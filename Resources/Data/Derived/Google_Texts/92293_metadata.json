Domino\u2019s Pizza claims it offers 34 million different pie combinations; Pizza Hut boasted last year it can make 2 billion different pizzas. While the FDA has suggested restaurants can institute calorie \u201cranges\u201d for each pizza, one Domino\u2019s franchise owner in Missouri guessed it would cost him $5,000 to build the boards -- though over 90 percent of Domino\u2019s business comes in over the phone or online, and so most customers never see the in-store board.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly fit all the iterations of pizza on a typical menu board like you can for burgers, for example,\u201d Lynn Liddle, executive vice president of communications for Domino\u2019s, said in testimony before Congress in June. According to this Domino's video, menu boards are used in less than 1.5 percent of their total orders each day. She told FoxNews.com Thursday that Domino's has been providing nutritional information voluntarily online for 10 years.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re doing is the right thing for our consumers and for the small business owners, so they do not have to pay for a big static menu board that won't help the consumer anyway,\u201d said Liddle, who also represents the American Pizza Community -- a consortium including Pizza Hut, Little Caesars and Papa John\u2019s now lobbying to relax the rules under proposed legislation.\n\nThe Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015 was introduced in April by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., who has called the new rules \u201can overreach.\u201d The bill, currently awaiting action in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, would allow stores that mostly deliver to provide calorie information online and through mobile apps instead.\n\n\u201cThis is commonsense legislation that provides access to caloric information in a practical and flexible manner by clarifying, not significantly altering, this complicated regulation,\u201d said Rodgers in June.\n\nShe said the FDA regulations on restaurant labeling were 400 pages long and overly complicated, putting an unfair burden on pizza franchises. \u201cRequiring Domino\u2019s franchisees to post in their stores every potential topping combination \u2013 more than 34 million possible outcomes \u2013 when more than 90 percent of their orders take place over the phone or Internet \u2013 just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the FDA\u2019s website, the proposed rule, which will not only cover franchise restaurants but convenience stores, \u201cwill fill a critical information gap and help consumers make informed and healthful dietary choices.\u201d The deadline for compliance was extended to Dec. 1, 2016. Further, \u201cthe FDA will work flexibly and collaboratively with individual companies making a good faith effort to comply with the law.\u201d\n\nNot everyone sees the need to deliver aid to the pizza franchises. Karen Raskopf, chief communications officer at Dunkin\u2019 Brands, which oversees Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Baskin-Robbins franchises, says the uniform labeling provisions are fair and no one should be exempt. Their stores already are instituting the labeling to meet the old December 2015 deadline, she said in June. Their natural competitors would be convenience stores that sell breakfast and lunch items.\n\n\u201cCongress decided that restaurant type foods should bear calorie labeling, regardless of where they are sold. In the interest of creating a level playing field for these types of foods, we emphatically agree.\u201d\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill.., said at the time she did not understand why pizza companies did not want to comply with the rules as written, given the importance for public health. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand the problem here,\u201d she said during the hearing. \u201cThese arguments are just silly to me.\u201d\n\nFoxNews.com's Kelley Vlahos contributed to this report.", "article_metadata":
