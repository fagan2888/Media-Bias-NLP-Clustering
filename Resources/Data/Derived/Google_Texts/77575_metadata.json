She interviewed several couples for the project, all of whom had at least one child under the age of 14. And Lyonette found there is \u201ca stark difference in couples\u2019 attitudes toward gender equality depending on how much they are earning.\u201d\n\nMen on lower incomes were happier to fill the dishwasher, whereas wealthier men were more interested in hiring a cleaning service. Despite the increased help of un-wealthy men, women, on the whole, are still doing the most, Lyonette said. This is due in part to the \u201cmyth of male incompetence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a belief by some women \u2014 and our study shows it's still rife \u2014 that men are unable to complete housework to an acceptable standard,\u201d Lyonette said in a press release. \"Women know their contribution to the household should be fairly reflected in the sharing of housework and are often frustrated by their lack of success in changing the situation. But their frustrations are to some extent mollified by the idea that men are inept at domestic chores.\"\n\nIn fact, one woman Lyonette interviewed accused her partner of doing housework poorly on purpose. Her partner would clean around certain areas, not under, and say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t clean upstairs now because no one goes up there except for us.\u201d It\u2019s this kind of disconnect Lyonette believes is likely to stall gender equality.\n\nWe wonder if wealthy men know separate research have shown relationships actually thrive when the work is split evenly. A 2013 study found the mental wellbeing, plus heart-health, of partnered adults over the age of 60 improved when they gardened together. What's more is The Washington Post cited research suggesting couples who split housework have a better sex life. Specifically, couples who shared routine housework had sex more than seven times a month. The Post added sex and housework are huge indicators of a relationship's stability.\n\nBut like Lyonette, The Post found only 30 percent of married couples were in these equal, sexy relationships in comparison to 47 percent of cohabiting couples \u2014 a sign \"our institutions and our policies haven't caught up with our attitudes. This is why we're still stalled.\"\n\nSource: Lyonette, C. Sharing the load? Partners\u2019 relative earnings and the division of domestic labour.
