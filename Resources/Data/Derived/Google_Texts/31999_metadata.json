In fact, a promotional brochure from the Iowa Economic Development Authority lists some of the benefits enjoyed by insurance companies based in Iowa:\n\n\u2022In recent years, Iowa lowered its insurance premium tax by half, to just 1 percent \u2014 which makes it one of the lowest rates in the nation.\n\n\u2022Iowa does not charge premium taxes on the sale of annuities or qualified life insurance plans.\n\n\u2022Iowa does not assess any additional surtaxes or income taxes on insurance carriers.\n\n\u2022Iowa offers \u201ca favorable business climate with direct financial assistance, tax advantages and supportive regulatory services\u201d for insurers.\n\nBut there are other specific benefits that the state\u2019s promotional brochures don\u2019t highlight.\n\nAs the New York Times reported recently, Iowa is one of several states that have passed laws allowing life insurance companies to pull cash out of the reserves they\u2019re required to keep on hand to pay claims. They can then use that money for bonuses, shareholder dividends, acquisitions and other projects. And because of a loophole in the federal tax law, that money is not being taxed by the federal government.\n\nTransamerica Life Insurance Co. of Cedar Rapids used the Iowa law last year to pull $1.8 billion from its reserves. In the process, the company avoided paying an estimated $640 million in federal taxes.\n\nThat\u2019s $640 million in lost tax revenue from just one company.\n\nTo put that in perspective, $640 million would have been more than enough to pay for the entire Land and Water Conservation Program aimed at expanding and protecting national parks \u2013 a program that was gutted earlier this year due to a lack of funding.\n\nIn other words, this sort of tax avoidance has real-world consequences for those of us who still view our taxes not as \u201cconfiscated wealth,\u201d which is the label preferred by some conservatives, but as the dues we pay for the privilege of living in the United States. When corporations don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes, that results in fewer services and higher taxes for the rest of us.\n\nThe so-called \u201cshadow insurance\u201d ploy works like this: State insurance regulators require companies to maintain reserves that will enable them to quickly pay all claims. Under federal law, any reductions in these reserves are treated as taxable income. But some states, like Iowa, allow insurers to dramatically lower their reserves through a complex series of transfers that free up money for other purposes. And yet, for federal tax purposes, these types of reductions in reserves are invisible. That saves the companies tens \u2014 in some cases, hundreds \u2014 of millions of dollars in taxes they\u2019d otherwise be paying.\n\nTo make matters worse, these same companies can claim a tax deduction on \u201creserves\u201d that don\u2019t even exist, except on paper.\n\nIs it any wonder that Symetra Life Insurance Co. trumpeted Iowa\u2019s \u201cstate-of-the-art statutes and regulations\u201d as one of the reasons it decided in January to change its legal domicile from Washington to Iowa? The switch is expected to result in the opening of one small office in Des Moines with 20 to 40 employees, but the company\u2019s headquarters will remain in Bellevue, Wash.\n\nBenjamin M. Lawsky, the financial services superintendent of New York, has tried to impose a moratorium on these types of transactions. He is also calling for action by the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department.\n\nBut the sad reality is that nothing is likely to change, even though it\u2019s estimated that this \u201cshadow insurance\u201d scheme has enabled life insurers to avoided paying an astounding $100 billion in federal taxes in recent years.\n\nThat\u2019s because insurance regulation is left to the states, which means insurance companies can pit states against each other to determine which of them will provide the most incentives for relocation while offering the most \u201cindustry-friendly\u201d approach to regulation. That\u2019s a game Iowa loves to play, even when it means giving away the store.\n\nTransamerica points out that it\u2019s not doing anything illegal. Taking advantage of massive, and perhaps unintended, tax breaks aren\u2019t exactly the hallmark of good corporate citizenship, but corporations do have a fiduciary responsibility. In that respect, they should avail themselves of whatever incentives our elected leaders have seen fit to provide.\n\nThe problem is that politicians will always be eager to offer up incentives like these because \u201cjob creation\u201d plays well on the campaign trail. Few voters will ever ask about the public assets \u2013 tax revenue, grants, land, buildings, public improvements, etc. \u2013 that were quite literally given away to secure those jobs.\n\nSo, yes, the Orascom fertilizer plant in southeast Iowa will create 240 jobs in Iowa. But the state, local and federal governments ponied up more than $1 million for each of those jobs, and the deal was negotiated in secret. Good public policy? Maybe not, but it\u2019s definitely good politics.\n\nIowa\u2019s governor and state legislators talk a lot about economic development and job creation in Iowa \u2014 as they should. But it\u2019s high time they started being open and honest with the public about the real cost of those jobs.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1BbJb8g", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "What\u2019s the real cost of such incentives?
