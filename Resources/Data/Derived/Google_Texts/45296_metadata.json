He also wants to reform regulations that hinder business growth and focus on workforce development.\n\n\u201cThese are straightforward solutions to obvious problems,\u201d Ellenson said in the email, emphasizing a nonpartisan approach to local issues. \u201cI\u2019m just doing what makes sense, and I don\u2019t care what side of the aisle that comes from.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUrias, a former staffer for U.S. Rep. Judy Chu and then-Congresswoman Hilda Solis, said he wants to work on making higher education affordable and ensure that the San Gabriel Valley continues to get its fair share of resources for transportation and water infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten better but I think it could get a lot better,\u201d said Urias, who currently lives in Duarte. \u201cWe don\u2019t get nearly as close to 100 percent we pay in taxes back to the San Gabriel Valley.\u201d\n\nLozano, the only candidate who has run for state office before, said he decided to run as an alternative to Urias and Rubio, who have raised more than $400,000 and $245,000, respectively, according to campaign finance records. Urias has been endorsed by several top Democrats in Congress as well as many state legislators. Rubio has also received endorsements from state officials and the legislature\u2019s Latino and Democratic women\u2019s caucuses.\n\n\u201cThey are simply going to be status quo,\u201d said Lozano, Baldwin Park\u2019s mayor since 1999. \u201cI\u2019m seeking the endorsement of the residents of the 48th district versus Sacramento.\u201d\n\nHe and Barajas, a newcomer to politics, have not raised any money leading up to the primary election. Lozano said he was relying on social media this time around, while Barajas has opted to spend a few thousand dollars of his own money on his campaign.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t make it past the primary I don\u2019t want to be wasting people\u2019s money,\u201d said Barajas, a 30-year-old U.S. Army veteran from La Puente. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s an investment.\u201d\n\nBarajas, who was only elected to the Bassett Unified school board in November, described himself as an outsider whose main priorities are the economy, education and veterans.\n\nHe wants to bring more services to veterans in the San Gabriel Valley and invest more in early childhood education.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d Barajas said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that money makes the world go round.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An army veteran, a longtime mayor and a teacher are among the five candidates seeking to represent the 48th Assembly District in California\u2019s primary election next month.Running to succeed Assemblyman Roger Hernandez are four Democrats &", "title": "Four Democrats, one Republican seek San Gabriel Valley\u2019s 48th Assembly District seat in June primary", "og": {"url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20160515/four-democrats-one-republican-seek-san-gabriel-valleys-48th-assembly-district-seat-in-june-primary", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Four Democrats, one Republican seek San Gabriel Valley\u2019s 48th Assembly District seat in June primary"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "An army veteran, a longtime mayor and a teacher are among the five candidates seeking to represent the 48th Assembly District in California\u2019s primary election next month.Running to succeed Assemblyman Roger Hernandez are four Democrats &", "title": "Four Democrats, one Republican seek San Gabriel Valley\u2019s 48th Assembly District seat in June primary", "url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20160515/four-democrats-one-republican-seek-san-gabriel-valleys-48th-assembly-district-seat-in-june-primary", "image": {"src": "http://local.sgvtribune.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sgvtribune.png?052016"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Assembly District 48,California primary 2016,campaign finance,daily,elections,Roger Hernandez, Local elections", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Assembly District 48,California primary 2016,campaign finance,daily,elections,Roger Hernandez, Local elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce96\"", "article_summary": "Running to succeed Assemblyman Roger Hernandez are four Democrats \u2014 Bassett Unified School District Board member Armando Barajas, Baldwin Park Mayor Manuel Lozano, Baldwin Park Unified School District Board member Blanca Rubio and Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District Board member Bryan Urias \u2014 and Republican Cory Ellenson, a self-employed tax attorney and Glendora Unified School District board member.\n\u201cI would not get another opportunity for a number of years,\u201d said Rubio, a fourth-grade teacher in the Fontana Unified School District.\nAn army veteran, a longtime mayor and a teacher are among the five candidates seeking to represent the 48th Assembly District in California\u2019s primary election next month.\nAnd in a majority-Democrat district, Rubio, 46, saw this year\u2019s election as her best shot at getting elected.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s an investment.\u201dBarajas, who was only elected to the Bassett Unified school board in November, described himself as an outsider whose main priorities are the economy, education and veterans."}
