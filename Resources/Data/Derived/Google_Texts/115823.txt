WASHINGTON — He told some whoppers at the White House, but now President Obama’s former press secretary Robert Gibbs will be slinging spin for McDonald’s.

The global fast food chain announced Tuesday that Gibbs’ title would be global head of communications.

Gibbs was at Obama’s side during his 2008 presidential campaign, then helmed the White House podium during calorie-burning battles over an economic stimulus package and ObamaCare.

Gibbs may get the chance to celebrate his new undisclosed salary with a mojito. The company also hired Silvia Lagnado away from Bacardi Ltd. as executive vice president and global chief marketing officer.

“Robert and Silvia are both highly respected, talented leaders who will bring a wealth of experience and outside perspective to McDonald’s as we build a more modern, progressive burger company,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement.

At the top of Gibbs’ list will be guiding the chain’s PR response to increased competition amid saturation of the market.

He’s already facing one communications headache that could be even worse than the ObamaCare rollout: the company’s decision to bring back the Hamburglar to TV with a redesign that makes him look like a skinny guy in a trench coat.

Gibbs has been running the Incite Agency, a communications firm.
