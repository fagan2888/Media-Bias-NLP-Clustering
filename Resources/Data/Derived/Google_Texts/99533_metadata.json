The book apparently came to the host as a recommendation from National Book Award winner Sherman Alexie, who was a guest on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d last night and whose books, along with Colbert\u2019s, are published by Hachette. And Colbert was sufficiently enraged by Amazon\u2019s strong-arming that he decided to take his own stance against the retail giant, cherry-picking one novel to vault into the cultural limelight.\n\nReached for comment, Lepucki said simply: \u201cToday was nutty.\u201d But Colbert\u2019s intervention on this book\u2019s behalf seems pretty clearly to have worked. Powell\u2019s reports that the post-apocalyptic novel is now its bestselling book in terms of pre-sales. There is no way to order \u201cCalifornia\u201d from Amazon, though the glowing reviews of the novel remain on the site. By all accounts, it\u2019s a worthwhile read in need of a little attention, and that attention seems to have come in a big way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The host's anti-Amazon stunt proves that he has become one of our top literary tastemakers", "author": "Neil Drumming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The host's anti-Amazon stunt proves that he has become one of our top literary tastemakers", "title": "Stephen Colbert is the next Oprah", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/05/stephen_colbert_is_the_next_oprah/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bezos_colbert.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The host's anti-Amazon stunt proves that he has become one of our top literary tastemakers", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bezos_colbert.jpg", "title": "Stephen Colbert is the next Oprah", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Stephen Colbert is the next Oprah", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Gillian Flynn, sherman alexie, Stephen Colbert, The Colbert Report, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd161f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Gillian Flynn, sherman alexie, Stephen Colbert, The Colbert Report, TV, Media News, Entertainment NewsLast night, Stephen Colbert, describing \u201cthe game\u201d that Amazon is playing with publisher Hachette, announced that he had made arrangements with Portland independent bookseller Powell\u2019s Books to sell copies of writer Edan Lepucki\u2019s debut novel \u201cCalifornia\u201d on his own website.\nThe book apparently came to the host as a recommendation from National Book Award winner Sherman Alexie, who was a guest on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d last night and whose books, along with Colbert\u2019s, are published by Hachette.\nAnd Colbert was sufficiently enraged by Amazon\u2019s strong-arming that he decided to take his own stance against the retail giant, cherry-picking one novel to vault into the cultural limelight.\nThere is no way to order \u201cCalifornia\u201d from Amazon, though the glowing reviews of the novel remain on the site.\nPowell\u2019s reports that the post-apocalyptic novel is now its bestselling book in terms of pre-sales."}
