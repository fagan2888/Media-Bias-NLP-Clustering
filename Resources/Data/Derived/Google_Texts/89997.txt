Texas ranks among the top 10 states to live with the lowest amount of local, state and federal tax on personal dividend income, according to information released today by the Tax Foundation, a a nonpartisan research group in based in Washington, D.C.

The absence of personal income tax mean Texas residents face a top marginal tax rate on personal dividend income of 25 percent, ranking the state No. 44. It tied with six other states — Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming — with the same tax picture, according to the foundation.

California has the highest combined tax rate of 33 percent — the sixth highest in the industrialized world. Hawaii (31.6 percent) is second and New York (31.5 percent) is third.

Two states don’t tax personal income, but do tax on dividend income: a 6 percent tax in Tennessee and a 5 percent tax in New Hampshire.

The U.S. average total tax on personal dividend income is 28.6 percent — the 9th highest among 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and 5 percent higher than the group average, according to the foundation.

The top federal rate on personal dividend income is 23.8 percent (20 percent top marginal tax rate plus a 3.8 percent net investment tax to fund the Affordable Care Act). State personal dividend taxes range from zero to a high of 13.3 percent in California.

Note: The Tax Foundation’s map (above) takes into account the deductibility of a person’s state taxes against federal taxes, local income taxes, the phase-out of itemized deductions, and any special treatment of personal dividend income. Most states tax personal dividend income as ordinary income, so states with high income tax rates have the highest taxes on personal dividends.
