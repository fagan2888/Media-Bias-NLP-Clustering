But by 6 p.m. on Sunday evening, dread and anxiety settle in, as the realization emerges that the weekend is over and the workweek starts in a matter of hours. This feeling, termed the \"Sunday Night Blues,\" is suffered by the majority of respondents in a survey conducted by Monster.com.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is happy to see their weekend come to a close\u201d said Mary Ellen Slayter, career advice expert for Monster.com. \u201cMonday mornings are notoriously stressful. Catching up on emails, planning the upcoming week, tackling new assignments \u2014 all while thinking, \u2018I have another five solid days of work before my next day off.\u2019 It\u2019s understandably daunting.\u201d\n\nThe web survey asked visitors, \u201cAre your \u2018Sunday Night Blues\u2019 bad enough to make you want a new job?\u201d Over 3,600 people responded worldwide, with 47 percent claiming that their \u201cSunday Night Blues\u201d were \u201creally bad.\u201d Another 18 percent and 13 percent said that their blues were \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cslightly bad,\u201d while 22 percent said they didn\u2019t feel the blues at all.\n\nFeeling blue was most prevalent among respondents from the U.S., where 59 percent of respondents said they dreaded going back to work. Only 19 percent of respondents said they were happy on Sunday nights.\n\nA 2012 Gallup Poll found that employees who were \u201cactively disengaged\u201d from their jobs were less happy as their weekends came to a close, with larger numbers becoming unhappy until about Wednesday. The proportion of happy employees did not rise again until Friday night. On the other hand, happiness for those who felt \u201cengaged\u201d at their jobs remained stable throughout the week \u2014 showing that job happiness is essential to a smoother transition from weekend to workweek.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no easy solution to eliminatng the blues, Slayter advises those who find Sunday nights difficult to take \u201caction on Friday afternoons. Don\u2019t run for the door the moment your clock strikes five. Instead, spend a few minutes preparing for next week: review and prioritize your calendar, assemble materials you expect to be using, and tie up every loose end you can.\u201d\n\nShe also says that pausing a project in order to leave work faster could prove to be more of a hindrance once Monday comes back around. \u201cOften it\u2019s wise to simply finish a task you\u2019re already immersed in, rather than attempting to pick up the pieces and resume progress after two days off.\u201d For those who can\u2019t seem to improve their Sunday nights, \u201cit might be time to consider bigger changes in your professional life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sunday night blues, monday, weekend, job, satisfaction, monster, anxiety, monday blues", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The ideal weekend is a relaxing time to get your mind of work, but a new poll from Monster.com shows people may be too worries about the upcoming workweek to enjoy their days off.", "title": "Case Of The Mondays? 59% Of Americans Dread Work Even Earlier With 'Sunday Night Blues'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/case-mondays-59-americans-dread-work-even-earlier-sunday-night-blues-259747", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/sunday-night-blues.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ideal weekend is a relaxing time to get your mind of work, but a new poll from Monster.com shows people may be too worries about the upcoming workweek to enjoy their days off.", "title": "Case Of The Mondays? 59% Of Americans Dread Work Even Earlier With 'Sunday Night Blues'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/case-mondays-59-americans-dread-work-even-earlier-sunday-night-blues-259747", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/sunday-night-blues.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/sunday-night-blues.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-10-13T15:21:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-13T15:21:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The ideal weekend is a relaxing time to get your mind of work, but a new poll from Monster.com shows people may be too worries about the upcoming workweek to enjoy their days off."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2971\"", "article_summary": "This feeling, termed the \"Sunday Night Blues,\" is suffered by the majority of respondents in a survey conducted by Monster.com.\nAlthough there\u2019s no easy solution to eliminatng the blues, Slayter advises those who find Sunday nights difficult to take \u201caction on Friday afternoons.\nFeeling blue was most prevalent among respondents from the U.S., where 59 percent of respondents said they dreaded going back to work.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is happy to see their weekend come to a close\u201d said Mary Ellen Slayter, career advice expert for Monster.com.\nFriday arrives with anticipation for the relaxation, decompression, and good times that the weekend will bring."}
