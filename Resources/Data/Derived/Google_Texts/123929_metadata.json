The agency reports a total of 15,351 confirmed cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain, United States, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nDespite the CDC's close watch on the outbreak and guidelines for U.S. hospitals to prepare for the virus to make its way to the country, healthcare organizations were not ready when the first case appeared in September. The first Ebola patient in the United States was misdiagnosed and failure to properly put safeguards in place led two nurses caring for him to contract the disease.\n\nThe White House administration has requested $6 billion for resources to be used in part for the CDC to work with an international coalition to prepare for and prevent the spread of Ebola and other infectious diseases. The agency plans to train rapid response teams to investigate cases, \"so they're better able to detect and respond to not only Ebola but other pathogens,\" Jordan Tappero, M.D., the CDC's director of global health protection told the news outlet. \"It's our intention to be there for the long-term to really build that public health capacity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Frieden said that although the slowdown in the disease in Liberia is encouraging, it's unclear whether it will continue, MedPageToday reports. \"The recent decrease in cases suggested by these reports shows how important it is to continue to intensify our Ebola response,\" he said. \"We have to keep our guard up... We can't stop until we stop the last chain of transmission.\"\n\nCloser to home, National Nurses United urged the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to implement strict safety requirements to shield healthcare workers from the virus similar to ones that California created in the wake of a two-day nurses strike and world-wide protest about the lack of healthcare safety protections in place.\n\nThe CDC last week released updated guidelines and best practices for U.S. hospitals to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff to wear when treating patients with the deadly virus due to the sudden increase in demand.\n\nBut California nurses continue to clash with hospitals over Ebola training, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reports. Some Bay Area hospitals focus on training select staff members with hands-on training but others only offer online training modules. Hospitals say it's not necessary to train every nurse and every unit, but nurses worry that they won't be properly trained to handle a potential case.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the AP report\n\n- here's the latest WHO statistics (.pdf)\n\n- check out the MedPage Today article\n\n- here's the latest CDC PPE guidelines\n\n- read the Santa Cruz Sentinel article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEbola outbreak worsens as scientists search for source of virus\n\nNurses union: OSHA must tighten Ebola protection requirements\n\nEbola watch: California adopts toughest regulations in US to protect hospital workers\n\nNurses to strike over lack of Ebola prep\n\nEbola: Researchers need access to virus samples for treatment, vaccines\n\nEbola Watch: Nurses plan protests over lack of preparedness in US hospitals\n\nUS hospitals unprepared for Ebola-related medical waste\n\n3 new federal guidelines to contain the Ebola virus\n\nNIH: Revised guidelines will help prevent Ebola spread in US\n\nObama appoints \"Ebola czar\"\n\nCDC outlines new Ebola protocol with rapid response teams\n\nProviders, officials double down on Ebola precautions\n\nEbola in the U.S.: Review office game plan for handling infectious disease\n\nNurses union: U.S. hospitals not prepared for Ebola patients\n\n3 reasons U.S. Ebola patients recover faster than those in West Africa\n\nDallas hospital defends treatment of Ebola patient\n\nEbola Watch: White House makes case for $6B in prep funds, resources", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bThe Ebola outbreak in Liberia is now showing signs of slowing down, but U.S. public officials aren't necessarily breathing a sigh of relief as they now must prepare for the next health disaster, the Associated Press\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "\u200bThe Ebola outbreak in Liberia is now showing signs of slowing down, but U.S. public officials aren't necessarily breathing a sigh of relief as they now must prepare for the next health disaster, the Associated Press\u00a0reports.", "title": "Ebola epidemic slows down, but public health officials prepare for new threat", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/ebola-epidemic-slows-down-public-health-officials-prepare-new-threat/2014-11-24", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),Ebola,Ebola virus,Infectious Disease,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4018\"", "article_summary": "The Ebola outbreak in Liberia is now showing signs of slowing down, but U.S. public officials aren't necessarily breathing a sigh of relief as they now must prepare for the next health disaster, the Associated Press reports.\nBut California nurses continue to clash with hospitals over Ebola training, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reports.\n\"Ebola is a powerful reminder that a health threat anywhere can affect us.\"\nSome Bay Area hospitals focus on training select staff members with hands-on training but others only offer online training modules.\nThe virus, the worst outbreak in history, has killed 5,459 people to date, according to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO)."}
