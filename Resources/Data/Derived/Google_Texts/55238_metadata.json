If so, they should check with their hospital first.\n\nThe top-ranked hospital cited by President Barack Obama as a national model for health care reform accepts only one kind of insurance plan under the new Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, a top 4-ranked U.S. hospital that performs 250 surgeries per day, only accepts Blue Cross Blue Shield silver plans under the new Obamacare exchanges. No other Obamacare exchange plans are accepted.\n\nPeople who want to sign up for insurance under the president\u2019s favorite law and also visit the president\u2019s favorite hospital might not even know that those two things could be incompatible.\n\n\u201cLook at what the Mayo Clinic is able to do. It\u2019s got the best quality and the lowest cost of just about any system in the country. So what we want to do is we want to help the whole country learn from what Mayo is doing\u2026 That will save everybody money,\u201d Obama said in Minneapolis in September 2009.\n\n\u201cMany companies have selectively entered the exchanges because they are concerned that (the exchanges) will be dominated by risky, high-using populations who wanted insurance [before Obamacare] and couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Gail Wilensky, member of UnitedHealth\u2019s board of directors late last year. \u201cThey are pressed to narrow their networks to stay within the premiums.\u201d\n\nThe Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, based on three campuses including Rochester, Minnesota, is internationally well-regarded.\n\nA useful chart released by Watchdog.org in late 2013 shows which top hospitals accept which kinds of plans. But you should still check with local hospitals near you.\n\nThe Daily Caller previously reported that the Top 4 U.S. hospital the Cleveland Clinic, which performed the nation\u2019s first near-total face transplant, is making more than $100 million in cuts as a direct result of Obamacare, offered voluntary early retirement to its employees and anticipates workforce reduction in fiscal year 2014.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "President Obama praised Mayo as a national model for health-care reform", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Are people actually signing up for Obamacare?
