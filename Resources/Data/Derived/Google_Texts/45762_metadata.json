The Iowa Republican is expected to use the meeting to explain why the Senate will not take up his nomination.\n\nMiller \u2014 as well as Keith Uhl, a former Grassley aide, and Mark Kende, a professor at Drake University Law School \u2014 argued Monday that the senator is ignoring the Constitution and undermining the Supreme Court by refusing to take up Garland, the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\n\"At stake here: an independent judiciary that is able to function, that is not politicized,\" Kende said.\n\nMonday's conference call \u2014 organized by the Constitutional Responsibility Project \u2014 is the latest attempt by Democrats and outside groups to get Grassley to change his position.\n\nUhl, who described himself as a registered Republican, suggested his comments don't amount to \"pressure tactics,\" saying \"Iowans are disturbed\" by Grassley's position.\n\n\"I find back here in Iowa that our citizens are tired, quite frankly, of both sides ... simply just trying to govern by the lowest common denominator,\" he said. \"My efforts are not to try to get Chuck Grassley defeated in the race for the United States Senate. I don't think that's going to happen.\"\n\nDemocrats have made Grassley the top target of a weeks-long campaign to get Republicans to cave. A hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee would be the first step to confirmation.\n\nBut top Republicans, including Grassley, have shown no signs of changing their position.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Iowa Republican will meet Obama's Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday.", "description": "The Iowa Republican will meet Obama's Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Iowa Republican will meet Obama's Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday.", "title": "Grassley targeted ahead of Garland meeting", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/275856-grassley-targeted-ahead-of-supreme-court-meeting", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/grassleychuck_030316gn2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-11T14:57:51-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-11T14:57-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/275856-grassley-targeted-ahead-of-supreme-court-meeting", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-11T14:19-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jordain Carney", "author": "Jordain Carney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Lisa Murkowski, Chuck Grassley, Susan Collins, Kelly Ayotte, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Rob Portman, Jeff Flake, Mark Kirk,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-11T14:19:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-11T14:57:51-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/275856-grassley-targeted-ahead-of-supreme-court-meeting", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Iowa Republican will meet Obama's Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Grassley targeted ahead of Garland meeting"}, "dcterms.title": "Grassley targeted ahead of Garland meeting"}, "article_summary": "The Iowa Republican is expected to use the meeting to explain why the Senate will not take up his nomination.\nIowa's top attorney is pressuring Sen.(R-Iowa) to take up the nomination of President Obama's choice for the Supreme Court ahead of a sit-down with Merrick Garland on Tuesday.\nA hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee would be the first step to confirmation.\nADVERTISEMENT Grassley will have breakfast with Garland Tuesday.\nBut top Republicans, including Grassley, have shown no signs of changing their position."}
