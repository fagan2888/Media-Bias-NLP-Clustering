Some presidential candidates attempt to "reach out" to non-traditional voters by appearing on late-night television. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is instead putting his own message out to those audiences without having to set foot on any entertainer's stage.

Saturday, his presidential campaign team released an ad that spoofs Democrats, the Obama Administration, and other Beltway conservative whipping posts, like the IRS targeting scandal. Titled "Cruz Christmas Classics," the 90-second spot aired during that evening's broadcast of Saturday Night Live on NBC affiliates in Iowa.

The ad shows Cruz sitting on a sofa, reading an assortment of fictional "Christmas stories" to his daughters. These "Christmas Classics" include:

• A Wonderful Life: A Very Merry Economy

• Rudolph the Underemployed Reindeer—"All of the other Reindeer couldn't afford to hire Rudolph."

• How ObamaCare Stole Christmas

• The Grinch Who Lost Her Emails—a dig at Hillary Clinton: "I know just what I'll do", she said with a snicker. "I'll use my own server, and no one will be the wiser!"

• Miracle on K Street

• Frosty the Speaker of the House—a dig at former Speaker of the House John Boehner that depicts a very tanned "Frosty" as a drinker and a smoker—"Look! The Speaker is melting before Congress!"

• Night of the Sugar Plum Cronies

• Auditing St. Nick—a reference to former IRS official Lois Lerner—"I will audit him here or there, I will audit him anywhere!"

• The Senator Who Saved Christmas

"Imagine the greatest Christmas stories ... told by the Senator who once read 'Green Eggs and Ham' from the Senate Floor," the narrator states, later adding. "If you are not completely satisfied with this collection of Cruz Christmas Classics you probably hate Christmas and America."
