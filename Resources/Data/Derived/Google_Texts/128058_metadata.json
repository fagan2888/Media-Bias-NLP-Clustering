Sitting and just reflecting on what these guys have committed to, really from that (New Mexico) bowl game on, when they came back from spring break and when they came back to Ram U (conditioning), I think they\u2019ve really turned into a football team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the most talented outfit out there, but the guys are playing together, they\u2019re playing with energy and for the most part, they do their job. I can\u2019t tell you how proud I am of them. I\u2019m proud for the state of Colorado and I\u2019m proud for the Ram fans that support these guys, because they\u2019re doing something special.\u201d\n\nSaid Grayson: \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve never been here. My senior class has never been here. For the freshmen coming in this year, this is something hopefully they can get used to. I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be for many years to come.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado State Rams vs. Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, Nov. 8, 2014\n\nIn the rout of Hawaii, a 52-yarder to Lovett in the second quarter was Grayson\u2019s 24th scoring pass of the season, bettering his total in 2013 and the CSU record he had shared with Justin Holland, who threw for 23 TDs in 2005. By the time he and the other starters left the game early in the fourth quarter, the senior from the Vancouver, Wash., area had nudged the record up to 26 with two regular-season games remaining.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t ever a time where I was, \u2018Dang, I wish I had Rashard,\u2019 or anything like that,\u201d said Grayson. \u201cIt was really, go out there and play catch and let those guys make plays. I\u2019ve seen it all year and now you guys see what we can do without him. I don\u2019t want to take anything away from him, because he\u2019s a great player, but as long as I can get those guys the ball and let them make plays, I think they can do it.\u201d\n\nDee Hart rushed for 115 yards and one TD on 11 carries for the Rams, and Treyous Jarrells pitched in with 69 yards and two scores.\n\nLeading 42-15 just past the midway point of the third quarter, the Rams turned their attention to attempting to avoid the sort of late-game letdowns that made several of their previous wins turn into nail-biters \u2014 or at least deceptively close \u2014 at the finishes. And at least away from the sideline, scoreboard watching continued as fans and others followed the progress of the simultaneous and wild Boise State-New Mexico game in Albuquerque.\n\nBoise State ended up pulling out a 60-49 win over the Lobos. While CSU has a half-game lead over the Broncos and Utah State, Boise State owns the tiebreaker over CSU; CSU owns the tiebreaker over Utah State. A three-way tie with one loss isn\u2019t possible because Boise State faces Utah State on Nov. 29.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nGame balls\n\nGarrett Grayson, QB, CSU \u2014 With four TD passes, he surpassed the school single-season record he had shared with Justin Holland since 2013.\n\nDee Hart, RB, CSU \u2014 Rushed for 115 yards on 11 carries.\n\nCharles Lovett, WR, CSU \u2014 Had four catches for 134 yards, including 71- and 52-yarders.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams make it eight straight with blowout win over Hawaii", "title": "CSU Rams make it eight straight with blowout win over Hawaii", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/08/csu-rams-make-it-eight-straight-with-blowout-win-over-hawaii/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141108__csu-lovettp1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141108__csu-lovettp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-08T20:38:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:47:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "While CSU has a half-game lead over the Broncos and Utah State, Boise State owns the tiebreaker over CSU; CSU owns the tiebreaker over Utah State.\nA three-way tie with one loss isn\u2019t possible because Boise State faces Utah State on Nov. 29.\nCharles Lovett, WR, CSU \u2014 Had four catches for 134 yards, including 71- and 52-yarders.\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFreiGame ballsGarrett Grayson, QB, CSU \u2014 With four TD passes, he surpassed the school single-season record he had shared with Justin Holland since 2013.\nDee Hart, RB, CSU \u2014 Rushed for 115 yards on 11 carries."}
