This California-based financial services adviser is to romantic notions \u2014 like home ownership and dating \u2014 what sunshine is to fog.\n\nHis outlook may be just what America needs.\n\n\u201cI was sold an American dream,\u201d said Bet-David, who immigrated with his family from Iran in 1990. \u201cWhat I saw as an immigrant was a place we could have freedom of religion, and run a business in a free market, with free enterprise.\u201d\n\nAnd today, at 34, Bet-David owns the PHP Agency, a financial services firm he founded four years ago that has 30 employees and 200 full-time independent contractors nationwide. Bet-David does very well.\n\nHe also rents his home.\n\n\u201cMy employees come over and wonder, \u2018Why does our CEO rent his house?\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nBecause he\u2019s following his own financial rules, that\u2019s why. One of those rules: Just because you have the money doesn\u2019t mean you should buy a house.\n\nHis wife of nearly five years knew early in their courtship that owning a home was not going to be part of the plan for a long time. That discovery occurred shortly after their second date.\n\nThey went to church, then to breakfast, then to a bookstore where he bought her a book: \u201c101 Questions to Ask Before You Get Engaged.\u201d\n\nTalk about cutting to the chase. \u201cI figured, I liked her, she liked me, so let\u2019s flush out any problems before some deal-breaker comes up a year from now.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m telling you, this guy is practical in the extreme. \u201cAfter that, I knew I would marry her.\u201d\n\nHis no-nonsense approach to courtship applies to home buying, too: Logic first, emotion second.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with thousands of families struggling to make house payments, which leads to arguments, all because they bought a house prematurely, and spent too much,\u201d said Bet-David.\n\nI thought I\u2019d call Bet-David for a reality check because lately, I\u2019ve been hankering to buy a home again. As a live-in home stager, I am not currently living in a home I own \u2014 a lifestyle that breaks with more than two decades of personal history.\n\nHowever, I do own a home in another state, which I rent out, making me both landlord and tenant \u2014 as well as crazy.\n\n\u201cWhile I like having the flexibility of not being tied to a house,\u201d I tell Bet-David, \u201cbeing a tenant just isn\u2019t the same as owning. I want to paint my way, add built-ins and moldings, put up window treatments, plant a garden, have a dog, get to know the neighbors, nest.\u201d He\u2019s heard it all before.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing \u2014 owning a home you rent out and renting where you live \u2014 is perfect right now,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou get the benefits of a rising market, but can be nimble.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect?\u201d I\u2019m not sure I heard right. That would be the first time anyone has ever used that word to describe my investment strategy.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing has a lot to do with the phase of life you\u2019re in. Your kids are taking off. Your career is blooming. You\u2019re charting a new course.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I planned it this way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve built houses from the ground up. You\u2019ve bought and sold. Been landlord and tenant. You know about the different phases and stages of life and houses. I want to teach other people to do what you\u2019ve done,\u201d he says.\n\nI can\u2019t even talk for laughing.\n\n\u201cI work with a lot of millennials just getting started. They think buying a house is the next thing to do. But they saw what happened to their parents,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPlease tell me they learned something from the spend, extend, pretend era,\u201d I beg.\n\n\u201cMy message isn\u2019t \u2018don\u2019t buy a home,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cMy message is, the American dream is not home ownership. The American dream is freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want both,\u201d I said.\n\nBet-David is about to have both. In four months, he and his wife, and their two sons, ages 20 months and three weeks, are moving from their rental home in Woodland Hills, Calif., to a house they\u2019re buying in Dallas. (He chose Texas partly because it has no state income tax, so it\u2019s friendlier to business.)\n\nBut he still followed his own home-buying rules.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press). Contact her through marnijameson.com.\n\nSmart home buying\n\nFinancial services adviser Patrick Bet-David\u2019s five rules:\n\n1. Don\u2019t buy unless you have more than 12 months of house payments saved. He helped me with the math: Say, you buy a house for $350,000 and put 10 percent down. Depending on your loan, you will probably have a $315,000 mortgage, which will cost about $1,800 a month or $22,000 a year in mortgage payments. Add $3,000 for property taxes, and more for insurance and association fees, so you should have $25,000 to $30,000 in the bank after closing.\n\n2. Don\u2019t buy if you\u2019re not going to live in the area for 10 years. Do your due diligence. (Bet-David has been considering the Dallas area for two years.) Consider your work, the community, nearby family, schools and neighborhood.\n\n3. Don\u2019t buy if you\u2019re a newlywed. \u201cWait two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition to being a couple, you are business partners. It could take a while for you to learn how your partner manages finances. If one is spending out of control, you don\u2019t want to take on a mortgage. First learn how disciplined (the other is.)\u201d\n\n4. Don\u2019t buy too much house. Whatever price home you can afford, force yourself to go 10 to 20 percent cheaper. Brokers might try to persuade you to buy as much house as you can qualify for. Resist.\n\n5. Don\u2019t buy a house to keep up with your friends. Even if you and your friends have the same household income, and they buy a house for a certain amount, you don\u2019t know whether their parents helped with the down payment; you don\u2019t know what their debt is or whether they\u2019re going to be overextended, he said. Deal with the cards you were dealt. Buy within your means, not someone else\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Home buying: Go with cold, clear logic (and rent)", "title": "Home buying: Go with cold, clear logic (and rent)", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/18/home-buying-go-with-cold-clear-logic-and-rent/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131018__20131019_C3_FE19AHMARNIp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131018__20131019_C3_FE19AHMARNIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-19T00:48:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:41:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe16\"", "article_summary": "Don\u2019t buy unless you have more than 12 months of house payments saved.\nDon\u2019t buy if you\u2019re not going to live in the area for 10 years.\nDon\u2019t buy a house to keep up with your friends.\nDon\u2019t buy too much house.\n\u201cMy employees come over and wonder, \u2018Why does our CEO rent his house?\u2019 \u201d he says."}
