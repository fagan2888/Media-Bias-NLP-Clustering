She\u2019s a shoe-in for her party\u2019s presidential nomination because of President Obama\u2019s failures.\n\nBut those failures might keep her from getting the job. Her husband\u2019s \u201claw of politics\u201d is that elections are always about the future, but she\u2019s stuck in the past.\n\nIn 2008, Obama pandered to liberal hopes while Clinton appealed to their good sense. Obama promised miracles and magic. Clinton promised more homework.\n\n\u201cCynicism\u201d was Obama\u2019s real opponent, he explained. And he used Clinton as a stand-in for it.\n\nShe played her part, pointing out that the Civil Rights Act got through Congress because of LBJ\u2019s hard work, not Martin Luther King\u2019s speeches. She insisted that politics was toil, not performance art.\n\nAnd, as we\u2019ve learned from a pres\u00adident who so often thinks giving a speech is a substitute for solving a problem, she had the better argument.\n\nOne need only look at the reaction from Democrats to President Obama\u2019s handling of the VA scandal to see that even they would trade some inspirational claptrap for a bit more old-fashioned competence.\n\nThat attitude helps Clinton immensely. Burned by disappointment, many liberals want to vote with their heads, not their hearts, this time around.\n\nAnd the Hillary Industrial Complex is ready to exploit that sentiment.\n\nThe HIC is the vast network of loyalists, retreads, activists, pols, hacks, fans (in and out of the press), Friends of Bill and Friends of Hillary who want to see a Clinton restoration. They\u2019re waiting for her to run like 19th century land speculators anticipating news that the railroad will go past their lots.\n\nWould you want to be left with 500,000 \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d bumper stickers in your garage? (It\u2019s a solid rule of business that you\u2019ve made a poor investment if a Hillary Duff comeback is your Plan B.)\n\nThe Hillary Industrial Complex must be an awesomely hard thing to say no to. It would feel like telling your royal entourage, after years of buildup, that you\u2019re going to decline the throne and live a quiet life in the country.\n\nThese remoras are counting on her, not just for jobs and access but for vindication; \u201cWe were right to back Hillary from the beginning!\u201d\n\nAlas, leaning on your entourage for advice is never a great idea. They may think Clinton would be a fresh start, but will normal voters not similarly invested in her?\n\nAmericans almost never reward a party with a third consecutive term in the White House, and when they do, it\u2019s because they want more of the same. Anyone want to wager on how much of a \u201cmore of the same\u201d mood America will be in come 2016?\n\nClinton\u2019s clearly not taking any chances. In her first campaign-style speech on the economy last week at the New America Foundation, Clinton mentioned Obama exactly once. (He\u2019s worked hard, she said.)\n\nShe referenced her husband a half-dozen times and talked at great length about how we need to return to the policies of the 1990s. (The Clintons remain convinced that the 1990s boom was a function of Bill\u2019s expert tweaking of the dials and knobs on the master control board of the economy.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even subtle.\n\nNo mention of the stimulus, cash-for-clunkers, ObamaCare or Dodd-Frank. As economics writer James Pethokoukis noted, \u201cIt was like Hillary was placed in suspended animation in 2008 and just recently revived to give a stump speech about the evils of the Bush tax cuts.\u201d\n\nNot only was there precious little talk of Obama, there was precious little talk of her four years on Obama\u2019s once-vaunted \u201cteam of rivals.\u201d\n\nShe listed none of her major accomplishments as secretary of state, probably because she had none. (She did open with a reference to some bureaucratic reshuffling on her watch.)\n\nNo serious student of foreign policy thinks our strategic standing in the world improved on Clinton\u2019s watch as America\u2019s chief diplomat. That alone doesn\u2019t mean she was a terrible secretary of state \u2014 lots of people in that job tread water. But it doesn\u2019t inspire either.\n\nMeanwhile, the most famous thing she did in that job was nothing \u2014 on the night of the Benghazi attack. She also traveled a lot, which is nice.\n\nYou can understand why Clinton might want to pretend that the Obama years never happened. I certainly get why she wants to run on her husband\u2019s record rather than her own.\n\nBut I can\u2019t see how this is adds up to a compelling message outside the Hillary Industrial Complex, which may be stuck with a lot of bumper stickers.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton is in a pickle.
