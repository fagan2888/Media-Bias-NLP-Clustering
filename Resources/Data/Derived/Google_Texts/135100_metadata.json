Bush, Iraq, john danforth, Religion, Republican Party, News, Politics News\n\nJohn Danforth represented Missouri in the U.S. Senate from 1976 to 1995. An ordained Episcopal priest, he officiated Ronald Reagan\u2019s funeral. In 2000, Dick Cheney narrowly edged him out for the vice presidential spot on the Republican presidential ticket. Instead, Danforth went on to serve, briefly, as President Bush\u2019s ambassador to the U.N.\n\nNow 79 years old, Danforth isn\u2019t happy. And, for all his Republican chops, much of that animus is directed at the political right. In his new book, \u201cThe Relevance of Religion,\u201d Danforth criticizes a political climate that he sees as overly attached to grand social visions, and deaf to the basic demands of democracy. \u201cThe fundamental allegiance of Americans is to our structure of government, not to any particular ideology or policy,\u201d he writes.\n\nInstead, Danforth calls for a kind of ideological disarmament, driven by religious moderates. The basic suggestion here\u2014that religious people can help to make politics more mellow\u2014may sound strange in the era of Hobby Lobby showdowns and Rick Santorum.\n\nBut Danforth\u2019s goal is not to amplify the place of religious rhetoric in politics. Instead, it\u2019s to use religious language to insist that politics matters less than the ideologues insist\u2014and that to make a policy position non-negotiable is to turn it into an idol. \u201cPolitics,\u201d he writes, \u201cis not the battleground for universal truth.\u201d It\u2019s a process for negotiating compromises.\n\nOver the phone, Danforth spoke with Salon about Ferguson, Donald Trump and whether America still has a conservative political party.\n\nMost Americans would say that they want a friendlier, more positive political dialogue. But things just seem to be getting crazier. What\u2019s the disconnect between our desires here, and what we keep getting?\n\nWell, I think the big question is, \u201cWho is speaking to the politicians?\u201d The most outspoken voices are the so-called bases of the political parties, particularly of the Republican Party. And the message [politicians] are receiving from the base is: \u201cTake an absolute position. Don\u2019t compromise. Be absolutely pure in your position, and if you\u2019re not pure, we\u2019re going to run a primary opponent against you.\u201d\n\nWhere have the moderate voices gone?\n\nI think that the great work of America has always been to try to have a process, to try to have a way to hold together all those competing ideas and competing interests. Somehow that process isn\u2019t working now, because people on the edge of politics really don\u2019t want it to work. They want to stay in their absolute positions.\n\nDo you think religious arguments are feeding this divisiveness?\n\nReligion certainly has been divisive. Religion should be a binding, reconciling force in politics. It should make it possible for diverse people to live together in a respectful way.\n\nSome religious communities promote a universalistic vision. But others are pretty tribal.\n\nRobert Putnam and David E. Campbell, in \u201cAmerican Grace,\u201d say that belonging to a religious congregation, regardless of theology and denomination, creates social capital on a broader basis, and connects people to the community around themselves. So, I don\u2019t think that being connected to a congregation necessarily creates an adversarial relationship with the broader community.\n\nYou\u2019re an ordained Episcopal priest. The denomination has recently put its weight behind some Democratic policies. Do you ever feel separated from your own movement? What changes when a denomination aligns itself with a political party?\n\nI do think that religion compels us to be concerned about disadvantaged people and poor people. There are a variety of ideas on how to best accomplish that, right across the political spectrum. I think it is a mistake for people to say that the religious position on such-and-such piece of legislation is this or that.\n\nIf you say, \u201cI am speaking for my denomination, and my position is the moral position,\u201d does that mean that the opposite position is immoral? How are we supposed to have a meaningful discussion if I am on God\u2019s side and you are on the enemy of God\u2019s side? This shuts it off completely. Politics is not religion. Politics is simply politics. It is a method for working our differences. It is not the realm of the absolute.\n\nAren\u2019t there cases when legislation does do something immoral?\n\nIt is certainly possible. In the days of the Jim Crow, it was a reality.\n\nWe should be very wary about saying that somebody\u2019s position on legislation is anti-God. Politics is not saying, \u201cI believe,\u201d as a matter of faith. The way that politics works, when it works, is to engage people with a variety of opinions and competing interests, and hold them together.\n\nWhen you were in the Senate, how did your religious beliefs inform your politics?\n\nThere were a very few instances when I thought there was a close connection between my faith and my view of an issue. I was very interested in world hunger when I was in the Senate. I was opposed to the death penalty, and I thought that had religious implications. But it was not in my mind on a day-to-day basis: \u201cHere is a piece of legislation. What is God\u2019s will in relation to this piece of legislation?\u201d\n\nReligion affects politics in a different way than [offering] direction for positions on legislation. It creates a tone. Part of that tone is honoring the views of other people, even if we disagree with them, and not turning our own position into absolutes\u2014in religious terms, not turning them into idols.\n\nIn the book, you emphasize basic, practical changes in the Senate\u2019s culture\u2014like whether or not senators eat dinner with colleagues from the other party.\n\nI had one member of the Senate tell me [recently] that he or she couldn\u2019t think of more than five or six members of the Senate to invite over for dinner. This is a very, very big change over [the] 21 years [since I left the Senate]. My family lived in Washington. We got to know other senators socially. We got to know their children. We were in their homes\u2014Democrats and Republicans, equally.\n\nPart of me hears this and thinks, \u201cIn a system with billions of dollars, media empires, and lobbyists, something as simple as dinner is inconsequential.\u201d\n\nI think it is important because it\u2019s one thing that\u2019s practical, that could be done. But the problem is much more extensive than that. Politics is much less workable than it was. There is much greater pressure not to give on anything, to make absolute decisions, not to be working across party lines.\n\nSo what would a religious protest against this status quo look like?\n\nI don\u2019t think it takes thousands and thousands of people to pull this off. It would be possible for a relatively small number of people to be much more forceful in presenting an alternative point of view. For example, let\u2019s say that just a few people would make it their business in election terms to attend political meetings, go up to the candidates, and say, \u201cI just saw this commercial. It was run on your behalf. It said you approve this message, and it was a total vilification of your opponent. Tell me how that squares with your values.\u201d\n\nI think pushing against the state of campaigns could definitely be done by people.\n\nIn the book, you write that \u201csociety is not hopelessly unjust.\u201d There are plenty of critics right now who would disagree. When should people say that they want reconciliation, and when can they say, \u201cThe system is never going to serve me. I need to fight against that\u201d?\n\nReconciliation has to do with mutual respect and humility, and recognizing that politics is always going to be imperfect.\n\nThat was the key question for the people who wrote the Constitution. It wasn\u2019t how you were going to come out on a particular issue; in fact, they compromised on the most awful of issues, namely slavery. Their concern was what sort of system will hold us together. That is the thrust of the ministry of reconciliation. It should be the mission of both politics and religion, to try to hold together a diverse nation. But how we do we hold all that together? That is the ministry of the reconciliation. That is the purpose of our Constitution.\n\nNow, when you get to the specifics\u2014what do you think is just or unjust? How does that relate to specific legislation? How do you define justice? What is it? How does it work itself out on, let\u2019s say, healthcare or government spending or whatever else you want to address as a matter of public policy? You can have strong positions on those subjects, and you can advance them as powerfully as you can, but you can also do it within the structure of a system that allows us to state our positions and to be advocates and to press our points, but at the same time do it in a way where the system works.\n\nYou\u2019re from St. Louis. One of the messages of the Ferguson protests seemed to be that a lot of Americans don\u2019t feel like the system is working for them, or will ever work for them. What do you say to them?\n\nWell, I say, first of all, let\u2019s listen to you, let\u2019s find out\u2014there is a Ferguson Commission that was appointed by the governor to address just this. What is the path forward? How do we deal with this? They held multiple hearings. They came out with a report. Hopefully, some of that report\u2014some has already been put in place. So let\u2019s address this issue.\n\nWill a committee feel like enough response to people who are protesting?\n\nWell, I certainly would not advocate somehow destroying the system. I would not advocate a situation where all we do is shout down other people.\n\nI would say, okay, what\u2019s the problem? Well, one of the problems here is the situation in North St. Louis County. African-Americans believed that they were being used as ways of financing these tiny little communities. There were traffic fines, and there were just an awful lot of stops of [African-American drivers].\n\nWhat can we do about that? Well, there was legislation that was passed to try to address that problem. So, okay, let\u2019s figure out where we can effect change, but not undermine the whole system, thinking that will make things better, because it will not.\n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to this idea of a \u201cministry of reconciliation.\u201d But I\u2019m white and coming from a fairly comfortable background, and that shapes my perspective. How does reconciliation look different, coming from different social vantage points? Is that something you reckon with?\n\nPart of advocacy is to be as effective as you can be, and to be as strong as you can in advocating your position. But at the same time, it\u2019s within a political process. And the political process has a design to create the possibility of change, but to do so within a structure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon exclusive: The three-term GOP senator takes honest look at his party, conservatives, and religion in politics", "title": "Longtime GOP senator lets Donald Trump have it: \u201cThere\u2019s an audience for this self-proclaimed great man, and for the anger and hatefulness that he expresses\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon exclusive: The three-term GOP senator takes honest look at his party, conservatives, and religion in politics", "title": "Longtime GOP senator lets Donald Trump have it: \u201cThere\u2019s an audience for this self-proclaimed great man, and for the anger and hatefulness that he expresses\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/28/longtime_gop_senator_lets_donald_trump_have_it_theres_an_audience_for_this_self_proclaimed_great_man_and_for_the_anger_and_hatefulness_that_he_expresses/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/danforth_bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon exclusive: The three-term GOP senator takes honest look at his party, conservatives, and religion in politics", "title": "Longtime GOP senator lets Donald Trump have it: \u201cThere\u2019s an audience for this self-proclaimed great man, and for the anger and hatefulness that he expresses\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/danforth_bush.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Schulson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Books, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, George W.
