The second annual Support Local Law Enforcement parade gave onlookers and one child a special day.

The parade, which highlights local police officers and sheriff deputies, brought out hundreds of people.

"It kind of refills the gas tank of the officers and makes them realize that the majority of the public does support them," said Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsey.

"I'm sure it makes them feel good, at least they know someone cares about them," Jeff Scott said about how he thinks officers react to seeing so many people supporting them.

Leading the parade was a 4-year-old boy fighting a dangerous brain tumor.

Christopher "Junior" Hecox is undergoing chemo theraphy. He was also Chief of Wichita police for the day; that act was made possible by the Make-A-Wish foundation.

"It's a dream come true," said Chris Hecox, father of Junior Hecox.

The recruit class for the Wichita Police Department gave Hecox an electric toy car as a present after the parade. The toy car was altered to look like a Dodge Charger police car.

"Woah! I got a car," Hecox said when the present was revealed.

"He always has a smile on his face... you can tell it made him happy. He loves it," said Recruit Officer Jason Halloran of the Wichita Police Department recruit class.

In addition to the parade, over 100 bike helmets were given to children at the parade.

Officers say their goal is to cut down on head injuries children sustain while riding their bikes.
