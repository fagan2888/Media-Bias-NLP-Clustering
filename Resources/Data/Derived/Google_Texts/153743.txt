BlaBlaCar, a ridesharing app based in France, just raised $100 million in a round of investments from venture capitalists, cementing itself as a major player in Europe's sharing economy.

Here's how it works: When one of the 8 million registered users is making a long trip, they open up the app and look for someone that is heading in the same direction. Each passenger has to pay an average of $25, and the app suggests pricing so that the users don't bicker too much over the costs. The average trip arranged through BlaBlaCar is 200 miles long, but rides can be as long or short as necessary. It's like Uber for highway hitchhikers, with similar accountability mechanisms where passengers and drivers can rate each other.

French startups received $1.03 billion in venture investments in 2013, making BlaBlaCar's $100 million investment nearly a tenth of last year's total. The firm, founded in 2006, took off as gas prices rose and smartphones became more pervasive.
