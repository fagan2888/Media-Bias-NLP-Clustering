Van Tassel and David McClusky, attending the board meeting by phone. \u201cI put my time in and I\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of it.\u201d\n\nSandy was first appointed to the Idaho Commission of Pardons and Parole under then-Gov. Phil Batt, and remained on that board during Gov. Dirk Kempthorne\u2019s term. She was appointed to the Idaho Board of Correction in 2006, serving under Govs. Jim Risch and Butch Otter.\n\nSandy\u2019s fellow board members lauded her dedication, saying she brought valuable insight and institutional knowledge to the department during her tenure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done a marvelous job, and you\u2019ve been an inspiration to me,\u201d Van Tassel told Sandy. \u201cThe depth of knowledge I\u2019ve gotten from you is encyclopedic.\u201d\n\nWhile she was chairman of the Commission of Pardons and Parole, Sandy presided over parole hearing of Claude Dallas, a mountain man who was convicted of voluntarily manslaughter in the deaths of two Idaho conservation officers. Dallas later escaped from prison before he was recaptured in California.\n\nDuring her nine years leading the department, Sandy oversaw the first execution in Idaho in 17 years, when Paul Ezra Rhoades was put to death by lethal injection in 2011.\n\nShe also saw the department navigate deep budget cuts and staffing furloughs during the Great Recession and was responsible for turning a vacant warehouse that had once been part of a prison industry program into the state\u2019s largest drug rehabilitation facility at the Idaho Correctional Center.\n\nIdaho Department of Correction Director Kevin Kempf said the department planned to name the prison unit after Sandy.\n\nShe was a supporter of private prisons, expanding the number of Idaho inmates housed at the Idaho Corrections Center, which was then run by Corrections Corporation of America.\n\nDespite reports of excessive violence and understaffing at the facility, she first rebuffed suggestions that the state should operate the facility. But after it became clear that CCA was violating its $29 million annual contract with the state and falsifying staffing reports to make it seem as if thousands of hours\u2019 worth of unstaffed shifts were actually filled, Gov. Otter asked the board to have the department take over the prison.\n\nShe then voted in favor of the move and oversaw the transition of the state\u2019s largest prison from private to a publicly run facility.\n\nSandy said Otter has a new person in mind to take her place, and said that announcement would come soon.\n\n\u201cI have greatly appreciated Robin\u2019s hard work and dedication,\u201d Otter said in a prepared statement. \u201cEnsuring the public safety, while at the same time, safeguarding the taxpayer\u2019s best interest is hard work which Robin accomplished with great skill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robin Sandy, a longtime Idaho Board of Correction member and the first woman to serve as chairman, has retired after 18 years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/7/longtime-idaho-prisons-board-chairman-robin-sandy-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Robin Sandy, a longtime Idaho Board of Correction member and the first woman to serve as chairman, has retired after 18 years.", "title": "Longtime Idaho prisons board chairman Robin Sandy retires"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robin Sandy, a longtime Idaho Board of Correction member and the first woman to serve as chairman, has retired after 18 years.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Longtime Idaho prisons board chairman Robin Sandy retires"}, "Author": "REBECCA BOONE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb056\"", "article_summary": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Robin Sandy, a longtime Idaho Board of Correction member and the first woman to serve as chairman, has retired after 18 years.\nIdaho Department of Correction Director Kevin Kempf said the department planned to name the prison unit after Sandy.\nShe was appointed to the Idaho Board of Correction in 2006, serving under Govs.\nSandy said Otter has a new person in mind to take her place, and said that announcement would come soon.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time I relax and do some other things,\u201d Sandy told fellow board members J.R.
