No doubt \u201che loves\u201d these Muslims.\n\nIn the case of Azerbaijan, the savvy Trump appears to have shown no hesitation. The country has a reputation as an oppressive kleptocracy whose ruling family was described by a U.S. State Department official in a Wikileaks cable as the Caspian Sea\u2019s version of the Corleone family of \u201cGodfather\u201d infamy. However, as Trump knows well, when it comes to real estate, it is all about location. And Azerbaijan\u2019s critical geo-political location, and it\u2019s vast oil reserves, ensures that the U.S. and the rest of the West will ignore whatever that nation does that might get in the way of doing business. The predominately Shiite Muslim nation is also Israel\u2019s top oil supplier.\n\nTo the north, the country is bordered by Russia, to the south by Iran and to the west by its arch-nemesis, Armenia. Long simmering tensions between Armenia, a predominately Christian nation, and Azerbaijan, a secular Muslim country, broke out into a shooting war in the late 1980\u2019s that still flares up since a 1994 truce.\n\nFor Trump, in such a geo-political pivot point, finding the right partner was critical. Promotional material produced in 2014 predicted that his signature hotel would be 33 floors high and would provide the \u201chighest level of luxury and refinement\u201d in the heart of Baku, the nation\u2019s capital on the shores of the Caspian Sea. So Trump turned to the well connected, locally based Garant Holding. Garant is run by Anar Mammadov, whose father, Ziya Mammadov, is the national government\u2019s Transport Minister and top advisor to the nation\u2019s leader, Ilham Aliyev, who took over ruling this former Soviet republic from his father in 2003.\n\n(Ilham\u2019s father Heydar\u2019s hold on power extended from 1969 through the early 1980s. Only two years after Azerbaijan\u2019s independence from the dissolving Soviet Union in 1991, Heydar was back on top until 2003 when he stepped down and Ilham took over.)\n\nAccording to an October 2015 report from Human Rights Watch the Azerbaijan regime plays real Soviet styled hardball with political dissidents:\n\n\u201cTorture and ill-treatment are well-documented, persistent problems in Azerbaijan, and are perpetrated with near impunity,\u201d according to a report by Human Rights Watch. \u201cIn the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, the detainees complained to their lawyers, family members or in court that they have been beaten or abusively harassed to force them to sign incriminating confessions or letters of repentance, suffered physical or psychological pressure in prison, or been denied appropriate medical treatment. \u201cThe government has been locking up human rights defenders one after another and then denying their reports of ill treatment,\u201d said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe UN Committee Against Torture made clear that the government needs to free the human rights defenders and stop turning a blind eye to their ill treatment in prison.\u201d\n\nComplaints about how elections are run in Azerbaijan are longstanding. Despite years of U.S. State Department handwringing, American officials still write statements like the one they did last month, lamenting the country\u2019s decision to block outside election monitors. The language is carefully crafted, calling for an end to the country\u2019s \u201crestrictive political environment\u201d and urging the dictatorship to \u201crespect the freedom to assembly\u201d and of a free press to operate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before he wanted to lock the rest of the world out, Trump was eager to do business with shady international figures", "title": "He wasn\u2019t always a xenophobe!
