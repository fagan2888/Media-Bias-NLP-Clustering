This creature isn\u2019t sure where its loyalty lies, but through a series of betrayals and evil machinations, and aided by a kindhearted human being with whom he/she shares some awkwardly scripted sexual tension, he or she ultimately decides to fight for the good guys. There\u2019s a surprise revelation, a couple more betrayals, and then a gigantic climax wherein the good guy creature is near death after a battle with a newly monstrous antagonist. At the last minute, they reveal surprising inner strength with the aid of the aforementioned human and conquer the evil leader, thereby saving mankind.\n\nWelcome to the world of \u201cUnderworld Legion Priest\u201d \u201cI, Frankenstein.\u201d It follows the aforementioned formula pretty much to a T, and that\u2019s about all you need to know. Instead of vampires and werewolves, or priests and vampires, or angels and demons, this time it\u2019s gargoyles (!) and demons, the gargoyles being an army sent down by Heaven to watch over mankind. Instead of a rogue vampire or rogue priest or rogue angel, the protagonist is effectively a rogue human \u2014 Frankenstein\u2019s monster, played with spectacular blandness by a tragically wasted Aaron Eckhart, who has really fallen down a hole of terrible scripts after his terrific performance as Harvey Dent. Frankenstein\u2019s creature, dubbed Adam by Leonore (Miranda Otto \u2014 oh, honey, no), the queen of the gargoyles (!!), is set against the demon prince Naberius (Bill Nighy, the film\u2019s lone interesting spot), who wants to find out the secret to his reanimation so that he can animate a crapload of dead people, get them possessed by his demon brethren, and take over the world and holy sh*t, I really did just write that sentence, didn\u2019t I.\n\nThere are battles and noble speeches and villainous declarations and everyone is vaguely British for no good reason, except for Adam, who after 200 years in the wilderness is now American. Also, apparently during those 200 years he learned how to sculpt his hair immaculately, but not how to do laundry or wash his face. The bad guys are baaaaad, and wear suits and all look like the Dark Prince Of The Ill-Fitting Brooks Brothers Cabaret. The good guys all wear curiasses and kneepads and there are enough capes to make you think that it\u2019s Spartacus Day at Comic-Con. Except when they dramatically turn into the giant gargoyles, which fly and grunt and are huge and dangerous looking, which naturally means that 50% of the time they fight \u2014 and get killed \u2014 in human form, because I really don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cI, Frankenstein\u201d is horrible, folks. I can\u2019t really put it any better than that. But I guess it\u2019s no morehorrible than any of the above noted films, which all use the same formula, which all trade role players around \u2014 Nighy is in the \u201cUnderworld\u201d films, as is Kevin Grevioux (who actually wrote both the comic book this is based on, as well as the screenplay). I\u2019m frankly surprised that \u201cLegion\u201d and \u201cPriest\u201d don\u2019t share any links, since they hew so closely to the same exhausted tropes, but then again they have the same director and writer and lead actors, so they\u2019re sort of parallel in that sense. I was halfway expecting Paul Bettany to pop up anyway, as if he heard the clarion call of idiotic mythology and couldn\u2019t resist its siren song, and writer/director Stuart Beattie just threw him in there because it was a slow shooting day. Regardless, if you\u2019ve seen any of those films, then \u201cI, Frankenstein\u201d becomes utterly predictable. In fact, if you\u2019ve got even two or three neurons capable of firing at even half-speed, you should basically already know how the whole thing goes and thereby want to avoid it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Terrible CGI, and laughably predictable plots. \"I, Frankenstein\" is just the latest in a long string of horror duds", "title": "Worst \u201cFrankstein\u201d ever?
