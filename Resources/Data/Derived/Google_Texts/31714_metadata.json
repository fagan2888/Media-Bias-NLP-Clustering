Here\u2019s what you need to say and do to stay in compliance.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with these letters?\n\nHere\u2019s a brief rundown of the healthcare reform exchange letters:\n\nWhat are they?\n\nThe healthcare reform law requires employers who are covered by the FLSA (those with annual sales of at least $500,000) to provide their employees with a notice informing them of the ability to purchase health insurance in the new Health Insurance Marketplace (a.k.a., the health exchanges).\n\nWho has to send them out?\n\nUnlike a number of healthcare reform requirements, this one applies to almost all employers: Every company with at least one employee and $500,000 in annual revenue is on the hook for sending out these letters.\n\nWhat do they have to say?\n\nAccording to FindLaw\u2019s Betty Wang, the letter should include:\n\nnotification that the exchange exists\n\na description of the services provided by the exchange\n\ninformation on how to contact the exchange to request assistance\n\nthe employee\u2019s potential eligibility for subsidized coverage on the exchange if your company\u2019s group health plan doesn\u2019t provide \u201cminimum value,\u201d and\n\nthe fact that the employee may lose the employer contribution (if any) toward health insurance coverage if he or she chooses to purchase individual coverage on the exchange.\n\nNotices available, thankfully\n\nIn some good news for firms, the DOL has issued two model notices that employers can use to satisfy the reform exchange notice requirement.\n\nThe first model notice the DOL released is meant for firms that offer health insurance to some or all of their workers. The second notice is for businesses that don\u2019t offer a health plan.\n\nAlso, the DOL released a revised COBRA Model Election Notice, which includes info about the health insurance exchanges, as well as a redline document that shows the changes to the initial COBRA notice.\n\nPrior to its guidance on the exchange notices, the DOL released an FAQ that included info on changes to the Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBCs) documents employers are required to distribute, as well as model SBCs firms can use to comply with this Obamacare provision.\n\nThe best way to communicate\n\nSimply issuing the exchange notices without further explanation is likely to lead to some confusion.\n\nSome other important facts you\u2019ll want to touch on about the exchanges:\n\nExchange coverage will begin Jan. 1. The exchanges are expected to start accepting applications for coverage on Oct. 1, but that coverage will not begin until at least Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nThe exchanges are expected to start accepting applications for coverage on Oct. 1, but that coverage will not begin until at least Jan. 1, 2014. Whether your company will help pay for exchange coverage. Employers are not required to contribute to health insurance coverage employees purchase on an exchange. And if you choose not to (as most employers will), tell employees that they\u2019ll be on their own if they purchase coverage through an exchange. If you sponsor a health plan, you may even want to explain how much you contribute to employee premiums \u2014 so they know what they\u2019ll be missing and have a better idea of how much more they\u2019ll have to pay for insurance in an exchange.\n\nEmployers are not required to contribute to health insurance coverage employees purchase on an exchange.

Exchanges may be good for some. Employees who are currently not offered health insurance, like part-timers, may be able to purchase an insurance plan via an exchange cheaply \u2014 especially if they qualify for a tax credit. The same applies to spouses and children who may not be offered much, if any, coverage under an employer-sponsored plan.\n\nEmployees who are currently not offered health insurance, like part-timers, may be able to purchase an insurance plan via an exchange cheaply \u2014 especially if they qualify for a tax credit. The same applies to spouses and children who may not be offered much, if any, coverage under an employer-sponsored plan. How the tax credits will work. For the benefit of those who are at least exploring the option of purchasing coverage via an exchange, explain how the tax credits will work. You may even want to do the calculations yourself and tell employees whether or not they\u2019ll qualify.\n\nWill there be penalties?\n\nTo make things even more complicated, the Obama administration just announced, via a brief FAQ on the DOL\u2019s website, that employers who fail to provide employees with a health exchange notice will not be \u201cpenalized.\u201d\n\nThe ACA carries a general non-compliance penalty of $100 per day that can be slapped on employers for a number of reasons \u2014 one of which is the failure to provide the exchange notice on time.\n\nBut the FAQ, which has since been released, made it very clear no employer will be \u201cpenalized\u201d for failing to provide the notices by Oct. 1 or otherwise.\n\nDOL wants to assist, not penalize\n\nIn fact, in another FAQ issued by the DOL last year, the agency said its general approach to enforcement of the law will:\n\nbe marked by an emphasis on assisting (rather than imposing penalties on) plans, issuers and others that are working diligently and in good faith to understand and come into compliance with the new law.\n\nSo it appears the DOL will only impose penalties on those who blatantly ignore or refuse to follow the law.\n\nSmall businesses unaware of notice rule\n\nWhy issue an FAQ nixing the notice penalty \u2014 and why do it now?\n\nThe reason for easing the rules has become clear: Many small businesses (those with fewer than 50 employees) weren\u2019t aware of the requirement. And as the deadline approached and more info came to light about the rule, the owners of those businesses started to complain about the potential non-compliance penalties attached to it.\n\nBut the timing of it remains a mystery. When asked why the FAQ was issued, a spokesperson for the DOL said, \u201cThe reason all the FAQs go out is to provide further clarity,\u201d reported Reuters.\n\nOne possible reason for releasing the FAQ, which essentially frees employers from the notice requirement, so close to the deadline: It allows the Obama administration to reap the rewards of the rule (making people aware of the exchanges) because by now most firms are prepared to comply and will issue the notices anyway \u2014 without any of the backlash that could come from forcing small employers who were caught off guard by the rule to comply.\n\nNo penalties, but there could be consequences\n\nThe ambiguity of the new FAQ, however, has many employment law experts suggesting that while there may not be any non-compliance \u201cpenalties\u201d attached to the exchange notice rule, there\u2019s a strong possibility there will still be consequences for not providing the notices.\n\nIn a response to whether or not the exchange rule carries a non-compliance penalty, the FAQ says:\n\nNo. If your company is covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, it should provide a written notice to its employees about the Health Insurance Marketplace by October 1, 2013, but there is no fine or penalty under the law for failing to provide the notice.\n\nBenefits attorneys like Christine Roberts say that this response is actually very confusing because it says employers \u201cshould\u201d provide the notices rather than employers \u201cshall\u201d provide the notices, which is the terminology used in other laws like the FLSA in regard to the notices.\n\nAnd since the new FAQ doesn\u2019t change any prior guidance on exchange notice duties, non-compliance could trigger consequences other than penalties.\n\nFor example, in her blog E is for ERISA, Roberts says the exchange notices could be viewed by the DOL as required disclosures under their ERISA covered-benefit plans. So not issuing them could open the door to an ERISA audit, she says.\n\nBottom line: Even though there\u2019s no monetary penalty for failing to provide the exchange notices, the safest bet for employers is to stay the course and issue them by Oct. 1.\n\nPortions of this story initially appeared on our sister site HRBenefitsAlert.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most companies -- including many small businesses -- are on the hook to send their employers a heads-up about the new healthcare reform exchanges by October 1.
