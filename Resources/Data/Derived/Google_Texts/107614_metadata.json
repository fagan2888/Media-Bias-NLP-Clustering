Ted Cruz hasn\u2019t made a final decision on whether he will sign up for Obamacare but will make up his mind \u201cin the coming days,\u201d a spokesman said Wednesday.\n\nRick Tyler, national spokesman for the Texas Republican senator\u2019s newly launched presidential campaign, also defended Cruz against charges of hypocrisy for suggesting that he might enroll in Affordable Care Act health exchanges.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz and his wife are still weighing options for their family,\u201d Tyler wrote in an email to POLITICO when asked about the senator\u2019s current thinking on enrolling in an ACA health insurance exchange, adding that the senator would make a decision shortly.\n\nTyler said that Cruz \u2014 who has vigorously opposed and vowed to repeal Obamacare \u2014 was subject to a law with which he disagrees. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying he\u2019s not going to pay the taxes he voted against,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCruz, meanwhile, slammed the media coverage of his family\u2019s health care dilemma, saying the mainstream media is playing \u201cgotcha games.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so suddenly, all the media goes, \u2018Ah ha ha ha, gotcha!\u2019\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday with The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal. \u201cBecause Cruz is now signing up for Obamacare. Listen, I have zero intention of taking any government subsidy or Obama subsidy. Rather, what I\u2019m going to do is pay in the marketplace for health insurance for my family, just like millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThe senator and his family had been covered through the plan his wife, Heidi, receives through her job as a managing director at Goldman Sachs in Houston. But they will lose that coverage as she takes an unpaid leave to work on his presidential campaign. That means Cruz and his wife have a decision to make regarding their family health insurance.\n\nUnder an amendment to Obamacare sponsored by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, lawmakers and some of their staffers can get a government subsidy for health insurance only if they enroll in the District of Columbia health exchange and if they are not on Medicare or on another family member\u2019s plan.\n\nCruz insists he wouldn\u2019t accept the federal subsidy if he were to enroll, which his spokesman reiterated Wednesday. It\u2019s the same subsidy that lawmakers received through the federal health insurance program they were in before the Affordable Care Act passed. They aren\u2019t eligible for the income-related subsidies middle- and lower-income Americans using the Obamacare exchanges can get.\n\nIf Cruz chose not to sign up for the ACA health exchange, he could enroll in a private insurance plan outside of Obamacare and pay the full cost. Tyler said the Cruz family is still determining whether it might be eligible through COBRA coverage via Goldman Sachs, but the firm did not respond to a request for comment. COBRA is primarily for those who have lost a job and want to keep their employer health plan, and is sometimes available in other job-change circumstances. People enrolling in COBRA must pay the whole cost of their health coverage \u2014 a considerable amount for a family of four, such as Cruz\u2019s.\n\nCruz\u2019s statement that he would \u201cpresumably\u201d sign up for insurance through Obamacare \u2014 first reported Tuesday by the Des Moines Register \u2014 has delighted many progressives. Several liberal blogs have argued that the senator would be actively choosing to enroll in Obamacare \u2014 not being compelled under law, as he has suggested \u2014 given his ability to apply for private insurance or possibly to get COBRA coverage.\n\n\u201cObamacare has driven the whole industry, though,\u201d Tyler said when pressed on that point in a separate phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if the new private plans have been all preserved. They haven\u2019t. Everything was affected by Obamacare.\u201d\n\nCruz, who on Monday became the first Republican to launch an official 2016 presidential campaign, has been among the most outspoken opponents of the Affordable Care Act since arriving in the Senate. He has been criticized by many in both parties for his hard-line push against the ACA in 2013 \u2014 which included a 21-hour-plus filibuster on the Senate floor \u2014 that helped lead to the federal government shutdown. During that speech, he compared those who would relent on defunding Obamacare to people who gave up the fight against the Nazis. \u201cLook, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, \u2018Accept the Nazis. Yes, they\u2019ll dominate the continent of Europe, but that\u2019s not our problem. Let\u2019s appease them,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe ACA continues to be a focus of his attention \u2014 including at the launch of his presidential campaign Monday at Virginia\u2019s Liberty University.\n\n\u201cImagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d he said then.\n\nNick Gass contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He'll make up his mind about signing up for ACA \u201cin the coming days.\u201d", "title": "Cruz 'still weighing options' on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ted-cruz-obamacare-116408.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/25/150325_topaz_cruz3_obamacare_getty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Obamacare,Senate,Republicans,Health Care,2016 Elections,Texas,Ted Cruz 2016,Affordable Care Act,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He'll make up his mind about signing up for ACA \u201cin the coming days.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dd9\"", "article_summary": "2016 Cruz 'still weighing options' on ObamacareSen.
