Bernie Sanders have traded accusations about their healthcare plans \u2014 the former\u2019s campaign has defended the private insurance industry that has financially supported Clinton\u2019s political career, while the latter has proposed to create a Medicare-for-all system, with the government as the single payer. But while the two positions seem different, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told the World Economic Forum Thursday that the political debate is missing a key point: Today's so-called Obamacare system is really a hybrid of the two ideas.\n\nResponding to a question about the intensifying political debate over healthcare, Burwell said President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act \u201ccreated a marketplace that has both government payment as well as market payment.\u201d But, she argued, the United States may be closer to a government-supported system than many realize.\n\n\u201cMany times we don\u2019t recognize everyone in the United States is supported by the government in their healthcare if they have it in any form \u2014 in some form, most likely,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in Medicare, obviously you\u2019re being subsidized by the government. Let\u2019s just say you\u2019re in employer-based care. Well tax benefits are a huge subsidy that the American taxpayer is giving you for that care. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in Medicare \u2014 Medicaid. Medicaid is being subsidized by the government, and in the marketplace, 8 out of 10 folks in the marketplace have subsidies.\u201d (She clarified that there are a few people in the marketplace whose healthcare isn\u2019t supported by the government because they don\u2019t qualify for subsidies).\n\nPhoto: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nAs Congress debated healthcare legislation in 2009, some lawmakers pushed to expand traditional Medicare or add a government-administered insurance policy known as a \u201cpublic option\u201d to the proposal. Those initiatives were ultimately blocked, after furious lobbying by the private health industry. In the lead-up to the final vote on the legislation, then-HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius asserted that the Affordable Care Act was tailored to prevent the creation of the kind of single-payer, government-run system that many industrialized nations today have, and that Sebelius herself had endorsed in 2007.\n\n\"I think that's very much the case,\u201d she told National Public Radio when asked if the bill was designed to prevent single payer. \u201cIf you want anybody to convince people of that, talk to the single-payer proponents who are furious that the single-payer idea is not part of the discussion.\"\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe same cannot be said for today, as Sanders \u2014 who is the only 2016 candidate to cast a congressional vote for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is now pledging that if elected president, he will push to create a single-payer system that guarantees government-sponsored healthcare to all Americans.\n\nClinton has portrayed single-payer as a costly effort to fully roll back the current Affordable Care Act. However, Burwell this week suggested that in practice, the two do not necessarily have to be mutually exclusive: she said that \u2014 despite Sebelius\u2019 earlier comments \u2014 there is nothing in the current Affordable Care Act that prevents states from trying to create their own single payer systems, as Vermont initially attempted, and as Colorado voters will likely consider during their 2016 election.\n\n\u201cCan states choose to do things within this system? Sure. But they have to meet pretty high standards,\u201d she told International Business Times. In the meantime, as the campaign debate over healthcare continues to simmer, she said her department is focused on implementing the current legislation as it is.\n\n\u201cRight now we are in a system that has a market and a system that has direct pay by the government, and that\u2019s a system we\u2019re working hard to make work,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we want to do is make the system in front of us work, because we\u2019ve seen it reduce the uninsured by 45 percent ... We\u2019ve seen progress on affordability and quality, but not as much as we\u2019d like.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, single payer, medicare for all, clinton health care, sanders health care, clinton sanders health care, clinton single payer, sanders single payer, universal health care, health insurance, private health insurance, 2016", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Weighing in on the 2016 presidential race, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said \u201ceveryone in the United States is supported by the government in their healthcare.\u201d", "title": "Davos 2016: Health And Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell Says America Already Has A Government-Supported Healthcare System", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/davos-2016-health-human-services-secretary-sylvia-burwell-says-america-already-has-2275968", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/22/497718206.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Weighing in on the 2016 presidential race, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said \u201ceveryone in the United States is supported by the government in their healthcare.\u201d", "title": "Davos 2016: Health And Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell Says America Already Has A Government-Supported Healthcare System", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/davos-2016-health-human-services-secretary-sylvia-burwell-says-america-already-has-2275968", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/22/497718206.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2016/01/22/497718206.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "published_time": "2016-01-22T06:20:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T06:59:24-05:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rocktheboat"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Weighing in on the 2016 presidential race, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said \u201ceveryone in the United States is supported by the government in their healthcare.\u201d"}, "article_summary": "Clinton has portrayed single-payer as a costly effort to fully roll back the current Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cRight now we are in a system that has a market and a system that has direct pay by the government, and that\u2019s a system we\u2019re working hard to make work,\u201d she said.\nIn the meantime, as the campaign debate over healthcare continues to simmer, she said her department is focused on implementing the current legislation as it is.\nWell tax benefits are a huge subsidy that the American taxpayer is giving you for that care.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in Medicare, obviously you\u2019re being subsidized by the government."}
