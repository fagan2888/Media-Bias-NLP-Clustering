Regardless of the promises for what fracking could do — serve as a “bridge fuel” on the way to renewables, help America achieve energy dependence, etc. — it’s hard to deny what it’s actually done: methane leaks, air and water pollution and earthquakes have all emerged as a consequence of our drill first, ask questions later mind-set. Gas and oil interests are drilling and fracking nearly 100 wells per day, leaving little time for them — or anyone else — to step back and fully account for the safety risks. CleanTechnica sums up the problem thusly: “you have far too many new wells, far too few public inspection resources, and an expectation that the industry can fill in the gaps.”

Falling into those gaps are gas and oil wells identified as “high risk,” meaning they’re located near national forests or fragile watersheds, or are otherwise more likely than others to seriously pollute surrounding areas. In the struggle to keep up, an Associated Press investigation reveals, federal regulators are allowing four in 10 of such wells to go uninspected.

Dennis Willis, a former Bureau of Land Management field officer who now does consulting work for conservation groups, calls the situation “a disaster waiting to happen.”
