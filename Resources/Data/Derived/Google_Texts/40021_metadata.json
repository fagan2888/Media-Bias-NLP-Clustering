Don\u2019t remember how many shots you took or how many beers you chugged? No worries, there\u2019s a new app that will keep track for you: Alcohoot.\n\n\u201cThe app connects to your alcohol breathalyzer via your headphone jack, and you blow for about 4 seconds and it shows you your Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) and it also shows you the legal limit in your GPS location for drunk driving, and apart from showing you your BAC and the numbers, it also explains in context what this number means,\u201d Ben Biron, Alcohoot co-founder and chief marketing officer, told Medical Daily.\n\nYour BAC shown on the device is based on the number of drinks you\u2019ve consumed, age, weight, and height.\n\n\u201cAlcohoot engages smart drinkers who aspire to discover their personal limits,\u201d Lisa Willey-Knierim, Alcohoot CEO, said in a press release, \u201cand to use that insight to empower greater enjoyment, while remaining in control whenever and wherever they are enjoying a drink. Smart drinkers are looking to extend the experience in a way that will let them start the next day refreshed and with great memories.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of Alcohoot Photo courtesy of Alcohoot\n\nThe app will also let you know the location of nearby restaurants to grab food and relax; the location of nearby taxis through connections with Uber, Hailo, Lyft, and Taxi Magic; and, show a personal history graph of tests to see if your BAC is increasing or decreasing.\n\nThe app assists you in finding your \u201cperfect BAC\u201d by analyzing past drinking trends and using algorithms, so you can drink smarter next time. The next morning after you drank, there will be a two-question quiz asking about how you felt the night before.\n\nThere are currently other breathalyzer smartphone devices available, like this one on Amazon for $49.95, which is half the price of Alcohoot, $99.99.\n\nIn an interview with Medical Daily, Biron said:\n\nThere\u2019s actually a big difference between our product and the product you found on Amazon for $50, our product has two different sensors and breathalyzers. One is the one police use and is called fuel cell. It is also equipped with a pressure sensor and pumping system. And these sensors are completely accurate, very specific and have long working life. And the one that you found is called semi-conductor, and it tests and picks up different things, not just alcohol, like gases, perfumes, and hairsprays. They are a lot cheaper and have a shorter working life. There is a huge difference in the technology, and our product is able to provide police grade accuracy as opposed to just a cheap toy.\n\nAlcohoot is a registered entity with the FDA and has a partnership with Pernod Ricard USA, who is the creator of brands like Absolut Vodka, Jameson, and Malibu.\n\nYou can order an Alcohoot breathalyzer through the company\u2019s website and Amazon. The device comes in black, white, and red. In addition to the breathalyzer, the package includes one USB charging cable and eight mouth pieces. The battery provides power for 500 tests before having to be recharged with the USB cable.\n\nCheck out how Alcohoot works and see if people know how alcohol affects their body:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alcohoot, breathalyzer app, drinking, alcohol", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Is your BAC above the .08 percent legal limit for driving under the influence?
