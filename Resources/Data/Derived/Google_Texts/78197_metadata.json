So it is with Rand Paul\u2019s proposal to create Economic Freedom Zones for Detroit and other depressed cities\u2014a recycled version of the Enterprise Zones of 1980s.\n\nBut if past is prelude, this idea won\u2019t work not because it doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014but because Washington won\u2019t allow a sensible version to pass its august chambers.\n\nFreedom Zones is Paul\u2019s answer to Obama\u2019s bailout\u2014oops, aid\u2014package for Detroit and a way to show minorities that the GOP cares. Unlike Obama\u2019s plan, Paul won\u2019t offer federal handouts for housing, brownfield cleanup, highways and gang busting. Rather, he\u2019ll slash federal taxes (income, corporate, capital gains and payroll) and regulations (EPA\u2019s storm-water clean up rules) for areas whose unemployment is 50 percent over the national average.\n\nFor Detroit, this would work out to a $1.3 billion-stimulus over 10 years. \u201cThese zones don\u2019t ask Houston or Atlanta to bailout Detroit,\u201d he said last week. \u201cIt frees Detroit to bail itself out.\u201d\n\nThat would be a correct statement if Paul\u2019s proposed bill had included spending cuts to offset the lost tax revenue. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nThat issue aside, the theory behind the Freedom Zones concept is that jumpstarting growth in depressed areas requires not a top-down industrial policy with Uncle Sam picking winners and losers. Rather, it requires giving these areas a more competitive economic environment that overcomes their existing disadvantages\u2014inhospitable climate, dying local industries\u2014to boost local entrepreneurs and attract outside investors.\n\nThis approach worked well in England, turning London\u2019s depressed docklands into a super-dynamic hub for finance and other businesses in the 1980s. It also transformed India\u2019s Bangalore from a sleepy little town (that Winston Churchill once compared to a prison) into a global IT powerhouse in the 1990s.\n\nBut it has been a disappointing failure in America. Why? Because neither Republicans nor Democrats have ever managed to create anything resembling a genuine Enterprise Zone.\n\nThe crucial thing is not just tinkering with taxes but also regulatory relief at both the federal and local level. But even Ronald Reagan, whose HUD secretary Jack Kemp conceived the whole idea, ultimately proposed only cosmetic regulatory changes, focusing mainly on tax breaks. The upshot was not new growth but simply shifting of businesses\u2014sometimes moving no more than few blocks\u2014to lower-tax zip codes.\n\nBill Clinton gave up even the pretense of tax relief in his 30-plus \u201cEnterprise Zones,\u201d deploying instead \u201ctargeted investments,\u201d a glorified term for handouts. Worse, in order to qualify for these \u201cinvestments,\u201d state officials had to submit elaborate plans for retraining workers and building cheap housing to an \u201cEnterprise Board.\u201d\n\nThis exercise in bureaucratic central planning turned the whole concept of Enterprise Zones on its head, producing no discernible impact on the targeted communities. (Some areas of Detroit got the Empowerment Zone desgination in 1994 but that didn\u2019t stop the city from becoming an economic basket case anyway.) It also increased local red tape and corruption. A 2003 audit of Cincinnati\u2019s Empowerment Zone found that state officials routinely misused federal funds to inflate their own salaries, prompting President Bush to eventually slash funding.\n\nThe bipartisan failure to implement the concept without dilution or distortion is no accident. There are systemic reasons for it.\n\nThe federal regulatory state has been the liberal tool of choice for enacting sweeping environmental, consumer, and workplace protections over the past 50 years. Liberals regard the country\u2019s primary challenge not as wealth creation\u2014but protecting Americans from the ill effects of wealth creation. Depressed cities are a price they are willing to pay (unlike, say, in India, where eradicating rampant poverty is still the central political task).\n\nHence, liberals are not going to simply stand back and allow the weakening, say, of EPA\u2019s clean water mandates or OSHA\u2019s workplace requirements in the name of reviving local economies.\n\nIf Paul wants to succeed, he\u2019ll have to do more than outline an abstract concept. He\u2019ll have to present it in a form that can withstand the inevitable political onslaught. Lame half gestures won\u2019t fix Detroit or win over its minorities.\n\nThis column originally appeared in the Washington Examiner", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/15/rand-pauls-non-plan-to-save-detroit", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Economic Freedom Zones can't survive the regulatory state.", "title": "Rand Paul Won't Be Able To Save Detroit"}, "twitter": {"title": "Rand Paul Won't Be Able To Save Detroit", "description": "Like yesterday\u2019s fashions, old policies never die, they simply\nreturn with new accessories.
