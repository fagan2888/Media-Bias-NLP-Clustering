Buffalo Wild Wings Franchisee Gobbles Up Catalina Restaurants

The latest deal from Food Management Partners follows restaurant acquisitions from Redrock Partners and Romulus

Food Management Partners, one of Buffalo Wild WingsÂ’ largest franchisees, is buying restaurant owner Catalina Restaurant Group from Zensho America Corp.

Catalina owns and operates 149 Coco's Bakery Restaurant and Carrows Restaurants in California, Nevada and Arizona. The deal is expected to close on March 31.

San Antonio, Texas-based Food Management operates franchised and independent restaurant brands, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Zio's Italian Kitchen, Don Pablo's and Furr's Fresh Buffet.

The seller is Japan's largest operator of restaurant chains, with about 4,000 gyudon (beef bowl), family dining and fast food locations.

Moelis & Co. LLC and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. acted as Zensho's financial advisers for the deal, and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP provided legal advice.

There have been several restaurant transactions lately. Earlier in March, Rerock Partners LLC bought struggling Romano's Macaroni Grill for $8 million. In November, Romulus Inc. agreed to buy 16 IHOP (International House of Pancakes) franchises. For more on restaurant M&A, see Debt Markets Nourish Restaurant M&A.
