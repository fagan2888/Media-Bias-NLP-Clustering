For example, Goodwill does minor repairs on and sanitizes donated medical supplies, then gives them to people who can't afford them.\n\n\"We certainly depend on the donations, but then we have personnel costs involved in that,\" Beirne said.\n\nThis year, that program cost about $187,000, he said. And only about $11,000 of that is covered by cash donations, he said. The rest is self-funded. That's just an example of the costs the organization is covering, he said.\n\nBeirne came on in October and said it's only been since then that the organization is making more of an effort to find other funding streams, such as corporate partnerships or requests from area foundations.\n\nThe budgetary shortfall is largely because of increased expenses for benefits and business regulations and decreased workforce development funds from the State of Tennessee\u2019s Department of Rehabilitation, he said.\n\nFor example, the Affordable Care Act requirement of offering health care to employees not previously insured has been a big budget strain, adding about $300,000 to the organization's costs, he said.\n\nThere's also a liability shift involving credit card processing that is impacting Goodwill. The United States is transitioning to a new credit card infrastructure. Many banks are issuing new credit cards with chips in them to help protect from fraud. And that means that retailers have to update their point-of-sales systems to work with the new cards.\n\nIt isn't required that retailers update their systems, but if they don't and there is a fraudulent transaction, the retailer must accept the liability.\n\nFor Goodwill, this means replacing about 46 point-of-sales stations, which is a large added cost.\n\nAnother cost that could be avoided involves taking off trash that people donate. Workers remove more than 100,000 pounds of trash from 35 donation sites each month.\n\n\"This requires a huge expense of manpower, transportation and fuel that robs from what we could use to provide our program services,\" Beirne said.\n\nPeople should donate items they would want to buy themselves, he said. And donations can help leaders close the budget gap, he said.\n\nIn an effort to close the gap, leaders have discontinued the YouthAdvantage career mentorship program, modified the Health Equipment Links Program\u2014which provides medical supplies\u2014and made staff reductions. In 2014, HELP provided 6,126 people with supplies, and leaders hope that they can eventually fully restore and grow that service.\n\nRecent staff reductions have impacted two full-time directors and several other positions in retail and support services divisions.\n\nOfficials said in a statement:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chattanooga news, entertainment, opinion, editorials", "og": {"site_name": "Nooga.com", "description": "Until recently, Chattanooga Goodwill has been able to self-fund the majority of costs for its programs and services, which serve more than 10,000 people in a 23-county area.", "title": "Chattanooga Goodwill Industries struggles with budgetary shortfall", "url": "http://nooga.com/170208/chattanooga-goodwill-industries-struggles-with-budgetary-shortfall/", "image": "https://noogacms.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/_/4afb9e18e21d9555fa17b02a7fa8e50862058_large.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NoogaNews", "image": "https://noogacms.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/_/4afb9e18e21d9555fa17b02a7fa8e50862058_large.png", "description": "Until recently, Chattanooga Goodwill has been able to self-fund the majority of costs for its programs and services, which serve more than 10,000 people in a 23-county area.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chattanooga Goodwill Industries struggles with budgetary shortfall"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "10861fd2fb15c60793c07348980e295e"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1400280486890380}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nooga.com", "published_time": "20150612T1215", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/1586522245"}, "msvalidate.01": "1FCFAF85DD84EF15FE1F984BAA51D8EC", "google-site-verification": "ZV6KJxYZmuIj2xB89lDEfnaBCsDCtzILRcc-orlSZm8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For example, Goodwill does minor repairs on and sanitizes donated medical supplies, then gives them to people who can't afford them.\nRevenue from sales at Chattanooga Goodwill Industries has increased over the last year, but the nonprofit is still struggling and leaders have had to make cuts to close the budgetary shortfall.\n\"This requires a huge expense of manpower, transportation and fuel that robs from what we could use to provide our program services,\" Beirne said.\nAnd donations can help leaders close the budget gap, he said.\nUntil recently, Chattanooga Goodwill has been able to self-fund the majority of costs for its programs and services, which serve more than 10,000 people in a 23-county area, he also said."}
