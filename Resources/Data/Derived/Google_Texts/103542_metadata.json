(NASDAQ: BNFT), a leading provider of cloud-based benefits software solutions, today announced that Outsource, LLC has selected Benefitfocus HR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE\u00ae to automate benefits enrollment and administrative tasks that were previously managed manually on paper. Headquartered in Los Angeles, Outsource is the largest staffing firm in the commercial and industrial wiring industry with 19 branch offices across the country that service over 400 clients a year. HR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE enables Outsource to manage benefits information, eligibility and communication for its internal staff as well as its contract employees within a single solution.\n\nIn 2015, a significant number of Outsource's technicians that mainly work offsite will become eligible for employee-sponsored benefits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). By centralizing benefits information and activity within the mobile-friendly HR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE portal, Outsource can offer its geographically dispersed workforce a more convenient way to enroll in their benefits while streamlining administration. This consolidation eliminates paper forms and reduces the risk of costly errors that can result from manual data entry. In addition, the portal features a dynamic messaging center and content manager that provides a simple process for administrators to tailor communication and create a personalized benefits experience.\n\n\"Adopting a cloud-based enrollment system was a necessary step for us to be able to streamline processes moving forward while providing our employees with convenient access to their benefits information,\" said Kayt Priester, Human Resources Manager at Outsource. \"After researching other solutions, we found that Benefitfocus was the only option that offered the core elements we needed to make this transition seamless and better communicate the value of our benefits package with our geographically diverse workforce. In addition, Benefitfocus provides the scalable administrative capabilities that make us confident we will be prepared to address the future needs of our rapidly growing workforce and the evolving benefits landscape.\"\n\nHR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE combines an intuitive interface with a rules-driven engine to create a guided workflow that presents employees with all of the benefits for which they are eligible. The BENEFITFOCUS\u00ae Plan Shopping App allows employees to evaluate health plans based on expected utilization and estimated costs, helping them identify which option best meets their health and financial needs. The app, along with educational videos, provides employees with easy-to-understand explanations of other coverage options such as voluntary benefits that may be a cost-effective supplement to their healthcare coverage.\n\n\"In addition to automating the transmission of benefits data between systems, we are helping companies address two key components of employee benefits - communication and cost transparency,\" stated Benefitfocus President and CEO Shawn Jenkins. \"We are thrilled that Outsource will be able to leverage the flexibility of our Platform to offer greater support both to their administrators and their workforce. As benefits become more complex, our goal at Benefitfocus is to offer these stakeholders the support they need to make good decisions for themselves and their families.\"\n\nAbout Outsource LLC\n\nOutsource is a leading Specialized Labor Contractor focused on delivering technical resources to companies that install and service wired systems within commercial buildings.
