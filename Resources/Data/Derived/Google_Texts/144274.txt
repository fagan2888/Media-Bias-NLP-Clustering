Wichita police are investigating several cases of arson in south Wichita, the most recent case happening in the 2200 block of S. Osage.

Sgt. Chris Marceau told KAKE News they responded to the call around 12:57 a.m Saturday morning. A red sedan's passenger side was fully engulfed in flames.

Sgt. Marceau says he believes it is arson, because just last week two other vehicles were found on fire in the 2200 block of S. Silver, just east of the river.

So far, no arrests have been made. If you have any information regarding any of the fires, please call police.

"I just thought, oh no, not again," said the victim of the latest car fire.

She says that the area is going to increase its neighborhood watch program and that the criminals will be caught if they try to start more cars on fire in their community.

"They just better be careful because we are going to be out here looking here."
