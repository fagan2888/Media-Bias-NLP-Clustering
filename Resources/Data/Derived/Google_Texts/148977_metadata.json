People are more prone to start shopping.\"\n\nThat could be bad news, financially, for hospitals and health systems that don't examine how consumers value different services.\n\n\"It puts a lot of businesses at risk,\" said Grube. \"If we don't know what people are looking for in the marketplace, we're vulnerable to other organizations that come in that have a better handle on what people want.\"\n\n[Also: Consumers urged to pay attention to out-of-pocket costs when enrolling in health plans]\n\nAnd what people want may skew to cheaper services -- not necessarily better ones.\n\n\"Those are the kinds of decisions being made because of high-deductible plans,\" said Grube.\n\nWhile there's no one-size-fits-all solution to the disconnect, Grube said it's important for health systems to make investments in turning their operations more consumer-centric. That involves determining in which resources to pour capital.\n\nOne possibility is constructing consumer databases. That may help organizations understand people's attitudes and perceptions of the healthcare system, and help them understand what the consumers' ideal experience looks like. A useful model might be Walgreen's, which has constructed huge consumer databases to figure out their customers' preferences and buying patterns.\n\nImproving efficiency and access for consumers are also notable steps an organization can take, said Grube.\n\n\"To remain relevant, there's going to have to be a much higher level of consumer-centricity going forward,\" he said. \"Each organization needs to figure out what niche it's going to be and how it's going to differentiate itself.\"\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-providers-struggle-understand-patient-financial-needs-kaufman-hall-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor%20talking%20to%20patient-feature_4.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "A new survey of hospital and health system senior executives by by Kaufman Hall found that while 96 percent of healthcare organizations say understanding patient needs is important, only 13 percent really understands what those needs are.", "title": "Healthcare providers struggle to understand patient financial needs, Kaufman Hall says"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctor%20talking%20to%20patient-feature_4.png"}, "description": "A new survey of hospital and health system senior executives by by Kaufman Hall found that while 96 percent of healthcare organizations say understanding patient needs is important, only 13 percent really understands what those needs are.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthcare providers struggle to understand patient financial needs, Kaufman Hall says"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A new survey of hospital and health system senior executives by Kaufman Hall found that while 96 percent of healthcare organizations say understanding patient needs is important, only 13 percent really understands what those needs are.&#13; Only 15 percent said they were confident in their organization's overall consumerism strategy, while 28 percent said they were minimally or not confident.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"To remain relevant, there's going to have to be a much higher level of consumer-centricity going forward,\" he said.\nA new survey of hospital and health system senior executives by Kaufman Hall found that while 96 percent of healthcare organizations say understanding patient needs is important, only 13 percent really understands what those needs are.\n\"The role of the individual in healthcare is rapidly transforming from passive patient to active consumer,\" according to a statement issued with the survey.\nThat may help organizations understand people's attitudes and perceptions of the healthcare system, and help them understand what the consumers' ideal experience looks like.\n\"Each organization needs to figure out what niche it's going to be and how it's going to differentiate itself.\""}
