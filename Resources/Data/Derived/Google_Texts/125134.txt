Community health workers, individuals who have been linking underserved communities with medical and social services, can now be certified in Florida.

The professional credential brings credibility and visibility to the profession, which began as a grassroots effort in various communities, and is expected to grow by as much as 25 percent by 2022.

The certification represents the workers' competency, "but most importantly it's good for the community, so that people know that this is a person who has professional and ethical qualifications," said Glen Casel, a member of Florida Certification Board.

Community health workers generally work in nonprofit organizations like HHI or Federally Qualified Health Centers and many times they're known within their community as someone who can answer questions about medical and social resources.

"People are more apt to share their stories with somebody who's from the same community and somebody who they can relate to, and that's what's different with the community health workers," said Patria Alguila, co-chair of Florida Community Health Worker Coalition.

There were lots of hugs and photos and cheers at a small conference room at the Hispanic Health Initiatives office in Casselberry on Tuesday, as two community health workers were presented with the first of state-issued certifications.

One of them was Lolita Dash-Pitts, executive director of Front Porch Community Development Association, in St. Petersburg, who has been a community health worker since 2009. The certification, she said, adds another level of legitimacy to what she does.

To be eligible for the CHW certification, individuals must have at least 500 hours of paid or volunteer experience; 30 hours of training in the core competencies; and two letters of reference. They must also complete an application. Starting in 2016, applicants must also take an exam.

Community health workers officially got a Department of Labor job code in 2010.
