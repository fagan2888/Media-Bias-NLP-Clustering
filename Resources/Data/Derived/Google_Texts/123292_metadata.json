Hordes march. Cannibalism occurs.\n\nFor a fan of the catastrophe genre, \"The Walking Dead\" is right on the money.\n\nThe same cannot be said, however, for the Republican Party. Since before President Barack Obama was first inaugurated, GOP lawmakers and talking heads have promised us disaster of immeasurable proportions.\n\nIf even a fraction of the prognostications were correct, America should now be a lawless land in which a gallon of gasoline costs more than $6 and nobody has a job, which doesn't matter since the stock market and the entire economy collapsed. We should be living under Shariah law in a European socialist hellscape, robbed of our guns and freedom of speech and subject to sinister death panels that decide our fate, assuming that fate hasn't already been decided by Iran nuking us into the Dark Ages while Obama sits cackling atop a mountain of burning Bibles.\n\nUnfortunately, Republicans promised catastrophe and we wound up with this:\n\nThe January jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that more than 1 million jobs have been created over the past three months. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told The New York Times: \"Employment growth is astonishingly strong.\"\n\nCharles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, told CNBC that the latest numbers show signs of a \"fairly normal economy\" and that people should stop looking at the economy as being in \"perpetual crisis.\"\n\nThat's no fun.\n\nAAA reported Monday that the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.18, down more than a dollar from last year. Rather than fighting over high-priced and hard-to-get fuel, people are using the stuff to wash their hybrid cars.\n\nAnd what of Obamacare, the job-killing legislative stake Obama drove through America's perfectly healthy heart? Well, there is the aforementioned job creation, which is the same as job killing only in reverse.\n\nThere are about 10 million previously uninsured people who now have health care, and the uninsured rate in the country has dropped to the lowest level since Gallup started tracking it in 2008.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says the number of insurance companies offering plans under Obamacare will increase by 25 percent this year. The Congressional Budget Office now says the cost of Obamacare will be 20 percent less than expected and predicts 27 million people will gain insurance under the law over the next decade.\n\nBORING!\n\nWe were promised tyranny and all we got was a recovering economy, a flu shot and a decent co-pay.\n\nWhat's the deal, Republican politicians? By comparison, you're making the boy who cried wolf seem like a keen-eyed spotter of wilderness canids.\n\nEager to help, I looked into people who always expect the worst-case scenario to unfold. Lo and behold, the behavior has a name: catastrophizing.\n\n\"They imagine the worst-case-scenario version of everything,\" said Alice Boyes, a former clinical psychologist from New Zealand and author of the upcoming book \"The Anxiety Toolkit.\" \"When something turns out bad, it's going to be a catastrophe. Rather than worry about going to the dentist and having to spend a few hundred dollars getting something fixed, they would be worried the dentist is going to have to do five root canals.\"\n\nShe said catastrophizing, a cognitive distortion, can arise when people are in opposition.\n\n\"They have this feeling of helplessness,\" Boyes said. \"They feel helpless to stop this change that's being put upon them.\"\n\nSound familiar?\n\nShe said one of the main mechanisms related to catastrophizing is \"rumination\": \"Rumination is over-thinking without moving on to problem-solving. That's the most common complaint about Congress. That they just gripe and gripe and gripe and don't actually move on to useful problem-solving solutions.\"\n\nFor more on that see last week's 56th attempt by House Republicans to repeal Obamacare.\n\nSo how can we help anti-Obama politicians shake their catastrophizing ways?\n\nBoyes said it's important that people learn to recognize when they're catastrophizing.\n\nSay you hear the word \"Obamacare\" and your mind immediately goes to \"it will fundamentally transform America into an unrecognizable, war-torn oligarchy.\" That's a good indicator that you're catastrophizing.\n\nA next step, Boyes said, is to recognize that when you're catastrophizing \"you're not actually doing anything useful.\"\n\n\"It might be that someone thinks they can over-think and over-think and come up with a solution,\" she said. \"But it's unlikely that thinking and trying the same thing is going to help. You need to consciously make yourself think about the other possible outcomes.\"\n\nLike the possibility that things in America, while far from perfect, aren't nearly as bad as you've spent the past six years making them out to be.\n\nOr the possibility that if you keep incorrectly forecasting cataclysms, we'll eventually stop listening and get our catastrophe fix from \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\nrhuppke@tribpub.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Republicans predict catastrophe, but Obama fails to deliver", "date": "2015-02-09", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "If there's one thing I enjoy about the wildly popular television series \"The Walking Dead,\" it's that it promises an apocalyptic version of America, replete with brain-starved zombies and gangs of renegade humans, and then it really delivers.", "title": "Republicans predict catastrophe, but Obama fails to deliver", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/huppke/ct-talk-huppke-gop-obamacare-catastrophe-20150209-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54d94c34/turbine/ct-talk-huppke-gop-obamacare-catastrophe-20150209", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/82770423", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "obamacare jobs report, gop obamacare jobs report, obamacare republicans repeal", "news_keywords": "obamacare jobs report, gop obamacare jobs report, obamacare republicans repeal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Huppke: Diagnosing the GOP's worst-case-scenario view of Obama \u2014 they're catastrophizing!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf0e\"", "article_summary": "A next step, Boyes said, is to recognize that when you're catastrophizing \"you're not actually doing anything useful.\"\nSince before President Barack Obama was first inaugurated, GOP lawmakers and talking heads have promised us disaster of immeasurable proportions.\nFor a fan of the catastrophe genre, \"The Walking Dead\" is right on the money.\nOr the possibility that if you keep incorrectly forecasting cataclysms, we'll eventually stop listening and get our catastrophe fix from \"The Walking Dead.\"\nThat's a good indicator that you're catastrophizing."}
