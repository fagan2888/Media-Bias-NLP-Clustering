The American Cancer Society estimates that around 1,350 children under the age of 15 will die as the result of cancer by the end of 2014. A subway billboard advertisement created by the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation (Barncancerfonden) is using a powerful message to help raise awareness regarding cancer diagnoses among children.\n\nThe foundation got the idea for their ad from the Swedish shampoo brand Apolosophy. In Apolosophy\u2019s ad, a young woman\u2019s hair is blown around her face every time a train passes. A young girl featured in the foundation\u2019s ad also has her hair blown around, but toward the end the girl\u2019s hair blows away completely while a message flashes on the screen: \u201cEvery day a child is diagnosed with cancer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, around 250,000 children and young people around the world are diagnosed with some form of childhood cancer each year. Following major treatment advances over the past few decades, childhood cancer survival rates after five years in developed countries have climbed to 80 percent compared to 60 percent in the mid-1970s. Unfortunately, childhood cancer in underdeveloped countries remains a major concern due to a lack of viable treatment options.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "swedish, childhood, cancer, foundation, ad", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This ad created by the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation uses a powerful message to raise awareness.", "title": "Childhood Cancer Ad Delivers Powerful Message To Subway Riders [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/childhood-cancer-ad-swedish-subway-delivers-powerful-message-promote-awareness-306894", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/swedish-childhood-cancer-foundation.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This ad created by the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation uses a powerful message to raise awareness.", "title": "Childhood Cancer Ad Delivers Powerful Message To Subway Riders [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/childhood-cancer-ad-swedish-subway-delivers-powerful-message-promote-awareness-306894", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/swedish-childhood-cancer-foundation.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/swedish-childhood-cancer-foundation.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-13T14:25:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-13T14:25:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This ad created by the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation uses a powerful message to raise awareness."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd111e\"", "article_summary": "A subway billboard advertisement created by the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation (Barncancerfonden) is using a powerful message to help raise awareness regarding cancer diagnoses among children.\nUnfortunately, childhood cancer in underdeveloped countries remains a major concern due to a lack of viable treatment options.\nIn Apolosophy\u2019s ad, a young woman\u2019s hair is blown around her face every time a train passes.\nFollowing major treatment advances over the past few decades, childhood cancer survival rates after five years in developed countries have climbed to 80 percent compared to 60 percent in the mid-1970s.\nIn the United States, cancer is considered the second leading cause of death in children after accidents."}
