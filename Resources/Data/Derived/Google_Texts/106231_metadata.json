There are people from all parts of the district.\u201d\n\nThere are about 11,000 people in District 1, Hiller said.\n\nThe summit was sponsored by the Topeka Police Department, City Council District 1, the city\u2019s Department of Neighborhood Relations, Topeka Unified School District 501 and the Safe Streets crime prevention organization.\n\nHiller is hoping other neighborhoods get on board with the idea and host their own anti-crime summits. Topeka City Councilwoman Sylvia Ortiz, representative for City Council District 3, attended the summit, Hiller said, and other districts have shown interest.\n\nThe anti-crime summit didn\u2019t take place just to address crimes in District 1, Hiller said. The summit was a chance to educate people about driving crime out of neighborhoods and building neighborhood strength.\n\nAttendees were able to select from breakout sessions, including what happens when someone calls 911, what happens when a report is made, neighborhood strategies that work and community policing.\n\nAfter the breakout sessions, people were asked to get into small groups to discuss ideas. Each group had a resident facilitator, a note taker and a police officer, Hiller said. The ideas will be compiled and provided to TPD and the Department of Neighborhood Relations.\n\nElmer Garlock, who owns about 55 properties in District 1 through Key Associated Rental Management, received a flyer about the summit and decided to spend Saturday morning learning more about what he can do to help fight crime in neighborhoods where he as properties.\n\n\u201cI have apartments, duplexes and houses,\u201d Garlock said. \u201cI have 140 properties across Topeka. Nighttime crime is one of the biggest problems.\u201d\n\nGarlock said getting to know neighbors is important.\n\n\u201cI introduce myself to my neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cCall your neighbors. Get to know them. You can make your own (neighborhood watch) group \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to do. Just don\u2019t turn a blind eye.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Ann Marie Bush", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Topeka police vehicles lined the streets around Topeka High School on Saturday morning. \nInside the school at 800 S.W. 10th St.", "title": "Fighting crime focus of summit at Topeka High", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-06-20/fighting-crime-focus-summit-topeka-high", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/14494884.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Topeka police vehicles lined the streets around Topeka High School on Saturday morning.Inside the school at 800 S.W. 10th St., nearly 20 officers and 100 residents and business owners from City Council District 1 interacted and discussed the best ways to fight crime during the Strategic Anti-Crime District 1 Summit.Topics of discussion included crime statistics, how crimes get counted and crime reduction strategies."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cbd\"", "article_summary": "Topeka City Councilwoman Sylvia Ortiz, representative for City Council District 3, attended the summit, Hiller said, and other districts have shown interest.\nThe summit was sponsored by the Topeka Police Department, City Council District 1, the city\u2019s Department of Neighborhood Relations, Topeka Unified School District 501 and the Safe Streets crime prevention organization.\nTopeka police vehicles lined the streets around Topeka High School on Saturday morning.\n10th St., nearly 20 officers and 100 residents and business owners from City Council District 1 interacted and discussed the best ways to fight crime during the Strategic Anti-Crime District 1 Summit.\nThe summit was a chance to educate people about driving crime out of neighborhoods and building neighborhood strength."}
