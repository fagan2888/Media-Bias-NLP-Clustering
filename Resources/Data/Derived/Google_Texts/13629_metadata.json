In President Obama\u2019s recent State of the Union address, he proposed \u201cmyRA\u201d accounts, another plea for us to save more for retirement.\n\nSen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, believes that Americans are about $6.6 trillion short of funding a secure retirement. While numbers starting with a \u201cT\u201d are startling, the answer to solving a big money problem like retirement savings lies in solving a much smaller problem first: getting us to succeed at smaller goals.\n\nIn other words, if saving $500,000 or more for retirement seems unfathomable, start with saving $50 a month just to say you can do it, or $500 so you\u2019ll be able to replace an aging transmission.\n\nIt\u2019s a compelling reason for consumers to visit a local bank or credit union. Unfortunately, interest rates below 1 percent fail to excite anyone. But consumers wanting a more lucrative jolt can find $50 to $250 bonuses for opening a new account.\n\nThe bad news? They\u2019re usually for opening a checking account or a credit card, not savings. \u201cSavings accounts are not one of the more profitable products by banks,\u201d said George Barany, director of financial education at CFA. \u201cBanks can make more money on checking accounts and credit cards because there\u2019s a much higher likelihood of incurring a fee.\u201d\n\nIn fact seven of the nine bonuses of $50 to $250 in this month\u2019s post of top bank account promotions at Moneycrashers.com are for checking accounts. Only one of the incentives is for a savings plan \u2014 U.S. Bank\u2019s Savings Today and Rewards Tomorrow program, known as S.T.A.R.T.\n\nU.S. Bank customers who save $1,000 in S.T.A.R.T. earn a $50 Visa rewards card initially and an extra $50 when $1,000 or more is left in the account for one year. With the $100 reward, consumers are earning 10 percent annual interest, an excellent rate compared with going rates near 1 percent.\n\nSmall savers can take longer than a year to accumulate $1,000, but they need to maintain a balance of $1,000 or more for a year to get the second $50.\n\nBarany said that U.S. Bank is to be commended for its S.T.A.R.T. program, which has gotten more than 2 million customers saving since its introduction in 2010. \u201cHaving a savings incentive program is unusual,\u201d he said. \u201cBanks usually offer a slightly higher interest rate but no long-term sustained product.\u201d\n\nLast month, the program had more than $4 billion in savings, said Karen Johanning, the S.T.A.R.T. expert at U.S. Bank. On its Facebook page, the bank asked readers to post their own experiences of saving for something memorable. The more than 500 responses included vacations, a new roof and a new washer and dryer.\n\nHannah Hyatt of southern Illinois wrote: \u201cWe encouraged our daughter to open a savings account and she saved enough to buy herself a Diamondback mountain bike. She\u2019s 7, so I consider that quite an accomplishment!\u201d\n\nThe S.T.A.R.T. program, like almost any bank offering, is not without potential gotchas. It requires a checking account in tandem with the savings account. And there are monthly maintenance fees of $7 to $9 per month, unless an account holder has a combined account balance of $1,500 in savings and checking or direct deposits of $1,000 per month. While many adults might be able to meet the minimum, small savers would quickly lose money.\n\nBanks seldom offer good incentives on savings accounts because they aren\u2019t \u201csticky\u201d enough, said Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com in North Palm Beach, Fla. \u201cConsumers close savings accounts more often than checking accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cWith checking accounts they might add credit or debit cards and online bill pay, and that makes them less likely to flee to a competitor.\u201d\n\nBesides that, banks are swimming in deposits right now and loan demand is off. That means they don\u2019t need to pay incentives, McBride said.\n\nOther than U.S. Bank, I couldn\u2019t find any local banks or credit unions offering incentives of $50 or more for opening a savings account, but banks have found creative ways to get people to save.\n\nFor example, Wells Fargo and other banks offer a form of \u201cforced\u201d savings, including automatic monthly transfers from their checking to savings accounts. The consumer may also be able to authorize the bank to take out an additional $1 for each debit card purchase, online bill pay or automatic payment and transfer it to their savings account. At Wells Fargo the automatic savings option, called Save As You Go, waives the $5 monthly service fee, spokeswoman Peggy Gunn said.\n\nAn extra dollar here and there may not provide the rush that an extra $100 might, but Minneapolis resident Nathan Dungan, founder of Sharesavespend.com, said it works. \u201cPeople quickly get comfortable with these auto deductions,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many times do we swipe a debit card in a day? It\u2019s almost like getting free money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Many Americans know they don&rsquo;t save enough.", "title": "Need an incentive to save?
