President Obama\u2019s announcement that the new health care plan had enrolled 7.1 million Americans coincided with the release by Representative Paul D. Ryan of a new Republican budget that proposes changes in Medicare and deep cuts in spending.\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to say a political turnaround is at hand, but for the first time this election year, Democrats are evincing some confidence that they have at least stanched the bleeding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing. If you\u2019ve been around awhile, and I\u2019ve been around awhile, you can sense it,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn away seven or 10 million people from insurance coverage \u2014 doesn\u2019t work anymore. And then comes Ryan. Thank you, thank you Congressman Paul Ryan, for reminding us what Republicans would do if they had control.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 newfound confidence may well be premature. Historically, a president\u2019s approval ratings are the primary determinant of his party\u2019s performance in a midterm election. On average, presidents below a 50 percent approval rating have lost an average of almost 40 House seats in midterms. And President Obama\u2019s ratings, seemingly mired in the low to mid-40s, may prove to be more tied to an economy that most Americans say is still in recession than to the health care law that may have turned a corner.\n\n\u201cEven though the Democrats are trying to take some victory lap, it\u2019s very short term,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. \u201cThe bad news continues. The hits keep coming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for the first time in a while, Democrats this week found themselves talking up a contrast between their agenda \u2014 protecting the newly insured, raising the minimum wage and renewing unemployment benefits \u2014 and a Republican plan that would cut health care and education spending deeply, and move Medicare toward private insurance.\n\n\u201cThe choice is very stark,\u201d Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader and Democrat of Nevada, said Wednesday on the Capitol steps, flanked by more than 30 Democratic senators in a campaign-style rally. \u201cThe American people are watching.\u201d\n\nAnd Republicans found themselves in a new position: on the defensive, justifying a budget that has already proven to be a political loser (\u201cWhat\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 plan?\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio asked Wednesday) and trying to explain what would happen to more than 10 million people who have signed up for insurance through the president\u2019s health care law via a private plan or Medicaid and would be left at sea with its repeal.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe president can go out there and tout all the people he\u2019s signed up, but how about the young man I talked to last week out in California whose premiums have doubled? His co-pay and deductibles tripled, and his wife\u2019s hours got cut to 29 hours,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cMy insurance premiums nearly doubled. My co-pays and deductibles tripled under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats, this spring at least should be a respite. With the closing on Tuesday of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first open enrollment period, nothing much will happen to the law until after the election \u2014 when the next enrollment period begins and employer-mandated coverage begins.\n\nOn the plus side, the president\u2019s announcement that 7.1 million Americans had signed up for private health policies through the law\u2019s exchange is likely to prove understated. Once totals are tabulated to include new Medicaid enrollees, people who signed up for new federally protected policies through private insurance brokers, and young adults who have stayed on their parents\u2019 policies because of the law, the figure is likely to be at least double that.\n\nMoreover, the Ryan budget, which was approved by the House Budget Committee on Wednesday night along party lines, will present the Democrats a chance to expand the political conversation beyond health care, to more Democrat-friendly subjects like Medicare, Social Security, education funding and health research. The tax-and-spending plan once again proposes to convert Medicare into a \u201cpremium support\u201d system in which older people would be given subsidies to purchase private insurance \u2014 a proposal that Democrats ran on successfully in 2012.\n\nIt cuts Medicaid by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, food stamps by $125 billion, education programs by $145 billion \u2014 including Pell grants \u2014 and makes university students begin paying interest on student loans while still in college. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, forecast that 57 percent of the people who vote will be over 50 this November, compared with 43 percent in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe ability to drive our advantage on Medicare will be invaluable,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublicans, for now, are not that worried. Their core voters remain more energized that the Democratic base, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, and are likely to remain vehemently opposed to the health care law, regardless of the enrollment numbers.\n\n\u201cThe health care law has always been characterized by stronger Republican opposition than Democratic support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that Democratic support for the law could increase, but fundamentally changing opinion of the law will be difficult in the short term.\u201d\n\nBut some Republican members of Congress are showing a newfound willingness to negotiate changes in the law rather than demand its repeal.\n\nLast month, Representatives John Carney, Democrat of Delaware, and Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius requesting minor changes to Healthcare.gov to ease enrollment. Of the 75 signatories, 18 were Republicans, including hard-core opponents of the law like Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Rob Woodall of Georgia, Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Mark Meadows of North Carolina. That was a marked contrast from the position most Republicans once took, which was to do nothing to help constituents find insurance through the law.\n\n\u201cThe law\u2019s real. It\u2019s there,\u201d said Representative Reid Ribble, Republican of Wisconsin and a signer of the letter. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a recognition that the law\u2019s in place, and if our constituents are going to be penalized for it, the federal government ought to make it work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140402204857, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats are talking
