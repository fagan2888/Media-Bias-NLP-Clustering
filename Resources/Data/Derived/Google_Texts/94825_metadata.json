According to 20-year-old Jasmine Tridevil, it\u2019s surgically implanting a third breast in the middle of your chest. The massage therapist explains that she underwent the extreme body alteration as a way to deter attention, but the extra appendage has clearly done the exact opposite and helped Tridevil quickly become an Internet sensation.\n\nAs one would expect, getting a doctor to purposely implant a third breast in a woman isn\u2019t easy. \u201cIt was really hard finding someone who would do it because it would be breaking their code of ethics,\u201d explained Tridevil in an interview with The News Junkie radio show in Orlando. The Florida native talked of how she had to approach \u201c50 or 60 doctors,\u201d before one actually agreed to perform the $20,0000 operation. However, after living with her third breast for about a year, Tridevil has no regrets.\n\nIn her opinion, the third breast looks nearly identical to her two natural breasts except for one minor difference: \u201cIn the middle one, the areola looks a little different. \u2026 They put a mini implant to look like a nipple sticking out and I got a tattoo for the areola.\u201d\n\nJasmine had to approach between 40 and 50 doctors before one agreed to perform the surgery.

Still, a second benefit of the third breast is that the added attraction will bring the young Floridian one step closer to her dream of reality TV stardom. Tridevil has gone as far as hiring a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes of her story being picked up by MTV.\n\nJasmine spent $20,000 to realize her dream of having three breasts.

Still, we wonder, why?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jasmine, tridevil, reportedly, spent, 20000, have, third, breast, surgically, implanted, wanted", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Jasmine Tridevil had a third breast implanted to deter unwanted male attention, but the new body part ended up making her an Internet sensation.", "title": "Woman Allegedly Spent $20,000 On Surgery To Get A 3rd Boob [PHOTOS AND VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jasmine-tridevil-reportedly-spent-20000-have-third-breast-surgically-implanted-wanted-make-304372", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/jasmine-2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jasmine Tridevil had a third breast implanted to deter unwanted male attention, but the new body part ended up making her an Internet sensation.", "title": "Woman Allegedly Spent $20,000 On Surgery To Get A 3rd Boob [PHOTOS AND VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jasmine-tridevil-reportedly-spent-20000-have-third-breast-surgically-implanted-wanted-make-304372", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/jasmine-2.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/22/jasmine-2.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-22T17:04:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T14:59:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jasmine Tridevil had a third breast implanted to deter unwanted male attention, but the new body part ended up making her an Internet sensation."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ae5\"", "article_summary": "According to 20-year-old Jasmine Tridevil, it\u2019s surgically implanting a third breast in the middle of your chest.\nAs one would expect, getting a doctor to purposely implant a third breast in a woman isn\u2019t easy.\nHowever, after living with her third breast for about a year, Tridevil has no regrets.\nWhat\u2019s the best way for a woman to deter unwanted male attention?\nThe Florida native talked of how she had to approach \u201c50 or 60 doctors,\u201d before one actually agreed to perform the $20,0000 operation."}
