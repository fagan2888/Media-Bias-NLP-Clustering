Shrapnel killed Igor Debrin, a 25-year-old National Guard soldier.\n\nAvakov said 122 people were hospitalized, including two French TV journalists, and 11 people were in \u201cvery critical condition.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s protests were over a constitutional amendment, which grants separatist-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine more autonomy. The measure passed a preliminary vote amid a tumultuous parliamentary session Monday.\n\nMore than 30 protesters were arrested, Avakov said, including the attacker, identified as Igor Gumenyuk. Avakov said Gumenyuk is a member of the nationalist Svoboda Party and was caught carrying several grenades. He was also a volunteer fighter for the Svoboda Party\u2019s Sich Battalion and was on leave from the warzone in east Ukraine\u2014set to return to the front within days.\n\nIn a televised national address Monday evening, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko blamed nationalist groups involved in Monday\u2019s protests, which included the Svoboda Party and Right Sector, for the violence.\n\n\u201cIt was an anti-Ukrainian protest, for which all of its organizers, without exception, all representatives of political forces must be held strictly liable,\u201d Poroshenko said.\n\nBoth the Svoboda Party and Right Sector also have paramilitary arms, which have fought in the Ukraine war. Monday\u2019s violence will likely escalate an increasingly volatile relationship between Kyiv and volunteer groups that have played a key role in Ukraine\u2019s war effort.\n\nThe current cease-fire\u2014known as \u201cMinsk II\u201d\u2014calls for Kyiv to grant separatist-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine more autonomy by the end of the year. Poroshenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as German and French leaders approved the deal, which was signed in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Feb. 12, 2015.\n\nPushback\n\nMany in Ukraine oppose decentralization and other concessions to the combined Russian-separatist forces. Opponents claim it is a capitulation to Russia, which has supported the separatist territories with weapons and troops, and nullifies the sacrifices suffered by the Ukrainian military after more than a year of war.\n\n\u201cThey say that we should negotiate, but in my humble opinion, as a citizen, negotiating with Russia is the same as negotiating with an alligator,\u201d said Julia Minaeva, 26, a university assistant professor in Kyiv and a volunteer who collects supplies for Ukrainian troops in the war zone.\n\n\u201cMany soldiers feel betrayed by the state,\u201d said Marina Komarova, a 33-year-old volunteer from Crimea who has been collecting and delivering supplies to Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines for more than a year.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s much worse than betrayal,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s like spitting on the graves of our soldiers.\u201d\n\nThe U.S., however, has openly backed Kyiv granting the separatist territories\u2014the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic\u2014more autonomy, calling the move a necessary step for peace. After a trip to Kyiv in July, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland endorsed the decentralization measure.\n\n\u201cMy country is a country that is very decentralized, as you know,\u201d Nuland said July 15. \u201cAnd we believe that people at the community level know best what is right for their people. That when government is close to citizens it is strongest.\u201d\n\nNuland added: \u201cIt will also bring Ukraine into compliance with its Minsk obligations with regard to decentralization and special status. And that is very, very important.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s decentralization vote comes one day before a fresh truce is set to go in effect in eastern Ukraine. On Aug. 26, the trilateral contact group\u2014a group comprising representatives from Ukraine, Russia and the separatist territories, under OSCE oversight\u2014agreed on a full cease-fire to go in effect on Sept. 1, to coincide with Ukrainian students returning to school.\n\nCatch-22\n\nMonday\u2019s deadly protests reflect Kyiv\u2019s unwinnable pickle\u2014securing a domestically acceptable outcome in the war balanced against the need to move forward on post-revolution reforms.\n\nThe war has consumed most of the political oxygen in Ukraine, and there is a growing sense of national frustration due to the lethargic pace of anti-corruption and pro-democracy reforms for which the 2014 revolution was launched.\n\nIn a Pew Research Center poll published June 10, 32 percent of Ukrainian respondents said the Kyiv government was having a positive impact\u2014a 15 percent drop in one year\u2014and 59 percent of respondents said the central government was negatively affecting the country.\n\nThere is also a growing sense of national frustration with Kyiv\u2019s prosecution of the war effort. Many civilians and soldiers say that Ukrainian troops have had to weather combined Russian-separatist heavy weapons attacks for months without adequate means to protect themselves due to terms of the Feb. 12 cease-fire.\n\n\u201cThey soldiers are demoralized because they\u2019re not getting what they need,\u201d Komarova said. \u201cThey are demoralized because they are not allowed to respond to the fire; they can\u2019t shoot back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the shelling is an hour or two hours long, and the commanders actually fire back with the artillery they are not allowed to have they are punished for breaking the Minsk agreement,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to attack or defend themselves.\u201d\n\nProtests have slowly ratcheted up nationwide due to growing frustration with the war. In the frontline city of Mariupol, residents are skeptical over a pullback of volunteer battalions from the front lines and a proposal to demilitarize the town of Shyrokyne, over which Ukrainian troops and combined Russian-separatist forces have fought for more than six months.\n\nThe war has also battered Ukraine\u2019s economy, sending the country\u2019s currency, the Hryvnia, into freefall, sparking inflation and deterring foreign investment. Therefore, Kyiv is hard pressed to take measures to end the war, including domestically unpopular ones pushed by the West such as decentralization. Yet, the very measures necessary to end the war have also spurred a domestic backlash, as Monday\u2019s protests demonstrate.\n\n\u201cLosing the war is not even an option,\u201d Komarova said. \u201cMany soldiers have died for this victory. Their sacrifice won\u2019t be useless.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protests outside Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Monday left one Ukrainian National Guard soldier dead and over 100 law enforcement personnel and civilians injured.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Protests outside Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Monday left one Ukrainian National Guard soldier dead and over 100 law enforcement personnel and civilians injured.", "title": "Ukraine: Anti-Autonomy Protests Turn Deadly", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150831_Protests_Nolan.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-01T13:26:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1N5EIve"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Protests outside Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Monday left one Ukrainian National Guard soldier dead and over 100 law enforcement personnel and civilians injured.", "title": "Ukraine: Anti-Autonomy Protests Turn Deadly", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150831_Protests_Nolan.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-09-01T11:31:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-01T13:26:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, Protests, Decentralization, Rada"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7ab\"", "article_summary": "Both the Svoboda Party and Right Sector also have paramilitary arms, which have fought in the Ukraine war.\nKYIV, Ukraine\u2014One Ukrainian National Guard soldier died and more than 100 law enforcement personnel and civilians were injured, several critically, after violent protests erupted outside Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Monday.\nCatch-22Monday\u2019s deadly protests reflect Kyiv\u2019s unwinnable pickle\u2014securing a domestically acceptable outcome in the war balanced against the need to move forward on post-revolution reforms.\nYet, the very measures necessary to end the war have also spurred a domestic backlash, as Monday\u2019s protests demonstrate.\nPushbackMany in Ukraine oppose decentralization and other concessions to the combined Russian-separatist forces."}
