He\u2019s a polarizing celebrity who doesn\u2019t play by any of the rules of politics, and so you don\u2019t want someone like that in the Oval Office to begin with.\u201d\n\nConway, who previously backed Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s (R., Texas) bid, said she was never part of the #NeverTrump movement in explaining her current support.\n\n\u201cFor two decades-plus, my job has been to listen to voters,\u201d Conway. \u201cI think they\u2019ve spoken very loudly and clearly here, and I don\u2019t know who I am to rebuff the will of over 10 million people who have voted for this man in the primaries \u2026 I look at the two parties right now. You\u2019ve got Hillary Clinton, for whom the field was completely cleared, and she just can\u2019t vanquish Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nConway said she had \u201cswallowed hard\u201d on a lot of candidates before like Mitt Romney, who she said took Obamacare off the table as a political issue against the White House in 2012 because of Romneycare being the blueprint for the federal health care law.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party, the voters have spoken,\u201d Kornacki said. \u201cThis is the guy they\u2019ve chosen. Doesn\u2019t that tell you something about where the Republican Party is?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not where I am,\u201d Continetti said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, and people can for who they want, and the party\u2019s going to nominate Donald Trump. But I think there\u2019s a large number of people who are conservatives or who have voted for Republican candidates in the past, who just won\u2019t be able to bring themselves to vote for Trump in the fall. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re going to support Hillary.\u201d\n\nContinetti also mentioned Romney and said in 2012 that there were policy differences with Republicans about him, but they eventually concluded he had the best chance to defeat President Obama.\n\n\u201cHe lost horribly, Matthew,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThey lost eight of nine swing states. He lost all four states where he has a home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think Trump is going to do any better?\u201d Continetti asked.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see, but that\u2019s the point here, isn\u2019t it? We know what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said.\n\nContinetti responded that pro-Trump Republicans thought winning above all mattered, but he said it also mattered who wins.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t want Donald Trump in the Oval Office,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risks are too great, and also, kind of the damage to American democracy, constitutional norms, God help us, the state of the world, our financial system \u2026 By the way, that\u2019s why Trump will lose. Forget about making inroads into the Obama coalition. He\u2019ll never do that. The problem is there are a lot of Republican leaners \u2026 white men, white women, who just aren\u2019t going to pull the lever for him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti discussed his opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy Monday on MSNBC.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Washington Free Beacon\u00a0editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti discussed his opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy Monday on MSNBC and got into an exchange with Trump-supporting GOP pollster Kellyanne Co", "title": "Continetti, GOP Pollster Debate Trump\u2019s Merit for Office, Electabitility", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/continetti-gop-pollster-debate-trumps-merit-office-electabitility/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "description": "Washington Free Beacon\u00a0editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti discussed his opposition to Donald Trump'", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Continetti, GOP Pollster Debate Trump\u2019s Merit for Office, Electabitility"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat\u2019s keeping me from supporting him is Donald Trump,\u201d Continetti said.\nHe lost all four states where he has a home.\u201d\u201cYou think Trump is going to do any better?\u201d Continetti asked.\n\u201cDonald Trump is like a piece of reality TV that detached itself from the networks and implanted itself in the Republican Party,\u201d Continetti said.\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t want Donald Trump in the Oval Office,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, and people can for who they want, and the party\u2019s going to nominate Donald Trump."}
