But she's also fresh from wrapping a month's worth of dates on Katy Perry's PRISMatic Tour, as Billboard previewed in a May cover story, and ready to focus on her upcoming second album.\n\n\"I had such a blast on the PRISMatic tour, it was insanity,\" Musgraves told Billboard backstage at iHeartRadio, shortly after wrapping her 20-minute set. \"It was so fun and everyone was so welcoming to the crew, Katy and her whole team. It was cool to see country music collide with what Katy does and I think it really worked.\"\n\niHeartRadio Festival's 5 Best Performances\n\nAnd amid all the traveling and rehearsals throughout the Midwest and Canada, Musgraves was happy to report logging some girl-time. \"Katy took us all to a water park at one point, I went roller skating for my birthday, and she just hung out with us. It was a great time.\"\n\nMusgraves heads back out on the road later this week to play a handful of headline dates in support of her Grammy-winning debut Same Trailer, Different Park, but she's also eager to get back to work on its highly-anticipated follow-up. She's already been road-testing several new songs on tour, including early fan favorite \"Biscuits,\" which features plenty of her now-trademark country wit (\"Sow your own oats / Raise your own babies / Mind your own biscuits / And life will be gravy.\")\n\nMight \"Biscuits\" end up on her next project? \"I love that song so much. I don\u2019t wanna make any promises to myself before the whole thing takes shape because anything could change. But I do love that song and I do have a few that I\u2019m really excited about. When I have some time to really sit and focus on writing, then I\u2019ll add some more to the basket. And hopefully I\u2019ll have something I really like there.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Kacey Musgraves caught up with Billboard.com backstage at iHeartRadio Fest to talk about touring, new music and roller skating with Katy Perry.", "title": "Kacey Musgraves Talks Hanging With Katy Perry, New Music At iHeartRadio Fest", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6259096/kacey-musgraves-talks-hanging-with-katy-perry-new-music-at", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/kacey-musgraves-iheartradio-fest-2014-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kacey Musgraves caught up with Billboard.com backstage at iHeartRadio Fest to talk about touring, new music and roller skating with Katy Perry.", "title": "Kacey Musgraves Talks Hanging With Katy Perry, New Music At iHeartRadio Fest", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6259096/kacey-musgraves-talks-hanging-with-katy-perry-new-music-at", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/kacey-musgraves-iheartradio-fest-2014-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Kacey Musgraves caught up with Billboard.com backstage at iHeartRadio Fest to talk about touring, new music and roller skating with Katy Perry.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Kacey Musgraves Talks Hanging With Katy Perry, New Music At iHeartRadio Fest | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb35c\"", "article_summary": "\"I had such a blast on the PRISMatic tour, it was insanity,\" Musgraves told Billboard backstage at iHeartRadio, shortly after wrapping her 20-minute set.\nIt was cool to see country music collide with what Katy does and I think it really worked.\"\niHeartRadio Festival's 5 Best PerformancesAnd amid all the traveling and rehearsals throughout the Midwest and Canada, Musgraves was happy to report logging some girl-time.\nBut she's also fresh from wrapping a month's worth of dates on Katy Perry's PRISMatic Tour, as Billboard previewed in a May cover story, and ready to focus on her upcoming second album.\n\"It was so fun and everyone was so welcoming to the crew, Katy and her whole team."}
