I am not referring to Israel\u2019s birth in 1948, significant as that event was. I mean instead that a vibrant, successful, and above all else, secure life has, for the first time ever, become possible in states in which Jews are, and always will be, in the minority. \u201cIn the diaspora,\u201d proclaimed the Economist in the summer of 2012, \u201cJewish life has never been so free, so prosperous, so unthreatened.\u201d That Jews can live among gentiles without living in fear is an epochal accomplish\u00adment, as much testimony to the perseverance of those who have made the Diaspora their home as it is to the willingness of their compatri\u00adots to overcome centuries of prejudice. Most remarkable of all, it is rarely remarked. Of course, that the Jews should live with freedom and equality, most, if alas not all, of their fellow citizens in this day and age would be the first to acknowledge, failing to appreciate how radical and unsettling their grandparents would have found such a sentiment.\n\nIt is time for the Diaspora to have its due. Living at the mercy of the majorities around them throughout history, Jews have experienced more than their fair share of discrimination and destruction, the latter as thorough and unwarranted as any group has ever faced. Nor can there be any doubt that anti-Semitism persists throughout the con\u00adtemporary world and rears its ugly head all too many times. Yet lost in the tales of endless woe that Jews so frequently tell each other has been the opportunity that living in a land not their own has offered: a deep understanding of unfairness and a commitment to the abso\u00adlute necessity of fighting against it. \u201cExile and dispersion,\u201d as David J. Goldberg, rabbi emeritus of London\u2019s Liberal Jewish Synagogue, writes of the Jews, \u201cfar from being the disasters they were invariably considered to be were in fact blessings in disguise, enabling them to escape the fate that befell other contemporary nations rooted in a single territory.\u201d (In England, Liberal Judaism, to the left of Ameri\u00adcan Reform, is \u201ca kind of Jewish Unitarianism,\u201d as the historian Todd Endelman characterizes it.) Now that they have become so much safer in non-Jewish lands, Diaspora Jews are in a stronger-than-ever position to transform the passion for justice that so moved the He\u00adbrew prophets into ideals of human dignity desperately needed in an age of rising domestic inequality and overseas instability. This, un\u00adfortunately, has not been happening, at least not enough. The Jewish Defense League is a violence-prone organization rightly condemned by Jews around the world. But defensiveness is widespread among all those Diaspora Jews who remain reluctant to accept the fact that at long last they belong where they have long chosen to live.\n\nIt is not difficult to grasp why contemporary Jews have failed to appreciate the blessings that exile has conveyed to them. For the past seventy-plus years\u2014the same years in which I, born in 1942, have been alive\u2014Jewish life has been marked by the shift, in the course of a mere decade, from the horrors of the Holocaust to the haven offered by statehood. Both events are therefore inevitably linked, and not just because Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Memorial Day) occurs just a week before Yom Ha\u2019atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day). It is often said that there exists within Judaism a tension between particularism and universalism, one of those dichotomies that on the one hand dramatically oversimplifies but on the other contains a great deal of truth: particularists believe that Jews should be primarily concerned with their own, while universalists insist they are under a special obliga\u00adtion to spread the light of reason to as many people as possible. The twin events that have dominated contemporary Jewish life created an environment especially conducive to particularism: the Holocaust, after all, singled out Jews for extermination, while Israel singled them out for expansion. Statehood promised a final solution to the Final Solution: now that they had achieved it, Jews would finally constitute a nation like the others, able to speak in its own name and defend its own interests.\n\nFinality, alas, was not to be. Because it was built on land occupied by others, the Jewish state has been unable to satisfy the need for se\u00adcurity that gave rise to it. Nor, despite a dynamic economy and numer\u00adous efforts at outreach, has it been able to appeal to all Jews: roughly half of world Jewry has made aliyah (ascent), the Hebrew word that characterizes the decision to leave the Diaspora for Israel. (Worse than that, at least for those who consider Israel the only appropriate home for the Jews, a significant number of Israelis in recent years have made yeridah, or descent into the gentile world.) As it increasingly becomes clear that the Diaspora is not a disaster and that the security offered by statehood has proven to be precarious, the lost universalism that has been so much a part of Jewish tradition may well be prepared for a comeback, and this time on firmer ground than in the past. This will be good for the Jews no matter where they live, Israel very much included. It will be just as important for the non-Jews with whom they live, Israel, again, very much included.\n\nII\n\nAs important as it may be to achieve, no one should expect that a revival of diasporic universalism will prove easy. There are four in\u00adtimately interconnected reasons why so many Jews are determined never to forget the events of the 1930s and 1940s, no matter the cost to the universalist element in their own tradition.\n\nThe first is the feeling, strongly believed if rarely explicitly stated, that honoring the living somehow insults the dead. Six million Jews, from this perspective, did not die so that another six million could lead the good life in New York, Toronto, London, or, God forbid, Berlin. Since Hitler was determined to kill each and every one of them, any Jew who is now alive must be so through sheer chance: by the decision of one\u2019s grandparents to leave Europe before it all began, for example, or by the fact that they boarded one train rather than another, or because they had the right connections to obtain an ever-elusive exit visa. When survival is the result of individual fortitude, pride in lon\u00adgevity follows. When it is a roll of the dice that determines who shall live, the winners ought to have the good sense not to brag. Every living Jew must understand that he or she is taking the place of another who never had the opportunity. Guilt that pervasive is not easily overcome. More important, at least to those who think this way, it should never be overcome. Best keep satisfaction with one\u2019s diasporic experience muted lest the ghosts of the Shoah\u2019s victims be stirred.\n\nThe never fully quarantined disease of anti-Semitism is commonly brought forward as the second reason for Jews never to succumb to any illusion of security the Diaspora seemingly offers. Hitler aimed to settle the Jewish question once and for all and, although not in the way he expected, he did; because of what he believed and managed to carry out, Jews must keep their mental suitcases constantly packed. Waiting for the next Hitler to appear requires that instances of Jew hatred, as if they had become part of a secular liturgy, be told and retold with increasing fervor. How, this responsive reading asks, can any Jew be safe in Paris when Jewish children are killed in Toulouse? British Jews can and do attend Oxford and Cambridge, but anti-Semitism in that country, now polite and respectable rather than cruel and arbitrary, is, it has been charged, as pernicious as ever. It is only a matter of time before societies long known for their record of anti-Semitism, espe\u00adcially those in Eastern Europe such as Hungary, Ukraine, and Russia, return to their pattern of hating the Jews, paradoxically made all that much easier because so few of them live there now. America\u2019s Jews may have it better than those in Europe, but let an economic crisis linger, and criticisms of Wall Street, which the knowing inform us are actually attacks on the Jews, will come from the angry left rather than from the nativist right. And above all else, there are the Islamic militants, whether they live in the Middle East or in the West, who, as a number of rather fervid writers cannot help but point out, have inherited the hideous Nazi obsession with the Jews and are unafraid to act upon it. Jews can never bring Hitler\u2019s victims back to life. But, the conclusion follows, they can at least avoid the mistaken optimism that condemned so many to death. Because so many were killed, ev\u00aderyone else must be wary.\n\nLove for everything Israel has accomplished since its founding, third, keeps Jews in a particularist frame of mind. For those who view it as the last refuge against hatred, Israel has everything Dias\u00adpora Jewry lacks. In contrast to a long tradition of subservient court Jewry more accustomed to exercising flattery rather than power, its military makes it the dominant state in the Middle East. It is home to Jews of every conceivable variety. Because of the protection it con\u00adtinues to offer to Jews who remain vulnerable in Eastern European or in Arab lands, it is still the natural destination for those unwelcome in the countries in which they live. For the most religious, it is too secular and for the secular it is too religious. But its very existence demonstrates to the world that, because they have a state of their own, Jews can never again be treated as a people undeserving of the respect of others. Of course Israel needs the Diaspora, for without the support of American Jews especially, it would have too few friends in the world. Yet for all that, the notion persists that Diaspora Jews, cut off from the language, traditions, and sense of solidarity that nation\u00adhood offers, are being unfaithful to their Jewishness. Israel\u2019s strength and Jewish survival, many believe, have become one and the same.
