General manager Dave Caldwell says they arrived Thursday and took physicals Friday. But Caldwell says they could interview elsewhere before making a decision.\n\n\n\nBernadeau, a seventh-round pick by the Panthers in 2008, has started 49 games in eight seasons. He started all 16 games for the Cowboys in 2012 and 11 in 2013, but has been a backup since. The 30-year-old Bernadeau is expected to play behind interior linemen Brandon Linder, A.J. Cann and Tyler Shatley.\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
