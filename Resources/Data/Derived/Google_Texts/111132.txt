The first female judge in the district, Post is also one of the longest-serving judges in the district's history.

She started as an assistant district attorney and later became a special district judge before she was elected to her current position in 1994.

"Growing up in a family of modest means, becoming a judge was a big dream for a little girl in rural Oklahoma," Post said in a statement. "I appreciate having had the opportunity to serve the people in this district."

During the past several years, Post started programs to help children within the court system, such as Tri-County CASA, and Helping Children Cope with Divorce. Additionally, she helped establish adult Drug Courts across the district and started a juvenile drug court in Rogers County.

Post serves on the Juvenile Judges Oversight and Advisory Committee to the Supreme Court.

She is the current chairwoman of a statewide foster care review board.

In recent years, Post was honored as OK CASA's Judge of the Year and was given the Community Advocate award by Rogers County Youth Services.
