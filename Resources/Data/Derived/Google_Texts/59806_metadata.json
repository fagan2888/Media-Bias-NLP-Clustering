Upon taking over the company in 2002, Iwata breathed life back into the company: Nintendo was able to report substantial growth for the next 15 years, according to NBC News.\n\nThe decline of Nintendo until Iwata\u2019s tenure as president was attributed partly to the company\u2019s resistance to technological advancements in gaming as a whole. Part of the company\u2019s explosion after he became the president can be attributed to Iwata\u2019s creation of both the Wii gaming system and the Nintendo DS.\n\nSatoru Iwata underwent a surgery to remove the cancer in June, 2014, after which his doctors reported that the prognosis was good as they had been able to catch and remove the growth on his bile duct early.\n\nIwata had regularly been attending meetings with shareholders and company staff as recently as May of this year. At that time, Iwata held a news conference to review the 2014 financial report and indicated that the company had resumed making a profit for the first time in three years.\n\nThe death of the man who called himself a \u201cgamer at heart\u201d hit the gaming community hard. Twitter exploded with heartfelt tributes to Iwata from all over the world.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost a legend. #RIP #SatoruIwata pic.twitter.com/m6yPg6Lozq \u2014 TigerDirect (@TigerDirect) July 13, 2015\n\nThe sad news of Iwata\u2019s death was made a bit brighter when a rainbow appeared over the company\u2019s headquarters two days after he died.\n\nA rainbow appeared over Nintendo\u2019s headquarters in Japan a day after the announcement of Satoru Iwata\u2019s death. pic.twitter.com/YiovIDSlRB \u2014 Gaming Humor & News (@VGFGamers) July 13, 2015\n\nThe entire quote made by Iwata sums up his views on his life and the gaming niche as a whole. \u201cOn my business card, I am a corporate president,\u201d he said in a speech to thousands of attendees of the Game Developers Conference in San Jose, California, in 2005, just three years after he\u2019d become the head of Nintendo.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I am a game developer. In my heart I am a gamer.\u201d\n\n[Photo via Handout / Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo Co., has died from a bile duct growth at just 55-years-old.
