O'Neill had been a waiter at the time.\n\n\"Michael was swept into Stuart's world,\" Ms Shann told Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth.\n\nFor 16 years the couple had been involved in a loving but deeply imbalanced relationship where Stuart liked to be in control and O'Neill liked to be controlled.\n\nMs Shann said O'Neill was suddenly mixing with the high society of Melbourne among Mr Rattle's wealthy clients.\n\nBut O'Neill was not treated as an equal by Mr Rattle, more like an assistant.\n\nThe defence barrister said everything revolved around Mr Rattle, and O'Neill never revealed to even his closest friends any vulnerability, weakness or feelings of not being able to cope.\n\nO'Neill was one half of the \"perfect couple\" and the couple's image and brand were important to both of them.\n\nMs Shann said the pair had been good-looking, mixed with a social clique from the art world and enjoyed a first-class lifestyle but there was \"a lot of smoke and mirrors to this world\".\n\nSex was an area of ongoing difficulty and shame for O'Neill as the interior designer was very demanding sexually, the defence barrister claimed.\n\nMr Rattle would regularly demean and belittle O'Neill in public, saying he wasn't getting enough sex and was planning to send him back to where he came from.\n\nO'Neill was constantly in fear of losing Mr Rattle, who was the anchor to his life.\n\nMs Shann said the couple had been spending $600,000 to $700,000 a year on a decadent lifestyle, more than double what they were making, and both were to blame for the business being in trouble.\n\nThe pre-sentence hearing continues.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Victoria", "application-name": "The Age", "og": {"site_name": "The Age", "description": "The man who murdered his partner of 16 years, well-known interior&nbsp;designer Stuart Rattle, was a pathological liar known as &quot;The Talented&nbsp;Mr Ripley&quot;, a court has heard.
