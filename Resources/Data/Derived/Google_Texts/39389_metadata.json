He chose the latter \u2014 and it cost him dearly.\n\nLiberalism, as an ideology, insists that government can do good and great things for the people and the world, if the people running the government are smart liberals.\n\nThe Democratic Party says the exact same thing. But liberalism is an ideal, while the Democratic Party is that ideal\u2019s representative here in the real world, and in the real world political parties disappoint.\n\nJust to be clear \u2014 and to avoid a lot of \u201cOh, yeah? What about Republicans?!\u201d responses \u2014 this is true of the GOP, too. Conservative ideology holds that government should only do those things that only government can and should do, and that list is very short.\n\nFor instance, government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of playing favorites in the economy. It shouldn\u2019t \u201cpick winners and losers.\u201d Rather, it should be a fair umpire and let competition work its magic.\n\nAlas, Republican politicians routinely fall short of this ideal, preferring to be pro-business rather than pro-market. That, in so many words, is why the Export-Import Bank is immortal.\n\nBut this was supposed to be liberalism\u2019s moment. This was supposed to be a new Progressive Era.\n\nObama came into office vowing to be \u201ctransformative\u201d just like Ronald Reagan. The difference being that Reagan ushered in an era of skepticism about government, and Obama wanted to usher in an era of hope and idealism about all the wonderful things government can do.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s mind this put him at odds with Republicans. And in a partisan sense it obviously did.\n\nBut as a matter of policy, Obama\u2019s real challenge came from within. Government\u2019s failures in recent years can\u2019t be laid at the feet of the Republican Party but at the feet of the Democratic Party.\n\nAsk most serious liberal policy wonks how they\u2019d make government more effective, and a good number of their answers would involve doing things the Democratic base would never, ever allow.\n\nSmart liberalism has no love for bureaucratic inefficiencies. There\u2019s nothing inherent to liberalism that says public-sector unions should have a stranglehold on the government payroll the way they do. FDR loathed the idea of government workers unionizing.\n\nThe biggest threat to job security at most federal agencies is death. Incompetence, negligence and redundancy are rarely seen as cause for termination.\n\nIn 2010, the dismissal rate for 168,000 federal workers in the Washington, DC, area was .26 percent. That\u2019s point-two-six, not 26 percent or 2.6 percent.\n\nLocal governments are little better. Short of murder or pedophilia, there\u2019s almost nothing a tenured public-school teacher can do that will get him or her summarily fired. Read all the Keynes, Schlesinger, Lippmann, Galbraith you can. You\u2019ll find nothing in there that even hints this is the way things ought to be.\n\nIf Obama wanted to restore faith in government, he\u2019d have pushed for mercilessly firing bad government workers and ending stupid programs. He paid a little lip service to such things, but his priorities were all in the other direction.\n\nThat is because he had to dance with the girl that brung him.\n\nThe Democratic Party isn\u2019t simply the party of government, it\u2019s the party for government. That\u2019s why his stimulus package was top-heavy with bailouts for federal programs, state governments and public-sector workers.\n\nWhen he finally learned that there are no such things as \u201cshovel ready jobs,\u201d it should\u2019ve prompted him to ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201d The answer would\u2019ve led him to reforms that undoubtedly would have helped the American people \u2014 and the cause of liberalism! \u2014 but hurt his own base in the Democratic Party.\n\nOn Obama\u2019s watch, we\u2019ve seen horrifying incompetence, malfeasance or skulduggery at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the IRS, Justice Department and Health and Human Services.\n\nRepublicans didn\u2019t create the fiasco of the ObamaCare rollout; the architects of ObamaCare did that all by themselves. Just this week, the wheels came off the bus at the Secret Service.\n\nYou can denounce the anti-government rhetoric of Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and the Koch brothers all you like, but they didn\u2019t cause any of these spectacular failures.\n\nObama set out to restore faith in government and liberalism.
