He points to the mine\u2019s British manager, scrambling excitedly across the newly blasted rocks, and chuckles: \u201cThis is what Dave calls \u2018horny\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut the object of their affection is rapidly tarnishing before their eyes. On October 30th, the day that Mr Cooke brought the board of his Vancouver-based company, Endeavour Silver, on their annual inspection of one of its three mines in central Mexico, the upper house of Congress approved a new mining tax proposed by the government of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cIf it goes through as is, our fourth mine will not be in Mexico,\u201d declared Mr Cooke.\n\nMining is not the only industry up in arms over Mr Pe\u00f1a\u2019s broad tax overhaul. In fact, there is hardly a business group that has not dispatched lobbyists to Congress in a forlorn attempt to soften its impact; from soft-drinks and food manufacturers who face a new anti-obesity tax, to manufacturing exporters (maquiladoras) who lose tax privileges, to pet-food firms hit by higher value-added tax.\n\nThe government needs to raise revenue in a country where tax avoidance is rife. The mining levy\u2014a royalty of up to 7.5% on profits, plus 0.5% on revenue from precious metals\u2014makes sense in principle. But it comes just when metal prices have swooned. For instance, Endeavour\u2019s silver prices fell by 21% in the third quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nMiners say the royalty will threaten investment and jobs. Grupo M\u00e9xico, a copper producer and conglomerate, said on October 28th that a $5.3 billion investment programme after 2014 could be redirected towards lower-tax jurisdictions, such as the United States, Canada, Peru or Chile. Rosalind Wilson, head of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce\u2019s mining task-force in Mexico, says that in 2012 the country took 53% of the $1.9 billion raised on the Toronto Stock Exchange and its junior twin to finance mining in Latin America. In the first eight months of this year, the figure had fallen to 17%. \u201cMexico is completely pricing itself out of the market,\u201d she says.\n\nThe finance ministry expresses surprise at the reaction but is unrepentant. It claims Mexico has been overgenerous in not charging any royalty. It disputes the industry\u2019s assessment of the severity of the 7.5% tax, saying that there is a generous allowance for the depreciation of investment.\n\nMexico has seen a mining boom since opening the industry to foreigners in 1990. The result is evident at Bola\u00f1itos mine near Guanajuato, a town still resplendent from silver wealth dating back to Spanish colonial times. After taking it over in 2007, Endeavour increased the daily volume of ore it crushes from 50 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes. The \u201csovereign take\u201d, as a member of the company\u2019s board calls the royalty, means this kind of productivity-boosting investment may now come more slowly.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20131102_AMP002_1.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Mining in Mexico", "description": "A new royalty rattles investors", "pubdate": 20131102, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "A new royalty rattles investors", "title": "The sovereign take", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21588891-new-royalty-rattles-investors-sovereign-take", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131102_AMP002_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "A new royalty rattles investors", "sailthru.date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131102_AMP002_1.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131102_AMP002_1.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "The Americas", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20131102_AMP002_1.jpg", "articleid": 21588891, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20131102_AMP002_1.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Mining in Mexico", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2013-11-02 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "Mining in Mexico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17f0\"", "article_summary": "The \u201csovereign take\u201d, as a member of the company\u2019s board calls the royalty, means this kind of productivity-boosting investment may now come more slowly.\nFor instance, Endeavour\u2019s silver prices fell by 21% in the third quarter compared with the same period last year.\nAfter taking it over in 2007, Endeavour increased the daily volume of ore it crushes from 50 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes.\nThe mining levy\u2014a royalty of up to 7.5% on profits, plus 0.5% on revenue from precious metals\u2014makes sense in principle.\n\u201cIf it goes through as is, our fourth mine will not be in Mexico,\u201d declared Mr Cooke."}
