Chris Christie\u2019s pick to head New Jersey\u2019s Transportation Department has been confirmed by the state Senate.\n\nIt means Democrat Jamie Fox is returning to a position he also held when Jim McGreevey was governor.\n\nFox\u2019s nomination flew through the state Senate on Monday. The judiciary committee cleared him and then the full Senate confirmed him.\n\nChristie nominated Fox last week, days after a coalition of business, consumer and transportation groups called for the state to find a permanent way to fund the depleted Transportation Trust Fund for road and transit projects.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing, Fox told senators that all options were on the table for accomplishing that goal \u2014 including a gas tax hike.\n\nChristie said last week that he was considering all options, though he would not say specifically that a gas tax was among them when he was asked at a news conference.\n\nChristie, a Republican who is considering running for president in 2016, has previously opposed major tax increases.\n\nFox had the support of many groups that follow transportation.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey\u2019s transportation infrastructure and the Transportation Trust Fund are serious issues that need to be concentrated on immediatel, and today\u2019s vote is a great step toward finding sustainable and reliable solutions to these challenges,\u201d said Tom Bracken, the president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of Forward NJ, the group promoting focus on transportation projects.\n\nHis group last week presented a report calling for major upgrades.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1uzBV0j", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Democrat Jamie Fox is returning to a position he held when Jim McGreevey was governor.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Democrat Jamie Fox is returning to a position he held when Jim McGreevey was governor.", "title": "New Jersey transportation commissioner confirmed", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2014/09/22/new-jersey-transportation-commissioner-confirmed/16072267/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrat Jamie Fox is returning to a position he held when Jim McGreevey was governor.", "title": "New Jersey transportation commissioner confirmed", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7bcdf30294f95b91be3e600dbbdc6e59f46a7cd5/c=0-336-1933-2269&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/09/22/-chlbrd09-19-2014daily1a01120140918imgchristietransportat21ru8.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccab\"", "article_summary": "Jamie Fox Jamie Fox listens at a news conference after New Jersey Gov.\nChris Christie\u2019s pick to head New Jersey\u2019s Transportation Department has been confirmed by the state Senate.\nJim McGreevey to be New Jersey's new transportation commissioner Thursday, Sept. 18, 2014, in Trenton, N.J.
