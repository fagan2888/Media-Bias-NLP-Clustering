Elizabeth Warren isn\u2019t running. Hillary Clinton is and she starts out with very large leads in the early states. But hope is not lost. The choice facing progressives is not and never has been to somehow make Warren vs. Clinton happen or to spend the next 22 months enclosed in a political hellscape fit for only Sean Hannity and Lanny Davis. The 2016 election season does not have to be devoid of purpose or redeeming value.\n\nIf something changes in Iowa or New Hampshire Hillary Clinton could be in danger of being upset. At this point she looks like a strong favorite for the Democratic nomination and, by extension, if people feel their economic security is headed in the right direction from around this time next year to the election in November, a pretty good bet to be the next president. Progressives may not be able to change who is nominated but they can affect who is in the room with the nominee and the forces the nominee has to contend with if they reach the Oval Office.\n\nSure, garbage will not be in short supply this cycle. Democrats will be alleged to \u201cbe in disarray,\u201d as in having a healthy internal debate. Declarations that the Republican establishment is putting the Tea Party in its place will abound in spite of what is happening around those making the declaration. The strange notion that we live in a nation of political junkies closely following every single development will inform a lot of analysis. Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie and Jeb Bush will be to this cycle what John McCain and Jon Huntsman were to cycles past as much of the DC press barely manages to conceal its affection.\n\nSurrogates will say things that will make people in every campaign including their own wonder what they could possibly have been thinking. Candidates\u2019 physical appearance and meaningless \u201cgaffes\u201d (Marco Rubio took a sip of water as human beings are known to do and it became a thing) will get much more attention than they should. It would not be entirely shocking to see a prominent pundit assert that Michael Bloomberg should be nominated by either party or a new vehicle party designed for him; or preferably given the nomination of both parties and the new third party by acclimation because there\u2019s nothing so wrong with America that cannot be fixed by what is right with a soft plutocrat in the guise of a \u201ccentrist\u201d technocrat. Polarization will be roundly condemned.\n\nThe things voters in both parties tend to agree on that run counter to elite preferences will be overlooked.\n\nIn the midst of all of this lies an opportunity for progressives to seize and wield for substantive purposes a dynamic they\u2019re used to rightly bemoaning: whether through the actions of a current president or the candidates in the running for the office, the presidency is the surest access point to a discussion about pretty much anything. A constant pivot from rebuffing attacks from the right to giving credit to a national Democrat when due, to giving strong criticism of that same Democrat when it\u2019s warranted, may appear dizzying but it\u2019s something a lot of Democrats have gotten used to over the last seven years. Yes, elected Republicans are awful on practically everything with a few exceptions on select issues. No, this is not a free pass for a Democrat to simply affirm their Not A Republican status and have whatever they do go uncritically accepted.\n\nIndividuals and organizations are perfectly capable of deciding which candidates merit what kind of support while as an overall force engaging in more definitive agenda-setting. The right uses (insert event here) to talk about (insert one of their issues here) all the time. There\u2019s no reason progressives can\u2019t do more to use legitimate access points like, say, the ongoing HSBC scandals to elevate questions about the Justice Department\u2019s application of the \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d doctrine to megabanks or the need for a fee on financial transactions within the Democratic debate.\n\nThe usual argument against progressives more assertively doing this is that it undermines party unity. This claim has even less to it than the similar assertion that a long nomination fight would spell disaster for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and hopes for a Democrat in the White House circa 2008. The specter of a substantive fight jeopardizing unity and therefore electoral victory has already been raised by people like Steve Rattner, a lead member of the Wall Street wing. Rattner conflates operational unity among the groups that make up the Democratic voting and activist base, which is important, with the struggle for influence between what Thomas Edsall aptly summed up as \u201cthe money wing\u201d and \u201cthe voting wing.\u201d\n\nParty unity is a curious concept for the self-identified \u201cNew Dems\u201d to appeal to considering that during their rise to power New Dems labeled minorities, women, the LGBT community, working people in unions, seniors, environmentalists and others \u201cspecial interests\u201d to be grouped in with \u201ccause-orientated\u201d Democrats and pushed aside. This was done while elevating the financial sector to the hallowed place within the party establishment from which it now delivers edicts for everyone else to be super nice to them. Note that Rattner\u2019s highly selective brand of party unity was not enough to prevent his key support of Reshma Saujani\u2019s unsuccessful 2010 primary challenge to New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who Rattner deemed insufficiently deferential to finance\u2019s interests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For all the talk of needing to primary Hillary, here's how liberals really take over the party -- and America", "title": "The left\u2019s real choice in 2016: Why it doesn\u2019t need Elizabeth Warren to run", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For all the talk of needing to primary Hillary, here's how liberals really take over the party -- and America", "title": "The left\u2019s real choice in 2016: Why it doesn\u2019t need Elizabeth Warren to run", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/the_lefts_real_choice_in_2016_why_it_doesnt_need_elizabeth_warren_to_run/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/brown_warren.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For all the talk of needing to primary Hillary, here's how liberals really take over the party -- and America", "title": "The left\u2019s real choice in 2016: Why it doesn\u2019t need Elizabeth Warren to run", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/brown_warren.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Conrad", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016, Banks, Barack Obama, economy, Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, Liberals, Middle Class, Populism, Progressives, Sherrod Brown, steve rattner, The Left", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf5e\"", "article_summary": "If something changes in Iowa or New Hampshire Hillary Clinton could be in danger of being upset.\nHillary Clinton is and she starts out with very large leads in the early states.\nThe usual argument against progressives more assertively doing this is that it undermines party unity.\nThe things voters in both parties tend to agree on that run counter to elite preferences will be overlooked.\nThe 2016 election season does not have to be devoid of purpose or redeeming value."}
