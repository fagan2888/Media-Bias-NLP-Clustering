Expect Gov. John Hickenlooper to don a red-and-white striped hat Monday as he reads a Dr. Seuss book to school kids as part of the 17th annual Read Across American Day.

He and Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia will join an expected 45 million participants celebrating a National Education Association event that also honors the legacy of the late Theodor Geisel, the beloved children’s author better known as Dr. Seuss. The event traditionally is held on or around Geisel’s birthday on March 2.

Gov. Hickenlooper at 9:30 a.m. is scheduled to read “Green Eggs and Ham” to a group of 55 kindergarteners from Clyde Miller Elementary School, who will be at the Capitol.



A recent Denver Post look at the author noted this his books “have spawned movies (which Geisel resisted during his life) and TV classics such as “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,” which Boris Karloff memorably voiced. They have been read on the floor of the U.S. Senate — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz recited “Green Eggs and Ham” in his 2013 Obamacare filibuster. And one book, 1950’s “If I Ran the Zoo,” put the word “nerd” into the lexicon.”
