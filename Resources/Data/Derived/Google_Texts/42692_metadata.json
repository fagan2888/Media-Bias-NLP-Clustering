The Byrd Rule was enacted to ensure reconciliation is being used to reduce the deficit, and senators can attempt to block a provision within a reconciliation bill on the grounds that it includes \u201cextraneous matter.\u201d\n\nA provision of a reconciliation bill can be ruled \u201cextraneous\u201d if it falls under one of six different definitions, one of which questions if a provision \u201cproduces a change in outlays or revenue which is merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision,\u201d meaning that the budgetary component must outweigh the non-budgetary component.\n\nThe \u201cmerely incidental\u201d test, Reynolds said, is subjective and up to the discretion of the Senate parliamentarian, currently Elizabeth MacDonough.\n\n>>> Commentary: Why Reconciliation Can\u2019t Be Used to Defund Planned Parenthood\n\nIf a senator objects to a provision of the reconciliation bill on the grounds that it violates the Byrd Rule, the offending language can be removed from the bill.\n\nThe Senate can waive the Byrd Rule, but doing so requires 60 votes.\n\n\u201cWhat does all this mean for a hypothetical Planned Parenthood provision?\u201d Reynolds wrote. \u201cActual objections raised on the floor alleging \u2018merely incidental\u2019 budget effects are relatively rare, but that obscures any deterrent effects on the rule; after all, legislators may simply avoid including problematic provisions, knowing the parliamentarian may strike them down.\u201d\n\nIn addition to passing the \u201cmerely incidental\u201d test, Reynolds also said that using reconciliation to defund Planned Parenthood may be problematic because of the type of money the organization receives from the government.\n\nThe funds Planned Parenthood receives, such as Title X, qualify as discretionary spending, meaning they are allocated to specific agencies through appropriations acts. Discretionary funds cannot be changed in a reconciliation bill.\n\nReynolds noted that this specific provision of the Byrd Rule would limit Congress\u2019 ability to cut Planned Parenthood\u2019s discretionary funds\u2014which includes $60 million the group receives through Title X \u2014through reconciliation.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Reynolds said, \u201cit\u2019s difficult to predict exactly where the current parliamentarian might come down on these questions. As congressional Republicans continue to plan their budget strategy, however, they\u2019d be wise to recall the words of parliamentarians past and consider how their motives might be read.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in Congress have been calling for Planned Parenthood to be stripped of its federal funding following the release of a series of undercover videos from the Center for Medical Progress. The videos show Planned Parenthood officials allegedly discussing the sale of organs and tissue from aborted babies.\n\nFollowing the release of the videos, lawmakers have begun to hold hearings to investigate the group. Now, Republicans are looking to the upcoming debate on the budget to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n>>> Conservatives Face Uphill Battle to Use Government Funding Bill to Punish Planned Parenthood", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican leaders have been considering using a budget tool known as reconciliation to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Republican leaders have been considering using a budget tool known as reconciliation to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding.", "title": "Conservatives Have Unlikely Ally In Planned Parenthood Fight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150921_PPReconciliation_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-23T06:32:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NKmM89"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Republican leaders have been considering using a budget tool known as reconciliation to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding.", "title": "Conservatives Have Unlikely Ally In Planned Parenthood Fight", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150921_PPReconciliation_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2015-09-22T14:13:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-23T06:32:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Byrd Rule, reconciliation, Obamacare, Planned Parenthood, Brookings Institution, Molly Reynolds, Title X, Elizabeth MacDonough"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb383\"", "article_summary": ">>> Conservatives Face Uphill Battle to Use Government Funding Bill to Punish Planned Parenthood\n\u201cWhat does all this mean for a hypothetical Planned Parenthood provision?\u201d Reynolds wrote.\nNow, Republicans are looking to the upcoming debate on the budget to defund Planned Parenthood.\nRepublican leaders have been considering using a budget tool known as reconciliation to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding.\nThe videos show Planned Parenthood officials allegedly discussing the sale of organs and tissue from aborted babies."}
