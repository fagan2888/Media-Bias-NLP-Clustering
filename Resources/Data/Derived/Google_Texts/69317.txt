Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made a blunt acknowledgment on Tuesday: That even if Republicans win the Senate in the midterm elections next week, they won't be able to repeal ObamaCare.

"Well, it's at the top of my list — but remember who's in the White House for two more years. Obviously he's not going to sign a full repeal," McConnell said, during an appearance on Fox News' Your World with Neil Cavuto. "But there are pieces of it that are extremely unpopular with the American public that the Senate ought to have a chance to vote on: Repealing the medical device tax; trying to restore the 40-hour work week; voting on whether or not we should continue the individual mandate, which people hate, detest, and despise."

Cavuto then asked whether repealing aspects like the medical device tax was possible, even if totally "dismantling" the law was not.

"Well, it would take 60 votes in the Senate — nobody thinks we're going to have 60 Republicans — and it would take a presidential signature, and no one thinks we're going to get that," McConnell explained. "So the question is: What can you do about it? Well, I'd like to put the Senate Democrats in a position of voting on the most unpopular parts of this law, and see if we can put it on the president's desk and make him take real ownership of this highly destructive ObamaCare, which has done so much damage to the country."
