The Washington Post coined the political fact-check phrase “Pinocchios” for untrue statements, whether they appear in a campaign advertisement or are spoken by an elected official.

For example, 2013’s ‘Pinocchio of the Year’ was the President’s “if you want to keep your plan…” claim.

Well, WaPo just released their list of the top Pinocchios of the year, and it’s something to behold. There are recipients on both sides of the aisle.

Here we go (in no particular order):

1. President Obama: “I didn’t call the Islamic State a ‘JV’ team.”

This statement from the President can be proven wrong by simply looking at the transcript from the interview with The New Yorker, wherein he clearly said it.

2. Rand Paul: “John McCain met with Islamic State terrorists.”

Rand Paul’s assertion was proven to be absolutely false. On this one, WaPo regretted that Four Pinocchios is the highest level rating they give for falsehoods.

3. President Obama: “Republicans have filibustered 500 pieces of legislation.”

No, Mr. President, it was closer to 50, about a tenth of the amount claimed.

4. Paul Ryan: “A boy didn’t want a government lunch but one in a brown paper bag.”

Paul Ryan’s source for this statement got it from a book. Oops. Ryan did say he regretted retelling the story.

5. Alison Lundergan Grimes: “Mitch McConnell took $600,000 from anti-coal groups.”

By the time Alison Lundergan Grimes made this statement, previous accusations like this about McConnell had already earned four Pinocchios. It didn’t help Grimes, as she was trounced in the November elections.

6. David Perdue: “Michelle Nunn funded organizations linked to terrorists.”

Despite this fully-debunked claim, David Perdue (R-GA) went on to win his Senate campaign against Nunn, daughter of long-time Senator Sam Nunn.

7. Super-PAC Advertisement: “Republican cuts to Ebola research are killing people.”

This Super-PAC ad was not only untrue, as George W. Bush actually increased public-health spending and both Democrats and Republicans have acted to cut federal spending, it ends with the inflammatory tagline, “Republican Cuts Kill.”

8. National Rifle Association: “Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights.”

This NRA ad was emotional in its content, showing an intruder breaking in a home after a mother had just put her baby to bed, but they later admitted that the bill Landrieu was supporting would have still allowed the mother to buy a gun for self-defense.

9. Politicians talking about the Obamacare numbers.

Dick Durbin, Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell, and John Boehner all earned 4 Pinocchios over the course of the year for various statements they made about enrollments and plan cancelations.

10. Vladimir Putin: “A referendum was held in Crimea in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms.”

Vladimir Putin was not exempt from earning recognition. The referenced vote did not allow a choice against the motion, and resistance to it was repressed.

These are indeed whoppers of epic proportions. Rest assured, there’ll be plenty of options to choose from next year this time, too.
