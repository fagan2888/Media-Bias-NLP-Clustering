Cigna rejected the offer on Sunday, despite Anthem\u2019s attempt to pressure Cigna\u2019s board by taking the offer public. Anthem, Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc. all are poised to emerge as buyers or sellers when the dust settles.\n\nDriving the consolidation is the 2010 health law that put tougher rules on the industry, demanding more covered services, better care and a ceiling on profits. It funded coverage for the uninsured, and companies are racing to capture the more than 20 million customers who will buy coverage through Obamacare\u2019s markets.\n\n\u201cThe industry is far more regulated under Obamacare and so companies need to do a better job at negotiating better unit costs and contracts,\u201d said Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners. \u201cMarket share helps. The larger you are, the stronger standing you have.\u201d\n\nGupta predicts that the \u201cbig five\u201d insurers will merge into a \u201cbig three,\u201d likely composed of Aetna, Anthem and UnitedHealth.\n\nA combined Anthem and Cigna would form an insurance giant with more than 50 million customers, adding power to negotiate prices with hospitals and doctors. Cigna also has a large presence overseas, another source of potential growth.\n\nCigna said in a statement Sunday that Anthem lacked a clear strategy for growth or for how to run a merged company. Cigna called Anthem\u2019s offer inadequate and said it had fundamental concerns about a deal.\n\nNot Alone\n\nAnthem isn\u2019t alone in seeking a major deal. While the Indianapolis, Indiana-based insurer has also expressed interest in Humana Inc., so have Aetna and Cigna, Bloomberg has reported. The Wall Street Journal has said UnitedHealth might be interested in Aetna or Cigna, and that Aetna has proposed buying Humana.\n\nAs Anthem and Cigna go back and forth, a deal isn\u2019t guaranteed. Anthem has made multiple approaches since last year and been rejected. Going public raises the stakes.\n\n\u201cAnthem is upping the ante,\u201d said Chris Koller, a former Rhode Island health insurance regulator. \u201cThey have been trying to do this by cooperating but now they are forcing the deal by going public and putting up an offer that is hard for the board to refuse.\u201d\n\nOne major sticking point ha been who will head a combined company, according to Anthem.\n\nIn a June 20 letter to Cigna\u2019s board of directors, Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said that he should run the combined group for two years after the deal closes, and that Cigna CEO David Cordani should be president and chief operating officer as part of a deal that would include Anthem conceding on other board-related issues.\n\n\u201cWe were stunned that the Cigna Board continues to insist on a guaranteed CEO position for Mr. Cordani over choosing to allow its stockholders to realize the significant premium being offered,\u201d Swedish said in the letter.\n\nCigna, in its statement rejecting the offer, said Anthem\u2019s proposal would give Swedish too many roles.\n\nRegional Businesses\n\nWhile the big five are indeed large, their businesses are for the most part regional. Not every company has operations in every state, and buying a competitor offers access to new markets.\n\nAnthem, for example, has about 38.5 million members, through insurance plans in 14 states and government plans for the poor in 19 states. A combination with Cigna would give it 53 million customers and add services in Arizona, Oklahoma and elsewhere.\n\nWhile regulators will scrutinize a deal, a combination can probably pass antitrust hurdles, said Jason McGorman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cOf all of the deals announced, this one has fewer hurdles based on our analysis.\u201d\n\nGupte agreed. \u201cIn combination Anthem and Cigna don\u2019t have market share that\u2019s threatening. There could be some minor divestitures, but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a doable transaction.\u201d\n\nScrutiny\n\nA merger between UnitedHealth -- the biggest insurer by market value -- and Aetna would face much more scrutiny from regulators, Gupte said.\n\nHealth insurers\u2019 consolidation is driven in part by hospitals doing the same sort of deals, said McGorman said in a telephone interview. \u201cInsurers need to gain efficiencies and scale to get more negotiating power with the hospitals.\u201d\n\nThat could, in turn, cause more hospital mergers, Gupte said. \u201cAfter this deal, hospitals will start looking at their negotiating power. The industry is too fragmented.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Drew Armstrong and Saijel Kishan", "twitter": {"description": "America\u2019s biggest health insurers are about to get even bigger, driven into a wave of consolidation by Obamacare\u2019s new regulations and markets.", "title": "Biggest Health Insurers to Get Even Bigger Under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-21/biggest-u-s-health-insurers-to-get-even-bigger-under-obamacare", "image": "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQO5tePvBq_U/v5/-999x-999.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Drew Armstrong and Saijel Kishan", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "UnitedHealth Group Inc,Aetna Inc,Health,Cigna Corp", "news_keywords": "UnitedHealth Group Inc,Aetna Inc,Health,Cigna Corp", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-21/biggest-u-s-health-insurers-to-get-even-bigger-under-obamacare", "parsely-title": "Biggest Health Insurers to Get Even Bigger Under Obamacare", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-21T20:32:10.183Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "America\u2019s biggest health insurers are about to get even bigger, driven into a wave of consolidation by Obamacare\u2019s new regulations and markets.", "parsely-tags": "UnitedHealth Group Inc,Aetna Inc,Health,Cigna Corp,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-06-21T20:32:10.183Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "America\u2019s biggest health insurers are about to get even bigger, driven into a wave of consolidation by Obamacare\u2019s new regulations and markets.", "title": "Biggest Health Insurers to Get Even Bigger Under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-21/biggest-u-s-health-insurers-to-get-even-bigger-under-obamacare", "image": "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQO5tePvBq_U/v5/-999x-999.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "America\u2019s biggest health insurers are about to get even bigger, driven into a wave of consolidation by Obamacare\u2019s new regulations and markets."}, "parsely-post-id": "NQB01U6VDKHT01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQO5tePvBq_U/v5/-999x-999.jpg"}, "article_summary": "America\u2019s biggest health insurers are about to get even bigger, driven into a wave of consolidation by Obamacare\u2019s new regulations and markets.\nAnthem, Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc. all are poised to emerge as buyers or sellers when the dust settles.\nCigna rejected the offer on Sunday, despite Anthem\u2019s attempt to pressure Cigna\u2019s board by taking the offer public.\nHealth insurers\u2019 consolidation is driven in part by hospitals doing the same sort of deals, said McGorman said in a telephone interview.\nThe larger you are, the stronger standing you have.\u201dGupta predicts that the \u201cbig five\u201d insurers will merge into a \u201cbig three,\u201d likely composed of Aetna, Anthem and UnitedHealth."}
