According to a lawsuit filed against the East Neck Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in West Babylon, male strippers were brought in as a part of the home\u2019s \u201centertainment event\u201d for patients back in 2012.\n\nFranklin Youngblood was visiting his 86-year-old mother Bernice when he discovered a photograph that both horrified and shocked him. The photo shows Youngblood\u2019s elderly mother, who reportedly suffers from partial dementia, being straddled by a brawny gentleman while shoving money down his underpants. When Youngblood asked a staff member about what he had discovered, a nursing supervisor went to grab the photo from his hands.\n\n\u201cI felt terrible,\u201d Bernice Youngblood told reporters at a recent press conference. \u201cI was shaken.\u201d The lawsuit filed by Youngblood\u2019s family stated the event was \u201call for the perverse pleasure and enjoyment of the Defendant\u2019s staff.\u201d\n\nHoward Fensterman, East Neck Nursing and Rehabilitation Center\u2019s attorney, said the decision to bring in strippers for the patients\u2019 enjoyment was ultimately left up to the clients. Fensterman said a 16-member committee of residents requested the striptease act, and other clients of the facility voted it in, NBC New York reported. The nursing home, however, did approve the request and paid $250 for the exotic dancer\u2019s time.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "long, island, nursing, home, strippers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The family of an elderly patient at a Long Island nursing home is suing the facility after they discovered staff members hired strippers for the clients' entertainment.", "title": "Nursing Home Hires Strippers To Entertain Patients [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/long-island-nursing-home-hires-strippers-entertain-elderly-patients-ends-court-275546", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/09/long-island-nursing-home-striptease.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The family of an elderly patient at a Long Island nursing home is suing the facility after they discovered staff members hired strippers for the clients' entertainment.", "title": "Nursing Home Hires Strippers To Entertain Patients [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/long-island-nursing-home-hires-strippers-entertain-elderly-patients-ends-court-275546", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/09/long-island-nursing-home-striptease.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/09/long-island-nursing-home-striptease.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-09T12:25:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-09T12:25:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The family of an elderly patient at a Long Island nursing home is suing the facility after they discovered staff members hired strippers for the clients' entertainment."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd450b\"", "article_summary": "A nursing home in Long Island has landed in hot water after it was discovered the facility hired strippers to entertain some of its elderly clients.\nWhen Youngblood asked a staff member about what he had discovered, a nursing supervisor went to grab the photo from his hands.\nAccording to a lawsuit filed against the East Neck Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in West Babylon, male strippers were brought in as a part of the home\u2019s \u201centertainment event\u201d for patients back in 2012.\nThe photo shows Youngblood\u2019s elderly mother, who reportedly suffers from partial dementia, being straddled by a brawny gentleman while shoving money down his underpants.\nFranklin Youngblood was visiting his 86-year-old mother Bernice when he discovered a photograph that both horrified and shocked him."}
