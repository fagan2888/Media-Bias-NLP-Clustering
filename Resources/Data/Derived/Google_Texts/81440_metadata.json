But for the past year, her attention\u2019s been turned to Africa, where a human-versus-animal war is at its breaking point. Organized, aggressive and hugely profitable poaching operations are on the rise, and elephants and rhinos are on the fast track to extinction.\n\nIt\u2019s a crisis of international proportions, and the tragedy of the potential loss of entire species is only the beginning. As Hillary Clinton put it last fall when she introduced an $80 million anti-trafficking program: \u201cThis is not just about elephants. It is about human beings, governments, trying to control their own territory, trying to keep their people safe, as well as protect their cultural and environmental heritage.\u201d The spoils from the global poaching trade, valued as high as $10 billion a year, moreover, are funding terrorist organizations and criminal syndicates, making it an issue of international security as well.\n\nBrooks is in the middle of filming \u201cThe Last Animals,\u201d a documentary about the complexities of the poaching epidemic, and hopes to complete it next year. We spoke about the project and about the insights she\u2019s gained about efforts, both locally and around the world, to put an end to poaching before it puts an end to Africa\u2019s wildlife. A selection of her photographs follow the interview, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat does the filming entail? Where have you been traveling?\n\nI\u2019ve been filming in Kenya and Chad so far. Though there are other places where I intend to film. The project is really sort of intended to just capture the poaching epidemic and how endemic the poaching crisis is across the continent.\n\nHas it been easy enough to just go there and find where this is happening? Or is it something you\u2019ve had to seek out?\n\nPoaching is really happening all over the continent, so one doesn\u2019t really have to go very far, unfortunately, to find it. And I don\u2019t know if you saw any of the reports that have come out in the last couple of days\u2026\n\nAbout the elephants? I wanted to ask you about that.\n\nYeah, the National Academy of Sciences just published a substantiated report stating that 100,000 elephants have been killed over the past three years. While many people believed those were roughly the numbers, they weren\u2019t substantiated until this report came out. So the situation is dire for wildlife across Africa.\n\nA lot of the coverage of poaching, and the effort to stop it, refers to it as a war. Based on what you\u2019ve seen and your past experience, is that be an apt description?\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing, I think, are landscapes that are increasingly militarized in an effort to deter poachers. I think it is generally fair to say this is a war and there are people being killed in the process, whether those are rangers or poachers. And even if they\u2019re poachers, it has pretty significant effects on the social fabric of society. Because very often the people carrying out the actual poaching are people from impoverished communities and basically the product is being sort of passed on to criminal syndicates.\n\nSo you have rangers being killed in the process of protecting wildlife. You have the ways in which local communities are being affected by the demand for ivory. And then you have 100,000 elephants being killed in the last three years or over a thousand rhinos being killed per year. So with these numbers, we are really at an incredibly critical phase in human-animal relationships.\n\nI think those numbers are really going to drive home for a lot of people that this is a tipping point, and just how extreme the problem is. Was there a moment like that for you, when you decided to start covering this topic? What made you realize how big of an issue it was?\n\nTwo years ago I was a Knight Wallace Fellow at the University of Michigan. You had to summarize your study proposal in 15 words or fewer, and mine was, \u201cCan there be ecological preservation in an overpopulated world with diminishing resources?\u201d As a fellow there, having an advisor who\u2019s an environmental anthropologist, I sort of began looking at the poaching crisis, and I was seeing an uptick in poaching and in articles. I also started paying attention to the information that was being put out by various NGOs and I just thought that the problem was incredibly underreported in mainstream media. And that was really what compelled me to begin this project. I\u2019m a photographer by profession; I\u2019ve worked on documentaries before, but I\u2019ve also been doing editorial assignments related to poaching and conservation. But I really felt that this project was necessary to address the complexities of poaching in a multimedia dimension.\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of those complexities. I know when you do see poaching covered in the media it\u2019s usually a very simple narrative: \u201cPoaching is bad. We need to try to stop it.\u201d What did you witness that complicates that story?\n\nWell, you have impoverished communities. Unfortunately, there has typically been a great deal of corruption in a number of African countries helping to facilitate the trafficking of ivory and rhino horn. You\u2019ve had very lax penalties for poachers and people who are in possession of ivory and rhino horn. And then you\u2019ve also had the issue of supply and demand. All of those things combined. Also, a few years ago, China surpassed having a million millionaires. Typically, China is identified as the largest market and consumer of ivory. And obviously, with those kinds of numbers, if you\u2019re looking at a million millionaires in China wanting a piece of ivory, then that means there aren\u2019t going to be any elephants left.\n\nI\u2019m curious about your perspective as a photographer. Do you have a code of ethics for how much you\u2019re willing to show when it comes to graphic or disturbing images? Are you looking for the shock-value pictures of animals? What\u2019s your approach to that?\n\nI think what I have been incorporating in my coverage \u2014 whether it\u2019s my film or also in the capacity of a photographer \u2014 I had a cover story in Smithsonian last month on the race to stop Africa\u2019s elephant poachers \u2014 and for me it\u2019s really, I think, very much about capturing the contrast. There\u2019s the horror of poaching. And of course, capturing the beauty that still exists in recognition that some of these elephant populations that I photograph are likely not to exist 10 years from now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Photojournalist Kate Brooks talks with Salon about the threat to Africa's wildlife", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Photojournalist Kate Brooks talks with Salon about the threat to Africa's wildlife", "title": "\u201cThis is a war\u201d: A conflict photographer takes on the rapidly escalating poaching crisis", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/23/this_is_a_war_a_conflict_photographer_takes_on_the_rapidly_escalating_poaching_crisis/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/poaching.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Photojournalist Kate Brooks talks with Salon about the threat to Africa's wildlife", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/poaching.jpg", "title": "\u201cThis is a war\u201d: A conflict photographer takes on the rapidly escalating poaching crisis", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cThis is a war\u201d: A conflict photographer takes on the rapidly escalating poaching crisis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Africa, Editor's Picks, elephants, endangered species, Photography, Poaching, trafficking, war photography, wildlife", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfde9\"", "article_summary": "The project is really sort of intended to just capture the poaching epidemic and how endemic the poaching crisis is across the continent.\nTopics: Africa, Editor's Picks, elephants, endangered species, Photography, Poaching, trafficking, war photography, wildlife, Sustainability NewsKate Brooks has long fixed her camera lens on violence.\nPoaching is really happening all over the continent, so one doesn\u2019t really have to go very far, unfortunately, to find it.\nI know when you do see poaching covered in the media it\u2019s usually a very simple narrative: \u201cPoaching is bad.\nA lot of the coverage of poaching, and the effort to stop it, refers to it as a war."}
