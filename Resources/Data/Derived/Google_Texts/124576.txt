The foreign ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have promised to take necessary action against human traffickers who have been driving the exodus of Myanmar’s persecuted Rohingya Muslims.

According to a joint statement after talks in Malaysia on Wednesday, Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman says the three Southeast Asian nations will take steps to bring the perpetrators of such heinous crime to justice.

Thailand has already arrested several police and local officials after authorities uncovered jungle camps where the trafficked Rohingya had been held until their families agreed to pay ransom for their release.
