By Brock's account, his colleagues within Team Hillary were orchestrating his demise.\n\nRon Friedman\n\nSetting aside a debate on the accuracy of Brock's assertion, there's an interesting psychological perspective to be raised about why campaign squabbles like this are already cropping up for the Clinton campaign and why we can expect more of them.\n\nUnlike her competitors on the Republican side, Clinton is the clear frontrunner for Democrats. And while intuitively we might expect that fewer primary contenders would allow Clinton to snatch up her party's most talented consultants, enabling her to form a stronger, more disciplined campaign team, research suggests that too much talent in a group can actually undermine performance.\n\nWe often assume that adding more talented players to a team will lead to better outcomes. But a close look at the data reveals a different story.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ron Friedman says Hillary Clinton has amassed some of the top political operatives, but can a team of all-stars live up to expectations?", "pubdate": "2015-02-16T13:48:00Z", "author": "Ron Friedman", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Ron Friedman says Hillary Clinton has amassed some of the top political operatives, but can a team of all-stars live up to expectations?", "pubdate": "2015-02-16T13:48:00Z", "title": "Hillary Clinton's talent problem", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/16/opinion/friedman-hillary-clinton-talent-problem/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141104140308-introvert-clinton-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "opinion", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/16/opinion/friedman-hillary-clinton-talent-problem/index.html"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "template-top": "opinion,art-gal", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "keywords": "opinion, Hillary Clinton's talent problem - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2015-02-16T20:43:01Z", "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141104140308-introvert-clinton-large-169.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3a0\"", "article_summary": "By Brock's account, his colleagues within Team Hillary were orchestrating his demise.\nHis resignation letter contained a bold claim -- that leaders at Priorities USA were feeding newsgroups devastating stories about his fundraiser, undermining his ability to raise money.\nWe often assume that adding more talented players to a team will lead to better outcomes.\nRon FriedmanSetting aside a debate on the accuracy of Brock's assertion, there's an interesting psychological perspective to be raised about why campaign squabbles like this are already cropping up for the Clinton campaign and why we can expect more of them.\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author."}
