If that paycheck seems handsome, it wasn\u2019t. At least, not when you compare it to Hemsley\u2019s total pay five years earlier, when it amounted to $102 million.\n\nExecutives at health care companies in the United States had the highest median CEO pay of any industry in 2014, according to an analysis by the Associated Press/Equilar released Tuesday. Yet whatever the supposed benefits of higher CEO pay are -- more efficient management, better health care -- they are not trickling down to ordinary Americans, who want better, more affordable medical care. In fact, analysts noted that these outsized paychecks, not just for CEOs but also for other managers in the health care industry, are in fact serving to drive up the costs of health care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that one of the reasons why Americans pay more for health insurance and for health care than people in any other country in the world is because of this high executive compensation,\u201d Wendell Potter, a former public relations executive for insurance company Cigna, said. Yet \u201cthere is no real justification for it,\u201d he added.\n\nAs the United States struggles to rein in rising health care costs -- at the last count, the U.S. spent $2.9 trillion in 2013 -- many questions have focused on how medical care could become more efficient, such as how to pay doctors according to the quality rather than the quantity of care they provide, or how to cut back on costly yet unnecessary trips to the emergency room. The compensation for leaders of hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies hasn\u2019t been a major part of the conversation, even as their pay steadily rises.\n\nChief executives at health care companies earned a median of $13.6 million in 2014, up 4 percent from the year before and marking the sixth time pay has risen in the past seven years, the AP\u2019s analysis, conducted with data firm Equilar, found. The broad range of health companies analyzed included pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies and hospitals, Aaron Boyd, director of governance research at Equilar, said.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe sheer amount of money involved in awarding six-, seven- and eight-figure compensation packages to CEOs is not the only reason health care costs can be inflated by executive pay, analysts say. It\u2019s also about what those generous packages consist of.\n\n\u201cIf executives are loaded up with stock options and other types of equity-based pay, they have a personal incentive to boost share prices by whatever means necessary,\u201d Sarah Anderson, global economy project director at the Institute for Policy Studies, said. That could push them to cut corners in medical services, training or any number of cutbacks that could hurt consumers. \u201cThe incentives for short-term thinking among managers is actually more dangerous than the dollar amount of executive pay,\u201d Anderson added.\n\nOn average, a CEO at a health insurance company earns $584,000 a year, the New York Times found in 2014. Hospital CEOs earn an average of $386,000, while hospital administrators earn $267,000. But for some, earned salaries constituted merely a small portion of how much these executive actually took home. Mark T. Bertolini, CEO of insurance company Aetna, had a salary of $977,000 -- but received more than $36 million in total compensation that included stocks and options.\n\nLinked to these dollars are growing budget lines for administrative costs at these companies. Insurance companies in the U.S. spent at least twice as much on administrative costs as other developed countries did, according to a 2013 survey by the Commonwealth Fund. And yet Americans are paying these very administrators through the nose, by comparison.\n\n\u201cIf you look at some of the most globally competitive firms from other countries, the executive pay levels are nowhere near the level they are in the United States,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe do not have a pay-for-performance system.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has tried to bring down these pay grades. A little-known rule in the law aimed to encourage health insurance companies to pay executives less by imposing a cap on the amount of money companies could seek in tax deductions for those salaries. That regulation gave back $72 million to taxpayers in 2013, according to the Institute for Policy Studies. Yet despite the minimal benefit to taxpayers, the rule had little impact on compensation overall, the institute found. In other words, salaries for health insurance CEOs didn\u2019t take a hit -- companies were just paying more in taxes because of them.\n\nHealth care companies justify these high packages by saying they have to pay competitively to attract the best talent, Potter, the former Cigna executive, said. \u201cThey hire compensation experts who supposedly review compensation at their peer companies,\u201d he explained, adding that the system virtually \u201cguaranteed\u201d that salaries would keep climbing.\n\nAs long as they do, Americans can expect to shell out more and more for their health care, with little guarantee they\u2019re getting what they're paying for.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rising costs of health care, health care executive pay, equilar, associated press, data analysis of ceo pay, why does health care cost so much, administrative costs health care, administration costs health care, highest paid ceos in health care, highest p", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Median pay for CEOs at health care companies was $13.6 million in 2014, an analysis shows.", "title": "Rising Costs Of Medical Care, Health Insurance: Median Pay For CEOs In Health Care Companies Higher Than Any Other Industry, Analysis Finds", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/rising-costs-medical-care-health-insurance-median-pay-ceos-health-care-companies-1938699", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/05/26/rtr31gv8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Median pay for CEOs at health care companies was $13.6 million in 2014, an analysis shows.", "title": "Rising Costs Of Medical Care, Health Insurance: Median Pay For CEOs In Health Care Companies Higher Than Any Other Industry, Analysis Finds", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/rising-costs-medical-care-health-insurance-median-pay-ceos-health-care-companies-1938699", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/05/26/rtr31gv8.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/05/26/rtr31gv8.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-05-26T15:56:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T00:58:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Median pay for CEOs at health care companies was $13.6 million in 2014, an analysis shows."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0ae\"", "article_summary": "The broad range of health companies analyzed included pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies and hospitals, Aaron Boyd, director of governance research at Equilar, said.\nIn fact, analysts noted that these outsized paychecks, not just for CEOs but also for other managers in the health care industry, are in fact serving to drive up the costs of health care.\nExecutives at health care companies in the United States had the highest median CEO pay of any industry in 2014, according to an analysis by the Associated Press/Equilar released Tuesday.\nYet whatever the supposed benefits of higher CEO pay are -- more efficient management, better health care -- they are not trickling down to ordinary Americans, who want better, more affordable medical care.\nHealth care companies justify these high packages by saying they have to pay competitively to attract the best talent, Potter, the former Cigna executive, said."}
