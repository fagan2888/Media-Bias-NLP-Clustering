(Photo: Coca-Cola)\n\nWe asked readers what they thought of a Coca-Cola ad shown during the Super Bowl featuring America the Beautiful sung in eight languages. Comments from Twitter and Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nI thought it was a beautiful, edgy statement reflective of the diversity of America.\n\n\u2014 @ShelbyAnne\n\nI enjoyed the ad the most! It was uplifting and inspirational.\n\n\u2014 @MortBecker\n\nIt highlighted what makes the U.S. unique: a nation of immigrants, cultures, languages.\n\n\u2014 @jl_urbano\n\nWhen you try to cater to everyone, you cater to no one.\n\nI'm tired of going into a store and seeing signs in different languages. Signs should be in English! If you want to come here and be a part of our country, learn it.\n\n\u2014 Arlington Andrews\n\nThe ad was beautiful. It showcases the true America and all the people who live here.\n\n\u2014 @grimsleyyy\n\nMulticulturalism is a proven failure. A key tenet of American exceptionalism is the shared use of English.\n\n\u2014 @FreeStateFrank\n\nI understand that some people are upset about the ad, but it's a beautiful message. America is still the place where people all over the world can go for a better life and opportunity.\n\nAlso, it embraces the fact that U.S. citizens don't have to give up their culture in order to be American. It sends the message that it's OK to be different.\n\n\u2014 Julia Fu\n\nThe ad isn't an award winner, but I see nothing objectionable.\n\nFor those who don't like the foreign languages, perhaps the people were singing in their native tongue and do speak English.\n\nAmerica is made up of people from all over the world. You can't hate who we once were.\n\n\u2014 Rick H Sutton\n\nThe ad fit the song. It's a perfect prelude to the Olympics !\n\n\u2014 @gobuxgal\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share America\n\nFor more discussions, follow @USATOpinion or #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1kPcFiP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We asked readers what they thought of a Coca-Cola ad shown during the Super Bowl featuring America the Beautiful sung...", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "We asked readers what they thought of a Coca-Cola ad shown during the Super Bowl featuring America the Beautiful sung...", "title": "Coca-Cola's Super Bowl ad unites? #tellusatoday", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/02/04/coca-cola-super-bowl-ad-tellusatoday-your-say/5212523/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We asked readers what they thought of a Coca-Cola ad shown during the Super Bowl featuring America the Beautiful sung...", "title": "Coca-Cola's Super Bowl ad unites? #tellusatoday", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8cfff4c6e5e4bc1b91f54589ca8254deb65fc837/c=723-0-1339-616&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/04//1391561400000-XXX-2014-SUPER-BOWL-COCA-COLA-ITS-BEAUTIFUL03-61528350.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Coca-Cola", "gci-categories": "Companies/Coca-Cola", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Coca-Cola's Super Bowl ad unites? #tellusatoday", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d9d7b2510dfafb046776a79fe74b99417f724f80/c=797-0-1259-616/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/04//1391561400000-XXX-2014-SUPER-BOWL-COCA-COLA-ITS-BEAUTIFUL03-61528350.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d0f72892427c52d982ef63711f46c1f812074ab/c=723-0-1339-616/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/04//1391561400000-XXX-2014-SUPER-BOWL-COCA-COLA-ITS-BEAUTIFUL03-61528350.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffaa9b0aa7bbc31a12b78761f3f98824e3ef76d1/c=686-0-1507-616/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/04//1391561400000-XXX-2014-SUPER-BOWL-COCA-COLA-ITS-BEAUTIFUL03-61528350.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f82280a4f67e7786e0c99239476d86253d48d8d7/c=536-0-1627-616&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/04//1391561400000-XXX-2014-SUPER-BOWL-COCA-COLA-ITS-BEAUTIFUL03-61528350.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-02-04T19:52:31.347000-05:00", "shorthed": "Coca-Cola's Super Bowl ad unites? #tellusatoday", "articleid": 5212523, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/885c8e09fb1bc42890100c0a5f917c91371bb5e3/c=536-0-1627-616/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/04//1391561400000-XXX-2014-SUPER-BOWL-COCA-COLA-ITS-BEAUTIFUL03-61528350.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0629b5da0a7b2216527ae2b95325d72c3d08760d/c=857-0-1202-616/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/02/04//1391561400000-XXX-2014-SUPER-BOWL-COCA-COLA-ITS-BEAUTIFUL03-61528350.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Coca-Cola, Super Bowl ad, America the Beautiful, immigration, assimilation, Super Bowl"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce650\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 @gobuxgalSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share AmericaFor more discussions, follow @USATOpinion or #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n(Photo: Coca-Cola)We asked readers what they thought of a Coca-Cola ad shown during the Super Bowl featuring America the Beautiful sung in eight languages.\n\u2014 @FreeStateFrankI understand that some people are upset about the ad, but it's a beautiful message.\nComments from Twitter and Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:I thought it was a beautiful, edgy statement reflective of the diversity of America.\n\u2014 Arlington AndrewsThe ad was beautiful."}
