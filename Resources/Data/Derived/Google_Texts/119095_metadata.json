And it\u2019s got lead \u2013 so obviously it\u2019s super-bad, but addictive. It\u2019s not so much the taste, it\u2019s more that they like the head rush and stuff.\u201d\n\nWhile chewing tobacco is hardly new, a recently released study found students in Grades 6 to 12 are getting hooked by flavouring in tobacco.\n\nAccording to a study released by the University of Waterloo, 46% of 117,000 students surveyed in 2010-2011 used a form of flavoured tobacco within 30 days of the poll.\n\nOf 54,200 youths using flavoured tobacco, the study found cigarillos were the top choice, followed by menthol cigarettes, flavoured cigars, chewing tobacco and shisha (molasses-based tobacco).\n\nThe study\u2019s author Steve Manske, a senior scientist at and research associate professor in Applied Health Sciences at the University of Waterloo, said the provincial and federal governments have left too many loopholes open to the tobacco industry.\n\nThe federal Tobacco Act was amended in 2010 to prohibit flavours in cigarettes, cigarillos and blunt wraps, with an exception for menthol. Cigarillos are defined as cigars weighing 1.4 grams or less or having a cigarette filter.\n\nHowever, many tobacco companies have avoided this definition by increasing the weight to more than 1.4 grams, which allows them to continue to add flavours to the product, Manske said.\n\n\u201cWe really need legislation that closes those loopholes,\u201d Manske said. \u201cThe other concern is tobacco companies were able to get menthol exempted. The argument was, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make a difference and kids don\u2019t really use it anyway.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis data shows that 32% of kids that smoke cigarettes actually use menthol cigarettes, which is so dramatically different than the adults,\u201d he added.\n\nAnti-smoking organizations have jumped on the bandwagon, calling for an outright ban on flavoured tobacco.\n\nMichael Perley, of the Ontario Campaign for Action on Tobacco, said: \u201cIf you look at the products and saw them in a retail store \u2013 the flavours of cherry, vanilla, strawberry fields \u2013 they not only have names that remind people of Fruit Roll-Ups or other candy products, they look like them.\n\n\u201cIf my kid comes home with one of these, I\u2019m not necessarily going to know it has anything to do with tobacco. They\u2019re cheaper than buying a premium brand of cigarettes.\u201d\n\nOntario Health Minister Deb Matthews said the province has a plan to set \u201can aggressive target\u201d to have the lowest smoking rates in the country.\n\n\u201cWe know that a lot of kids start smoking by using flavoured tobacco products. This is something we\u2019re very concerned about,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI continue to support the need for a federal response to this issue, but in the absence of federal action, the Ontario government is considering how best to address youth use of flavoured tobacco products.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout one of two people using tobacco on an ongoing basis is going to die,\u201d Manske said. \u201cThat means 27,000 kids are going to have an early death. To me, that\u2019s a whole lot of people that is easily prevented.\u201d\n\nHealth Canada spokesman Sean Upton said the department is aware of the issue and continues to evaluate the impact of recent tobacco marketing trends, especially on youth.\n\n\u201cIf Health Canada determines that the tobacco industry continues to market tobacco products, including these modified cigarillos (and) little cigars, to Canadian youth, the government will take appropriate action,\u201d said Upton in an e-mail statement.\n\nPart of the government\u2019s restrictions also require little cigars and blunt wraps be packaged in minimum quantities of at least 20 units \u2013 a measure that ended an industry practice of selling these products in single units and \u201ckiddy-packs\u201d that are affordable to youth.\n\nHealth Canada\u2019s tobacco inspectors seized 28 million units of flavoured little cigars that were not compliant with the Act in Jan. 2012, Upton said.\n\nAn official with Montreal-based Casa Cubana \u2013 which imports and distributes flavoured tobacco products \u2013 said tobacco companies aren\u2019t targeting kids and blamed anti-smoking interest groups for trying to quash the tobacco industry.\n\n\u201c(The Waterloo study) is tantamount to an outright lie,\u201d argued Luc Martial, vice-president of government affairs for Casa Cubana. \u201cIt\u2019s really misinforming the public and government, and then government feel they have to do something to protect children, and who doesn\u2019t want to protect children?\u201d\n\nMartial said the complaints surrounding flavoured tobacco products aren\u2019t because of product design, but rather access.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting access six times more to non-flavoured tobacco products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market for flavoured tobacco products is less than 1% in the market in all of Canada. Our market is legal age consumers. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always saying (lobby groups are) sounding the alarm.\u201d\n\nMichael Hegyi, owner of Thomas Hinds Tobacconist on Cumberland St., a Yorkville landmark for 21 years, said a ban on flavoured tobacco could affect his business.\n\n\u201cA ban would affect the whole industry,\u201d said Hegyi, adding he doesn\u2019t sell to anyone under 19. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chunk of sales going towards those products.\u201d\n\nBack at the arena, Jamie said an older friend has developed lesions in his mouth from chewing tobacco for so long.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of guys whose gum lines have started to retract and started to rot away,\u201d he said. \u201cHis gums are trashed. He hasn\u2019t gone to a dentist. It\u2019s a really dirty habit.\u201d\n\nDr. Jonathan Irish, chief of surgical oncology at Princess Margaret Hospital, said flavoured tobacco can contribute to throat and oral cancer, which can develop over the course of 20 to 30 years, depending on how much tobacco was consumed.\n\nThe first signs of oral cancer include a non-healing sore on the tongue for three weeks that won\u2019t go away. Treatment involves surgery and possibly removing the tongue.\n\n\u201cThe concept that (flavoured tobacco) might be safer is an illusion,\u201d said Irish. \u201cYou\u2019re just wrapping it up with a different wrap, but the end result is going to be the same \u2013 tobacco \u2013 and the end result is cancer.\u201d\n\nIn his Yorkville office, Perley examines the colourful packages of cigarillos, Arabic shisha and miniature cigars. Some have small labels similar to the warning pictures you can find on regular cigarettes.\n\nHowever, the ingredients are rarely listed on many of these products. One tin of chewing tobacco was show to contain 0.012 mg. of Nitrosamines, .0004 mg. of lead and 27.5 mg. of nicotine.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, if we have nearly 60,000 Ontario kids using these products, it\u2019s something we want to get rid of,\u201d said Perley.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Toronto Sun", "description": "Jamie unlaces his skates and prepares to decompress after a gruelling hockey practice.", "title": "Flavoured tobacco is hooking our kids into the habit, study shows", "url": "http://www.torontosun.com/2013/10/19/flavoured-tobacco-is-hooking-our-kids-into-the-habit-study-shows?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Flavoured tobacco is hooking our kids into the habit, study shows", "image": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297481329573_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464089634132&size=100x", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "Jamie unlaces his skates and prepares to decompress after a gruelling hockey practice.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "pinterest": "nopin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce74d\"", "article_summary": "Of 54,200 youths using flavoured tobacco, the study found cigarillos were the top choice, followed by menthol cigarettes, flavoured cigars, chewing tobacco and shisha (molasses-based tobacco).\nAn official with Montreal-based Casa Cubana \u2013 which imports and distributes flavoured tobacco products \u2013 said tobacco companies aren\u2019t targeting kids and blamed anti-smoking interest groups for trying to quash the tobacco industry.\n\u201cThe market for flavoured tobacco products is less than 1% in the market in all of Canada.\n\u201cWe know that a lot of kids start smoking by using flavoured tobacco products.\nAnti-smoking organizations have jumped on the bandwagon, calling for an outright ban on flavoured tobacco."}
