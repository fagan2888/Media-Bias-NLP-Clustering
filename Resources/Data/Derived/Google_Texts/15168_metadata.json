On Wednesday, the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise released a hard-hitting ad tying the Ohio governor to liberal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cWhich presidential candidate voted with Nancy Pelosi to cut troop levels and military funding? And supported expanding Obamacare? If you guessed Bernie Sanders, you\u2019re half right. It\u2019s also John Kasich,\u201d says the ad, which pairs images of the Ohio governor and Vermont senator.\n\n\u201cKasich also had the worst rating of spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat,\u201d it adds. \u201cAnd he jokes that he ought to run as a Democrat. But with Kasich\u2019s record, maybe he should.\u201d\n\nSpokespersons for Right to Rise and the Kasich campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A media buying source said the commercial was set to run in several markets covering South Carolina, including Charleston.\n\nIn South Carolina, Bush has directed most of his fire toward Marco Rubio, his chief rival in the establishment lane, and Donald Trump. Yet he has also gone after Kasich. Following the Ohio governor\u2019s second-place showing in the New Hampshire primary, Bush has repeatedly criticized Kasich for his decision to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe former Florida governor has gone all out in South Carolina \u2014 a state seen as central to his fortunes. He has campaigned with his brother, former President George W. Bush, and will also appear with his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush.\n\nKasich\u2019s aides have conceded that he is unlikely to fare particularly well in South Carolina, a conservative Southern state that isn\u2019t a natural fit for the governor\u2019s politically moderate style. They say they are focused on Michigan, which votes on March 8. Indeed, while most candidates are camped out in South Carolina, Kasich spent the early part of this week in the Midwest.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Right to Rise releases a hard-hitting ad tying the Ohio governor to liberal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.", "title": "Bush-backing super PAC goes after Kasich", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/south-carolina-primary-2016-live-updates-and-results/2016/02/jeb-bush-super-pac-john-kasich-219401", "image": "http://static.politico.com/f4/72/c4dc9c784fa6bcafdb8d23d539f6/160217-jeb-bush-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Right to Rise releases a hard-hitting ad tying the Ohio governor to liberal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, while most candidates are camped out in South Carolina, Kasich spent the early part of this week in the Midwest.\n| AP Photo Bush-backing super PAC goes after KasichJeb Bush, who\u2019s counting on a strong showing in South Carolina, is increasingly turning his fire on a rival who could cause him problems there: John Kasich.\nIn South Carolina, Bush has directed most of his fire toward Marco Rubio, his chief rival in the establishment lane, and Donald Trump.\nOn Wednesday, the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise released a hard-hitting ad tying the Ohio governor to liberal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\nIt\u2019s also John Kasich,\u201d says the ad, which pairs images of the Ohio governor and Vermont senator."}
