The rise of expensive oral oncolytics has made it more challenging for patients to pay for their prescription drugs, though the closing of the Medicare coverage gap\u2014the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d\u2014is expected to increase access to care for individuals with Medicare Part D prescription coverage, Patt said.In addition, oncologists need to be aware of what the so-called Cadillac tax on high-end insurance coverage will do, Patt said. \u201cThe natural consequence of this 40% excise tax is many employers will eliminate their high cost plans and have lower cost plans,\u201d she said. She noted that many unionized workers enjoy coverage from these high-end plans and will be affected, too. The tax goes into effect in 2018.Medicaid expansion has extended care to many oncology patients, but the poorest states with the largest populations of uninsured have held back on participating, Patt said. \u201cIf Texas were to expand Medicaid, think of what the natural consequence would be if the federal government stopped paying for so much of it,\u201d she said. \u201cEither education costs would be decreased or the budget would have to be decreased or tax would have to increase.\u201dAt the time of this writing, 31 states had adopted Medicaid expansion, allowing people under age 65 at 133% or lower of the federal poverty threshold to receive coverage. States that have not adopted include Patt\u2019s home state of Texas, Maine, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, and Mississippi. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge burden to the Southern states,\u201d she said, noting that Texas has a population of 27 million and about 14 percent of the uninsured in the US.The failure of poor states to implement Medicaid expansion under ACA accounts for what Patt called a disappointing dent in the uninsured population in the US. In 2008 it dipped as low as 14.4% of the population, then gradually climbed to 18% by late 2013, aided by recessionary forces. It now stands at 11.4%, lower than in 2008, but not as much as was anticipated, considering the downward boost the rate should have gotten from ACA, Patt said.\u201cI saw 4 patients without insurance with local advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the last 2 weeks in Austin. It\u2019s such a challenge. It\u2019s really such a hardship,\u201d Patt said.DYSRIP programs under the Section 1115 Waiver extend care to uninsured populations, but their mechanisms are \u201celusive,\u201d and it\u2019s essential for physicians to understand these better, Patt said. \u201cI think our patients will be better served if we can be effective advocates to help them get what they need.\u201d DYSRIP funds took her by surprise when she suddenly saw more patient navigators in her local hospital, wondered why, and then found out they were paid for with DYSRIP money.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "healthcare reform,medicare,Us-Oncology,value based care,", "description": "Many healthcare reforms are dramatically changing the payment landscape for oncologists."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa15\"", "article_summary": "States that have not adopted include Patt\u2019s home state of Texas, Maine, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, and Mississippi.\nShe noted that many unionized workers enjoy coverage from these high-end plans and will be affected, too.\n\u201cThe natural consequence of this 40% excise tax is many employers will eliminate their high cost plans and have lower cost plans,\u201d she said.\nIn 2008 it dipped as low as 14.4% of the population, then gradually climbed to 18% by late 2013, aided by recessionary forces.\n\u201cIf Texas were to expand Medicaid, think of what the natural consequence would be if the federal government stopped paying for so much of it,\u201d she said."}
