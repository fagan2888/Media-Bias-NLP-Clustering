And both are under a lot of pressure from Congress and the Obama administration to figure out a unified response to high drug prices.\n\nAlmost every sector of the health care industry \u2014 including insurers and drug makers \u2014 eventually got on board with the Affordable Care Act back in 2010. Everybody took a hit, some more than others, but everybody got something in return. The buy-in from those influential groups helped get the law over the finish line. Analysts say the same acquiescence from outside interests is likely necessary for any legislation dealing with prescription drug costs to have a chance of passing.\n\n\u201cUnless there are creative new ideas that cross the two industries, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a solution,\u201d said Dan Mendelson, a former Clinton administration health official who now heads Avalere Health, a consulting firm based in Washington. \u201cI would believe that something real will happen when the [pharmaceutical] and insurance industries come together and agree on a set of solutions.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to the key players \u2014 and their agendas.\n\nHealth insurers\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, a reserved, unflappable former hospital executive, took over at America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the prominent health insurance lobby, in August. Six months earlier, she had resigned as the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which made her one of the top federal officials overseeing the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTavenner provides an undeniable gravitas to AHIP, as one of the biggest names in health policy, with respect from both sides of the aisle. But she also brings some baggage as one of the public faces most identified with Obamacare in a Congress currently controlled by Republicans.\n\nIn an interview with STAT, Tavenner described her goals this way: Stop the public relations battle with the drug lobbying group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America over who deserves the blame for drug prices. And start a constructive dialogue about how to fix it.\n\nHealth insurers want to work with drug makers, but they expect major concessions.\n\nShortly after Stephen Ubl was named new head of the PhRMA lobby in September, Tavenner reached out to him, offering a sit-down to get acquainted. This month, they met for breakfast at Poste, an upscale French bistro in downtown Washington.\n\nThe escalating public anger over drug costs has nudged people on all sides of the issue to look for chances to talk constructively. \u201cIt\u2019s forcing a dialogue,\u201d Tavenner said.\n\nIn terms of approaching lawmakers with a plan on pricing, she said, \u201cI would want to go to PhRMA first and see if there\u2019s something that we can take together as an initial solution. That would be my preference.\u201d\n\nNot that she\u2019s going to start pulling punches.\n\nTavenner said the insurance lobby was staffing up, creating a team dedicated to drug pricing at the group\u2019s Washington offices, just a few blocks north of the National Mall. Every time a headline about the latest drug-price hike explodes, her communications team blasts out a release to reporters portraying pharma companies as out of control.\n\nAnd she expects her potential partners at PhRMA to make some major concessions.\n\nTavenner\u2019s stance is simple: The insurance industry took a bigger hit under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. Its market was significantly overhauled. So this time, it\u2019s pharma\u2019s turn.\n\n\u201cI would argue that [insurance] plans have definitely undergone a fundamental change,\u201d Tavenner said, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure PhRMA\u2019s there yet.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the health care law\u2019s requirement that health plans disclose how much of their premiums are spent on actual health care, as opposed to administrative costs or profits. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t that apply to PhRMA?\u201d she asked.\n\nSome in Washington think Tavenner could help tip the scales of the debate more in the insurance lobby\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve seen the insurers in a very organized way begin to come after PhRMA,\u201d said Kathleen Sebelius, the former health and human services secretary who worked alongside Tavenner in the Obama administration. \u201cMarilyn is certainly savvy about global politics and parochial politics.\u201d\n\nDrug makers\n\nUbl, who started his career in Washington working for Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, assumed his post at the beginning of November, coming over from the Advanced Medical Technology Association, where he had spent the last five years campaigning vigorously for the repeal of the health care law\u2019s medical device tax.\n\nThe cache of goodwill he accumulated in that role could prove useful: He persuaded a bipartisan majority that the tax needs to be repealed. It hasn\u2019t actually happened yet, complicated by the bigger fight over the law, but most observers in Washington think it has a good chance of getting done in the coming years. Ubl can take the credit for that.\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s very astute in knowing where different members\u2019 interests may lie,\u201d said former Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, a Democrat. Bayh cited Ubl\u2019s success in recruiting Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the staunchest liberals in Congress, to support medical device tax repeal.\n\n\u201cPeople around Washington get a reputation for being straight shooters or not, and he clearly is the former,\u201d Bayh said.\n\nBut now Ubl is moving into a much bigger spotlight.\n\nThe device industry is still new to the Washington scene. Drug makers, by contrast, have one of the most experienced and influential lobbies, with big expectations about getting their way. The independent research firm APCO Insight recently ranked PhRMA, and its $200 million annual budget, as the most effective lobbying group in the nation\u2019s capitol.\n\nPhRMA officials in interviews emphasized their interest in working with insurers to find workable policies. But they also spent a lot of time reiterating how much health plans have changed under the Affordable Care Act, leading to consumers paying more of their own money for drugs.\n\n\u201cMedicines that truly represent value should merit a larger price.\u201d Lori Reilly, PhRMA\n\n\u201cThey are paying more, but not all of that is in relation to us and our products,\u201d said Lori Reilly, PhRMA\u2019s executive vice president for policy and research. \u201cThat\u2019s in relation to how the system is changing and how the insurance benefit design has changed in a way that doesn\u2019t always help patients.\u201d\n\nDrug makers want to turn the conversation to one of value \u2014 in particular, the value that they say their medicines provide by preventing people from getting sicker. That not only helps the patient but could save money for society in the long run, they argue.\n\nIf a breakthrough new drug comes to market, Reilly said, \u201cwill it have a big price tag? It might. If we really are moving toward a value-based health care system, then medicines that truly represent value should merit a larger price, and we\u2019re comfortable with saying that should be the case.\u201d\n\nSo what now?\n\nNobody is expecting any major legislation before a new Congress and president are sworn in in 2017. So for now, both sides are publicly posturing, trying to position themselves for backroom negotiations if and when the nitty-gritty work of drafting a bill gets underway.\n\nPolitical momentum might force the groups into the alliance that Tavenner and PhRMA are weighing. Recent polling has found that drug affordability is Americans\u2019 number-one health care concern, and politicians are responding accordingly.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services convened a forum on drug prices last week that included top officials from both industries. The star panel featured Merck chief executive officer Kenneth Frazier, who also happens to chair the PhRMA lobby, and Kaiser Permanente chief executive Bernard Tyson, who sits on AHIP\u2019s board.\n\nTheir differences were on full display.\n\nFrazier stressed the drug industry\u2019s commitment to value, while cautioning that it\u2019s hard to define that. Tyson argued that the drug market must be overhauled because, in the end, a drug company can price a medication however it wants.\n\n\u201cTo me, that says we\u2019re not on a level playing field yet. That\u2019s what the government should be looking at,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the whole ecosystem.\u201d\n\nRumors are already flying around Washington about possible steps the Obama administration might take in its last year to address drug costs. The drug-price plans from presidential candidates like Hillary Clinton include policies that both insurers and drug makers don\u2019t like \u2014 the kind of gut check that might bring them to the table.\n\nOld habits die hard, though. Even as leaders in both lobbies talk about a kumbaya moment, shots are still being fired. Earlier this month, a drug industry-backed group put out a report accusing health insurers of \u201chiding profits to justify raising prices.\u201d\n\nJust a few hours later, Tavenner\u2019s group released a report of its own, asserting that drug companies \u201ccontinue to demand a blank check, driving up costs across the board for everyone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pharmaceutical industry and insurance plan lobbies have opposing agendas, but are under pressure to work together to bring down drug prices.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "The pharmaceutical industry and insurance plan lobbies have opposing agendas, but are under pressure to work together to bring down drug prices.", "title": "Drug makers and insurance plans eye alliance on drug prices", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Marilyn-Tavenner_AP-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2015-11-24T08:49:54-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/24/drug-prices-health-insurers/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "The pharmaceutical industry and insurance plan lobbies have opposing agendas, but are under pressure to work together to bring down drug prices.", "creator": "@dylanlscott", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Marilyn-Tavenner_AP-1024x576.jpg", "title": "Drug makers and insurance plans eye alliance on drug prices", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "published_time": "2015-11-24T05:00:21-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dylanlscott13", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2015-11-24T08:49:54-04:00", "tag": "prescription drugs"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "insurance, lobbying, prescription drugs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfaa\"", "article_summary": "Health insurersMarilyn Tavenner, a reserved, unflappable former hospital executive, took over at America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the prominent health insurance lobby, in August.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With rising drug prices such a hot topic here, drug makers and health insurers are both coming under heavy fire.\nDrug makers, by contrast, have one of the most experienced and influential lobbies, with big expectations about getting their way.\nAlmost every sector of the health care industry \u2014 including insurers and drug makers \u2014 eventually got on board with the Affordable Care Act back in 2010.\nHealth insurers want to work with drug makers, but they expect major concessions."}
