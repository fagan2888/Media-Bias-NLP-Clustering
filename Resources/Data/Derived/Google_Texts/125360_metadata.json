(Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress may have passed a budget resolution last week, but Democratic leaders say they are girding for a possible confrontation with Republicans over the omnibus spending bill after their Republican counterparts refused to rule out legislative policy riders.\n\nJust as the Pentagon and defense industry were able to breathe a sigh of relief over the budget deal, which gives the Defense Department nearly everything it wanted, Democratic leaders insisted that controversial policy riders \u2014 \u201cpoison pills\u201d \u2014 would cost their support and could lead to a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThere are things they want to do like repeal Obamacare, go after Planned Parenthood, that the president would literally veto, putting us back in the soup without a resolution to this problem,\u201d Assistant Senate Minority Leader Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said of congressional Republicans.\n\nBeyond the budget deal, which eased sequestration budget caps and suspended the debt ceiling for two years, House and Senate appropriators will need to pass an omnibus spending bill, or 12 appropriations bills, by Dec. 11, to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Sen. Harry Reid and Democratic leaders in the Senate voiced fears that Republicans, who offered little support for the budget deal, will use controversial riders to try to derail it.\n\n\u201cDemocrats stand united against any shutdown riders that have no chance of being signed into law,\u201d Reid, D-Nev., told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch with the White House this morning and the president agrees with what we plan to do.\u201d\n\nThe comments came after Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., separately refused to rule out another confrontation with Democrats over riders.\n\n\u201cThis is the legislative branch and the power of the purse rests within the legislative branch, and we fully expect that we're going to exercise that power,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nMcConnell, who has previously vowed there would be no government shutdown, downplayed the issue\u2019s significance.\n\n\u201cRiders in appropriations bills are quite common,\u201d McConnell told reporters. \u201cThe Democrats will have some, too. Of course, there will be some riders in the appropriation bills.\u201d\n\nAsked what riders Democrats are considering, Reid told reporters, \"we're not looking for riders.\"\n\nOtherwise, Reid was optimistic about the appropriations process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that if we move and the Republicans work with us to get an omnibus bill done, I think we can work out the poison pill riders they\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d he said.\n\nEmail: jgould@defensenews.com\n\nTwitter: @reporterjoe\n\nRead or Share this story: http://defnews.ly/1MxdhVH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The possibility of legislative policy riders by Republicans have raised the possibility of a confrontation with Democrats.", "og": {"site_name": "Defense News", "description": "The possibility of legislative policy riders by Republicans have raised the possibility of a confrontation with Democrats.", "title": "Shutdown Fears Resurface in Congress", "url": "http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/budget/2015/11/03/shutdown-fears-resurface-congress/75115566/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/defensenews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The possibility of legislative policy riders by Republicans have raised the possibility of a confrontation with Democrats.", "title": "Shutdown Fears Resurface in Congress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/81006a860f181fea7b5053aa6c53fab12a3e1c61/r=x643&c=640x640/http/cdn.tegna-tv.com/-mm-/901096085cd801a397a6d70d9c8a9ddc638e6c94/c=654-0-2654-2000/local/-/media/2015/11/03/DefenseNews/DefenseNews/635821704227811620-DFn-US-ryan-mconnell.jpg", "creator": "@defense_news", "site": "@defense_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=893373374", "fb": {"app_id": 1513622342188088}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "shutdown, congress, ryan, mcconnell, reid, policy riders, durbin, poison pills, Obamacare, Planned Parenthood, omnibus"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDemocrats stand united against any shutdown riders that have no chance of being signed into law,\u201d Reid, D-Nev., told reporters.\nOf course, there will be some riders in the appropriation bills.\u201dAsked what riders Democrats are considering, Reid told reporters, \"we're not looking for riders.\"\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan, left, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walk together to a Senate GOP policy luncheon on Nov. 3.\nSenate Minority Leader Sen.
