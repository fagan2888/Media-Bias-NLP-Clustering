Shore Capital Recaps Chicagoland Smile as Dental Deals Continue

Cressey & Co. and Bregal Partners have also made dentistry investments recently

Health care-focused private equity firm Shore Capital Partners has recapitalized Chicagoland Smile Group, a dental practice.

Chicagoland, headquartered in Chicago, provides general dentistry services including fillings, crowns, dentures, root canals, bridges, dental implants, teeth whitening, veneers, tooth extractions and x-rays. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

In conjunction with the recap, Shore Capital has formed Great Lakes Dental partners LLC, which will provide administrative services and support to Chicagoland.

Chicago-based Shore is making the investment from its first fund, which closed with $122.5 million in May. The firm is also invested in Summit Medical Inc., a medical device manufacturer that Shore picked up in February. In November, Shore recapitalized three animal hospitals to form Southern Veterinary Partners.

Shore isn't the only firm chomping at the dental sector. In March, PE firm Cressey & Co. LP invested in Dental Service Group, a dental laboratory network. In August, Bregal Partners teamed up with Dental Partners Inc. and announced the firm would look to buy dental practices.

Mergers & Acquisitions predicted more consolidation within the dental space back in January. For more, see Dentists Will Unite, Just Like Doctors Did.
