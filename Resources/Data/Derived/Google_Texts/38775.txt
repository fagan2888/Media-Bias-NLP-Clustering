About 3:18 a.m., Jaraad Hazel, 23, was pulling into a parking lot in the 2700 block of Woodcrest Drive when two black males brandishing handguns approached from behind and told him not to move, according to Richmond County Sher­iff’s Office report.

According to the report, it is unclear what happened next, but Hazel ended up shot and with an injury to the back of his head.

Police say a witness, Spencer Pelkey, 23, heard a gunshot followed by cries for help. Pelkey, who told police he was a nurse for the Army, provided medical attention to Hazel until help arrived. Hazel was taken to Georgia Regents Medical Center.

The suspects were last seen in a white SUV. One wore a black hooded sweatshirt and the other wore a white T-shirt.
