I am not talking about the Republicans\u2019 record unpopularity. I am not talking about declining support for the tea party. I am not even talking about election results.\n\nI am focusing on the following numbers: 85, 49, 87 and 87 again.\n\nThose are not Powerball numbers ... well, in a sense maybe they are!\n\nWhat are they? These are the \"YES\" votes from Republican members of the House of Representatives on four pieces of legislation that Speaker John Boehner brought to the floor of the House, ignoring the Hastert rule. That, of course, is the rather absurd self-imposed rule that says you shouldn\u2019t bring up a bill if it does not have majority support from your caucus.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nHere are the bills:\n\n85 Republican votes to approve the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012.\n\n49 Republican votes to approve emergency funding for hurricane Sandy.\n\n87 Republican votes to approve extending the Violence Against Women Act.\n\n87 Republican votes to approve opening the government this week.\n\nCombined with nearly unanimous support from Democrats, all these bills passed.\n\nNow, that meant that 151 votes, 179 votes, 138 votes and 144 votes were cast against these four bills, respectively, by Republican House members.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the tea party.]\n\nThe point here is that the problem with Republicans is not just several dozen Tea Party activists \u2013 it is a caucus that won\u2019t truly stand up to those extreme elements of the party. Too much attention is being paid to the gladiator TV hard core \"stars\" of the Republican Party such as Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and Reps. Raul Labrador, Michele Bachmann, Steve King and a handful of others.\n\nThey have somehow convinced the House Republican caucus that the best way to take on Obama and the Democrats is scorched earth.\n\nThe real question now is whether the pragmatic, reasoned, responsible gene present in many Republican House members will assert itself. Will they negotiate bills on fiscal matters, immigration reform, entitlements and taxes that lead to progress? Or will they let the tea party members role them over and over again?\n\nThe hope for many is that this horrendous shutdown and brinkmanship may have taken many members to the edge \u2013 they see the absurdity and suicidal nature of the action \u2013 and they are ready to stand up to the extremists within their own party. When we start seeing the numbers switch and more than 100 Republican members begin to accept reasonable legislation then we will know that they are no longer going to kow-tow to the Tea Party. We can all hope for that day.\n\nRead Robert Schlesinger: Jim DeMint\u2019s Silly 2012 \u2018Mistrial\u2019 Argument on Obamacare\n\nRead Peter Roff: GM and the Obama Administration Took Taxpayers for a Ride", "article_metadata": {"zone": "Peter-Fenn/blogentries", "keyword": "tea party", "title": "House Republicans Have Problems Beyond the Tea Party", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-fenn/2013/10/18/house-republicans-have-problems-beyond-the-tea-party", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "The GOP's problem goes beyond a few dozen tea party members.", "title": "Will the GOP Moderates Please Stand Up?"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The GOP's problem goes beyond a few dozen tea party members.", "card": "summary", "title": "House Republicans Have Problems Beyond the Tea Party"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Oct. 18, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": ", column,politics, blogs,Fenn, Peter,Republican Party,House of Representatives, thomas jefferson street,peter fenn,tea party,Peter Fenn,Peter Fenn,House of Representatives,Republican Party,politics,tea party", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The GOP's problem goes beyond a few dozen tea party members."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd58\"", "article_summary": "Or will they let the tea party members role them over and over again?\nThe point here is that the problem with Republicans is not just several dozen Tea Party activists \u2013 it is a caucus that won\u2019t truly stand up to those extreme elements of the party.\nThe real question now is whether the pragmatic, reasoned, responsible gene present in many Republican House members will assert itself.\nNow, that meant that 151 votes, 179 votes, 138 votes and 144 votes were cast against these four bills, respectively, by Republican House members.\nToo much attention is being paid to the gladiator TV hard core \"stars\" of the Republican Party such as Sens."}
