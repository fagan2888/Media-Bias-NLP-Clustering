The company reports year over year growth at the rate of 400%. Now that\u2019s a lot of growth! Founder and CEO Greg Mark explains his take on what\u2019s behind the company\u2019s steady growth:\n\n\u201cOur customers are able to bring products to market faster because the Mark One prints high-strength components that endure where traditional plastics parts would just break. When we debuted this technology two years ago, our first customers were aerospace companies looking for cheaper composites, but over the last year we saw the largest growth from companies interested in high-strength, tough parts. We offer the only affordable 3D printer that prints these types of parts, and it is resonating in the market.\u201d\n\nCompetitors, look out. MarkForged Inc. is dominating many sectors with the \u201cworld\u2019s strongest 3D printed parts\u201d and is reporting the largest growth yet in 2015 for its affordable 3D printer that is very high in demand.\n\nExOne Company Reports Its Business Is Growing\n\nIn more financial news, the binder jetting 3D printing company ExOne has released shipment and fiscal information for 2015. In good news for the company, it reports that in the past year it has shipped 38 printing machines, retains a backlog of orders, and maintains a current 2015 revenue guidance of around $40 million.\n\nExOne\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, S. Kent Rockwell, states:\n\n\u201cBacklog was at record levels going into the fourth quarter and remains at high levels as we begin 2016. We are encouraged by this quarter\u2019s shipments as well as the sales mix which included more high value indirect printing machines. This quarter\u2019s shipments, combined with a strong backlog, continue to give us confidence in growing customer adoption of our binder jetting technology.\u201d\n\nClearly this news is an indication that the company\u2019s technology is catching on amongst 3D printing customers.\n\nSketchfab Hits Half-Million Upload Mark in 1,000 Days\n\nYou read the headline. Wow. People are using and obviously liking Sketchfab. What\u2019s not to like about this 3D printing service that allows you to \u201cpublish and find the best 3D content\u201d for free? When you can boast these kinds of numbers, which do speak for themselves here, it is clear that Sketchfab\u2019s business model is working. They\u2019ve had 500K models uploaded in less than 1,000 days of business \u2014 and 309,000 of those were from 2015 alone. With 21K annotated, 4K animated, and 28K downloadable models, Sketchfab is setting quite a pace. The website carries an incredible variety of models: brands, gaming, 3D artists, cultural heritage, education, makers and 3D printing, architects and designers, 3D portraits and entertainment. Are you getting the idea yet? If you haven\u2019t checked the Sketchfab site out yet, now is the time!\n\nXaar plc Has New Director of 3D Printing\n\nXaar is a world leader in industrial inkjet technology, and it recently turned a new leaf by appointing Professor Neil Hopkinson to the Director of 3D Printing position. Hopkinson invented High Speed Sintering (HSS) technology, so he has an incredible breadth of knowledge and insight to bring to the table. This comes from working for 19 years in the additive manufacturing technology field at the following institutions and companies: University of Sheffield, Loughborough University, De Montfort University, University of Nottingham, and 3D Systems.\n\nHopkins articulates a strong vision for the company in the new Director role, which includes accelerating the adaptation of his HSS technology in key sectors. Hopkins states:\n\n\u201cIndustrial 3D printing is entering an important phase of maturation and I am excited to be joining Xaar at this critical time. It is clear that inkjet printing will be an important enabling technology as the 3D printing sector scales up to be an integral part of mainstream manufacturing. As a leading supplier to printing equipment manufacturers all over the world, Xaar is in a strong position to accelerate the adoption of HSS technology within a number of key applications.\u201d\n\nA leader in 3D printing technology, it appears Hopkinson is an excellent choice to lead the company\u2019s contributions in the industrial 3D printing sector.\n\nMasterGraphics Attains \u201cPlatinum Status\u201d from Autodesk\n\nMasterGraphics , the Madison, Wisconsin-based provider of technology solutions for engineering, construction, manufacturing, architecture, and civil industries, is a company that helps streamline customer design data during the entire 3D design process. Now, with all of the company\u2019s hard work paying off, MasterGraphics reports it has reached the Autodesk Platinum Tier Value Added Reseller (VAR) status. This is quite an honor for the company, which has offices in Chicago, Appleton, and Milwaukee, because only about 10 percent of Autodesk VARs internationally have attained Platinum Tier status. What does this mean? MasterGraphics is now among one of the highest-rated companies in its industry, and we are sure to see it grow in the new year as it provides the services that Autodesk recognizes by this promotion to Platinum Status.
