Birmingham is trying to land its biggest prize in years: The 2016 Democratic National Convention.

Officials with the Democratic National Committee will arrive in Alabama's largest city Monday for a two-day visit to assess whether Birmingham could host the massive gathering.

The national representatives will meet with area promoters to discuss logistical needs like hotels and arena space. They'll also attend a public party Monday night at a downtown concert venue, and a private event is planned at the city's year-old baseball park.

The mayor's office is in charge of the city's bid, and local and state Democratic leaders say they've had hardly any involvement.

The party also is considering Cleveland, Ohio; New York; Philadelphia; and Phoenix. It plans to select a site no later than early 2015.
