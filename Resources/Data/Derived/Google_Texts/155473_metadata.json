Obamacare cancelled the policy. New rate $600/mo. Thnx Mr. President! \u2014 Dylan Ratigan (@DylanRatigan) November 8, 2013\n\nAfter receiving pushback from some of his Twitter followers, Ratigan further explained his problem with Obamacare:\n\nInterestingly core healthcare cost drivers were left intact. I.e. fee-for-service. Insurance monopolies etc. \u2014 Dylan Ratigan (@DylanRatigan) November 8, 2013\n\n\u201c@12jc: You're just trying to protect against crippling medical expenses but willing to accept normal medical costs\u201d This is illegal now? \u2014 Dylan Ratigan (@DylanRatigan) November 8, 2013\n\nI have been a long time advocate of catastrophic with a transparent mkt for routine. Struck me as interesting that that is illegal now. \u2014 Dylan Ratigan (@DylanRatigan) November 8, 2013\n\nFrom any perspective we still haven't addressed the underlying COST of healthcare. All of this will get more screwy until we do. \u2014 Dylan Ratigan (@DylanRatigan) November 8, 2013\n\nFortunately for Ratigan, he gets a consolation prize for having to pay more than three times more per month for his health insurance: a presidential apology. In an interview with NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd Thursday, Obama apologized to Ratigan and the millions of other Americans he lied to when he promised, while flacking for his health care law, \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it. Period.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,\u201d Obama said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and that we\u2019re going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.\u201d\n\nDespite the apology, Obama continued to downplay how many people will be forced off the insurance they like as a result of Obamacare, saying it was a very small number. Other estimates suggest that more than 129 million Americans may not be able to keep their previous health care plan if Obamacare is fully implemented.\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Former MSNBC host Dylan Ratigan doesn't like how President Obama's health care law is caring for him.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Former MSNBC host Dylan Ratigan doesn't like how President Barack Obama's health care law is caring for him.
