Throughout the President\u2019s tenure, Republicans fabricated one phony debt crisis after another to cripple the government\u2019s ability to operate and keep the economy stagnating regardless the damage to the people. In fact, it is safe to say obstructing governance, and democracy, has been the Republicans\u2019 only goal for four straight years.\n\nNow that the government is due to run out of operating funds and hit its debt limit, Republicans have created another crisis over funding the government, paying the nation\u2019s debt, and a three year-old health law they claim is an existential threat to the nation. However, the looming threat of a government shutdown and credit default Republicans promise are not about spending, debt and deficit, or even the Affordable Care Act; it is about ending the nation\u2019s representative democracy and ushering in fascism and rule by oligarchy.\n\nAfter the 2008 election Republicans acted as if they won control of Congress and the White House, and attempted to thwart President Obama and Democrats attempt to govern the nation. They have persisted in that vein throughout the President\u2019s tenure and it drove credit rating agency S&P to downgrade America\u2019s credit because \u201cRepublican political brinkmanship had shown evidence of America\u2019s governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable.\u201d When Republicans revealed their ransom demands to raise the debt ceiling on Wednesday, they exposed their disregard for democracy and revealed their only goal is fundamentally transforming the way America is governed; even if they have to decimate the economy to achieve their goal.\n\nIt is obvious that Republicans reject the results of the last election or they would not threaten to rule by destroying the nation\u2019s economy. Americans should not underestimate the Republicans\u2019 threat because there is just enough support for a default that analysts including Chris Krueger from Guggenheim Partners, warned on Wednesday that \u201cthere is a 40% chance of a credit default scenario as a result of the looming fight over raising the debt ceiling.\u201d Krueger did not inspire confidence that Republicans will pull back their threat because he continued that \u201cthe path forward on the debt ceiling remains a total mystery and our 60% probability that the U.S. will not enter into default is based on nothing more than blind faith.\u201d Krueger\u2019s blind faith aside, there are an overwhelming number of Republican and teabag voters supporting a default, and enough congressional Republicans willing to vote against raising the debt limit that the 40% figure is a serious threat to the nation\u2019s economy. Crashing the economy may seem risky for demanding enactment of their agenda, but Republicans are intent on satisfying their wealth donors\u2019 vision for America.\n\nThe Republican list of demands for raising the debt ceiling has nothing to do with the nation\u2019s debt, and everything to do with implementing every single Republican legislative proposal for the past two years and the RNC platform voters rejected last November. Whether it is eliminating the EPA\u2019s regulatory oversight, \u201crepealing Obamacare,\u201d eliminating the financial reform law, tax reform according to the Ryan budget, raiding federal employee\u2019s pensions, or approving the Keystone XL pipeline, the ransom demands are a reiteration of Willard Romney\u2019s first day to-do list had he won the presidency. The ransom demands represent the nation\u2019s agenda if Republicans ran the government, but since they are not in charge they have made blowing up the economy a \u201cvalid legislative strategy\u201d to rule unchallenged and contrary to the will of the voters.\n\nWhat Americans are witnessing from Republicans and Koch teabagger extremists is an attempted bloodless (for now) coup d\u2019\u00e9tat with the full faith and credit of the United States the price to pay for adhering to the Constitution\u2019s mandate for running the government. Republicans are mesmerized by nihilists in the extremist conservative movement who believe that America\u2019s form of government, and its Constitution, are worthless and so detestable that they have to be destroyed to give wealthy oligarchs power to dictate which laws are enacted according to their fascist vision. Boehner said as much a couple of months ago when he told an interviewer that Republicans primary goal is repealing laws their corporate donors oppose, and the list of ransom demands represent policies Wall Street and the Koch fascists lust for in their \u201cfundamentally transformed\u201d vision of America.\n\nThe Koch brothers, ALEC, and libertarian wing of the party have long plotted to dismantle the government departments they regard as standing in their way of controlling the course of the nation, and they found willing assistance from ignorant racists in the teabagger movement to support the fascist takeover. In 1944, Henry A. Wallace defined an American fascist as one who puts money and power ahead of human beings and uses demagogues and stooges as fronts for the power behind the scenes. In 2013, stooges and demagogues are the likes of Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, and Mike Lee who are fronts for Wall Street and the Koch brothers who are calling the shots behind the scenes.\n\nRepublicans, Wall Street, and the Koch brothers lost the last two Presidential elections, and for the President\u2019s first term they behaved like petulant little brats who took their basketball and stopped the game because they were losing. Now, Republicans and their wealthy backers are willing to puncture the ball, blow up the basketball court, and gun down innocent bystanders on their way home to pout if they lose the debt limit game. It is not governance; it is a group of angry losers willing to destroy the nation\u2019s economy because the other side won the last election and the voters retained the President who demands the nation be governed according to the Constitution and not the libertarian vision of a transformed America controlled by a fascist regime.\n\nThe current debt limit and funding crisis are about subverting democracy and ushering in fascism under cover of \u201cprotecting Americans from Obamacare\u201d and \u201creforming successful government programs,\u201d and have nothing to do with governing according to the Constitution. Republicans, or the Koch brothers, are not running the government, but one would not know it based on their threat to enact their platform or cause a devastating credit default. America has functioned as a representative democracy for 226 years, but Republicans refuse to accept the voters will and appear ready to crash the economy unless their party platform is enacted under duress. President Obama said, \u201cIf we continue to set a precedent in which a president \u2014 any president, a Republican president, a Democratic president \u2014 where the opposing party controls the House of Representatives, if that president is in a situation in which each time the United States is called upon to pay its bills the other party can simply sit there and say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re not gonna pay the bills unless you give us what we want,\u2019 that changes the constitutional structure of this government entirely.\u201d\n\nThe President is right, and hopefully he understands that Republicans and their fascist supporters want to change the structure of this government from the constitutionally mandated representative democracy to fascism by oligarchs. With a 40% chance of Republicans following through on their threat of a credit default, one hopes the President has a plan to save the economy because with only a 60% chance America resolves its debt obligation unscathed, it will take more than blind faith to hope America survives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The  threat of a government shutdown and credit default Republicans promise are not about spending, debt and deficit, or even the ACA; it is about ending the nation's representative democracy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The  threat of a government shutdown and credit default Republicans promise are not about spending, debt and deficit, or even the ACA; it is about ending the nation's representative democracy.", "title": "Republican Fascists Will Stop at Nothing Less Than Ending Our Representative Democracy", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/27/republican-fascists-stop-representative-democracy.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fascism-3.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-27T20:13:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Chris Krueger,Environmental Protection Agency,Fascism,financial reform law,Keystone XL Pipeline,Political philosophy,Republican Party,Ted Cruz,United States debt-ceiling crisis,Willard Romney,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-09-27T20:13:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-27T20:13:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Chris Krueger, Environmental Protection Agency, Fascism, financial reform law, Keystone XL Pipeline, Political philosophy, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, United States debt-ceiling crisis, Willard Romney"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec2e\"", "article_summary": "In fact, it is safe to say obstructing governance, and democracy, has been the Republicans\u2019 only goal for four straight years.\nIt is obvious that Republicans reject the results of the last election or they would not threaten to rule by destroying the nation\u2019s economy.\nThe Republican list of demands for raising the debt ceiling has nothing to do with the nation\u2019s debt, and everything to do with implementing every single Republican legislative proposal for the past two years and the RNC platform voters rejected last November.\nHowever, the looming threat of a government shutdown and credit default Republicans promise are not about spending, debt and deficit, or even the Affordable Care Act; it is about ending the nation\u2019s representative democracy and ushering in fascism and rule by oligarchy.\nAmerica has functioned as a representative democracy for 226 years, but Republicans refuse to accept the voters will and appear ready to crash the economy unless their party platform is enacted under duress."}
