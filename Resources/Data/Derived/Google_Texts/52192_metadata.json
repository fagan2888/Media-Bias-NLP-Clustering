(AP) \u2014 Ten sheriff\u2019s deputies in Southern California have been put on leave after several of them were shown on video kicking and punching a man following a 2\u00bd-hour chase involving a stolen horse.\n\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said Friday that the video \u201cdisturbed and troubled\u201d him and appeared to show an excessive use of force.\n\nMcMahon announced the action after 30-year-old Francis Pusok was arrested Thursday by deputies in a violent encounter filmed by a KNBC-TV helicopter (http://bit.ly/1H8UC3D). Pusok fled by car and then on the horse, traveling several miles while deputies chased him on foot after trying to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation.\n\nThe video shows Pusok, dressed in bright red clothing, falling from the horse as a deputy ran up and fired a Taser. McMahon said the Taser was believed to be ineffective because of Pusok\u2019s loose clothing.\n\nAs pursuing deputies reached him, Pusok was face down with his arms and legs outstretched and hands behind his back. One deputy kicked him in the head or shoulder area and punched him, and another kicked him in the crotch. Other deputies arrived moments later.\n\nMcMahon said internal and criminal investigations are under way. The FBI announced Friday it was starting a civil rights investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking for some patience while we complete a thorough and fair investigation,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cI am disturbed and troubled by what I see in the video. It does not appear to be in line with our policies and procedures.\n\n\u201cI assure you, if there is criminal doing on the part of any of our deputy sheriffs or any policy violations, we will take action.\u201d\n\nMcMahon said the department received multiple threats after the video was aired. He said names of the deputies, including a sergeant and a detective, won\u2019t be released until the threats are checked out. The deputies were place on paid administrative leave.\n\nAttorneys for Pusok told KNBC-TV Friday as they left the jail that their client has a badly swollen eye, marks from the beating over his face and body, and is in pain.", "article_metadata": {"description": "10 deputies on leave after California horse chase beating", "title": "10 deputies on leave after California horse chase beating", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "10 deputies on leave after California horse chase beating", "title": "10 deputies on leave after California horse chase beating", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/11/10_deputies_on_leave_after_california_horse_chase_beating/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/horse-chase-investigation.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "10 deputies on leave after California horse chase beating", "title": "10 deputies on leave after California horse chase beating", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/horse-chase-investigation.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tami Abdollah and Amy Taxin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc229\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsSAN BERNARDINO, Calif.
