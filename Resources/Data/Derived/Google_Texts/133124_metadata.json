But watching a consistent stream of bad news can have a serious affect on one\u2019s outlook on the world and overall mental health. It\u2019s important to know what\u2019s going on in the world, but it\u2019s also important to understand just how the media can warp your world view.\n\nThe Science of Us recently tackled this idea for its weekly animation series for New York Magazine. According to them, our brains are actually wired to be overly affected by negative news. Understanding the way this works, though, can help viewers avoid the anxiety and depression that results from watching terrible news stories.\n\nOne reason we're so stressed by current events is because humans have a natural instinct to take shortcuts when considering new information. One shortcut, Science of Us said, is called the availability heuristic. This suggests that when humans try to determine the likelihood of something happening, they concentrate on \"the vividness\" of what's portrayed in the news.\n\nTake plane crashes, for example. Science of Us explained that a crash may burn a memory into your mind, leading you to believe it\u2019s much more likely to happen than it really is. The same goes for a variety of natural disasters and violent conflicts.\n\nThere are some ways to combat these instinctual ways of thinking, however. Focusing on the good news, such as peace and medical advancements, can help the brain balance out its perspectives and achieve a more holistic way of thinking.\n\nWatch the video for more ways to cope with bad news.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "keeping, news, can, cause, depression, and, anxiety, heres, how, recover", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Focusing on different aspects of the news may help combat stress caused by current events.", "title": "Is The News Giving You Anxiety?
