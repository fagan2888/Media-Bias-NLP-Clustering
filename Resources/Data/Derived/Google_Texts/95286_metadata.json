In fact, the phones are commonly called by those opposed to the program as being \u201cObama phones\u201d, named after the President of the United States, who also has advocated the Affordable Care Act and the Stimulus.\n\nIn part, because of the negativity attached to the program utilized by so many in need, Louisiana for Lifeline recently opened a Baton Rouge office and launched a public campaign today \u201cto spread facts about the Lifeline program\u201d\n\nIn a press release by Louisiana for Lifeline, the program, \u201cprovides phone access to Americans who cannot otherwise afford it. The non-partisan program, which began under the Reagan administration and expanded during the presidency of George W. Bush, has come under attack recently by a small, yet vocal set of politically-motivated individuals. Louisiana for Lifeline is advocating on behalf of the more than 364,000 people who depend on the Lifeline in Louisiana, which includes some 156,000 seniors and 36,000 U.S. veterans.\n\n\u201cLifeline gives people a helping hand when they need it most. It helps communities stay connected, safe, and healthy,\u201d said Heyward Whetsell, the organization\u2019s state director. \u201cThere has been an abundance of misinformation on Lifeline, and we are here to set the record straight.\u201d\n\nThe campaign is set to include town halls, meetings with elected officials, Google Hangouts, and visits by influential supporters.\n\nLast week, Stephen Sabludowsky, publisher of Bayoubuzz.com, interviewed Whetsell, to obtain more facts about the program, to understand those benefits offered to the most needy population in Louisiana and to provide information to those uncertain whether the program is indeed worthy.
