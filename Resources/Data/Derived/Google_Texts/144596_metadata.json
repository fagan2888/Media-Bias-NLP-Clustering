That cuts Vodafone\u2019s employees out of the surveillance process, removing one of the hurdles that can curb government overreach.\n\nVodafone would not say which countries have established these direct links. But in an exhaustively researched appendix to the report, the U.K.-based company sheds light on the legal frameworks that surround government interception in the 29 countries. The appendix reveals that six countries \u2014 Albania, Egypt, Hungary, Ireland, Qatar and Turkey \u2014 have provisions that allow authorities to request unfettered access.\n\nIn two other countries, India and the U.K., legal provisions are unclear as to whether government officials are allowed to have direct access, according to the report.\n\nThe report is remarkable not so much for what it reveals about the extent of law enforcement and intelligence agency surveillance, but for the comparisons it enables across countries. The report also highlights six countries for which Vodafone was unable to disclose any statistics on warrants from the government or other requests: Romania, Qatar, Egypt, India, South Africa and Turkey.\n\nBy contrast, Vodafone\u2019s report is almost superfluous for some Western European countries, like Germany, where the government already publishes statistics on how many requests it sends phone companies.\n\nWiretapping of phones and accessing of call records for law-enforcement purposes is a decades-old and accepted practice even in the most open democracies. With backing from courts, police can request cooperation from phone companies to access communications.\n\nBut in developing countries like Congo, Ghana and Lesotho, Vodafone doesn\u2019t have the capability to support wiretapping, since governments haven\u2019t requested it.\n\nBy making its report public, together with a disclosure of requests for information, Vodafone is entering the international debate about balancing the rights of privacy against security. Rather than being stuck with responsibility and backlash when citizens realize their data has been scooped up without their knowledge, Vodafone decided it was time to push for a debate.\n\nVodafone\u2019s report comes one year after former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. and other countries\u2019 intelligence agencies indiscriminately gather and store huge amounts of data from phone calls and Internet communications.\n\n\u201cCompanies are recognizing they have a responsibility to disclose government access,\u201d Daniel Castro, senior analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington. \u201cThis is new.\u201d\n\nVodafone\u2019s report is also seen by some as an effort to turn the page on the company\u2019s embarrassing role in the protests that toppled Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. As the protests raged, the government forced Vodafone to bombard its Egyptian subscribers with propaganda text messages. The company said it had no choice but to comply, but was severely criticized for its actions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cellphone operator wades into surveillance debate", "title": "Cellphone operator wades into surveillance debate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cellphone operator wades into surveillance debate", "title": "Cellphone operator wades into surveillance debate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/cellphone_operator_wades_into_surveillance_debate/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/europe-vodafone-surveillance.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cellphone operator wades into surveillance debate", "title": "Cellphone operator wades into surveillance debate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/europe-vodafone-surveillance.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Peter Svensson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the report published Friday, Vodafone, which has unparalleled global reach for a cellphone company, said six countries have demanded direct access to its network.\nThat cuts Vodafone\u2019s employees out of the surveillance process, removing one of the hurdles that can curb government overreach.\nIn two other countries, India and the U.K., legal provisions are unclear as to whether government officials are allowed to have direct access, according to the report.\nThe appendix reveals that six countries \u2014 Albania, Egypt, Hungary, Ireland, Qatar and Turkey \u2014 have provisions that allow authorities to request unfettered access.\nBy making its report public, together with a disclosure of requests for information, Vodafone is entering the international debate about balancing the rights of privacy against security."}
