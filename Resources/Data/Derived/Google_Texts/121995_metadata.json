Tea partiers still want ACA gutted\n\nYou go through a whole government shutdown so you can kill Obamacare dead, and all you get is a little more due diligence before people can get their subsidies?\n\nTea party groups are furious over the prospect that Congress is drifting toward a government funding-debt ceiling deal that might just take the usual one or two tepid dings out of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, just like Congress has in previous fights.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe whole point of urging Republicans to use the continuing resolution and debt ceiling bills as leverage, in their view, was to force a real shutdown of Obamacare, not just settle for one or two minor concessions. But in the deal that appeared to be coming together in the Senate Monday, only two Obamacare provisions were on the table: a measure to verify the incomes of everyone who applies for subsidies, and a one-year delay of a tax to help insurers that cover a lot of sick people.\n\n( Understanding Obamacare: POLITICO's guide to the Affordable Care Act)\n\nIf Obamacare was a pi\u00f1ata, that would be like walking away after you\u2019ve lightly whacked the tail a couple of times. Tea party groups were hoping to keep smashing it until it broke.\n\n\u201cThis fight is a fight worth having so that millions of Americans can get relief from Obamacare,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots. \u201cThis fight is not worth having on issues that are smaller than that.\u201d\n\nThe tea party universe is not monolithic, and as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans seem to be willing to settle for minor Obamacare concessions, some groups say it\u2019s time to take what they can get and live to fight another day.\n\nBut the tea party faithful who are urging House Republicans to fight on are passionate and include groups like Martin\u2019s Tea Party Patriots, one of the leading tea party groups, and FreedomWorks, which has organized Obamacare protests since Congress was first debating it in 2009. They\u2019re both urging House Republicans to stand firm against any Senate deal if it doesn\u2019t slow down Obamacare in a fundamental way, like delaying the individual mandate for a year.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pushed very, very, very hard, and we\u2019re doing that because we understand that this law is having very real effects on millions of Americans right now,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIf they walk away from the current situation without securing any real, meaningful relief from Obamacare, we\u2019re going to be very upset with them.\u201d\n\nAdam Brandon, executive vice president of FreedomWorks, said the Senate talks were one of the main topics of conversation at a meeting of the group\u2019s activists in Atlanta this weekend.\n\n\u201cThe grassroots are tired of these little technical tweaks. They want to start over,\u201d said Brandon. He said any deal that doesn\u2019t include, at a minimum, a delay of the individual mandate will have a hard time passing the House, because \u201cthe House guys are feeling the pressure.\u201d\n\nBrandon said the activists were especially cynical about an earlier Senate proposal to delay the law\u2019s tax on medical devices, saying it would have been yet another example of interest groups with skilled lobbyists getting a break from Obamacare while regular people can\u2019t. But that proposal appeared to have dropped out of the emerging Senate deal by Monday night.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nEven some tea party leaders, however, say the Obamacare protest has probably gone as far as it can go \u2014 since it has failed, so far, to peel away any of the red-state Senate Democrats the anti-Obamacare forces needed on their side.\n\n\u201cI would take progress, knowing that we can fix some of the problems,\u201d said Sal Russo, co-founder and chief strategist of the Tea Party Express. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re not going to be happy, but most of the tea party people, we fought the good fight.\u201d\n\nRusso\u2019s background is different from other tea party leaders \u2014 he\u2019s a veteran Republican strategist who has worked on campaigns dating back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s days in California politics. Russo said he had always called for Republicans to use the spending bill as the vehicle for broader Obamacare changes because he thought they could get a few red-state Senate Democrats to side with them \u2014 like Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, all of whom are up for re-election next year.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Sarah Palin: Barack Obama flirts with impeachment)\n\nThat effort has clearly failed, Russo said, and even though everything depends on the final details of a Senate deal, \u201cthat might be as far as we can get, given that we didn\u2019t move those Senate votes that we have to move.\u201d\n\nOther groups are fully aware that the shutdown and debt limit crises have taken the focus away from their efforts to highlight Obamacare\u2019s problems. So they\u2019ll be happy to get past the crises and turn the spotlight back to the health care law, especially now that the law\u2019s centerpiece is a federal health insurance website that breaks down all the time.\n\n\u201cWe think overturning Obamacare is a long-term, grind-it-out effort, and we\u2019re committed to doing that,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. When comedians like Jon Stewart are mocking the \u201cincompetence\u201d of the Obamacare website, Phillips said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got a problem, and it\u2019s been overshadowed.
