Patty Murray Patty MurraySenate backs equal pay for female soccer players Feds can learn lessons from states about using data to inform policy Lawmakers blast poultry, meat industries over worker injuries MORE (D-Wash.) on Tuesday unveiled a bill to keep in place the rule that insurance companies must cover contraception, even if certain methods, like birth control pills, become available without a prescription.\n\nThe bill is a direct rebuke to Senate Republicans who are trying to champion the issue of over-the-counter birth control. That GOP bill has drawn fire from reproductive health groups like Planned Parenthood Action Fund, however, that warn the legislation would force women to again pay out of pocket for their birth control.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf something is too expensive, it doesn\u2019t matter how easy it is to get. It might as well be on the moon,\u201d Murray told reporters Tuesday.\n\nUnlike the Republican bill, Murray\u2019s bill would not provide incentives for insurance companies to offer birth control available over the counter.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very careful not to put political pressure on the FDA without going through the regular process,\u201d Murray said.\n\n\u201cI do think at some point, birth control will be offered over the counter, and when that happens, our bill makes sure insurance companies still cover it,\u201d she said.\n\nMurray slammed the GOP version of the bill, led by freshman Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), which she said was like offering someone a single shoe: \u201cYou really need the pair.\u201d\n\nShe said her bill has 25 co-sponsors, including Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\n\nDemocrats and reproductive health groups have condemned the Republican bill, arguing that it would undermine other parts of ObamaCare intended to make contraception available.\n\n\u201cYou can make birth control available over the counter in every pharmacy in America, but if it still costs $600 a year, it will be out of reach for many women,\u201d Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told reporters.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A bill from Sen.
