AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Texas senior Morolake Akinosun won the women’s 100 meters at the Texas Relays on Saturday to become the first woman to win the event three years in a row.

Akinosun was a heavy favorite and didn’t let the field behind her get close as she won in 11.07 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year.

“It feels phenomenal,” Akinosun said. “I’ve been training for this.”

The Texas Relays is in its 89th year but women didn’t compete until 1963, according to school records. Akinosun joins Leleitha Hodges of Texas Women’s University as the meet’s only three-time winners. Hodges won in 1978-79 and 1981.

“It was a goal,” Akinosun said of three consecutive championships. “We’ve had some of the greatest track and field athletes come through the University of Texas and this meet. It’s a great feeling.”

Akinosun hopes to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team for the Rio Games this summer.

“It would mean the world to me, to know it’s a reachable goal means a lot,” she said.

Clemson’s Tevin Hester won the men’s 100 in a wind-aided 9.99. Trayvon Bromell, who won the previous two years at Baylor, did not attend the meet after turning pro in late 2015.

LSU’s Nataliyah Friar won the women’s long jump with a leap of 20 feet, 8½ inches on her first attempt. Jeron Robinson of Texas A&M-Kingsville; won the men’s high jump at 7-5.

Buffalo Bills wide receiver Marquise Goodwin, a former NCAA champion in the long jump at Texas, ran the 100 meters but had to run under protest after a false start and wasn’t given an official time.

Goodwin didn’t enter the long jump, but said he intends to try to qualify for the Olympics this summer. He said a tweet under his account Friday that referenced his “last time” in his Bills uniform was a “play on words” that some took to mean he was leaving the team.

Goodwin insisted he’s not leaving the Bills or football.

“Football is my deal,” Goodwin said. “Track is my fun.”
