(You can read a summary here.) While I agree that end-of-life care is an issue worth discussing, I think the report\u2019s recommendations contain a basic flaw: having a patient register his/her preferences with the doctor. It\u2019s a lawyer \u2014 a professional third-party advocate \u2014 the patient needs, not a doctor.\n\nEarlier this summer, the Obama administration was pushing for doctor-patient end-of-life discussions by floating a regulatory proposal to have Medicare pay for this activity. Yesterday\u2019s report adds credence to the administration\u2019s views on this. But that still doesn\u2019t make it the right approach.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem with having \u2018the\u2019 discussion with your doctor? First, few doctors today are independent practitioners. Most doctors today are employees of large medical groups (and thanks to Obamacare this will be increasing) and many such groups include a hospital. The group may be a for-profit or a non-profit entity, but the key factor is the hospital. More about that in a moment.\n\nAssuming Medicare will pay for \u2018the\u2019 discussion, the aim of the large medical group will be to have the discussion be as brief as possible \u2013 as Medicare is likely not to pay very much for the activity.\n\nHence the large medical group will devise a checklist form.\n\nLet\u2019s say Dr. Jones of Gizmo Medical Group hands Mrs. Smith the Gizmo end-of-life form \u2013 a questionnaire, consisting of a list of issues with \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 boxes. Doctor and patient spend a few minutes talking about the questionnaire. Then Mrs. Smith checks some boxes and signs Gizmo\u2019s form; the receptionists witness the form, and as one of them is a notary, she notarizes a copy for Gizmo\u2019s files and one for Mrs. Smith.\n\nSounds sensible, but is it in Mrs. Smith\u2019s best interests? For example, do the phrases in Gizmo\u2019s form actually represent what Mrs. Smith wants?\n\nSuppose Gizmo\u2019s form asks: \u201cCan we use extraordinary measures to keep you alive if you are in a coma for more than one week or are diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state?\u201d A natural reaction might be to check the NO box, but what exactly do \u2018extraordinary measures\u2019 mean?\n\nAs we learned in the Terry Schiavo case, a hospital may define \u2018extraordinary measures\u2019 to include providing food and water for a patient in a coma or persistent vegetative state.\n\nWhat would Mrs. Smith\u2019s answer be if the question was reworded to ask: \u2018If the doctor determines you\u2019re brain dead, or if you\u2019re in a coma for more than a week, do you give us permission to stop feeding you and giving you water?\u2019 Would Mrs. Smith agree to that? Would you?\n\nHere\u2019s where the hospital connection enters the picture. From a purely financial angle, a hospital is likely to want to have the patient\u2019s permission to stop providing food and water when it deems the patient is beyond recovery.\n\nHaving a hospital patient in a coma or vegetative state is costly \u2013 with Medicare or Medicaid picking up a lot of the tab, but not all of the tab. If the patient lacks secondary insurance, the hospital will have to make up the payment gap.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joanne Butler", "description": "Don't trust the hospital checklist, get a lawyer.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Wednesday, the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Science (both institutions receive a combination of federal and private funding) issued a report\u00a0on how America\u2019s medical system", "title": "Conflicts Of Interest In Discussions About End-Of-Life Care", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/19/conflicts-of-interest-in-discussions-about-end-of-life-care/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hospice.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Don't trust the hospital checklist, get a lawyer.", "title": "Conflicts Of Interest In Discussions About End-Of-Life Care Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/19/conflicts-of-interest-in-discussions-about-end-of-life-care/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hospice.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-19 10:13:11", "sailthru.title": "Conflicts Of Interest In Discussions About End-Of-Life Care", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "medicare,joanne-butler", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "joanne butler,medicare", "sailthru.description": "On Wednesday, the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Science (both institutions receive a combination of federal and private funding) issued a report\u00a0on how America\u2019s medical system", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hospice.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5cee\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s say Dr. Jones of Gizmo Medical Group hands Mrs. Smith the Gizmo end-of-life form \u2013 a questionnaire, consisting of a list of issues with \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 boxes.\nFor example, do the phrases in Gizmo\u2019s form actually represent what Mrs. Smith wants?\nEarlier this summer, the Obama administration was pushing for doctor-patient end-of-life discussions by floating a regulatory proposal to have Medicare pay for this activity.\nThen Mrs. Smith checks some boxes and signs Gizmo\u2019s form; the receptionists witness the form, and as one of them is a notary, she notarizes a copy for Gizmo\u2019s files and one for Mrs. Smith.\nWhile I agree that end-of-life care is an issue worth discussing, I think the report\u2019s recommendations contain a basic flaw: having a patient register his/her preferences with the doctor."}
