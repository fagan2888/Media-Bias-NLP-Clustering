Passengers on Frontier Airlines can now use small electronic devices during all phases of flight, and is the latest carrier to receive Federal Aviation Administration approval.

The Denver-based carrier’s announcement Friday comes three months after United Airlines and Southwest Airlines — Denver International Airport’s other major carriers — were green-lighted by the FAA.

The federal safety agency changed their policy on certain personal electronic devices — or PEDs — in November, but required each airline to present a safe implementation plan for their particular fleet and operations.

“This is an exciting day for Frontier customers and has been something they have wanted for some time now,” said Scott Gould, Frontier’s vice president of flight operations, in a news release.

Prior to the new policy, which still requires all electronics to be in “airplane” or non-transmittal mode, airline passengers had to turn off and stow all devices during takeoff, landing, taxi and below 10,000 feet.

Larger electronics like laptops still must be stowed during takeoff and landing for safety purposes.
