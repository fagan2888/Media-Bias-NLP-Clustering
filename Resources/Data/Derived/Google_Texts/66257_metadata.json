John Kasich said Thursday he doesn\u2019t plan to ask the quasi-legislative Ohio Controlling Board to approve new Medicaid expansion spending. Video of Kasich\u2019s remarks are available from Youngstown Vindicator reporter Marc Kovac.\n\nIn 2013, the governor won approval from the Controlling Board to spend $2.56 billion in Obamacare money on Medicaid benefits for able-bodied, working-age childless adults from Jan. 1, 2014, through June 30, 2015 .\n\nThe Controlling Board appropriation ran out in February, and Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion will likely be more than $1 billion over budget by July.\n\nWatchdog reported this in early March, but Ohio\u2019s newspapers still haven\u2019t caught on.\n\nA brief Associated Press piece about Medicaid expansion funding, published Thursday on the Akron Beacon Journal\u2019s website and elsewhere, failed to mention Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion burned through its approved funding four months early.\n\nAP reporter Ann Sanner also neglected to mention this in a column published Thursday by Dayton Daily News and other outlets. In fact, both AP stories about Kasich\u2019s latest remarks provided little information about Medicaid expansion funding.\n\nWhat else did the AP overlook?\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion was 74 percent over budget in February, has cost more than $300 million per month since December and will consume roughly 10 percent of Ohio\u2019s General Revenue Fund spending if continued for the next two years.\n\nBecause the $2.56 billion Controlling Board appropriation is gone, Kasich\u2019s Department of Medicaid is spending Obamacare money under budget authority lawmakers meant for children, pregnant women, impoverished families, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nToledo Blade reporter Jim Provance wrote a story about comments by Kasich regarding Medicaid expansion, but Provance provided almost no information about what the expansion has cost since January 2014.\n\nEditors at the Blade and several of Ohio\u2019s other major papers have openly advocated for Medicaid expansion and bashed the policy\u2019s critics. In 2013, newspapers celebrated Kasich\u2019s implementation of the expansion over General Assembly disapproval.\n\nWhile treating federal spending as free money, Ohio\u2019s press has given the Republican governor and potential presidential candidate a pass on false claims his Obamacare expansion does not increase federal spending.\n\nFor more than two years, Kasich has insisted he\u2019s paying for his Obamacare expansion by bringing Ohio money back to Ohio. In reality, the expansion is paid for with new spending from a federal government already $18 trillion in debt.\n\nEven the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency advising members of Congress, has debunked Kasich\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 but none of Ohio\u2019s newspapers have acknowledged the fact.\n\nKnowing Ohio reporters seemingly don\u2019t care what Obamacare expansion costs or where the money comes from, Kasich keeps repeating his refuted talking points in friendly national interviews, including a Tuesday segment with Megyn Kelly on Fox News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you relied on Ohio's legacy press, you'd have no idea Gov.
