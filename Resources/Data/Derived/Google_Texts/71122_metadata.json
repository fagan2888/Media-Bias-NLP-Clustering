He was the youngest person there; great-grandfather Prince Philip, 94, was the oldest.\n\nPrince Charles, William and Princess Anne were on horseback for the start of the annual ceremony, later joining the others on the balcony.\n\nThe queen turned 89 on April 21, her actual birth date, which is traditionally marked in private, with a public celebration held in June, when London\u2019s fickle weather is more likely to be favorable.\n\nCrowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace to view the festivities though the day was cloudy and cool.\n\nElizabeth, wearing a peach and silver coat dress with a matching hat, inspected 1,100 soldiers from the Household Division at the Horse Guards Parade grounds near the palace.\n\nShe arrived in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, formerly Kate Middleton, wore a blue and white dress by Catherine Walker and a whimsical white hat by Lock and Co. for the occasion. She arrived with Camilla, the wife of Prince Charles.\n\nKate and William and their two young children have spent much of the time since Charlotte\u2019s birth at their country retreat on the queen\u2019s estate at Sandringham in rural Norfolk. William has resumed his job as an air ambulance pilot after taking a break for paternity leave.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Queen Elizabeth II marked her ceremonial birthday Saturday with the traditional \"Trooping the Color\" parade in the heart of London - and 23-month-old Prince George made his debut on the Buckingham Palace balcony.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II marked her ceremonial birthday Saturday with the traditional \u201cTrooping the Color\u201d parade in the heart of London - and 23-month-old Prince George made his debut on the Buckingham Palace balcony.", "title": "Prince George on balcony as queen marks ceremonial birthday", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/13/queens-ceremonial-birthday-kate-joins-the-parade/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/13/7258044a66de421a790f6a706700cde4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/13/7258044a66de421a790f6a706700cde4.jpg", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II marked her ceremonial birthday Saturday with the traditional \"Trooping the Color\" parade in the heart of London - and 23-month-old Prince George made his debut on the Buckingham Pal", "card": "summary", "title": "Prince George on balcony as queen marks ceremonial birthday"}, "Author": "GREGORY KATZ", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Cambridge, Anne, London"}, "article_summary": "LONDON (AP) - Queen Elizabeth II marked her ceremonial birthday Saturday with the traditional \u201cTrooping the Color\u201d parade in the heart of London - and 23-month-old Prince George made his debut on the Buckingham Palace balcony.\nThere was no sign of Charlotte but George captivated throngs of well-wishers by appearing on the balcony in the arms of his father, Prince William, who was in full military garb.\nPrince Charles, William and Princess Anne were on horseback for the start of the annual ceremony, later joining the others on the balcony.\nIt was the first time George took part in the royal tradition of gathering the extended family on the balcony on important national occasions.\nWilliam has resumed his job as an air ambulance pilot after taking a break for paternity leave."}
