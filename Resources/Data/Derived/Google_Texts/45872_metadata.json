When the model does employ financial incentives, they must be geared toward provider-beneficiary relationships, patient engagement and eliminating barriers to care. \"We do not believe, however, that the currently proposed semi-annual monetary reward will achieve our shared goals of strengthened relationships between patients and their providers and enhanced patient engagement in their health and healthcare,\" the letter states.\n\nThe ideal Next Generation ACO will be able to improve patient experience as well as outcomes, according to the letter, and that requires partnerships with patients and their families, as well as the strongest possible consumer benefits and improved cost-sharing. Some aspects of the current CMS proposal advance that goal, including the proposed requirement that beneficiaries have access to their own medical records. Explicitly referencing electronic access would strengthen this even further, the groups write.\n\nThese considerations are particularly important as healthcare moves from a manufacturing model to a retail one, vastly increasing the importance of consumer focus, according to healthcare policy expert Paul Keckley, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the letter (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS announces 'Next Generation' accountable care organization model\n\nHHS will expand Pioneer ACO program\n\n3 challenges as healthcare shifts to a retail industry\n\nPioneer ACO spending growth lower than other Medicare beneficiaries'\n\nPioneer ACO program loses three more participants\n\nPioneer ACOs cut spending, but model may discourage savings\n\nMedicare ACO quality, savings improve in second year\n\nCMS: Medicare and Pioneer ACOs saved $380M", "article_metadata": {"description": "The accountable care organization model has\u00a0seen substantial progress in recent years,\u00a0but to succeed in the long term, the model must provide comprehensive data and engage with consumers, 12 consumer advocacy groups said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The accountable care organization model has\u00a0seen substantial progress in recent years,\u00a0but to succeed in the long term, the model must provide comprehensive data and engage with consumers, 12 consumer advocacy groups said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "title": "To succeed long-term, ACOs must increase consumer focus", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/succeed-long-term-acos-must-increase-consumer-focus/2015-05-20", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs),Care Delivery,Center for Medicare Advocacy,consumer protection,National Partnership For Women And Families,Next Generation ACOs,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,patient satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb85f\"", "article_summary": "The financial incentives included in CMS' Next Generation ACO Model Request for Applications are a major potential obstacle to these goals, the letter states.\nWhen the model does employ financial incentives, they must be geared toward provider-beneficiary relationships, patient engagement and eliminating barriers to care.\nThese considerations are particularly important as healthcare moves from a manufacturing model to a retail one, vastly increasing the importance of consumer focus, according to healthcare policy expert Paul Keckley, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nThe accountable care organization (ACO) model has seen substantial progress in recent years, but to succeed in the long term, the Next Generation ACO model must provide comprehensive data and engage with consumers, 12 consumer advocacy groups said in a letter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\nSome aspects of the current CMS proposal advance that goal, including the proposed requirement that beneficiaries have access to their own medical records."}
