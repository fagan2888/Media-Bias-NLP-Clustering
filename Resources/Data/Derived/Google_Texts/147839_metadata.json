At stake, to hear insurance executives tell it, is nothing less than the future of health care in California.\n\n\u201cThis ruling threatens to paralyze the healthcare system in the state, resulting in more costs and bureaucracy for Californians,\u201d UnitedHealth\u2019s PacifiCare President Stephen Scheneman told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe lawsuit was the latest iteration of a conflict dating back nine years. Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, a Republican, announced his intention in 2008 to sue UnitedHealth for $1.3 billion over its slipshod takeover of PacifiCare in 2005. The insurance department alleged the company violated state laws 992,936 times between 2006 and 2008, with each violation punishable by a $10,000 fine.\n\nPoizner upped the ante to $10 billion in September 2010 while making an unsuccessful run at becoming the state\u2019s governor.\n\nPolicyholders complained of lost and miscoded records during the transfer, a bunch of which ended up in India, and said they went months without medical care while the snafus were sorted out. Doctors complained that the insurance company mixed up which providers belonged to which medical groups and messed up contract information that resulted in lower payments to them.\n\nUnitedHealth said those were administrative errors that didn\u2019t hurt anyone and an administrative judge agreed with them last year, settling on an award of $11.5 million. That was more in line with the $2 million settlement reached with the Department of Managed Health Care over similar transgressions.\n\nThe commissioner said he regarded the judge\u2019s ruling as simply advisory and issued the $173.6 million fine.\n\nJones clashed with the company in May 2013, on the eve of the Covered California rollout, over an 8% rate hike it imposed on 45,000 small-business employees and dependents. Jones called it \u201cjust one more unwarranted economic burden on California's small business owners and their employees.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, responded from its headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota, that it was \u201cdisheartened\u201d by Jones\u2019 sentiments. A month later, it followed Aetna and Cigna out of the state when it announced that it was leaving California\u2019s individual market. They were all small players in the state market. UnitedHealth\u2019s subsidiary, PacifiCare, had 10,000 policyholders as of 2012, according to the California Department of Insurance. Aetna had 60,000.\n\nCalifornia voters will have a chance to tip the balance of power in the health insurance market in November. Lawmakers put a measure on the ballot, Proposition 45, that will let the commissioner reject rates found to be unreasonable. Thirty-five states already let regulators have that control, which is similar to that already exercised in California over auto and home insurance.\n\nState lawmakers rejected a single-payer system in January 2012 that would have removed private insurance companies from the equation. It fell two votes shy in the Senate and never made it to the Assembly or governor.\n\n\u2013Ken Broder\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nPacifiCare Sues State Insurance Commissioner over $173 Million Fine (by Kathy Robertson, San Francisco Business Times)\n\nUnitedHealth Group Sues California over Fine (by Chad Terhune, Los Angeles Times)\n\nHealth Insurer Faces $9.9 Billion in Fines (by Ben Rooney, CNN Money)\n\nFeds Say PacifiCare Overbilled Medicare $424 Million in California (by Ken Broder, AllGov California)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The lawsuit was the latest iteration of a conflict dating back nine years.
