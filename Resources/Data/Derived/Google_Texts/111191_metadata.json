But it was perhaps even more audacious than many of its critics realized: in contrast to the Affordable Care Act, whose drafters deliberately excluded undocumented immigrants from being eligible for coverage in order to avoid stepping into an even bigger political minefield than the one they were already in, Sanders\u2019 policy advisor Warren Gunnels confirmed to reporters that the senator envisions an expanded Medicare being open to at least some of those living in the country illegally.\n\nThis is almost certainly one of the boldest pro-immigrant positions espoused by a major party candidate in recent history. A casual observer might reasonably infer from his willingness to take such a stand that Sanders must be the clear favorite of those who lobby on behalf of immigrant rights. Yet throughout the campaign, he has been dogged by criticism of his immigration record \u2013 from the left.\n\nMuch of it has revolved around his 2007 vote against a failed bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate, which he opposed on account of a provision that would have expanded so-called \u201cguest worker\u201d programs that allow foreigners to work in the U.S. on a temporary basis without being granted permanent residency. Some have also highlighted purportedly anti-immigrant statements that Sanders made during the time the bill was being considered, such as his comment to Lou Dobbs that \u201cif wages are going down, I don\u2019t know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will\u2026 drive wages down even lower than they are right now.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Sanders\u2019 position on immigration is not anti-immigrant at all; it is motivated by the same progressive vision that animates the rest of his platform. According to Daniel Costa of the Economic Policy Institute, Sanders\u2019 opposition to guest worker programs like the H-2A, H-2B, and H-1B, and his support for a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented are not at all contradictory, but stem from the same underlying concerns:\n\nSanders understands that having eight million people working in the U.S. labor market without labor and employment rights puts downward pressure on the wages and working conditions of all workers. He has not failed to point this out. There\u2019s no question that Sanders\u2019 desire for legalization of the unauthorized population is consistent with his broader agenda to see wages rise for workers in the United States.\n\nDuring an interview with the Vermont independent last summer, Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein raised the prospect of the United States adopting an \u201copen borders\u201d policy as a means of combating global poverty. Sanders was clearly taken aback. \u201cOpen borders? That\u2019s a Koch brothers proposal,\u201d he replied. Klein was unpersuaded:\n\nKlein: It would make a lot of the global poor richer, wouldn\u2019t it? Sanders: And it\u2019d make everybody in America poorer\u2026 If you believe in a nation-state\u2026 you have an obligation, in my view, to do everything we can to help poor people [abroad]. [But] what right-wing people in this country would love is an open border policy, bring in all kinds of people [to] work for two or three dollars an hour. That would be great for them. I don\u2019t believe in that.\n\nAs Sanders has routinely emphasized, that we have an obligation to offer asylum to refugees fleeing violence and persecution is undeniable. But there are far too many of the \u201cglobal poor\u201d for mass immigration to the United States to be a workable response to their plight. In a guest post on Sanders\u2019 campaign website, writer Richard Eskow expands on this theme, arguing that \u201c[t]he principal instrument for [economic and political] change is the democratic nation-state, an entity which the open borders concept would seriously weaken.\u201d\n\nWhether immigration in general represents a net benefit or net cost to native-born Americans is a question on which economists have yet to find consensus (and the answer in any case is almost certainly \"it depends\"). What is not controversial \u2013 at least among those with no vested interest in keeping wages low \u2013 is that temporary guest worker programs are unambiguously harmful, both to the American workers who end up replaced by lower paid guest workers and to the guest workers themselves, who are generally bound to a particular employer in a kind of indentured servitude and who have little to no recourse if they are exploited. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the scandal caused when a society ostensibly committed to democratic ideals profits from the labor of a resident underclass denied the same rights enjoyed by the rest of the citizenry.\n\nAmong those concerned about this constellation of injustices is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 2013, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Gomez of Los Angeles testified before Congress that \u201c[t]he U.S. Catholic bishops have long been skeptical of large-scale \u2018guest worker\u2019 programs,\u201d and insisted that migrants should be guaranteed \u201cwage levels\u2026 equal to those afforded to domestic workers,\u201d \u201cthe same protections of U.S. labor law as U.S. workers,\u201d and the ability to \u201cnot be tied to one employer.\u201d If Bernie Sanders is anti-immigrant, then so is the USCCB.\n\nIn a speech before the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce last summer, Sanders declared that \u201cthere is a reason why Wall Street and all of corporate America likes immigration reform, and it is not, in my view, that they\u2019re staying up nights worrying about undocumented workers in this country.\u201d Indeed, the tendency of many progressives to suspend their ordinary skepticism about the motives of corporate lobbyists when the subject turns to immigration is alarming. Yet it probably helps explain why Sanders\u2019 2016 stump speech has thus far omitted the sort of concerns he shared with Lou Dobbs a decade ago.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Sanders handles this issue if he makes it to the general election. He and his surrogates have repeatedly discussed their intention to win over Trump supporters, whom they claim are angry at the wrong people for the right reasons. But perhaps out of a desire to avoid even more charges of anti-immigrant animus, Sanders has thus far refrained from making explicit the fact that business-friendly immigration policies have had deleterious effects on American workers. A careful articulation of the nuanced point that this can be so even though immigrants and guest workers themselves are just human beings looking to better their lives would strike at the roots of Trumpist demagoguery in a way that blithe dismissals of Trump supporters as xenophobes have failed to do. Whether the voters will get to hear someone make that point this election season remains to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "As Sanders has routinely emphasized, that we have an obligation to offer asylum to refugees fleeing violence and persecution is undeniable.\nIt will be interesting to see how Sanders handles this issue if he makes it to the general election.\nBut perhaps out of a desire to avoid even more charges of anti-immigrant animus, Sanders has thus far refrained from making explicit the fact that business-friendly immigration policies have had deleterious effects on American workers.\nThere\u2019s no question that Sanders\u2019 desire for legalization of the unauthorized population is consistent with his broader agenda to see wages rise for workers in the United States.\nYet it probably helps explain why Sanders\u2019 2016 stump speech has thus far omitted the sort of concerns he shared with Lou Dobbs a decade ago."}
