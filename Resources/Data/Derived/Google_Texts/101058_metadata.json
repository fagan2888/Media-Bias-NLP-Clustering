Marco Rubio made a campaign stop in The Villages on Sunday, stumping for much-needed votes two days before Florida\u2019s presidential preference primary.\n\nA laid-back and humorous Rubio, 45, who is an underdog in his own state, spent an hour detailing why he should be president. Rubio even smiled and casually dismissed one protester, who jumped up and told the audience that Rubio had ruined his relationship with his girlfriend.\n\n\u201cHe stole my girlfriend. She doesn\u2019t love me anymore,\u201d the man said. \u201cHe will steal your girlfriend, too.\u201d\n\nThe man was escorted from the venue by Sumter County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies. He said his girlfriend was in love with Rubio and no longer looks at him in the same way. The protester was not arrested, but was removed from the recreation center grounds.\n\n\u201cI'm still looking for the hidden camera,\u201d said Rubio, who shook his head to the laughter of about 500 supporters who had packed a room at the Rohan Recreation Center, which is east of Wildwood and north of State Road 44 in the southern reaches of The Villages retirement community.\n\nDuring the interruption, as the man was escorted from the building, Rubio said: \u201cWe don\u2019t beat up hecklers at our events.\u201d\n\nRubio then chastised GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, who has been in the news lately after violence has erupted at his events. Rubio said the Trump campaign rallies look like something that would happen in \u201ca Third World country.\"\n\nRubio said he is appalled that Trump has been telling his supporters to punch protesters in the face and offered to pay their legal bills if arrested, Rubio noted.\n\nThe rally seemed to be Rubio\u2019s final stand.\n\nTrump led in two Sunday polls by a large percentage in Florida. Those polls show that Trump leads Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich by more than 20 percentage points.\n\nRubio, who was gaining ground on Trump about a month ago, had two missteps in recent months. At one debate, Rubio repeated the same comment many times, and then in another debate, he confronted Trump with crude college humor.\n\nThat led some Rubio supporters to change candidates.\n\nAt a rally last Wednesday at a South Florida stadium, only a few hundred supporters showed up. Rubio has stated at many recent rallies that his candidacy rests on what happens in Florida.\n\nIn one Florida poll, Rubio is in third place behind Trump and Cruz. A few days ago, Rubio asked his supporters in Ohio, which also holds its presidential primary on Tuesday, to throw their support behind former Kasich. On Sunday, Kasich did not ask his supporters in Florida to do the same for Rubio.\n\nSunday\u2019s rally in The Villages featured Rubio\u2019s love of veterans. Several speakers jumped on Trump, who said last summer that Arizona Sen. John McCain, who was a prisoner of war for many years, was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d and was a \u201closer\u201d for not beating President Barack Obama.\n\nOne of the people to speak before Rubio took the stage was the grandson of famous World War II general George S. Patton. George Patton Waters carried a pair of his grandfather\u2019s boots on stage, hoping they could help Rubio march to victory.\n\nRubio told the crowd that, if elected, he would repeal and replace Obamacare. He would fix Social Security so that it would remain solvent for future generations and repeal many executive orders that President Obama recently signed.\n\nRubio had many lighter sides during his speech. He talked about all of the struggles American citizens have had in its history, starting when citizens defeated the British. He talked about how Americans survived many wars, the Great Depression and the 1960s upheavel.\n\n\u201cIn the 70s, we had a president who resigned in disgrace, long lines at the gas pumps and disco music,\u201d Rubio said to a chuckle from the audience. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but some of you did.\u201d\n\nNear the end of the event, the lights suddenly went dim. Rubio said it wasn\u2019t the first time the lights have gone out at his rallies. He said it happens when someone leans against a light switch, or because \u201cChina hacked us again.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, Rubio shook hands and signed autographs. He then headed to Orlando for an evening rally.\n\nJoe Callahan can be reached at 867-4113 or at joe.callahan@starbanner.com.
