Starting this year, the law requires employers with 100 or more workers on payrolls to offer health insurance for most employees working at least 30 hours a week. Beginning in 2016, those with 50 or more employees will also need to comply.\n\nHere\u2019s why that means one of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s favorite labor-market metrics is showing numbers that are probably weaker than the true underlying trend.\n\nYellen pointed to these so-called part-timers for economic reasons during her press conference last week as one reason central bankers will take their time in raising the benchmark interest rate.\n\n\u201cInvoluntary part-time employment remains elevated,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cAlthough progress clearly has been achieved, room for further improvement remains.\u201d\n\nThe chart below shows how far another measure of slack has already come. There were 563,000 workers so discouraged by job prospects in May that they weren\u2019t even looking for work, the fewest since October 2008. They represented about 0.36 percent of the labor force, closing in on the 0.27 percent average for the period from 1994 through 2007, and suggesting there\u2019s less room for further improvement here.\n\nThe next chart shows that wasn\u2019t the case for involuntary part-timers, who totaled 6.65 million in May, or 4.2 percent of the labor force, compared with an average 2.9 percent for the 14 years through December 2007, when the last recession began. That remains significant, which is why Yellen and her colleagues say they want to go slow. Reduce the part-time total by Feroli\u2019s estimate, however, and the gap is a little less daunting (see the red dots).\n\nBecause it\u2019s probably influenced by the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, some portion of that gap will persist even when the labor market has fully healed, Feroli wrote. (Note: The Supreme Court is due to rule this month on a challenge to the ACA that could unravel the core of the law, resulting in millions of Americans losing their insurance.)\n\nFeroli went on to say that he\u2019s not making any value judgments on the ACA\u2019s efficacy. It could be that the benefits of the law outweigh any costs from the distortions to the workweek, he said. It could also mean that employers are hiring more workers than they normally would, but keeping them under 30 hours a week. In other words, companies may be hiring three people part-time to do the work of two full-time staff.\n\nFor more on the global economy, check out Benchmark:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Carlos Torres,Victoria Stilwell", "twitter": {"description": "How much hotter can the job market get before spurring inflation?", "title": "What Obamacare Means for Janet Yellen and the Fed", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-22/what-obamacare-means-for-janet-yellen-and-the-fed", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipLw2asGBKcA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Victoria Stilwell", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Labor,Janet L Yellen,Affordable Care Act", "news_keywords": "Labor,Janet L Yellen,Affordable Care Act", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-22/what-obamacare-means-for-janet-yellen-and-the-fed", "parsely-title": "What Obamacare Means for Janet Yellen and the Fed", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-22T18:34:14.523Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "How much hotter can the job market get before spurring inflation?", "parsely-tags": "Labor,Janet L Yellen,Affordable Care Act,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-06-22T18:34:14.523Z", "parsely-section": "benchmark", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "How much hotter can the job market get before spurring inflation?", "title": "What Obamacare Means for Janet Yellen and the Fed", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-22/what-obamacare-means-for-janet-yellen-and-the-fed", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipLw2asGBKcA/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "How much hotter can the job market get before spurring inflation?"}, "parsely-post-id": "NQCZL26JTSEA01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipLw2asGBKcA/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s probably a little less slack in the labor market than meets the eye.\nHere\u2019s why that means one of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s favorite labor-market metrics is showing numbers that are probably weaker than the true underlying trend.\nIn other words, companies may be hiring three people part-time to do the work of two full-time staff.\nThat remains significant, which is why Yellen and her colleagues say they want to go slow.\nReduce the part-time total by Feroli\u2019s estimate, however, and the gap is a little less daunting (see the red dots)."}
