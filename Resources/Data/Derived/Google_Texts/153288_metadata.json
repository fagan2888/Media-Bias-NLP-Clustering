The criticism has come from a number of corners, most notably from the insurers\u2019 trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, which has repeatedly said such drug pricing is unsustainable and damage from that pricing scheme could reach far beyond the pharmaceutical industry. Rival drug firms, however, are developing similar treatments that could drive down the price in the U.S. in coming months and years.\n\nAHIP spokesman Brendan Buck said in an email that Gilead\u2019s $900 offer was \u201cmore evidence that Gilead is pricing not based on the cost of development, but rather just what it thinks it can get away with.\u201d\n\nThe Times of India quoted Gilead spokesman Gregg Alton as saying: \u201cWe have set three basic pricing tiers (based on a country\u2019s per capita income and hepatitis C prevalence) that serve as the starting point for negotiations with national governments. The tiers are low-income, low middle-income and upper-middle income.\u201d\n\nGilead officials would not comment further.\n\nThe Times says that at $900, Sovaldi will be cheaper than existing treatments, which cost roughly $6,000 and can take four times as long.\n\nBut the publication reports that $900 still will put Sovaldi out of reach for many users in that nation. So Gilead may license Sovaldi to generic drug makers in India.\n\nGilead shares were up marginally in recent action to $92.44.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nNearly 90% of uninsured qualify for Obamacare exemptions: report\n\nObamacare rate hikes to average 4% in California in 2015\n\nHow health care has swallowed the U.S. economy, in one map", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-08-08T14:11:40-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Gilead Sciences plans to sell its controversial Hepatitis C drug in India at a 99% discount to what it charges in the U.S.", "title": "Gilead offers to sell Hepatitis C drug in India at 99% off U.S. prices", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/08/gilead-offers-to-sell-hepatitis-c-drug-in-india-at-99-off-u-s-prices/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CM916_sovald_MG_20140711124155.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Gilead Sciences Inc.,health care,India,pharmaceuticals,Sovaldi", "article.headline": "Gilead offers to sell Hepatitis C drug in India at 99% off U.S. prices", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "Gilead Sciences plans to sell its controversial Hepatitis C drug in India at a 99% discount to what it charges in the U.S.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "Gilead Sciences Inc.,health care,India,pharmaceuticals,Sovaldi", "article.published": "2014-08-08T14:11:40-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/08/gilead-offers-to-sell-hepatitis-c-drug-in-india-at-99-off-u-s-prices/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Gilead Sciences plans to sell its controversial Hepatitis C drug in India at a 99% discount to what it charges in the U.S.", "title": "Gilead offers to sell Hepatitis C drug in India at 99% off U.S. prices", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/08/gilead-offers-to-sell-hepatitis-c-drug-in-india-at-99-off-u-s-prices/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CM916_sovald_MG_20140711124155.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2920", "article.updated": "2014-08-08T16:17:28-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0367\"", "article_summary": "Gilead Sciences Inc. /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD reportedly plans to sell full regimens of its controversial Hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, for $900 in India \u2014 a price that is roughly 1% of what U.S. patients are being charged.\nSo Gilead may license Sovaldi to generic drug makers in India.\nThe Times says that at $900, Sovaldi will be cheaper than existing treatments, which cost roughly $6,000 and can take four times as long.\nGilead has taken heat for pricing three-month Sovaldi regimens at $84,000 in the U.S., translating to nearly $1,000 for a one-day dose.\nThe Times of India reported earlier this week that Gilead offered to sell Sovaldi at what amounts to a 99% discount for the impoverished nation, following its plan to sell the highly effective treatment in Egypt at the same $900 price tag."}
