An Amber Alert has been canceled for a woman and her two children abducted from a home in Surprise Saturday morning, police said.

They have been located and are safe, according to a tweet from the Arizona Department of Transportation and Surprise police.

The suspect, Heriberto Mendoza, 22, has been apprehended, officers said.

Police said the man assaulted Alexis Escalante, 25, and then dragged and forced her into his truck. He returned to the house and took the children, ages 3 and 5, as well, police said.

Mendoza may have recently purchased a gun and has made threats to kill the mother and both children.

Investigators said the kidnapping occurred in the 12900 block of west Tara Lane at 9 a.m.

He fled with them in a red 2002 Dodge Ram pickup truck.

Heriberto Escalante-Mendoza, 3, and Danna Escalante-Mendoza, 5, along with their mother, are OK.

Police said at a news briefing they could not confirm if the suspect is the father of the two children because officers don't have proper paperwork.

The Amber Alert has been cancelled. The missing children have been located and they are safe. â€” Arizona DOT (@ArizonaDOT) February 13, 2016
