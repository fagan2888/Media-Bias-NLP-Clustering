His 100% NARAL rating means that Courtney has always voted to ensure abortion has no restrictions and that, in fact, access to abortion can be expanded.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Congressman is featured in a photo accompanying an article on page 12 of the August issue of Four County Catholic, the diocesan newspaper, along with Sister Mary Jude, director of the diocesan Hispanic Ministry.\n\n\u201cImmigration reform and immigration assistance continues to be a priority concern of the Church, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and the Hispanic Ministry here in the Diocese of Norwich,\u201d reads the article. \u201cContinuous efforts are underway to build awareness of the Catholic position on this matter with State legislators, national representatives and the public at large.\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2004, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) adopted a resolution, by a near-unanimous vote, that states\u2019 Catholic institutions should not honor pro-abortion politicians or provide them with a stage that would suggest support for their actions.\n\n\u201cIt is the teaching of the Catholic Church from the very beginning, founded on her understanding of her Lord\u2019s own witness to the sacredness of human life, that the killing of an unborn child is always intrinsically evil and can never be justified,\u201d reads the document \u201cCatholics in Political Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf those who perform an abortion and those who cooperate willingly in the action are fully aware of the objective evil of what they do, they are guilty of grave sin and thereby separate themselves from God\u2019s grace,\u201d the bishops say. \u201cThe Catholic community and Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles. They should not be given awards, honors or platforms which would suggest support for their actions.\u201d\n\nAccording to the diocesan newspaper article, Courtney, who this year is seeking his fifth term as U.S. representative to Connecticut\u2019s eastern district, met with Sister Mary Jude to discuss the urgency of enacting \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeaders of about a dozen groups across the state have been working together in an ad hoc committee, initiated by the Office of Social Justice of the Archdiocese of Hartford,\u201d the article explains. \u201cMore meetings with all five [Connecticut U.S.] representatives are being scheduled.\u201d\n\nAll five of Connecticut\u2019s U.S. representatives and two U.S. senators have 100% NARAL ratings for supporting abortion.\n\nThe diocesan article further invites readers to visit the Justice for Immigrants website for more information.\n\nJustice for Immigrants is the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d group that is closely aligned with the USCCB\u2019s Migration and Refugee Services (MRS) program. MRS states that Justice for Immigrants is \u201cdesigned to unite and mobilize a growing network of Catholic institutions, individuals, and other persons of good will in support of a broad legalization program and comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nAmong the founding members of Justice for Immigrants is the Catholic Health Association (CHA) which, in July of 2013, announced that it would accept the White House\u2019s \u201caccommodation\u201d for religious employers that opposed the HHS contraception and abortifacients mandate, even though the bishops said the final rule failed to resolve several key concerns for them.\n\nSister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of CHA, had also supported the passage of ObamaCare, even after the USCCB withdrew its backing because of concerns about the health reform law\u2019s subsidies for abortion.\n\nThe USCCB/MRS states that it is \u201cthe largest resettlement agency in the United States.\u201d\n\nMRS shows a total budget of approximately $71 million, of which nearly $66 million \u2013 or about 93% \u2013 has come from federal grants and contracts, which means MRS is essentially a federal government program that is being operated through the bishops\u2019 conference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Connecticut Diocese Praises Pro-Abortion U.S. Rep.
