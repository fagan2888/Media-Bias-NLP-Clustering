It\u2019s an important rite of passage for many as they transition from employer or individual plans into this federal health insurance program. It is also an important choice which each and every Montana Medicare beneficiary should be aware of and make for themselves.\n\nIn a nutshell, every person has an Initial Election Period (IEP) when they can choose their Medicare coverage including Parts A, B and D. This period begins three months before they become eligible for Medicare.\n\nIt is vital Montanans understand the Medicare sign-up process and their plan options. Health insurance coverage is important and there are limited opportunities to change your plan once you are enrolled. While some special election periods do apply, in general, if you are enrolled in a plan this month, you may not be able to actually change plans, including Part D Prescription Drug coverage, until the Annual Election Period (AEP). This year the AEP begins on Oct. 15, and runs through Monday, Dec. 7. At that time, your new plan will be in place Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nThese are big decisions and need to be researched and considered closely. Paying close attention to the details can help Medicare beneficiaries save time and money during 2015 and beyond.\n\nMontana Medicare beneficiaries need to consider many important details when making their Medicare choices:\n\n\u2022 Coverage: Does the plan cover the services and prescriptions you need?\n\n\u2022 Cost: What does the plan cost? What are the co-pays and deductibles?\n\n\u2022 Convenience: Is it easy to reach someone at the company if you have a question?\n\nHigh-quality, affordable health care is a necessity for all Montanans, especially Medicare beneficiaries. Our mission at New West Medicare is to improve quality of care, enhance member experience and decrease health care costs.
