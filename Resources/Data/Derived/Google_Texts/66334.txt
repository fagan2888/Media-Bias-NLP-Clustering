When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published new guidelines mandating that chain restaurants display calorie counts, this particular consumer (me, Joanna) thought that she might lose a couple pounds as well as the habit of ordering baked ziti from Sbarro’s. Turns out, American consumers will also suffer about $5.7 billion in “lost pleasure” over 20 years, an odd little metric that many public health experts are upset about.

Reuters reports:

[The FDA’s] work is based on a concept called “consumer surplus” long employed by economists to calculate benefits people get from various goods and services which may not be fully captured by market prices. For example, if a government turned a playground into an industrial park, or banned pizza, the pleasure people lose from not having the park or eating a slice counts as a “cost” of the action.

But some leading economists say there is no justification for the FDA’s application of consumer surplus to calorie counts, since the government is not banning a product but just making information available.

Consumers who eat healthier as a result “are presumably doing so because they are now better informed,” said Kenneth Warner of the University of Michigan, one of the nation’s leading experts on cost-benefit analysis. Anything a consumer freely chooses should not be treated as a forced loss of pleasure, he argued.
