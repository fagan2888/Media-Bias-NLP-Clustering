They're happy, they're positive, but sometimes there'll be maybe six or 10 people that can't handle alcohol. They drink a little too much and they start fighting with one another and it causes a bad vibe for everyone else.\"\n\nThis time around, he did things differently. He reached out to law enforcement early on with safety plans to make sure they prevent any emergencies.\n\n\"We actually asked the sheriff's office and all the other agencies this year if they see any violence whatsoever or anything to vent to put the people in cuffs and get them out of here because we don't want to deal with it,\" Sinclair said.\n\nPartygoers said they notice an increase in law enforcement presence, but they don't mind.\n\n\"They are absolutely doing their job keeping everything safe, under control, keeping underage drinking under control,\" Yergi said\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Commission representatives worked the party and said as of 6 p.m., they responded to two medical emergencies, including someone having a bottle broken over their head.\n\nThe final attendance number - and how many people may have been arrested - wasn't available late Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Thousands of people are out on the water across Southwest Florida this Labor Day weekend.
