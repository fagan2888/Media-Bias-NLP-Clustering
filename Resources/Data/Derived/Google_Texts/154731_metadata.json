That\u2019s one-fourth of what the federal government expects to spend on defense contracts in the state that year, the study said.\n\n\u201cNo state that declines to expand the program is going to be fiscally better off because of it,\u201d said Glied, a former Obama administration health planning official who is dean of NYU\u2019s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.\n\nTexas Republican leaders have resisted Medicaid expansion, saying federal rules are too rigid and state costs in future years would soar. GOP leaders predict that federal budget cuts and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rollout problems will force a rollback of the generous pledge of federal funding.\n\nLast year, Texas took $17 billion in federal money for its $28 billion Medicaid program. It currently covers 3.6 million children, pregnant women, seniors and disabled Texans.\n\nMore than 1 million poor adults of working age would be added to the program by 2016 if Texas changed course and embraced expansion, according to the state Health and Human Services Commission.\n\nThe study was sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit group that argues for improvements in health care accessibility and affordability. It said Texas in 2022 would have to pick up 10 percent of the Medicaid expansion tab. The state cost would be $1.2 billion.\n\nIf state leaders persist in rejecting expansion, Texans still would pay for other states to cover low-income adults through their income, corporate and estate taxes paid to the federal government, Glied and Ma wrote.\n\n\u201cTheir tax dollars will be used to support a program from which nobody in their state will benefit,\u201d Glied said in a written statement.\n\nHealth policy analyst John Davidson said state leaders are right to rebuff the federal money.\n\n\u201cUntil Medicaid is fundamentally reformed, it\u2019s reckless to expand it,\u201d said Davidson, of the free market-oriented Texas Public Policy Foundation.\n\nAnne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income Texans, said the study highlights how Medicaid already is \u201ca major job generator\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to imagine that Texas would even consider giving up a quarter of our defense contracts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would consider it calamitous, yet in the current [political] climate, that\u2019s the kind of decision that\u2019s being promoted.\u201d\n\nFollow Robert T.
