Adam Schiff Adam SchiffSunday shows preview: Sanders opens up about battle with Clinton Overnight Defense: Terrorism suspected in EgyptAir crash; McCain details funding plans The Trail 2016: Donald and the Supremes MORE (D-Calif.) introduced legislation Tuesday that would restructure the National Security Agency\u2019s phone metadata surveillance program.\n\nSchiff, a senior member on the House Intelligence Committee, unveiled the \u201cTelephone Metadata Reform Act,\u201d which would require the government to request records from phone companies on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis proposal, the congressman says, reflects what a panel has advised President Obama to do on NSA reforms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor a long time, I\u2019ve been pushing to have the call records held by phone companies and 'queried' on a case-by-case basis, instead of the government\u2019s collecting vast amounts of domestic phone records,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.\n\nSchiff was one of several lawmakers who attended a meeting at the White House last week to discuss possible agency reforms with Obama.\n\n\u201cMy legislation would restore the balance between security and privacy by allowing law enforcement and the intelligence community to access records when needed, but also respecting the privacy of Americans by ending government possession of these vast databases.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s introduction, however, comes just a day after Schiff acknowledged it would be difficult for Congress to pass NSA reforms. Some lawmakers say its surveillance operations violate privacy, while others credit the program with thwarting terrorist plots.\n\nInstead, Schiff urged Obama to use as much executive power as possible to reform the intelligence-gathering agency because Congress likely can\u2019t.\n\nMSNBC host Chuck Todd asked Schiff on the \u201cThe Daily Rundown\u201d Monday whether Congress could reach an agreement on the issue.\n\n\u201cVery difficult. Very tall order for a very dysfunctional Congress, which is why I think the president is going to need to go as far as he can through the executive process,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cA lot of these things can be done \u2026 the restructuring of the metadata program is a significant part by the executive acting on its own.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama is set to announce his proposed reforms on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bill would require the government to request records on a case-by-case basis.", "description": "The bill would require the government to request records on a case-by-case basis.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bill would require the government to request records on a case-by-case basis.", "title": "Schiff unveils NSA metadata reform bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/195381-schiff-unveils-nsa-metadata-reform-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-14T12:57:16-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-14T12:57-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/195381-schiff-unveils-nsa-metadata-reform-bill", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-14T11:49-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Security Agency, Mass surveillance,Adam Schiff,NSA", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-14T11:49:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-14T12:57:16-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/195381-schiff-unveils-nsa-metadata-reform-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bill would require the government to request records on a case-by-case basis.", "card": "summary", "title": "Schiff unveils NSA metadata reform bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Schiff unveils NSA metadata reform bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd382e\"", "article_summary": "Instead, Schiff urged Obama to use as much executive power as possible to reform the intelligence-gathering agency because Congress likely can\u2019t.\nSchiff, a senior member on the House Intelligence Committee, unveiled the \u201cTelephone Metadata Reform Act,\u201d which would require the government to request records from phone companies on a case-by-case basis.\nThis proposal, the congressman says, reflects what a panel has advised President Obama to do on NSA reforms.\nSchiff was one of several lawmakers who attended a meeting at the White House last week to discuss possible agency reforms with Obama.\nMSNBC host Chuck Todd asked Schiff on the \u201cThe Daily Rundown\u201d Monday whether Congress could reach an agreement on the issue."}
