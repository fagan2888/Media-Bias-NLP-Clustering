There was the fire and explosion in 2012 that sent toxic fumes into the surrounding Bay Area. There are the continuing worries about the long-term health effects facing the people who breathed those fumes in. There\u2019s the everyday air pollution, and the everyday risk, that comes from living in the refinery\u2019s vicinity and, more quietly, there\u2019s the big money Chevron pumps into local elections to ensure none of this is examined too closely.\n\n\u201cThe only time you ever saw Richmond on the news was two things: somebody\u2019s bleeding or somebody\u2019s burning,\u201d Michele McGeoy, the founder of Solar Richmond, tells a class of job trainees at the beginning of the documentary \u201cCatching the Sun.\u201d \u201cI want to create some good news in Richmond.\u201d\n\nThe project in Richmond, and in cities like it across the country, is to shift from what environmental activist Van Jones, who also features prominently in the film, calls a \u201cpollution-based economy,\u201d filled with haves and have-nots, to an economy based on green energy \u2014 the environmental benefits of which are almost second to the creation of jobs, and the improved quality of life, that investment in solar innovation can create. The film follows the stories of the workers, entrepreneurs and political activists who are working to make that happen, and of the forces, both local and global, that can help or hinder the process.\n\nSalon spoke with Shalini Kantayya, the film\u2019s director, about America\u2019s place in the global clean energy race. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\n\u201cCatching the Sun\u201d starts out a little differently from most environmental films: You don\u2019t really talk about the planet, large-scale, or climate change, but go straight to these very local impact of fossil fuels, focusing on one community where people might not normally prioritize environmental issues. Could you tell me a little bit more about why you chose that approach?\n\nI was very interested in Richmond, California, as a symbol of other American cities. It was a large industrial city, and a lot of those industries have left Richmond, leaving it with high amounts of unemployment. Also, a lot of those industries had been dirty industries, so it had higher rates of cancer and asthma. When I discovered this Solar Richmond training program, I thought it could be a symbol of the type of transformation that could be good for cities across the country.\n\nThat\u2019s sort of what put me on this journey, and I started to tell a small story about American workers seeking to retool for jobs in the solar industry. After a year or two of wondering why they haven\u2019t gotten jobs, I started to unravel the large global forces at play deciding whether American workers get jobs in the industries of tomorrow. That journey took me to China. Integrating those two stories \u2014 that local story in Richmond and this global story in China \u2014 that took two years in the edit room.\n\nIt\u2019s so disheartening in the second half of the film when this character who\u2019s gone through the training program, and is now a skilled worker, just can\u2019t find a job in solar. What are some of the global forces that you found that were working against him?\n\n\n\nWhat I really began to understand in the making of this film is the importance of public policy in creating common good for us, as a democracy. I think we\u2019ve been so swayed by media to believe that anything that is in the common good is communist. But actually our environment is something that is in our common good. And so, what I came to understand is that we can use the power of public policy to avert a crisis. Here in the United States we have a history of doing that \u2014 Ronald Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol. We know how to do that, and that\u2019s what I got excited about in the making of this film. And the fact that, because we\u2019re dealing with electricity, a lot of those decisions get made at the local and the state level, where people have a lot of power. With Congress totally missing in action, we can make this change all across the country.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about how public policy toward renewable energy in the U.S. differs from what\u2019s going on in China?\n\n\n\nI think the foremost distinction is that the government of China accepts the signs of global warming and accepts the signs that human beings are causing it. And also, China has passed aggressive national policy to become a world leader in renewable energy technology. In two of its last five-year plans, it\u2019s identified renewable energy as a major sector of growth in China. What we\u2019ve seen with that very aggressive policy is, China went from producing a fraction of 1 percent of the world\u2019s global solar to producing 90 percent of the world\u2019s global solar. That happened essentially in just over five years. What\u2019s interesting about China\u2019s entry into renewable energy is that it\u2019s also helped to bring the price down. What\u2019s happening is that the U.S. now has the opportunity to create jobs downstream, in the installation, in the design and the engineering, where there are more jobs anyway \u2014 and those jobs cannot be outsourced. I really think the U.S. and China can work together to solve this crisis.\n\nAt the local level, you suggest the problem isn\u2019t even about getting people to accept climate change. There\u2019s that really strong moment in the beginning of the film where a couple is speaking at home. The husband says, \u201cWe can get solar panels on our roof. It can lower the electricity bill.\u201d And the wife is telling him to \u201cbe practical\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s not believing it could happen. It seems like there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism in the U.S. that this industry is capable of growing as much as it is projected to.\n\nAbsolutely, and here\u2019s the thing: You don\u2019t have to accept what 99 percent of the world\u2019s scientists agree upon. You don\u2019t have to actually believe in climate change to believe that solar energy is good for our country. I think that\u2019s the big distinction that my film makes. It shows that in so many places across the country, it is the same cost or cheaper \u2014 rapidly becoming cheaper \u2014 than the cost of fossil fuels. And with fossil fuels, there are all these expenses that we don\u2019t factor in to the cost of energy: say, for instance, pollution, and the effect that fossil fuels have on our air and the amount of asthma and the cost of sending our kids to the hospital for those inhalers. We don\u2019t factor that into the cost of fossil fuels, nor do we factor the other costs that we spend: our human lives, our resources, our military. Once you begin to factor in those external costs, solar wins economically every day of the week and twice on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Director Shalini Kantayya talks to Salon about the incredible potential of solar power", "title": "The energy revolution that has 1 percenters shaking in their boots", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Director Shalini Kantayya talks to Salon about the incredible potential of solar power", "title": "The energy revolution that has 1 percenters shaking in their boots", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/21/the_energy_revolution_that_has_1_percenters_shaking_in_their_boots/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/10407814_392036310954856_3650977560832247686_n-e1434743795192.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Director Shalini Kantayya talks to Salon about the incredible potential of solar power", "title": "The energy revolution that has 1 percenters shaking in their boots", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/10407814_392036310954856_3650977560832247686_n-e1434743795192.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, fossil fuels, Green energy, Jobs, Solar energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3aa\"", "article_summary": "You don\u2019t have to actually believe in climate change to believe that solar energy is good for our country.\nSalon spoke with Shalini Kantayya, the film\u2019s director, about America\u2019s place in the global clean energy race.\nWhat we\u2019ve seen with that very aggressive policy is, China went from producing a fraction of 1 percent of the world\u2019s global solar to producing 90 percent of the world\u2019s global solar.\nIn two of its last five-year plans, it\u2019s identified renewable energy as a major sector of growth in China.\nAnd also, China has passed aggressive national policy to become a world leader in renewable energy technology."}
