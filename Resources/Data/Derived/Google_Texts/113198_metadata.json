Working a touch like Google, the engine essentially uses artificial intelligence to meld data from ClinicalTrials.gov with disease specifics to provide a tool that can fine tune cancer therapy.\n\nThe new tool, MM Lab, is building on data from the public-facing search engine to match the patient\u2019s exact genetic cancer type to the best known treatment option. It indexes clinical trials, drug and medical databases, as well as information from individual drug labels and scientific journals to pop up with the same query. Indeed, MolecularMatch says this \u201cincludes 300,000 biomedical documents checked against more than 700,000 biomedical facts \u2013 resulting in nearly 2.5 billion indexed combinations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMolecularMatch is targeting next-generation sequencing labs for its lab-facing software. Coker cited Biodesix, Foundation Medicine, Trovagene and Guardant Health as current or potential customers.\n\nThe company\u2019s raised about $4 million from a network of angel investors in the Houston area, CEO Kevin Coker said in an interview.
