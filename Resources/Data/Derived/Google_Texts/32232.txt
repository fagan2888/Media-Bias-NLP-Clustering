Sioux Falls, SD

Saturday hundreds of people who grew up in the Hilltop Neighborhood of Sioux Falls in the 1960's and 70's gathered for a reunion.

Linda Stoops organized the event, and she says catching up with old friends and neighbors is like taking a trip back in time.

"You'll get to see people that knew you when you were you, before you were a mom or a dad or a grandparent or an employee or an employer, whatever you became in life. These are the people that knew us when we were just us," Stoops said.

Stoops says when she was growing up in the Hilltop neighborhood, the people living on her street weren't just neighbors, but more like family.
