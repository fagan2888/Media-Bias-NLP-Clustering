Bernie Sanders or Hillary Rodham Clinton \u201cwon\u201d Tuesday night\u2019s debate, for two reasons: First, because no one can seem to agree what the criteria are for \u201cwinning.\u201d Second, because it would only matter if the result were dramatic enough to change the overall dynamic of the campaign, which in this case rather obviously did not happen. Whether you\u2019re feeling the Bern or ready for Hillary, you probably feel the same way now that you did before the debate.\n\nSo let\u2019s table the horserace angle for now and take a closer look at one of the key exchanges of the debate instead. The back-and-forth was primarily between Clinton and Sanders, and it concerned their respective understandings of what the word \u201ccapitalism\u201d really means. While I believe it would be a mistake to treat the moment as a Rosetta Stone for understanding the contest, I also think the New Republic\u2019s Elizabeth Bruenig is right to say that the disagreement between Clinton and Sanders mirrors \u201ca major fault line on the left.\u201d\n\nBefore we start exploring that schism, though, here\u2019s a recap for those who missed the debate. Responding to moderator Anderson Cooper\u2019s question about whether he is a capitalist, Sanders said, \u201cDo I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process, by which so few have so much and so many have so little; by which Wall Street\u2019s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don\u2019t.\u201d It was a strong, unapologetic, feisty answer; a great representation of why Sanders has become so adored by much of the American left.\n\nIt was also, however, an opportunity for Clinton to burnish her moderate bona fides. And she did. \u201cWhen I think about capitalism,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cI think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that, and [to] make a good living for themselves and their families.\u201d She granted that \u201cevery so often\u201d policymakers must \u201csave capitalism from itself.\u201d But she cautioned against \u201cconfusing\u201d capitalism\u2019s excesses with capitalism in general.\n\nSanders insisted he and Clinton were \u201cin agreement\u201d concerning \u201csmall and medium-size businesses.\u201d But he added that \u201cyou can have all of the growth that you want,\u201d but \u201cif all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent,\u201d it doesn\u2019t matter. Cooper then let the debate move onto a new topic, which was unfortunate. Because in just a few words, Clinton and Sanders had each shared a very different worldview. Not only about the economy, but also politics. And voters deserve to have the choice before them made more explicit.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein notes, the disagreement between Clinton and Sanders has much to do with the role they envision for big business. Sanders\u2019 politics are largely (but not exclusively) defined by \u201ca deep and abiding skepticism of the role large corporations play in American life.\u201d He \u201cbelieves their most crucial innovations often simply free-ride on publicly funded research\u201d and he \u201cworries that their massive profits allow them to buy off politicians and rig the system.\u201d Individuals within corporations may mean well, but corporations themselves are, to democracy, an inherent threat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two leading candidates seem to have much in common.
