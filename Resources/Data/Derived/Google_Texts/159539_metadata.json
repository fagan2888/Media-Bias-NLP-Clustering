USDA Rural Development is working to change that reality.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack this week announced important investments of $1.2 billion to improve access to health care, community infrastructure, and provide essential services across rural America through Rural Development\u2019s Community Facilities program. This brings us to a grand total of nearly $5 billion in rural health care investments since 2009, impacting nearly 7 million people in rural America.\n\nAs we celebrate National Rural Health Care Week, I\u2019m proud of the achievements we\u2019ve made thus far in closing that distance between our rural communities and top-notch medical care. For example, we\u2019ve recently provided a $91 million loan to the Avita Health System in Galion, Ohio to convert a vacant department store into a multi-specialty health care facility.\n\nWe provided funding to support the construction of a brand new critical care hospital in Livingston, Montana \u2013 one that replaces a crowded and undersized facility with one that can now serve residents throughout the area. We also invested in transportation in rural Allendale County, South Carolina to provide seniors in this Promise Zone region called the Low Country a way to get to the medical services they need.\n\nNo discussion about health care would be complete without considering mental health. In December of 2013, Secretary Vilsack set a three-year goal of investing $50 million in CF funds to develop or improve mental health facilities and services in rural areas. This year, we quadrupled that goal, funding more than $213 million in 80 projects in 34 states.\n\nIt goes beyond building hospitals and buying ambulances though \u2013 we have also invested in broadband technology to bring specialized medical experts from regional centers and place them digitally into rural medical facilities to make critical diagnoses and provide guidance to the trained staff in the field. This bridging of the miles using fiber optics and state-of-the-art medical equipment can quite literally save lives by giving patients immediate access to the best care available.\n\nWhen we combine this level of investment with the personal support available to rural residents through the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s clear that we are making great strides towards a new reality. A new reality that brings cutting-edge and affordable health care to all Americans \u2013 not just the ones in our urban centers.\n\nAt USDA Rural Development, we understand how important health care is for rural America, and we are committed to investing in these facilities, and more importantly, in supporting the hard working Americans who rely on them.", "article_metadata": {"NextGEN": "1.8.0", "generator": "WordPress 3.1.3"}, "article_summary": "This brings us to a grand total of nearly $5 billion in rural health care investments since 2009, impacting nearly 7 million people in rural America.\nAs we celebrate National Rural Health Care Week, I\u2019m proud of the achievements we\u2019ve made thus far in closing that distance between our rural communities and top-notch medical care.\nAt USDA Rural Development, we understand how important health care is for rural America, and we are committed to investing in these facilities, and more importantly, in supporting the hard working Americans who rely on them.\nNo discussion about health care would be complete without considering mental health.\nA new reality that brings cutting-edge and affordable health care to all Americans \u2013 not just the ones in our urban centers."}
