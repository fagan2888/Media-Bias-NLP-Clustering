She\u2019d already tried the contraceptive patch \u2013 a thin plastic strip that sticks to the body and delivers hormones through the skin \u2013 but it had given her a rash. She didn\u2019t like needles and had no desire to choose Depo-Provera, the pregnancy-preventing shot. And in the past, she\u2019d used the NuvaRing \u2013 a flexible plastic ring that\u2019s placed inside the vagina and releases progestin and estrogen \u2013 but for her, its side effects included \u201cextreme mood swings, to the point where I was crying and then I was laughing.\u201d\n\nDuring a break from school, Schmitz \u2013 now a 28-year-old architectural intern who lives in Atlanta \u2013 visited a trusted primary care physician, a female doctor whose husband was an architect. She listened closely to Schmitz\u2019s concerns, and then suggested the student try a form of contraceptive she\u2019d never used before: an intrauterine device, more commonly referred to as an IUD.\n\nIUDs, the doctor explained, are small, T-shaped plastic devices that are either wrapped in copper \u2013 a metal that\u2019s toxic to sperm \u2013 or release a hormone called levonorgestrel. They\u2019re inserted into the uterus by a health care professional, and depending on the type, can be left inside the body for time periods ranging from three to 10 years. And perhaps most importantly, they\u2019re nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. An IUD, Schmitz\u2019s doctor said, would free her from worrying about birth control so she could focus on her budding career.\n\nAfter weighing her options, Schmitz decided to opt for Mirena, a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD that releases hormones into the uterus instead of the entire body. It's known to lighten cramps and menstrual flows, and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for five years of use. Four years later, Schmitz says, it\u2019s almost time to get a new one \u2013 and depending on life circumstances such as marriage and pregnancy, she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to choose the method again.\n\n\u201cIt was a godsend,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have mood swings, I had very few periods or they were light, and I didn't have to worry about [pregnancy] anymore. I didn't have to think.\u201d\n\nBoth Schmitz and medical experts stress that there are many different forms of birth control. Some might work better than others for certain women\u2019s bodies and lifestyles, be it condoms, a patch or a pill. But according to recent national figures, more and more women, just like Schmitz, are opting to choose the IUD \u2013 once viewed as a contraceptive method best suited for busy mothers \u2013 as a first-line method of birth control.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to advance reproductive health, reports that women using long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs \u2013 which primarily consist of IUDs, but can also include hormone-releasing implants \u2013 have increased among all women, regardless of age, race, education or income. Only 2.4 percent of women used LARCs in 2002. By 2007, that figure had risen to 3.7, and by 2009 it was 8.5 percent.\n\nSimilarly, Planned Parenthood reports that it\u2019s seen the total number of patients using IUDs increase 75 percent from 2008 to 2012. In just one year, between 2011 and 2012, the organization says it saw a 19 percent rise in patients with IUDs. And because the data was compiled before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s no-copay birth control benefit took effect, Planned Parenthood says they expect the numbers to keep rising.\n\nMeanwhile, both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics recently recommended long-acting contraceptive devices as the first choice of birth control for sexually active teenage girls \u2013 outweighing conventional views that IUDs and implants were better suited for older women.\n\nBut are IUDs the right option for you? Here are a few common questions answered \u2013 and a few longstanding myths debunked:\n\nHow Do IUDs Work?\n\nAt first glance, IUDs look alike \u2013 they\u2019re small, plastic, T-shaped devices that are several centimeters high and wide. Thin strings that resemble fishing line dangle from the bottom and are primarily used so the doctor can remove the device and women can manually check to make sure it's still in place.\n\nHowever, there are differences between various types of IUDs. Although many kinds are used across the world, the U.S. currently offers three on the market: ParaGard, which is covered in tiny copper coils; Mirena; and Skyla, a new IUD that also releases levonorgestrel but is slightly tinier than Mirena or ParaGard and designed for women who have a smaller uterus.\n\nThe basic science of how they work differs as well, according to Anne Burke, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the Family Planning Fellowship Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. For Mirena and Skyla, \u201cThe progesterone \u2013 which is the kind of hormone that levonorgestrel is \u2013 has several contraceptive effects,\u201d she says. \u201cOne is that it helps thicken the cervical mucus, which creates a more impenetrable barrier for sperm. It also suppresses the growth of the lining of the uterus, which also probably impacts fertilization and enhances the contraceptive effect. There\u2019s also some evidence that it may impede some of the function of sperm.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, she says, ParaGard \u2013 the copper IUD \u2013 creates a mild inflammatory reaction inside the uterus, which primarily helps prevent the sperm from fertilizing the egg.\n\nParaGard can be left inside a women\u2019s uterus for 10 years, whereas Mirena only prevents pregnancy for five years, and Skyla for three. Upon insertion, ParaGard works to prevent pregnancy immediately; Mirena and Skyla are fully effective after a week. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 0.2 and 0.8 percent of women who use an IUD will have an unplanned pregnancy within a year.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Insertion and Removal Process Like?\n\nBefore getting an IUD, you\u2019ll usually need to take three things: a pregnancy test if you\u2019re sexually active, an STD test (the insertion process could potentially carry any infections through the cervix into the uterus) and a pain reliever like ibuprofen to alleviate the procedure\u2019s potentially painful aspects. Before actual insertion, the doctor will also perform a quick pelvic exam and check the position of the uterus.\n\nAccording to Burke, the insertion process itself is done by a medical provider, be it a primary care physician who\u2019s trained in IUD insertion, a gynecologist or another clinician. After explaining any risks and benefits, the procedure begins similar to a Pap smear: The doctor inserts a speculum into the vagina, dilates the cervix and occasionally provides numbing medicine to remove some discomfort. Then, the physician uses forceps to hold the cervix still, and a tool called a sound to measure the uterus to make sure it\u2019s large enough for the IUD to fit inside.\n\nFinally, the IUD is placed into the uterus through an insertion tube, which flattens the IUD\u2019s \u201cT\u201d and pushes the IUD through the cervix into the uterus before it\u2019s taken out. Once the IUD is inside the uterus, the doctor trims the strings so they poke out only slightly beyond the cervix and then removes the speculum. The entire process takes 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nAlthough IUDs can be left in for years, Burke says a woman can have her IUD taken out anytime she wants. Removal is a no-fuss procedure; a medical provider grabs hold of the strings with forceps and simply pulls the IUD out of the vagina.\n\nAs for a women\u2019s return to fertility, it\u2019s \u201cfairly immediate,\u201d Burke notes. \u201cThere's been some studies showing that out of the women who have their IUDs removed and are trying to get pregnant, about 85 to 89 percent ... will be pregnant by the end of [a] year,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Ninety percent of women have at least one risk factor for developing heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "A closer look at how they work, side effects and misconceptions.", "zone": "patientadvice/articles", "author": "Kirstin Fawcett", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A closer look at how they work, side effects and misconceptions.", "title": "The Ins and Outs of IUDs", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2014/11/19/iuds-is-this-kind-of-birth-control-right-for-you", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/99/37/86fe51bf4b49822ea7efd04d31a2/141119-iudbirthcontrol-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "A closer look at how they work, side effects and misconceptions.", "card": "summary", "title": "IUDs: Is This Kind of Birth Control Right for You? - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/41cb765/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F99%2F37%2F86fe51bf4b49822ea7efd04d31a2%2Fresizes%2F500%2F141119-iudbirthcontrol-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],women's health,birth control,patient advice,patient-advice-include [Consumer Advice],healthandwellness [Consumer Advice],Kirstin Fawcett", "published_at": "2014-11-19", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-11-19"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z47lk3", "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "An IUD, Schmitz\u2019s doctor said, would free her from worrying about birth control so she could focus on her budding career.\nI didn't have to think.\u201dBoth Schmitz and medical experts stress that there are many different forms of birth control.\nWhile earning her master\u2019s degree in architecture, Emilie Schmitz barely had time to sleep, let alone remember to take a birth control pill every day.\nAccording to Burke, the insertion process itself is done by a medical provider, be it a primary care physician who\u2019s trained in IUD insertion, a gynecologist or another clinician.\nAlthough IUDs can be left in for years, Burke says a woman can have her IUD taken out anytime she wants."}
