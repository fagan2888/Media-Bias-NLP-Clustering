Like they were wrong about drug-testing food stamp recipients and cutting funding to mental health.\n\nHere in Alabama, the Republicans have been wrong about taxes, the state budget, closing Veteran's Assistance offices, Medicaid expansion, and the effectiveness of corporate welfare because all they talked about during the election was who hated Obama more than their opponent.\n\nThey were wrong about trying to put the Ten Commandments in the courthouse and wrong about trying to make Christianity the state religion. Yeah, that pesky separation of church and state thing... again.\n\nAlso, they were wrong about Obama coming for your guns. Go look under your bed or in your waistband... still there.\n\nThey've been wrong about which President has taken the most vacation days. And, yes, for the umpteenth time, they were wrong about Benghazi. Oh, by the way, there is no U.S. Ebola crisis, either.\n\nNot to beat a dead horse, but the whole \"trickle-down\" thing and Reagan's anti-union tirade didn't really work out too well, either.\n\nBut, just like they talk about in twelve-step meetings, the first step to real recovery is to admit you have a problem. Sometimes, that includes admitting that you were wrong.\n\nRepublicans, this could be a very liberating experience and, perhaps, an opportunity to focus your energies on more productive things. Things that all Americans want; like improving our aging infrastructure or regaining our rank as the world's leader in education.\n\nOf course, that would mean swallowing one last bitter pill and admitting one more ideological wrong. Government is not intrinsically bad.\n\nSee, government policies, when intelligently and deliberately applied, can do amazing things. It's how we got our interstate system, our postal system, and a myriad of other public services that we take for granted. In fact, FDR's public works projects helped us out of the Great Depression.\n\nThe idea that every government program is rife with fraud and abuse is simply a myth. This may come as news to some conservatives, but our military is actually a \"big gub'mint\" Federal program. Yeah, it's pretty shocking, but totally true.\n\nAll this is really important because we have real problems in America that need to be solved, but they won't be solved if we don't learn from our mistakes and admit when we are wrong.\n\nEver since Republicans began mythologizing and idolizing Pres. Ronald Reagan, they have become increasingly intolerant to any fact or opinion that does not mesh with their increasingly extremist political rhetoric. But now, the cognitive dissonance it takes to listen to Republican-mouthpiece Fox News or to hear Alabama Gov. Bentley explain his flip-flopping on Medicaid expansion is enough to make one's head explode.\n\nRepublicans, just admit you're wrong. You'll feel better. As they say, the truth will set you free.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "opinion", "title": "Republicans: It's OK to admit you were wrong: opinion", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Throughout the Obama presidency, particularly since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have been shrilly claiming that Democratic policies would spell absolute disaster for the American economy and the complete destruction of all things American.
