FERGUSON, Mo., Nov. 16 (UPI)—After members of the KKK put up fliers saying they would use “lethal force” against Ferguson protesters, as the grand jury announcement over the shooting of Michael Brown approaches, the hacktivist group Anonymous has begun publishing names of area KKK members on social media.

The fliers the KKK distributed said: “There will be consequences for your acts of violence against the peaceful, law-abiding citizens of Missouri,” according to Vice News. “We will use lethal force as provided under Missouri Law to defend ourselves.”

Along with posting names on their own social media accounts, the hackers have taken over the Klu Klux Klan’s Twitter account, @KuKluxKlanUSA. “Under anon control as of 16 NOV 2014 09:11:47. You should’ve expected us,” the account’s description now reads.

The KKK claimed they were not worried about the threats from Anonymous before their account was taken over.
