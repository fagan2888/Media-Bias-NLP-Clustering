He also has vowed to prevent Social Security benefit cuts for anyone over the age of 14, staked out firm opposition to \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants and decried the fast-track trade powers and the pacific trade deal President Obama is seeking from Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of America\u2019s workers getting punched in the gut,\u201d Mr. Huckabee said in an op-ed this week against the trade initiatives.\n\nAmid stiff competition for the nomination, the former Arkansas governor and his camp sent a message they believe connects with working-class voters who feel left behind by power brokers in Washington and on Wall Street, and is a winning strategy for both the primary and the eventual general election.\n\nFrank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, a conservative think tank, said that Mr. Huckabee\u2019s message could resonate with voters who are concerned that their economic well-being and religious liberty is under attack, and that the Republican party has become too consumed with wooing the well-heeled.\n\n\u201cI think Huckabee is smart to be focused on the idea that there is a connection between the economic frustration of people and the frustration of people regarding the rejection of their religious beliefs,\u201d Mr. Cannon said. \u201cHuckabee is looking in his own way to form a set set of policies that combine those two elements.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee touched on that religious message Thursday, promising in his new pledge to defend the \u201csanctity of all human life from the moment of conception until the grave\u201d and to push to defund Planned Parenthood, which has become a favorite target of religious conservatives.\n\n\u201cToday I signed a \u2018Pledge to the People,\u2019 to defend our Constitution and founding principles, and not just speak to Americans, but for them, so that every American can go from Hope to Higher Ground,\u201d Mr. Huckabee said, repeating his campaign slogan, which brings together his Christian faith, his humble upbringing and his quest to become the voice for the common man in 2016.\n\nFox News released a national poll on Thursday that found Mr. Huckabee is running near the front of the pack in the nomination race, and is seen as the most ethical of the candidates lining up for the GOP nomination.\n\nIt also found that his net favorability is higher among those without college degrees and among those who made less than $50,000.\n\nThose age 65 or older also saw him in a more positive light than younger generations.\n\nThe poll also found that 85 percent of respondents believed that political leaders are \u201cmore interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right for the American people.\n\nThe populist mantle could prove powerful in a GOP primary, but it has had few takers in previous contests.\n\nThis time, there are several who could try to make claims, including former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, both of whom have said American workers\u2019 wages should be considered when writing immigration policy.\n\nBut analysts have said to win the populist tag could require not just opposing expanded immigration, but also finding other areas to take stands against major business interests \u2014 and free trade deals are shaping up this year as the litmus test for that.\n\nMr. Santorum has embraced the fast-track trade powers President Obama is seeking, while Mr. Huckabee said he opposes them.\n\n\u201cI never have been and won\u2019t be the favorite candidate of those in the \u2018Washington to Wall Street\u2019 corridor of power. I will be funded and fueled not by the billionaires, but by working people across America,\u201d Mr. Huckabee said.\n\nAlice Stewart, a Huckabee spokesperson, said the 2012 presidential election underscored the importance of fielding a Republican candidate that can connect with, and ultimately win over, ordinary Americans.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, Mitt Romney had a good resume on the issues, but people didn\u2019t like him so they didn\u2019t vote for him. They didn\u2019t think he understood what working Americans go through,\u201d Ms. Stewart said. \u201cWhereas people understand people that Gov. Huckabee knows what it is like to work hard and put food on the table and make ends meet.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee\u2019s entire pledge is as follows:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Arkansas Gov.
