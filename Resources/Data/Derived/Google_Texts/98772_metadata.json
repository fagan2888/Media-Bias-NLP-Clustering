Now the administration seems to be moving toward part \u2014 but not all \u2014 of what labor wants on the reinsurance fee.\n\nWhile it intends to waive the fee for 2015 and 2016, unions also wanted it scrapped for 2014, when it will be the greatest. Taft-Hartley plans are collectively bargained and run jointly by unions and employers to allow workers to move from job to job without losing coverage.\n\nThe AFL-CIO did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s too early to tell whether the Department of Health and Human Services will give union plans all of what they want on the fee, last week\u2019s language \u201cis how HHS often breaks controversial regulatory news,\u201d benefits lawyer R. Pepper Crutcher, Jr. wrote last week. It's not known when the administration will put out a new regulation on reinsurance.\n\nThe reinsurance fee made a cameo appearance in the October debt-ceiling negotiations when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reportedly proposed delaying it for everybody until 2015. Republicans objected, and the delay was not in the final deal.\n\nThe fee, scheduled to kick in next year, would shrink to $42 in 2015 and $26 in 2016, disappearing afterward. It would help insurers absorb the cost of care for people with preexisting illness enrolling in plans offered through subsidized marketplaces.\n\nBoth unions and business have criticized it as penalizing employer-sponsored health insurance to support plans bought directly from insurers.\n\nThe fee \u201ctakes money from the pockets of each laborer covered by a health and welfare fund and gives it to for-profit insurance companies,\u201d Terry O\u2019Sullivan, president of the Laborers International Union of North America, wrote in a letter to President Obama last summer.\n\nA LIUNA spokesman declined to comment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
