From there, insurers or third-party administrators are responsible for managing and paying for coverage for affected employees.\n\nMany nonprofits have rejected the accommodations, saying the opt-out forms still make them complicit in offering contraceptives to which they object, notably morning-after pills they equate with abortion.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit refused this week to grant a preliminary injunction that would shield Notre Dame University from the mandate, noting the Indiana university simply must notify the government that the \u201cball is now in the government's court.\u201d\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court used similar reasoning.\n\n\u201cThe regulation allows Plaintiffs to continue to do just what they did before the [Affordable Care Act]: notify their insurers of their sincere religious objection to contraception, and arrange for contraception to be excluded from the health insurance coverage they provide,\u201d Judge Pillard wrote.\n\nTwo D.C. Circuit Court judges dissented with the ruling, saying Priests for Life deserved a second hearing in light of Hobby Lobby\u2019s holding that the government should refrain from violating someone\u2019s religious beliefs, when possible.\n\n\u201cThat is precisely what has happened here,\u201d said Circuit Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an appointee of President George W. Bush.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal appeals court said Wednesday it will not reconsider a pro-life ministry's plea for relief from Obamacare's birth control mandate, dealing a second blow in as many days to religious nonprofits who say the administration is ignoring its strongly held beliefs and signals from the Supreme Court.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal appeals court said Wednesday it will not reconsider a pro-life ministry\u2019s plea for relief from Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate, dealing a second blow in as many days to religious nonprofits who say the administration is ignoring its strongly held beliefs and signals from the Supreme Court.", "title": "Religious nonprofits lose Obamacare contraception mandate court ruling second time this week", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/20/religious-nonprofits-lose-obamacare-contraception-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/08/img_0275.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/08/img_0275.jpg", "description": "A federal appeals court said Wednesday it will not reconsider a pro-life ministry's plea for relief from Obamacare's birth control mandate, dealing a second blow in as many days to religious nonprofit", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Religious nonprofits lose Obamacare contraception mandate court ruling"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Law Crime, US Court Of Appeals, Nina Pillard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb92\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat is precisely what has happened here,\u201d said Circuit Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an appointee of President George W.
