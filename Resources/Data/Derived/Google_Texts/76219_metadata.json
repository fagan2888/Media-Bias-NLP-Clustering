Based on the police report, it\u2019s safe to assume that the burrito was purchased at \u201chole in the wall\u201d Tacos Chukis, a Mexican restaurant in an upstairs mall on East Broadway in Seattle, Washington. Clearly unaware that \u201cwhen you spread the wealth around, it\u2019s good for everybody,\u201d a whole $3.25 burrito was purchased for just one person.\n\nIf the burrito buyer was a more thoughtful human being, he would have promoted Mexican food equity and chosen a taco for $1.60 and given the other $1.60 to someone less fortunate. And if he had done that, there would have been five cents\u2019 change left over to redistribute to someone else, too. But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead, after buying food at the Mexican eatery, the customer chose to tuck into a big fat burrito in plain sight right outside the restaurant. That\u2019s when he was approached by Mahamed M. Abdi, a 24-year-old African-American fellow dressed in a \u201cgray cloth cap and a white fur coat.\u201d\n\nSeems Mr. Abdi took Michelle and Barry at their word and must have felt justified in demanding a piece of someone else\u2019s pie. In keeping with the president\u2019s \u2018share the wealth\u2019 motto, Abdi demanded: \u201cGive me a bite of your burrito.\u201d After all, didn\u2019t Michelle Obama say something like, \u201cSomeone is going to have to give up a piece of their [burrito] so that someone else can have more\u201d?\n\nThe offended diner refused, and pointed out to Abdi that asking for a bite of a stranger\u2019s \"little donkey\" is \u201crude!\u201d\n\nBecause the restaurant wasn\u2019t giving out free burritos, and in keeping with fair-share principles, those able to throw around the big bucks for selections off the expensive side of the chalkboard menu should always be prepared to offer a couple of bites to those President Obama calls the \u201cless fortunate among us.\u201d\n\nAfter all, at the end of the day, didn\u2019t buying the burrito support a successful small business (built by somebody other than the owners)? That\u2019s why, to prove his commitment to Mexican food redistribution, Abdi pushed the greedy burrito eater and again demanded a bite.\n\nThe bite was not forthcoming. Instead, after Mahamed \u201casked\u201d a second time, with burrito in hand the insensitive diner rose from his seat outside the restaurant and attempted to vacate the vicinity. That\u2019s when, according to the Seattle Police Department report , Abdi punched the man in the head and ran away.\n\nOn behalf of socialist presidents, walloping people who refuse to \u2018share the wealth\u2019 ought to be a government-approved tactic. In America we have the Lois Lerner types who, unlike Mahamed Abdi, do the head-punching in a very dignified manner.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, back in Seattle, as a result of being beaten, thankfully, the burrito owner only had \u201cvery slight redness [on his] forehead.\u201d The injured party did not request or require treatment at the non-Obamacare approved Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. The assault victim also did not cite post-traumatic burrito heist disorder, nor was he so devastated that he needed Washington State-approved physician suicide assistance.\n\nThe police eventually caught up with and arrested the famished Mr. Abdi, who, in a desperate cry for help, yelled obscenities and spit on the Plexiglass divider from the back seat of the police car.\n\nBased on his rap sheet, Mr. Abdi is a man who, after being arrested more than a dozen times, clearly believes that wealth-sharing is a concept more people need to cheerfully embrace. If the general public would just comply and share half of whatever they have whenever Mahamed wants it, it would do away with the need for him to assault Mexican restaurant customers.\n\nWhat\u2019s sad about the whole incident is that, based on policies that Michelle and Barack Obama promote, Abdi isn\u2019t really a criminal. He\u2019s just ahead of his time in understanding what it means for others to willingly share their \u2018piece of the pie\u2019 with him and others like him.\n\nJeannie hosts a blog at www.jeannie-ology.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/03/share_your_burrito_so_someone_else_can_have_more.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-03/191761_1_.jpg", "title": "Blog: Share Your Burrito 'So Someone Else Can Have More'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf731\"", "article_summary": "In keeping with the president\u2019s \u2018share the wealth\u2019 motto, Abdi demanded: \u201cGive me a bite of your burrito.\u201d After all, didn\u2019t Michelle Obama say something like, \u201cSomeone is going to have to give up a piece of their [burrito] so that someone else can have more\u201d?\nIn America we have the Lois Lerner types who, unlike Mahamed Abdi, do the head-punching in a very dignified manner.\nThat\u2019s why, to prove his commitment to Mexican food redistribution, Abdi pushed the greedy burrito eater and again demanded a bite.\nHere\u2019s how it happened: Concerned only with his own selfish needs, some hungry person decided to indulge in a burrito for lunch.\nClearly unaware that \u201cwhen you spread the wealth around, it\u2019s good for everybody,\u201d a whole $3.25 burrito was purchased for just one person."}
