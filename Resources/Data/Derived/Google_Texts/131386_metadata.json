Its first international opening is scheduled for Dubai in the next several months. The company is in its first 5 years of franchising, having not only survived but thrived during the great recession, with 82 locations in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe had no intentions of going international,\u201d Chemero says. \u201cWe had an international customer who said he wanted to get involved with Jake\u2019s in the Middle East. He was an international banker who stopped in our Connecticut store with his wife and five sons, and we said no. Over the next six months, he had gotten more aggressive, and at the time the U.S. economy was stalled.\"\n\nThe customer finally convinced Chemero, and has a deal for a location in Saudi Arabia, he says. It was good timing to start thinking internationally, as the U.S. was in the depths of the great recession in 2009. The Mid-East and North Africa proved to be a \u201chotbed\u201d for development, he says.\n\n\u201cWe met with every international franchisee in their country before we inked a deal. Our big concern was getting to know them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe found in the Middle East in particular, they like the history of the U.S. \u2013 the Wild West concept. That was one of the reasons we decided to go international, it\u2019s something new and exciting.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut that being said, American store development hasn\u2019t taken a backseat. Chemero says 22% of its franchisees in the U.S. have more than one store, and one ambitious franchisee is about to open his sixth store.\n\nDespite the doom and gloom in the small business community over the Affordable Care Act, Chemero says the morale among franchisees is positive. Under the ACA\u2019s employer mandate, every employer with at least 50 or more full-time workers has to offer coverage beginning in 2015. Employers that don\u2019t will face a fine of $2,000 per worker, per year (the first 30 full-time employees are exempt). Those with 50-to-99 workers are exempt until 2016, under a recent delay in the law.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that it doesn\u2019t really impact us, because franchisees with multiple stores still only have about 20 full-time employees,\u201d he says. \u201cOur biggest franchisee is right at the threshold of 50 full-time employees. It could impact future expansion for him, but unfortunately he will probably just roll the costs onto the consumer.\u201d\n\nThe corporate arm of Jake\u2019s has hit the 50 employee threshold, but Chemero says they are already offering health insurance to workers.\n\nAnd although they are a newer player in the fast-casual market, Chemero says Jake\u2019s is poised to take on bigger competitors like Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Applebee\u2019s and Chili\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe think we are well-positioned to take on the bigger guys in fast casual,\u201d he says. \u201cOur whole philosophy is that you can go fast by learning to grow slow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-09 10:49:38 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Jake\u2019s Wayback Burgers is taking its nostalgic American theme overseas, with deals in 30 different countries inked for the next year alone.
