Mira had hospital bills last year of $200,000. (Ellen M. Banner/Seattle TImes/TNS)\n\nBy jOnel aleccia tribune NEWS\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 When Melissa Mira suffered sudden heart failure at the end of her second pregnancy last year, she worried first about her health and her baby \u2014 then about the more than $200,000 in medical bills that began rolling in.\n\n\u201cYour world is just crashing down around you and you wonder: \u2018How is this going to be covered?\u2019 \u201d recalled Mira, 30, who spent more than a month away from her Tacoma home, hospitalized at the University of Washington Medical Center.\n\nFor Mira and her family, the answer came not through traditional health insurance, but through faith that fellow Christians would step forward to pay the bills.\n\nThe Miras \u2014 including daughter Jael, 4, and baby Sienna Rain, now a healthy 9-month-old \u2014 are among the growing numbers of people looking to \u201chealth care-sharing ministries\u201d across the U.S. At last count, there were more than 10,000 members in Washington state and nearly 400,000 nationwide \u2014 individuals and families whose medical costs are taken care of entirely through the organized goodwill, and monthly payments or \u201cshares,\u201d of like-minded religious followers.\n\nMira\u2019s husband, Gabriel Mira, 30, a general contractor, had long been a member of Christian Care Ministry\u2019s Medi-Share program of Melbourne, Fla., one of the three top health-care-sharing groups in the U.S. The others include Samaritan Ministries International of Peoria, Ill., and Christian Healthcare Ministries of Barberton, Ohio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to be in touch in a prayerful way with other people,\u201d said Melissa Mira, whose family belongs to Impact Church International, a nondenominational Christian church. Along with payments, the family received dozens of notes of support and encouragement from group members.\n\n\u201cMedi-Share has been a blessing for our family.\u201d\n\nSharing burdens\n\nHealth-care-cost-sharing groups, which date back decades, originated with the biblical notion of neighbors sharing burdens. They\u2019ve gained increased attention in the era of Obamacare because they\u2019re specifically exempt from provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which requires that most people buy health insurance or face fines. They\u2019re an unregulated option for those seeking philosophical or financial alternatives outside of traditional insurance.\n\n\u201cOur overall membership has doubled in the past three years,\u201d said James Lansberry, executive vice president of Samaritan Ministries. \u201cThere are two reasons why. In general, it\u2019s because health care has been such a huge part of the national conversation. And because of the individual mandate, there are previously uninsured people who\u2019ve chosen health-care sharing as an option.\u201d\n\nTo be admitted, group members must agree to regular church involvement and get a pastor\u2019s signoff. They also agree to adhere to certain health habits, such as avoiding tobacco, heavy drinking and illegal drugs. And they agree to the Golden Rule: Treat others as they\u2019d like to be treated, sending letters of encouragement or support along with required payments.\n\n\u201cSend a note, pay your share, always stay alert in prayer,\u201d is the motto for Samaritan. Christian Healthcare Ministries is guided by the biblical verse, Galatians 6:2, \u201cShare one another\u2019s burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ.\u201d\n\nMonthly savings\n\nMembers are technically considered self-pay patients; when they visit doctors or hospitals, they\u2019re classified as not having health insurance. Instead of paying insurance premiums, they pay voluntary \u201cshares\u201d of $300 to $400 a month per family, either directly to other members or to plan organizers who match the money with patient needs.\n\nFor Veronika and Michael Boos of Seattle, who own a small home-brewery-supply business and have three young children, joining Samaritan was more affordable than anything they found on the Washington state health-benefit exchange.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking $1,000 a month on the exchange, if you want decent coverage,\u201d said Veronika Boos, 31, who gave birth to their youngest child, Desmond, in February. The family belongs to Cross & Crown Church in Ballard, Wash.\n\nBecause the health-care-sharing plans don\u2019t cover routine care and some pre-existing conditions, the couple also enrolled in a local Qliance primary-care medical program to cover preventive care for themselves and the kids, including Leo, 3, and Lucy, 2. But even with that, their total monthly insurance bill is about $650.\n\n\u201cThis saves us at least a few hundred dollars a month and there\u2019s no out-of-pocket,\u201d Veronika Boos said.\n\nMeeting all needs\n\nThere are certain limits to sharing. If a Medi-Share member is injured in a car crash, for instance, the medical bills won\u2019t be shared if alcohol or illegal drugs were involved, if the accident was part of a competition or a \u201cstunt,\u201d if drivers aren\u2019t old enough or if the incident occurred during commission of a crime.\n\nOrganizers note, however, that each of the plans has programs like Prayer Page that allow members to request payment for bills that fall outside the rules. Often, fellow members cover those costs, too.\n\nIn fact, ministry organizers say nearly all needs are met. If there are more bills than payments, the groups may prorate reimbursements or ask members to make up the difference.\n\nSince 1993, for instance, Medi-Share has covered all eligible medical expenses, for a total of more than $725 million, said Tony Meggs, president and chief executive of Christian Care Ministry, which runs the program.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/life/3592081-120/care-health-sharing-members", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=qXFcN2csqIej5BKnS8aLv8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs4IjCNHRcDgM1CxZp1u_UqWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "title": "Cost-sharing ministries offer alternative to Obamacare"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "article_summary": "The others include Samaritan Ministries International of Peoria, Ill., and Christian Healthcare Ministries of Barberton, Ohio.\nIn general, it\u2019s because health care has been such a huge part of the national conversation.\nFor Mira and her family, the answer came not through traditional health insurance, but through faith that fellow Christians would step forward to pay the bills.\nThey\u2019ve gained increased attention in the era of Obamacare because they\u2019re specifically exempt from provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which requires that most people buy health insurance or face fines.\n\u201cOur overall membership has doubled in the past three years,\u201d said James Lansberry, executive vice president of Samaritan Ministries."}
