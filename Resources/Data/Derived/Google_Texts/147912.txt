Rocky Twyman, a local Washington, D.C., activist, is planning a protest at the Verizon Center Wednesday night, where Beyoncé is scheduled to perform. He wants her to use the event to encourage young adults to sign up for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, Politico reports.

“Superstar Beyoncé raised millions for President Obama during his 2012 campaign,” Twyman wrote in an email news release Wednesday, according to the Capitol Hill newspaper. “This Wednesday evening, representatives of the Pray at the Pump Movement (PAPM) and other concerned citizens will picket her concert urging her to use her enormous influence with youth to get them signed up before the December 23 deadline."

Twyman also said his group will bring application forms to the venue to pass out to Beyonce's "loyal youthful fans" as they wait in line.

He has previously organized "citizen pickets" urging Presdent Obama to be more like Tim Tebow and meet with Rush Limbaugh. He also has caught the attention of comedian Jay Leno, who once referred to him in a joke mocking President George W. Bush's energy plan.
