Almost immediately after the Rockies traded Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto in July, attention turned Trevor Story, Colorado’s prized prospect at shortstop.

But Story likely won’t see the big leagues this season.

Rockies manager Walt Weiss said chances are slim Story will play out the Triple-A season with Albuquerque and call it good.

“I don’t know if the door is completely shut on that one, but it’s probably a longshot,” Weiss said of Story’s chances for a call-up in 2015.

The Rockies drafted Story, 22, with the 45th pick in 2011. He jumped from Double-A New Britain to the Triple-A Isotopes on July 2.

In 54 games with Albuquerque before Tuesday, Story was hitting .269 with eight home runs. But he’s striking out too much — with 60 Ks in 227 at-bats. His plate prowess, though, shows. His 20 doubles rank second on the team for the season, tied with Cristhian Adames and 10 behind Matt McBride, both of whom are now on the Rockies roster.

“He’s had a very good year,” Weiss said of Story. “He’s a talented kid. But I’m not sure we’ll get a look at him this month.”

Story hit .281 with 10 home runs in 69 Double-A games this season. When he moved up a level in July, Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich said his eventual jump to the Rockies would take time.

“Nobody has a crystal ball here to know what the opportunity on the major-league level will eventually be,” Bridich said.
