It is possible that the giant balloons at the Macy’s Thanksgiving day Parade may not fly if the city experiences severe weather, New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a news conference Monday.

The National Weather Service predicts a northwest wind of 18 to 23 miles per hour on Thanksgiving day, with gusts as high as 37 miles per hour. This comes after very heavy rain and winds predicted for Tuesday night into Wednesday.

Mr. Kelly said the balloons can be made to fly at various heights, depending on the weather.

“They can be lowered all the way to the ground or a determination is made not to fly them,” Mr. Kelly said.

The NYPD has assigned a sergeant to each of the balloons during the parade, Mr. Kelly said.

“Unless there are reports of a major storm system, the decision would be made that day,” with officials at the city’s Office of Emergency Management, Mr. Kelly said.

Mr. Kelly said past incidents are reason to be cautious about the weather. In 2005, two people were injured when an M&M balloon struck a light pole in high winds and brought part of the fixture to the ground. And in 1997, a Cat in the Hat balloon brought down part of a lamppost, injuring four people.
