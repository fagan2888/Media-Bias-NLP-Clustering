Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nGood Thursday morning, the 352nd day of 2014 and the morning after President Barack Obama unofficially ended the last battle of the Cold War by normalizing relations with Cuba - which, according to the New York Times, was a move several months in the making, and one that featured all the elements of a John Le Carre novel: spies, secret Oval Office phone calls and clandestine, trilateral diplomatic meetings brokered by the Vatican. But as one international psychic battle ends, another rages on: it\u2019s the first day since Sony Pictures, reacting to vague threats of terrorism, canceled the Christmas Day release of a comedy lampooning North Korea, (a starving, highly-militarized country with no apparent sense of humor about the assassination of its leader), whom the U.S. now blames for hacking into Sony\u2019s computer servers. The cyberattack destabilized a major Hollywood studio, freaked out the entertainment industry and caused Obama to tell people to go to the movies. Get ready for this morning\u2019s Three Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:\n\nHold the Mojitos...: Now that President Barack Obama has normalized relations with Cuba, we can all make like Hemingway and head to Havana, visions of pristine beaches, primo rum and amazing cigars dancing in our heads, right? No tan rapido, says the Washington Post, in an article laying out the dos and do-not-dos for eager tourists and cigar aficionados.\n\n...For Now\u2026: In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Obama said he\u2019s not planning to visit his new bro Raul Castro any time soon \u2013 unless, of course, he\u2019s invited. \u201cI don\u2019t have any current plans, but let\u2019s see how things evolve,\u201d he said. If so, he might want to touch base with his buddy Jay Z to get some travel tips.\n\n[READ: Renewed Diplomacy Between U.S., Cuba Follows Enigmatic Relationship]\n\n\u2026 But the Jumbo Popcorn\u2019s a Rip-Off: In the same interview, the president said his administration is investigating the hacking of Sony Entertainment computers, and the vague threat of violence at theaters screening \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a satire set in North Korea that apparently has really irritated Kim Jong Un. For Americans concerned about those threats, the president said, \u201cmy recommendation would be to go to the movies.\u201d\n\nTweet This: The Twitterati was not happy with Sony Pictures giving in to the demands of the anonymous hackers to pull \u201cThe Interview\u201d from its planned Christmas Day release. One Tweet in particular caught our attention:\n\nReleased by United Artists, March 1941. pic.twitter.com/cXuLoxdivx \u2014 mark romanek (@markromanek) December 18, 2014\n\nSi Se Puede: Obama\u2019s approval ratings among Latinos has jumped 10 points since he made his move on immigration reform, according to a new NBC News-Wall Street Journal report. FIfty-seven percent say they like the job Obama\u2019s doing, compared with 47 percent who said so in September, before the immigration announcement.\n\nNext Up, Motorcycling Across the Gobi: First it was the climate change deal with China, then it was said executive action on immigration. Now, by normalizing relations with Cuba, Obama has checked off another item on his \u201c2008 campaign bucket list,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nNo Sympathy: Falling oil prices has ExxonMobil wringing its hands, Russia is in an economic meltdown and commodities traders are spooked like they\u2019ve seen the ghost of Mike Wallace on the trading floor. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, however, says cheap gas is like a big ol\u2019 tax cut for the American people: \"It's good for families, for households. It's putting more money in their pockets,\" she said.\n\n[OPINION: Sony, Aaron Sorkin Ask Media to Stop Publishing Leaked Data, Pundits React]\n\nPhotos: U.S., Cuban Relations Over the Years EXPAND GALLERY Photo Gallery x of x Full Screen Fidel Castro gained notoriety in the 1950s after taking a leading role in the Cuban Revolution, resulting in the ouster of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista.

Elizabeth Warren may have declared she\u2019s not currently running for president, but the progressive Democracy for America, founded by Howard Dean, announced it\u2019s joining forces with MoveOn.org to draft her. That could make for some awkward conversations around the turkey come Christmas in the Dean household: Howard Dean\u2019s brother, Jim Dean, is the chair of DFA, and Howard Dean recently penned an op-ed heartily endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. If she, you know, actually decides to run.\n\nStat of the Day: Estimated number of times SWAT teams were deployed in the U.S. in 1980: 3,000. In 2013 : 60,000.
