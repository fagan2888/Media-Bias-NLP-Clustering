Even though UW-Green Bay didn\u2019t begin offering classes until 1968, on Sept. 2, 1965, then-Gov. Warren Knowles signed a bill authorizing a four-year university. Prior to that, Green Bay offered a two-year center with a growing enrollment.\n\nThat day 50 years ago capped an effort to build a campus here that proved to be fortuitous for not only the university and those who attended and worked there, but for the Green Bay community as well.\n\nA four-year public university can have a positive impact on the surrounding community. Some examples include:\n\nWith its student body of about 7,000, it gives area high school students who want to go to college a nearby university. It also brings in students from outside the area, state, and nation, exposing students and people in the community a glimpse of the diversity they\u2019ll find in the world.\n\nIt becomes a major employer, providing jobs to educators, professionals, hourly staff and students.\n\nIt also benefits the community economically in at least three ways: It brings in a population that spends money in the area, it supplies area businesses talented and trained workers, and it partners with experts and companies to provide opportunities and support.\n\nFor example, the state\u2019s Small Business Development Center at UWGB supports small and mid-size companies that are looking to grow or just starting out.\n\nIt connects with the community, both young and older, through programs like Upward Bound and the Regional Center for Math and Science, which help get students from low-income and first-generation families; Camp Lloyd, a weeklong event for grieving children ages 7-14; continuing professional education programs; and the Environmental Management and Business Institute, to name just a few.\n\nIt also has forged ties with area educational institutions, like Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, St. Norbert College, and elementary and secondary schools.\n\nIt\u2019s through these programs and initiatives that UWGB has become part of the the fabric of the community.\n\nSome have said the university is overlooked \u2013 out of sight and out of mind given its location in the far northeastern corner of the city.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t lessened its impact throughout the area. The students, faculty and staff are part of the Green Bay area, whether its patronizing area businesses or volunteering during Make A Difference Day. Plus, many of them tend to stay. More than 70 percent of UWGB grads stay within a 50-mile radius of Green Bay, according to a 2008 Press-Gazette story.\n\nFor this academic year, the university saw its student enrollment increase, continuing small, steady growth. That\u2019s remarkable and says a lot about UWGB given the cutbacks in state funding over the last several years and the loss of talented faculty through buyouts.\n\nBeing part of the community is just as important for the university and its students, preventing them from becoming insulated from the world around them.\n\nIt\u2019s a partnership between the university and the community that benefits both. Here\u2019s to UW-Green Bay on its 50th birthday and here\u2019s to hoping for 50 more.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1UziVv4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "For a public institution, such as the UW-Green Bay, that milestone usually indicates that you\u2019ve become a part of the fabric of a community.", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "For a public institution, such as the UW-Green Bay, that milestone usually indicates that you\u2019ve become a part of the fabric of a community.", "title": "UW-Green Bay a vital part of our community", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/09/05/our-view-uwgb-turns-50/71714384/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For a public institution, such as the UW-Green Bay, that milestone usually indicates that you\u2019ve become a part of the fabric of a community.", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50cdfd094d0e37bc7a06e22d7d730c654b6f742e/c=213-0-1787-1574&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/04/WIGroup/GreenBay/635769763462835299-UWGB-TURNS-50.jpg", "title": "UW-Green Bay a vital part of our community", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Even though UW-Green Bay didn\u2019t begin offering classes until 1968, on Sept. 2, 1965, then-Gov.\nHere\u2019s to UW-Green Bay on its 50th birthday and here\u2019s to hoping for 50 more.\nIt means that for many who live in Northeastern Wisconsin, Green Bay has always had a four-year public university.\nBuy Photo Students walk across campus Wednesday at UW-Green Bay.\nPrior to that, Green Bay offered a two-year center with a growing enrollment."}
