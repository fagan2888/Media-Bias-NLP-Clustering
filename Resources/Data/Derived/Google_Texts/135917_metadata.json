And while there\u2019s been much attention on enrollment, there\u2019s been less discussion about a key question, affordability. The first month of the new enrollment season through has gone a lot more smoothly than last year. More than 2.5 million people have selected a plan through the federal exchange so far.\n\nBut what about premiums and out-of-pocket costs?\n\nMary Agnes Carey covers this for Kaiser Health News. I sat down with her the other day to discuss the latest.\n\nMary Agnes Carey, welcome back.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser Health News: Thanks for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So let\u2019s talk first about enrollment. We understand there has been a surge in interest just in the first month. What are you seeing?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: From November 15 to until December 10, which was the last set of reported figures, 2.5 million people have signed up for a health plan on healthcare.gov.\n\nAnd, by comparison, this is what happened in the first three months of last year, when you had all those Web site problems. We\u2019re not seeing those this year. But there seems to be real interest.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Can you \u2014 so is it just the fact that the Web site is up and working? Is there something else going on here?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, it\u2019s certainly more appealing to go to a Web site that actually works and sign in.\n\nBut we have had a year of information about the Affordable Care Act. Perhaps people that didn\u2019t get in a year ago are seeing people that are in the Affordable Care Act and getting insurance and decided to sign up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So what \u2014 and, just quickly, what is going \u2014 what is it that is smoother about the process? Is it the response? Is it \u2014 what is it? Is it the delay time?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: If you had already been in the exchanges, a lot of your information on your application was pre-filled in for you. That made it faster.\n\nThe whole experience of getting on, comparison shopping, signing in and getting a plan, for the most part, has been phenomenally smoother. So, I think it\u2019s just a smoother consumer experience. That has been their focus this year. They have talked about that quite a bit.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And people have now heard that message?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: They have heard that message. And they are going to continue to hear it because open enrollment doesn\u2019t end until February 15.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let\u2019s talk now about cost. This is a big piece of this puzzle.\n\nWhat are you finding out? Because in some places we\u2019re hearing premiums have gone up. In other places, they have gone down. What is Kaiser seeing there?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, what\u2019s really interesting is health insurance, like politics, is local. You have variance between states. You have variance within counties internally.\n\nThere are some places where premiums are going up by 10 percent or higher. There are other counties where they are dropping by 10 percent or lower, and so you really have to get on there and examine to see what you can find.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And what \u2014 and so how do you explain that? I mean, why \u2014 in the places where it\u2019s going up, where are they?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, for example, if you look at my colleagues Jordan Rau and Julie Appleby did a story looking at the effect of competition and what\u2019s happening around the country with these premiums.\n\nThey looked at some counties in Southern Indiana where the number of insurers went from one to four. It\u2019s an increase in competition. And so the premiums dropped by 25 percent. But then they also took a look at Chattanooga, which is already one of the least expensive areas in the country to get insurance. While the number of insurance companies doubled there, the premiums still went up by 16 percent.\n\nSo even competition sometimes doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019re going to get a lower price.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is there something in common, though, about the places where prices have gone up or have gone down? Can you find anything in common with these places?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: It could be \u2014 if prices are dropping, it could be more insurers got in. Some insurers held back in 2014 and they decided to wait to see what the marketplace was.\n\nFor a place where premiums are increased, it could be you have a monopoly insurer that has got a big piece of the market or an insurer that got in on 2014, looked at the claims experience, and think \u2014 they may have thought, I didn\u2019t price this right. I need to raise my premiums.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What about \u2014 Mary Agnes, what about rural vs. urban? Is that making a difference?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: It absolutely does.\n\nIn an urban area, you tend to have more competition. That tends to keep prices down. But in the rural areas, you tend to have fewer provide \u2014 fewer insurers, rather, and that can make prices go up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So is this \u2014 was there a way to predict that this was going to happen? Or is it just the vagaries of the marketplace?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: I think it\u2019s the vagaries of the marketplace.\n\nAnd you have to remember before the Affordable Care Act became law, you had all sorts of price variation in the individual market. You might have had premiums that went up 8 or 10 percent a year. So now you\u2019re looking at \u2014 for example, the Kaiser Family Foundation did a study where they looked at all the counties across the country.\n\nAnd for the benchmark silver plan, that\u2019s the second cheapest Silver plan, they have an average increase of 2 percent. So, again, that\u2019s a national number. But when you get down and look at counties, you could see a lot of variance.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And HHS, Department of Health and Human Services, put out a report saying the premiums are rising about 5 percent, but that has evened out, average across the country.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Right.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where these averages, they are interesting and they are important, but they don\u2019t tell the whole story. That is where people really have to shop around. This is a message you have heard from HHS officials. You will continue to hear it. If you are currently have coverage on the exchanges, you have got to get back in there and look, because, if there is more competition in your area, your prices may change.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And just a reminder, we\u2019re not just talking about premiums here, because there are other \u2014 it\u2019s deductibles, it\u2019s co-pays.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: You have got to look at all the money that is going to come out of your pocket to get health care. It\u2019s not just the premiums. And that\u2019s a really important message, because people sort of look at that premium \u2014 and it\u2019s understandable and they focus on it \u2014 but there are, as you say, a lot of things, your co-pays, your deductibles, your cost-sharing. It\u2019s the total package that you have got to think about.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Mary Agnes Carey, Kaiser Health News, we thank you.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 2.5 million people have selected a health care plan through the federal health exchange so far in the new enrollment season.
