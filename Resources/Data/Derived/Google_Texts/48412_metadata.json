The president\u2019s outreach team took to Facebook and Twitter to fight (and win) their election battle in 2012, and they\u2019ve returned to that turf this week, asking influential supporters to promote Obamacare using the hashtag #GetCovered.\n\nThe exchanges set up under the law \u2014 marketplaces where the uninsured or employers go to buy coverage \u2014 opened Tuesday, and it makes sense that Obama\u2019s people would promote them regardless of D.C.\u2019s infighting. But given that the Affordable Care Act is the rope in current budget tug-of-war, the social media blitz promoting the law takes on more importance. With conservatives railing against the law and 40 percebnt of Americans supporting its defunding, this is a chance for the administration to demonstrate that influential (or at least well-known) people are tugging on their side.\n\nReaching young people who might follow these celebrities is especially important to making the law work, as premiums from healthier young consumers are needed to help off-set the higher healthcare costs for older consumers.\n\nAccording to social media analytics site Brandwatch, there have been about 47,000 mentions of the hashtag on Twitter since yesterday. Here\u2019s a sample of tweets from people and organizations who have responded to Obama\u2019s call:\n\nF the shutdown. The Health Insurance Marketplace is now open in every state.
