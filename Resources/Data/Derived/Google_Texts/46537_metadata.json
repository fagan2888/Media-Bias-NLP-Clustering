A lack of stable housing exacerbates challenges for people who may also struggle with getting jobs, physical and mental healthcare, and other supports based on their criminal record. We look forward to seeing how providers change their standards to comply with this clarifying guidance.\u201d\n\nThe new guidance explains how current housing decisions may violate federal housing and civil rights laws. If a housing provider intentionally discriminates by treating people who have criminal records differently based on race or ethnicity, they are violating the Fair Housing Act. Second, restrictions based on criminal history may burden members of one race or ethnicity more than another, leading to liability due to discriminatory effects.\n\nThe new federal guidance is not binding but it does put providers on notice that continuing to screen applicants for criminal history may subject them to legal liability.\n\nComments (powered by FaceBook)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Dallas Voice", "description": "The new policy clarifies that using criminal history to justify a negative housing decision may violate the Fair Housing Act.", "title": "National LGBTQ Task Force praises HUD guidance targeting discrimination based on criminal history", "url": "http://www.dallasvoice.com/national-lgbtq-task-force-praises-hud-guidance-targeting-discrimination-based-criminal-history-10217163.html", "image": "http://www.dallasvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/HUD.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004508915842, "app_id": 780617392052602}, "generator": "WordPress 3.5.2", "description": "The new policy clarifies that using criminal history to justify a negative housing decision may violate the Fair Housing Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development today (Monday, April 4) released a new policy that would eliminate housing discrimination against people with a criminal history.\nSecond, restrictions based on criminal history may burden members of one race or ethnicity more than another, leading to liability due to discriminatory effects.\nNearly a third of the adult population has a criminal record, including millions of LGBT people, Maury said.\nThe new federal guidance is not binding but it does put providers on notice that continuing to screen applicants for criminal history may subject them to legal liability.\nMeghan Maury, criminal and economic justice project director at National LGBTQ Task Force, said in a statement that\u2019s good news for LGBT people."}
