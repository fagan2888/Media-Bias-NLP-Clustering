The thing is, Wakefield's study has since been retracted, and when people first caught wind of 'Vaxxed,' they accused De Niro of spreading misinformation. He released a statement yesterday to defend himself, saying he was \"not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.\"\n\nWhat changed?\n\n\u201cMy intent in screening this film was to provide an opportunity for conversation around an issue that is deeply personal to me and my family,\u201d said De Niro, who co-founded the festival, according to the New York Daily News . \u201cBut after reviewing it over the past few days with the Tribeca Film Festival team and others from the scientific community, we do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion I had hoped for.\u201d\n\nDe Niro denied the backlash factored into his decision. Wakefield and other anti-vaxxers disagree.\n\n\u201cWe have just witnessed yet another example of the power of corporate interests censoring free speech, art, and truth. Tribeca\u2019s action will not succeed in denying the world access to the truth behind the film \u2018Vaxxed,'\u201d Wakefield said in his own statement on the film\u2019s website.\n\nOthers, however, congratulated De Niro on his decision to pull the film, including some doctors who believed the documentary was based on discredited science. If he went ahead and showed the film, health care providers believe it would possibly persuade parents to forgo vaccines for their children, which the most recent research concludes is not a risk factor for autism.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "robert, de, niro, pulls, controversial, documentary, vaxxed, tribeca, film, festival", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Anti-vaxxers accuse the actor of censorship after he decides to pull Tribeca Film selection.", "title": "Robert De Niro Decides Not To Show Anti-Vaccine Documentary", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/robert-de-niro-anti-vaxxers-tribeca-film-festival-censorship-379653", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/03/27/robert-de-niro.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anti-vaxxers accuse the actor of censorship after he decides to pull Tribeca Film selection.", "title": "Robert De Niro Decides Not To Show Anti-Vaccine Documentary", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/robert-de-niro-anti-vaxxers-tribeca-film-festival-censorship-379653", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2016/03/27/robert-de-niro.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/27/robert-de-niro.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-27T19:30:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-27T20:25:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Anti-vaxxers accuse the actor of censorship after he decides to pull Tribeca Film selection."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2db0\"", "article_summary": "Tribeca\u2019s action will not succeed in denying the world access to the truth behind the film \u2018Vaxxed,'\u201d Wakefield said in his own statement on the film\u2019s website.\nOthers, however, congratulated De Niro on his decision to pull the film, including some doctors who believed the documentary was based on discredited science.\nThe thing is, Wakefield's study has since been retracted, and when people first caught wind of 'Vaxxed,' they accused De Niro of spreading misinformation.\n\u201cBut after reviewing it over the past few days with the Tribeca Film Festival team and others from the scientific community, we do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion I had hoped for.\u201dDe Niro denied the backlash factored into his decision.\n\u201cWe have just witnessed yet another example of the power of corporate interests censoring free speech, art, and truth."}
