Yet, today Chick Fil A has captured the largest share of the fast-food chicken market, even beating out KFC. Analysts say that it is because of the taste and quality of the food and strategic business practices. But could there be more to it? Could their success be for the same reason that Duck Dynasty has become so wildly popular with the American public?\n\nIn 1999, KFC was the top rooster in the barnyard, with a whopping 40 percent of the market share, according to Business Insider. Chick Fil A was Chicken Little, with a mere 9 percent. Yet, in a new report released by Janney Capital Markets on July 15, Mark Kalinowski warns Wall Street that they had better pay attention to fast-growing Chick Fil A, cautioning that the chain even poses \u201ca growing long-term threat\u201d to fast food giant McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThis phenomenal growth has resulted in a reversal of roles for KFC and Chick Fil A. KFC only claims 22 percent of the fast-food fowl market, while Chick Fil A has captured the top spot, with 26 percent. The remarkable thing is that this happened while KFC boasts about 4,500 stores, which grossed $4.2 billion in 2013, while Chick Fil A grossed over $5 billion, with just 1,775 restaurants, less than half as many as the former top chicken. The market share for KFC has declined in direct inverse relationship to Chick Fil A\u2019s growth.\n\nPhilly.com advises McDonald\u2019s to \u201cFear the Bird,\u201d in its headline. Though McDonald\u2019s is still the industry giant with $36 billion in sales last year, Chick Fil A is rapidly climbing the ranks. Sales for the Atlanta-based company have tripled in the last 14 years.\n\nIt was two years ago this summer that Chick Fil A\u2019s CEO Dan Cathy was at the center of a furious culture war over same sex versus traditional marriage, by making comments that he supports the \u201cbiblical definition of the family unit.\u201d Cathy\u2019s statement quickly plunged the Chick Fil A corporation into the heart of a passionate, vitriolic debate. The company was boycotted by the LGBT community as well as same-sex marriage supporters.\n\nShortly after the boycott was instituted, former Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee joined the fray. The Inquisitr reported that Huckabee called for a nationwide Chick Fil A Appreciation Day on August 1, 2012. That day saw record sales, with people lined up for hours for their chicken sandwich and waffle fries.\n\nBloomberg posted an article that was a \u201creminder that boycotts often backfire.\u201d And backfire it did. Chick Fil A\u2019s sales have steadily increased, despite dire predictions that the old-fashioned comments would doom the chicken chain.\n\nIt would have been hard for patrons of Chick Fil A to miss the fact over the years that the restaurant was owned by people with traditional values. None of the chain\u2019s 1,775 locations have ever opened on Sundays, and the reason is clearly posted on every Chick Fil A door \u2013 they are closed to allow their employees the opportunity to worship with their families if they wish.\n\nNonetheless, analysts and experts are increasingly befuddled at the success of businesses, such as Chick Fil A, as well as films, whose leadership unashamedly endorse conservative messages. Movies with traditional values-based messages, such as Grace Unplugged, Moms\u2019 Night Out, or Heaven Is For Real are \u201csurprise hits\u201d that Hollywood critics cannot seem to wrap their brains around.\n\nCould the key to their success be the Duck Dynasty effect \u2013 that commitment to stand for traditional values, like prayer or the traditional family, no matter what society pressures them to do? It is those values that, still, the majority of Americans support, or at least they support the right of people to hold those values. In a time when society at large seems to be tolerant of everything except traditional values, those who espouse conservative views are often demonized by the politically correct. Yet, they are an inspiration to millions to have the courage to stand in the face of opposition.\n\nWhether one agrees with the perspective or not, it is the intolerance of the perspective that causes many who have remained out of the fracas to stand up and say, \u201cenough.\u201d It was not so much that everyone agreed with Phil Robertson or Dan Cathy; it was that many people have grown weary of the intolerance of the crowd that preaches \u201ctolerance,\u201d where only the views that agree with theirs are acceptable. And they have turned out in droves to support Chick Fil A and Duck Dynasty, even combining the two on Chick Phil A Day on February 21.\n\nMuch of the popularity of Duck Dynasty has been attributed to the Robertson\u2019s determination to stand up for their beliefs, in a world where those beliefs are under near-constant assault. Could it be that the incredible success of Chick Fil A is related to the determination of their leadership to stand up for conservative values, even if it means being politically incorrect?\n\n[images via Chick Fil A, GatewayPundit, and MovieGuide]", "article_metadata": {"description": "It wasn't too long ago that there were boycotts and threats of shutting down the popular chicken chain Chick Fil A over the conservative views of its CEO.
