It blurs the lines between who is the mentor and who is the mentee.\u201d\n\nEmily Wilensky, 31, the marketing director of food manufacturer Tasty Brands in Syosset, credits her relationship with her mentor, Andrew Signorelli, 57, the company\u2019s vice president of operations, with making her more adept at interpersonal communications on the job.\n\n\u201cI am more confident in myself and in my skills,\u201d said Wilensky, a Farmingdale resident and Syracuse University graduate. \u201cWhen I am on the phone, it doesn\u2019t matter who it is. I am more assertive.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Signorelli seeks Wilensky\u2019s help on issues such as a greater use of social media to help promote the company\u2019s name in public. \u201cShe is making me aware of some of the more modern vehicles of marketing,\u201d he said.\n\nMillennials 1 in 3 workers\n\nMillennials are the dominant generation in the workplace, surpassing Gen Xers (ages 36 to 51) and baby boomers (ages 52 to 70), according to a Pew Research Center study last year. Millennials now account for more than one in three American workers.\n\nFederal data show that 20- to 34-year-olds \u2014 the closest Census category to the millennial age range \u2014 make up 18 percent of Long Island\u2019s population. Local workforce numbers for millennials are unavailable.\n\nExperts contend that millennials, the first generation weaned on the constant back-and-forth of social media technology, are eager for feedback and actively seek mentors. So unlike baby boomers, who are more likely to have one or two mentors over their working life, younger workers often have had several early on in their careers, in part reflecting how often they change jobs.\n\n\u201cMillennials often have more than one mentor,\u201d Lenaghan said. \u201cThey use social media to reach out and establish their own mentoring relationships.\u201d\n\nMentoring pays off for both employers and employees, research shows.\n\nA Harvard Business Review article last year noted that mentoring programs enabled junior to midlevel professionals to advance more quickly and to earn higher salaries and experience more job satisfaction than people who weren\u2019t mentored.\n\nBetty Heiman, 50, chief executive and founder of the health-benefits company Transparent Healthcare in Plainview, credits her mentor, who was also an early investor in her 6-year-old company, with helping her to sharpen her company\u2019s mission and broaden its market.\n\nHer vision was to establish a network that offered health benefits for individuals who remained uninsured even after the federal Affordable Care Act took effect. But to her mentor, her business model suggested \u201csocial entrepreneurship\u201d and should be extended to include underinsured individuals as well.\n\n\u201cIt allowed the company to continue to broaden its scope and broaden its purpose, so that is part of the enormous success that we have been having,\u201d Heiman said.\n\nHigher pay found\n\nAnd mentoring helps companies hold onto valuable employees.\n\n\u201cMentoring is a critical retention tool,\u201d said Anna Beninger, director of research at Manhattan women\u2019s research and advocacy group Catalyst.\n\nMentoring has helped 26-year-old Douglas Henningsen envision a bright future at Racanelli Construction Co. in Melville. The East Northport resident, who started working at Racanelli soon after he graduated in 2011 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in construction management from SUNY Delhi, is an assistant project manager and hopes to be promoted to project manager \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nMentoring by vice president Martin Racanelli Jr. and his three brothers has given him key managerial experience, Henningsen said. That mentoring includes the meetings the Racanellis hold with project managers and their assistants every two weeks.\n\n\u201cLeadership and management of the subcontractors coupled with professionalism and respect toward clients\u201d are among the skills Henningsen said he\u2019s gained. He said he\u2019s also learned \u201chow to make decisions and execute them on time.\u201d\n\nHe, in turn, has shared with Racanelli and others in the company his know-how of advanced project-management, scheduling and cost-estimating software. \u201cI grew up with this,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand how it works.\u201d\n\nRacanelli, a third-generation executive at the company, said millennials\u2019 technology skills are an asset to his firm.\n\n\u201cThey have the smarts,\u201d said Racanelli, 47, adding that his role as mentor is to help them bridge the gap between those skills and real-world experience.\n\nMentors say the flip side of millennials\u2019 fluency with technology is that they are sometimes less skilled in face-to-face interactions.\n\nMillennials sometimes overlook the importance of in-person conversations in business because they are so accustomed to texting or emailing, Signorelli of Tasty Brands said.\n\n\u201cLive interpersonal communication, and the skills involved in doing that effectively, seem to be lacking,\u201d he said.\n\nLean, diverse workplaces\n\nSome experts contend that mentoring is more important than ever in this age of lean workplaces that are increasingly diverse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so critical that organizations embrace continuous learning,\u201d Lenaghan of Hofstra said.\n\nAs companies become more diverse, however, their mentoring efforts can trip over the problem of exclusion, especially regarding people of color, one expert said.\n\nThe most effective mentoring programs are the informal, or self-selective ones, said Michele Williams, assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University. But those can be exclusionary if people at the top of the organization tend to help younger workers \u201cwho look like [them],\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t excluding ethnic minorities from the networks, as much as they are helping people who are similar,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s the helping people who are similar that maintains the mentoring disparities.\u201d\n\nCompanies have tried to tackle the tendency to exclude workers of color through formal mentoring programs that make inclusion a key priority, she said.\n\nThat inclusive approach also needs to extend to older mentors recognizing and valuing what young people bring to the table, millennials said.\n\nMichelle Blum, 27, the founder and owner of Nutrish Mish Inc., a nutrition consulting company with five locations on Long Island, credits her current mentor with helping her to sharpen her 4-year-old company\u2019s mission, even while approaching her as a peer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saving lives, and I want to be a part of that,\u201d she said her mentor, Eric Scher, who designs websites, told her.\n\nAnd now Scher is not only a mentor but an investor whom she meets with once a month and speaks to daily.\n\nBlum said she values his advice as well as his democratic approach.\n\n\u201cHe always listened to my ideas,\u201d said Blum, a Farmingdale resident and Hofstra University graduate. \u201cHe kind of helped guide me rather than tell me what to do. Had he come at me in a different way, it might not have been a great relationship.\u201d\n\nOf millennials, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we think we know better, and I think a lot of times we get misconstrued that way,\u201d Blum said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we have a different approach.\u201d\n\n\u00a92016 Newsday Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Experts contend that millennials, the first generation weaned on the constant back-and-forth of social media technology, are eager for feedback and actively seek symbiotic relationships with mentors.", "pubDate": "2016-03-7", "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Digital Communities Articles", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "These young people, ages 19 to 35, are embracing this workplace rite more than previous generations because they seek out feedback, workplace experts said.\n\u201cI understand how it works.\u201dRacanelli, a third-generation executive at the company, said millennials\u2019 technology skills are an asset to his firm.\nExperts contend that millennials, the first generation weaned on the constant back-and-forth of social media technology, are eager for feedback and actively seek mentors.\nRather than the typical top-down approach, in which senior employees impart knowledge to their juniors, millennials prefer give and take.\nMentors say the flip side of millennials\u2019 fluency with technology is that they are sometimes less skilled in face-to-face interactions."}
