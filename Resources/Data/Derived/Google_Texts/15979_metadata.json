The letter was obtained by Bloomberg through an open records request.\n\nUnitedHealth's exits from the state Obamacare markets threatens to limit the number of options for consumers when they shop for coverage for next year. In addition to Kentucky, Iowa's insurance regulator said Monday that the company is quitting the state's individual market and small-business exchange for 2017. In both states, UnitedHealth will continue to offer small- business plans off the exchange.\n\n\"UnitedHealthcare's intent to withdraw from the market was not unexpected,\" Doug Hogan, a spokesman for the Kentucky Public Protection Cabinet, which oversees the state's insurance regulator, said in an e-mail. \"Insurers across the country have been losing hundreds of millions of dollars in the Obamacare exchanges and can no longer sustain such heavy financial losses.\"\n\nStephen Hemsley, UnitedHealth's CEO, said last week that the company would only offer ACA plans in a \"handful of states\" for 2017, though the company hasn't listed them. The company is retreating from the new markets created by the ACA amid mounting losses on the policies. Bloomberg has confirmed that the insurer is exiting at least 26 of the 34 states where it sold 2016 coverage.\n\nThe company will still probably sell ACA plans in at least three states next year: New York and Nevada have confirmed that UnitedHealth plans to remain on their ACA exchanges next year. The company has also filed plans to participate in Virginia for 2017", "article_metadata": {"description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. will pull out of Kentucky's individual marketplace for Obamacare plans, bringing to 26 the number of states the health insurer is quitting next year.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "title": "UnitedHealth quits more Obamacare markets, exiting Kentucky", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/business/unitedhealth-quits-more-obamacare-markets-exiting-kentucky-1.1552896", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. will pull out of Kentucky's individual marketplace for Obamacare plans, bringing to 26 the number of states the health insurer is quitting next year."}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "DC.creator": "Bloomberg News", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "UnitedHealth quits more Obamacare markets, exiting Kentucky"}, "article_summary": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. will pull out of Kentucky's individual marketplace for Obamacare plans, bringing to 26 the number of states the health insurer is quitting next year.\nIn both states, UnitedHealth will continue to offer small- business plans off the exchange.\nIn addition to Kentucky, Iowa's insurance regulator said Monday that the company is quitting the state's individual market and small-business exchange for 2017.\nThe company will still probably sell ACA plans in at least three states next year: New York and Nevada have confirmed that UnitedHealth plans to remain on their ACA exchanges next year.\nThe company plans to halt sales of individual plans in Kentucky for 2017, both inside and outside the state's Affordable Care Act exchange, as well as the small-business exchange, UnitedHealth said in a letter to the state's insurance department."}
