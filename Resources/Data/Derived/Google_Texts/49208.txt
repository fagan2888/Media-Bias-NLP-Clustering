The announced improvements include simplifying re-enrollment in current Obamacare plans, encouraging enrollment in plans that are best financially suited to a given person, and reducing the number of cases of people failing to provide information about their Social Security numbers or other data required to prove eligibility.

Those changes may help the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov enroll more uninsured people for next year, and retain them as customers throughout the year.

"As of today, we're 10 days from the start of open enrollment," said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which operates HealthCare.gov. "I can say with certainty that we're not the only people anticipating November 1."

"In fact, we're already beginning to see interest increase. This past week, incoming calls at our call center increased by about 25 percent and we've seen an uptick in traffic of around 10 percent," Slavitt said. "Americans realize that open enrollment is around the corner, and we're ready to welcome them back to HealthCare.gov."
