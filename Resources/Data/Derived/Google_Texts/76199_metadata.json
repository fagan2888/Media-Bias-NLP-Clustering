You do it by sending a poorly written letter to Iran. Really. That wasn\u2019t a joke,\u201d he said, according to a pool report of the event.\n\nObama was referring to his use of a selfie stick during a recent appearance in a video for BuzzFeed to promote the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives claim that Obama has diminished the presidency by appearing in the BuzzFeed video, being interviewed by YouTube stars and going on late-night talk shows.\n\nObama has also said that he was \"embarrassed\" for the Republicans who sent the letter to Iran. Vice President Joe Biden has said that the letter was \"beneath the dignity\" of the United States Senate.\n\nRepublicans have defended the letter, saying that they had to speak out because Obama didn't consult them.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that he would not apologize to Iran for the GOP's actions. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who orchestrated sending the letter, said that he had \"no regrets.\"\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obama With Celebrities Obama With Celebrities\n\n1 of 13 George Clooney & President Obama Actor George Clooney leaves after he spoke to the media March 15, 2012 at the White House in Washington, DC.
