That leaves Pasco as the third-largest jurisdiction in the state (behind Duval and Polk counties) with no protections for unmarried couples.\n\n\u201cI can tell you every city and county in Florida is on our radar,\u201d said Ed Lally, central Florida coordinator. \u201cWe\u2019ve tackled the major metropolitan areas, but we\u2019ve had good success in some rural areas as well. I don\u2019t know if there is a game plan in the near future to bring it up in Pasco. That\u2019s still a pretty conservative area.\u201d\n\nCounty commissioners who spoke with the Tribune didn\u2019t say they oppose the idea of a registry, which provides legal protections in matters such as hospital visitation, end-of-life decisions, and custodial arrangements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been discussed,\u201d Commissioner Ted Schrader said. \u201cNo one has ever approached me about it.\u201d\n\nSchrader said domestic partner registries have never been a pressing matter in Pasco. In fact, he knows so little about them he didn\u2019t realize they protect heterosexual and same-sex couples. He also was surprised that business leaders in Tampa support the policies. \u201cI\u2019m certainly willing to sit down and listen if people want to raise the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nSchrader said he plans to reach out to Hillsborough Commissioner Mark Sharpe, a longtime supporter of the policy, for more details. \u201cI have a lot of respect for him. We\u2019ve served together for a number of years on Tampa Bay Water and TBARTA. I\u2019d like to hear what he has to say about it,\u201d he said.\n\nCommissioner Kathryn Starkey offered a mild endorsement. \u201cI\u2019m OK with that,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it works or who does it. If you\u2019re living with someone, you should be able to visit them in the hospital. I just wonder is that a role county government should play \u2014 to be purveyor of a list? I don\u2019t understand why the hospitals just can\u2019t maintain their own list. But loved ones should be able to visit and care for each other.\u201d\n\nIn Pinellas County, the Clerk of Court maintains the registry, which is available online to any hospital. Couples must apply in person and pay $50 to register.\n\nErika Remsberg, a Democrat running to replace retiring Commissioner Pat Mulieri, is the only commission candidate with an opinion on the matter. \u201cI abhor discrimination in any form at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI support it, and it\u2019s nonnegotiable for me. A domestic partner registry is one of the things the county can do to remove barriers for people, and I think it\u2019s a good first step.\u201d\n\nRemsberg, a social worker, said she also supports efforts to overturn the ban on same-sex marriage. She shared a story about a lesbian couple who took in four foster children whose married parents were drug addicts. At the time, state law prohibited gays from adopting children. It has since been overturned.\n\n\u201cFamilies look different and don\u2019t come in a one-size-fits-all appearance anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to understand that there are legal ramifications for people based on how they live as a family.\u201d\n\nMike Moore, the Republican candidate for District 2, said he wanted to research the issue before forming an opinion. He said he wanted to watch the video of the Hillsborough meeting to better understand why four Republican commissioners who defeated the proposal in 2013 switched their votes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find that when I take office, my decisions will be very thoughtful and deliberate,\u201d he said.\n\nCommissioner-elect Mike Wells Jr. said he\u2019s never been asked about domestic registries. \u201cWow, that\u2019s a tough one,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what my personal beliefs are, it comes down to what\u2019s best for the residents of Pasco County. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of people over the years who are in same-sex couples.\u201d\n\nlkinsler@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1852\n\nTwitter @LKinslerTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 21 Sep 2014 13:23:38 -0400", "Description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 It\u2019s a vote that may have seemed impossible a decade ago, but last Wednesday Hillsborough commissioners unanimously agreed to follow the city of Tampa and Pinellas Cou", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 It\u2019s a vote that may have seemed impossible a decade ago, but last Wednesday Hillsborough commissioners unanimously agreed to follow the city of Tampa and Pinellas Cou", "title": "Domestic partner registry for Pasco?", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/domestic-partner-registry-for-pasco-20140921/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-09-21T13:23:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Domestic partner registry for Pasco?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-21T13:23:38Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-21T13:23:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d01\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNo one has ever approached me about it.\u201dSchrader said domestic partner registries have never been a pressing matter in Pasco.\n\u201cNo matter what my personal beliefs are, it comes down to what\u2019s best for the residents of Pasco County.\nCommissioner-elect Mike Wells Jr. said he\u2019s never been asked about domestic registries.\n\u2014 It\u2019s a vote that may have seemed impossible a decade ago, but last Wednesday Hillsborough commissioners unanimously agreed to follow the city of Tampa and Pinellas County by setting up a domestic partner registry.\nI don\u2019t know if there is a game plan in the near future to bring it up in Pasco."}
