Pre-IPO, Houlihan Lokey Expands in Europe

Under CEO Scott Beiser, Houlihan has acquired Bridge Strategy, ArchPoint Partners, and now, McQueen

As investment bank Houlihan Lokey pursues an initial public offering, the firm is set to broaden its consumer, food and retail presence in Europe by buying McQueen Ltd.

McQueen, headquartered in London, is an advisory group for consumer businesses. The targets clients include Heinz, Thai Union, V. Mane Fils, Morrisons, ABT, Paddy Power and Unibet. Houlihan is adding the McQueen team to its consumer, food and retail practice. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Houlihan provides M&A, restructuring, consulting and other corporate finance services.

The transaction comes about a week after Los Angeles-based Houlihan filed paperwork to go public with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Before that, the firm made several acquisitions  expanding in strategic consulting through the purchase of Bridge Strategy Group in January, and in technology with a deal for ArchPoint Partners in 2014.

Houlihan and McQueen acted as their own advisers on the deal. Pinsent Masons LLP was Houlihan's legal counsel, and Travers Smith provided legal advice to McQueen.
