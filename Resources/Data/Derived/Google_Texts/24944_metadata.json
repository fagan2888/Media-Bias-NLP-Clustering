There was a lull around Oct. 1, as strategists gauged how sign-ups would go. Now, there is a pounding, with AFP \u2013 which has started branding itself \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest grassroots champion for health care freedom\u201d \u2013 this week announcing \u201ca multimillion dollar ad effort holding three US senators [who are up in Nov.] accountable for their support of the President\u2019s health care law\u201d \u2013 Sen. Kay Hagen (D-N.H.), Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.)\n\nDeep pockets are behind these campaigns, with much more to come, according to strategists working closely with the Koch network. Freedom Partners, an Arlington-based group founded by Koch allies in late 2011 that serves one of the largest financial funnels in American politics, spent $250 million last year. In September, when Jim VandeHei and I disclosed the existence of this organization in our \u201cBehind the Curtain\u201d column, we called it the \u201c Rosetta Stone of the vast web of conservative groups \u2014 some prominent, some obscure \u2014 that spend time, money and resources to influence public debate, especially over Obamacare.\u201d That was even more true than we knew at the time.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nExpenditures by Koch-aligned groups in the fight against Obamacare, from July through this week, total more than $25 million. AFP spent $23 million, Generation Opportunity spent a little over $1 million and the LIBRE Initiative spent just over $1 million. The groups\u2019 activities include TV, radio, print, digital and mobile ads (in English and Spanish); grassroots efforts; and direct mail. One of the strategists tells us: \u201cThis is huge push behind a single issue -- and it\u2019s all happening very early, which is pressuring cash-strapped candidates and committees to make hard decisions about how they spend their dollars.\u201d\n\n--PDF of Freedom Partners\u2019 43-page IRS 990 form, outlining financials http://goo.gl/pksvOd\n\nBULLETIN -- @JeffZeleny: \u201cFormer First Lady Barbara Bush is being released from Houston Methodist Hospital today, family spokesman tells @ABC.\u201d\n\nAP FOR SUNDAY PAPERS \u2013 \u201cOutside money can be key factor in 2014 elections,\u201d by Philip Elliott: \u201cTerry McAuliffe's successful campaign for governor in Virginia might provide a playbook for fellow Democrats in 2014 -- and a warning for Republicans. \u2026 Nominally independent committees, political action groups, environmentalists and unions poured almost $14 million into McAuliffe's campaign. \u2026 In the final month before the November election, allies aired \u2026 $3 million in television ads to help McAuliffe maintain his lead, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project \u2026 Outside spending will play a pivotal, if not deciding, role [in 2014].

Times 2-col. lead, \u201cIntelligence system may be reformed: Obama could put a public advocate on the secret surveillance court and shift control of telephone data,\u201d by Christi Parsons: \u201cPresident Obama is preparing a package of intelligence reforms that will probably put a public advocate for the first time in the secret court that approves surveillance practices and remove a controversial telephone records database from direct government control, aides said. With plans to unveil the changes days before the State of the Union address on Jan. 28, key presidential advisors are looking skeptically at a separate proposal to require a federal judge to approve each use of a \u2018national security letter\u2019 \u2026 Some civil liberties experts who have been consulted by the White House are hoping Obama will make more sweeping changes than those his aides have disclosed so far.\u201d http://goo.gl/nGZVqC\n\nTHE JUICE \u2013 D.C. power players \u2013 \u201cThe Obamacare fixer,\u201d by Carrie Budoff Brown and Jonathan Allen: \u201cPhil Schiliro\u2019s work on Obamacare has come full circle. As President Obama\u2019s legislative director, Schiliro helped get the Affordable Care Act through Congress. Now, he\u2019s back as the fixer. \u2026 Shortly after his unexpected return last month, Schiliro met with more than a dozen Democratic senators to convince them the White House gets it. His message: \u2026 I understand your frustration, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here \u2014 to streamline coordination with the Hill, fix problems, deal with issues before they blow up. He told the senators to reach out whenever they needed him, \u2026 on his mobile phone, at home, by email \u2026\n\n\u201cSchiliro, 57, is particularly adept at creating new strategies on the fly. As a former longtime aide to Rep. Henry Waxman, he knows the policy and understands the mind-set of members of Congress. He grew up in a big Italian family on Long Island, where his professors at Hofstra University recall a student who came up with offbeat answers to questions. \u2026 Obama \u2026 nicknamed him \u2018third-way Phil.\u2019 \u2026 Since the White House announced his return Dec. 6, Schiliro has quickly become the public face of Obamacare. He mingled with lawmakers at the White House holiday parties. He called congressional leadership staff to the White House for a meeting, and sat down separately with senators and House leaders.\u201d http://goo.gl/zascY1\n\n--WSJ A1, \u201cHealth Site Failures Spur Push to Ease Tech Hiring,\u201d by Gautham Nagesh: \u201cThe Obama administration \u2026 is considering loosening hiring rules for technology specialists and creating a new federal unit dedicated to big tech projects \u2026 The steps, some of which President Obama could announce this quarter, are designed to address the lack of concentrated talent in civilian federal agencies to manage large technology projects\u2014a shortcoming exposed by October's disastrous launch of the federal health-insurance site.\u201d http://goo.gl/xtulrQ\n\nTHE OBAMAS LEAVE OHAHU this evening, landing in D.C. tomorrow morning.\n\nWHAT THE WEST WING IS READING \u2013 \u201cObama eyes modest momentum on Capitol Hill in 2014,\u201d by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace in Honolulu: \u201cThe health care questions aside, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House enters the new year buoyed by the \u2018modest amount of legislative momentum\u2019 generated by the December budget deal. \u2018We're hopeful Congress can build on it and make progress on other priorities where common ground exists,\u2019 Earnest said. It won't take long to test that proposition, with debates on unemployment insurance, budget spending and the government's borrowing limit expected in quick succession in the opening weeks of the year.\u201d http://goo.gl/yxB9op\n\n--\u201cObama Seeks Tighter Mental Health Restrictions on Guns,\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s Margaret Talev: \u201cThe White House said \u2026 the Justice and Health and Human Services Departments were proposing changes in regulations to clarify who under U.S. law is prohibited from possessing a firearm for mental health reasons.

Her plan to leave \u2026 has not been \u2026 reported \u2026 As Braunstein prepares to leave, \u2026 concerns are mounting among consumer advocates that the Fed may pick a financial industry ally who may want to weaken consumer protections.\n\n\u201cDiversified Search, an executive search firm retained by the Fed, has asked financial industry lobbyists for recommendations on who should replace Braunstein \u2026 Consumer advocates said they, too, have been asked \u2026 to recommend \u2026 replacements. \u2026 Braunstein helped the Fed develop stronger rules to protect consumers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But during the early years of her tenure, the Fed declined to use its vast powers to curb predatory or abusive lending, something that \u2026 Sheila Bair, the former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman, has described as the \u2018one bullet\u2019 that could have prevented the crisis.\u201d http://goo.gl/ucESqT\n\n**A message from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: U.S. Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue will outline the U.S. Chamber\u2019s plan to generate stronger economic growth, create jobs, and expand opportunity for all Americans in his annual State of American Business address on Wednesday.

The number of female high school players is declining statewide, dropping about 2 percent over the past six years \u2026 [S]ome have had to trim the number of teams they field.
