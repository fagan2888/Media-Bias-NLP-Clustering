Riff, Melinda Harper, Chuck Holum, Rebecca Lynn, Sharon Montes, Marc Ringel, Dan Tuteur, Lindy Wallace and Jack Westfall.\n\nColorado HealthOP was one of many state-operated cooperatives started nationwide to spur competitive pricing in marketplaces under President Barak Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. However, low rates forced many into insolvency, including Colorado, which left more than 80,000 people needing a new insurance provider for 2016 when the federal government shut them down. The email to former CO-OP members said in part: \u201cWe write, as former board members and staff of the late Colorado HealthOP, to state our strong support for the ColoradoCare \u2026 and ask that you also support this issue.\u201d The email said the initiative was \u201cuniversal health care\u201d that would \u201celiminate premiums, eliminate deductibles, and eliminate co-pays for primary and preventative care.\u201d Vincent Plymell, the communications manager for the Division of Insurance, said folks in his office were very concerned when they learned of the email. \u201cIt was such a concern to us, that we worked with our attorney in the Attorneys General office to issue a cease and desist letter to this group,\u201d Plymell said. \u201cThe (order) told this group it had to stop these activities and stop representing themselves as this was something coming from the health op.\u201d\n\nScott Rankin, president of Free Market Healthcare Advocates, said he and several others received the email on February 29. Because all them were former HealthOP clients, he believed the email could have been sent to roughly 80,000 people. He was right, Plymell said. The cease and desist order also included a request to destroy or return any email lists the group has that were HealthOP property. \u201cI was somewhat surprised by the email,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cI questioned if this was a legitimate email.\u201d Joseph Holloway, the receivership supervisor for Colorado HealthOP sent Rankin an email, confirming ColoradoCareYes\u2019s improper use of the name. \u201cPermission was not granted to use the Colorado HealthOP name to reach out in support of this project,\u201d Holloway said. Rankin, who is a strong opponent to Amendment 69, wanted to get to the bottom of how the email originated and make sure people were aware the initiative was not endorsed by Colorado HealthOP. \u201cIt has never been proven anywhere that it works,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cThe HealthOP didn\u2019t work. It extracted a ton of money from taxpayers and it failed. So why do again?\u201d If passed the plan would cost employers 6.67 percent of their total payroll in state income taxes, 3.33 percent on employees, and 10 percent for self-employed insureds, making Colorado the highest income tax in the United States. The cease and desist order said the group was in violation of court orders in the case. \u201cEmail addresses and all private identifying information of former CO-OP members, brokers, and any other clients, and/or affiliates obtained through the course of CO-OP\u2019s operation, are the sole property of the CO-OP. The email indicates that you have converted the former CO-OP members\u2019 email addresses to your own personal use,\u201d it says. \u201cFurthermore, your attempt to direct, control or influence former CO-OP members because of your role as former employees, board members or officers of the CO-OP also appears to be a violation.\u201d All but one of the 10 members could not be located by Complete Colorado. Harper did not return a request for comment, neither did the communications director for ColoradoCareYes. Failure to stop will result in legal action the order says. \u201cWe wanted to nip this in the bud and let them know this was not the right thing to do\u201d Plymell said.
