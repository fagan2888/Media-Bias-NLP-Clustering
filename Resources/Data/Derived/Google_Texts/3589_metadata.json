The higher the final number supposedly means there's more body fat.\n\nBut the student refused to include her BMI on her assignment and instead wrote an essay explaining why.\n\nThe essay read, in part, \"Ever since I can remember I've been a 'bigger girl,' and I'm completely fine with that; I'm strong and powerful.\"\n\nIn the paper, which was photographed and posted on Facebook by a family friend, she goes on to explain she felt very self-conscious about her body when the school year started and would even \"wear four bras\" and \"wrap ace bandages around [her] stomach\" to look skinnier.\n\nSo her mom took her to a doctor, who ran a few tests and said the girl was on track with her weight.\n\nThe girl says she's physically strong, and \u2014 as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points out \u2014 an athlete's BMI will often be higher because of her muscle and bone density.\n\nShe concluded her assignment by saying: \"I am just beginning to love my body. ... My BMI is none of your concern because my body and BMI are perfect and beautiful just the way they are.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "An eighth-grader was asked to determine her BMI on an assignment, but she wrote an essay instead.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "An eighth-grader was asked to determine her BMI on an assignment, but she wrote an essay instead.", "title": "Why This Middle Schooler Won't Calculate Her Body Mass Index", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/why-this-middle-schooler-won-t-calculate-her-body-mass-index/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1459866988.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An eighth-grader was asked to determine her BMI on an assignment, but she wrote an essay instead.", "title": "Why This Middle Schooler Won't Calculate Her Body Mass Index", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/why-this-middle-schooler-won-t-calculate-her-body-mass-index/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1459866988.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=txNG5sMjE6A_0L8rluWpi32Q8DDaLEih&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://58666", "iphone": "newsy://58666", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://58666", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "keywords": "student bmi, student won't calculate her bmi, student refuses to calculate bmi, body mass index, bmi, bmi in schools, bmi homework assignment, bmi homework assignment viral, viral news, life and culture news, aol, newsy", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1459866988.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "An eighth-grader in Indiana was asked to calculate her body mass index for a homework assignment.\n...
