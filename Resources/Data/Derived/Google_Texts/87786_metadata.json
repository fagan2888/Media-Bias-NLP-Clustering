We brought you the full scoop, with specs and photos and in-person reports on the hidden nuances -- even an interview with Ford's dynamic CEO, Alan Mulally.\n\nThe Fool's \"Motor Money\" duo of Rex Moore and John Rosevear attended the briefing that Ford held for media members and Wall Street analysts in New York City. We learned a lot about Ford's new pony, and we shared it all with you.\n\nBut what's it really like to go to one of these events as a member of the media? Here's the inside story: There was a buffet lunch, and then we were brought into a room where we saw a 2015 Mustang GT convertible -- and where we heard presentations from several key Ford executives who were closely involved in the development of the Mustang. After that, we had a chance to get up close with the car, as well as opportunities to interview those key executives.\n\nNow, we're bringing a couple of those presentations to you, just as we saw them. In this video you'll see Ford design chief Moray Callum share in-depth details about his team's approach to the new car. If you're a Mustang fan, take a few minutes to watch his presentation -- you'll learn a lot about Ford's latest pony, just as we did.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Callum led the design of the new 2015 Ford Mustang.
