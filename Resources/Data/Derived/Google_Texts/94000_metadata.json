They howl about the overreach of the federal government, but they are among the biggest beneficiaries of government programs. For 150 years, their brand of logic has pitted individuals against an activist government, Western cowboys against black Americans, and the West against the East. Behind their protest is a uniquely American story that welds racism to anti-government sentiment. It comes from a peculiar coincidence of timing: that Reconstruction after the Civil War coincided with U.S. expansion into the American West.\n\nReal \u201cpatriots,\u201d the Bundys claim, stand against a behemoth government that has grasped their lands and their rights. America, after all, is made by ambitious individuals working their way up. A government that promotes social welfare or regulates business destroys the American system because it both limits a man\u2019s ability to make money and requires tax revenue. Those taxes strike at the very heart of individualism because they redistribute money from hard workers to lazy people.\n\nAmmon and Ryan Bundy and their compatriots are quite clear about exactly who those lazy people are. The younger Bundys\u2019 father, Cliven, the Nevada rancher who started an armed standoff with government officials in 2014 over grazing rights, had plenty to say about the \u201cNegro\u201d who lived in government housing and \u201cdidn\u2019t have nothing to do.\u201d African-Americans\u2019 laziness led them to abort their children and send their young men to jail. Bundy wondered: \u201care they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life\u2026 or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\u2019t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, the Bundys are perfectly comfortably taking money from government programs themselves. Aside from animal kill programs that protect herds, drought relief payments, and the 93 percent discount at which the government assesses grazing fees, Ammon Bundy borrowed more than $500,000 from the federal government through a loan guarantee program for small businesses. Ammon Bundy\u2019s father, Cliven, owes the government more than $1 million in grazing fees for running his cattle on public land. No matter how you slice it, taxpayers have subsidized the Bundys.\n\nObservers have made much of this obvious contradiction. But it is not a sign only of the Bundys\u2019 lack of self-awareness, or even simply of white supremacy. It is the intellectual formula that has driven American politics since 1980.\n\nThat formula was laid down immediately after the Civil War. In 1865, the South was so devastated by the war that Southerners, white and black, were starving. To provide rations and medical care, and to place homeless Southerners on farming land, Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. To emphasize that government aid would be temporary, they placed what became known as the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau within the War Department. In summer 1865, military officers distributed 150,000 rations, a third of them to white people. But the agents also took on an unexpected role. Southern states refused to let ex-slaves testify in court, leaving them to the tender mercies of angry white Southerners, who cheated, beat, raped and murdered them. So Freedmen\u2019s Bureau officers began to hear the cases that pitted black and white Southerners against each other.\n\nWhile agents often forced black people back to work for abusive employers or demanded subservient behavior, they decided cases in favor of ex-slaves about 68 percent of the time. So Southern Democrats rewrote history. They had not fought the Civil War over slavery after all, they insisted. They had fought it to stop a huge government bureaucracy from forcing its way into their homes and regulating the way they treated \u201ctheir people.\u201d They had fought, they now claimed, not for slavery, but for states\u2019 rights.\n\nWhen Congress tried to expand the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau the following year to enable it to provide education for poor Americans of all races, President Andrew Johnson added the final ideological piece to the Democrats\u2019 attack on an activist government. That piece was taxation. During the war, the Republican Congress had created the nation\u2019s first national taxes, including the income tax. Johnson vetoed the bill expanding the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau on two grounds. First, although the schools in the bill would have disproportionately helped whites in the border states, Johnson claimed that it provided benefits for African-Americans that had never been accorded to white people. Second, he explained that the bill would create an army of officials that would harass Southern whites, while the taxes necessary to support them would impoverish hardworking white people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anti-government diatribes from the prime beneficiaries of government programs?
