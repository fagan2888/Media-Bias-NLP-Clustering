It is not the confusion you think. It is another confusion. I am not talking about the enormous differences between Republicans and Democrats, the gaping chasm between those who believe in more limited government, free speech, press, worship and gun rights, and those who advocate more government and greater limits. That one is secondary. This is a different sort of confusion, one that we can all understand.\n\nIt might have grown up from a mis-transcription of the Congressional Record, a few years ago. It could have been the result of President Obama reading his teleprompter too fast. It might even have been the result of some crazy pundit who thought the two words were interchangeable. But here is the rub. The White House \u2013 indeed, the entire Obama Administration and half the Congress \u2013 appear to have transposed the words \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cofficious,\u201d a simple yet remarkable error.\n\nWhile we expect our government to be official, we recoil when it becomes officious. As most know, the word \u201cofficial\u201d means \u201crelating to an authority or public body and its duties, actions, and responsibilities.\u201d Think of the \u201cOfficial\u201d Great Seal of the United States, or an \u201cOfficial\u201d ruling on a first down. The word \u201cofficious,\u201d on the other hand, is quite different. It means \u201cassertive of authority in an annoyingly domineering way, especially with regard to petty or trivial matters.\u201d I am not kidding, they are completely different words. The White House may not think so, but look at their last three letters!\n\nSo, now we know. This is all just a big mistake. Stop the White House presses, pull back the next White House proclamation. Hold the next vituperative attack on the Senate floor. We just have a big confusion here. It took some careful research, but I think we are better for discovering our error. This is like that alleged missing comma in the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the unnecessary heartache we have been through, thinking that all that brusque business about \u201cphone and pen,\u201d that oozing hubris and over-the-top arrogance from the White House \u2013 was just a transcription error.\n\nInstead of each unilateral White House directive being \u201cofficially\u201d signed into law, the mound of executive orders piling up in the West Wing, and those boxes overflowing to the Lincoln Bedroom, were \u201cofficiously\u201d signed into law. But that was just a big syntactical goof. This discovery explains everything, don\u2019t you think? Instead of our White House maintaining an \u201cofficial website\u201d for Obamacare, they accidentally set up an \u201cofficious website.\u201d That explains why they had to waive most of it. Instead of \u201cofficial\u201d IRS agents and oversight, we got \u201cofficious\u201d IRS activity. It is so simple. Instead of \u201cofficial assessments\u201d on the debacles at Benghazi, Operation Fast and Furious, the Solyndra scandal, we ended up \u2013 quite by accident \u2013 with \u201cofficious reports.\u201d What a mess, but what a relief, just word confusion after all!\n\nNo wonder this president last month described all of the administration\u2019s missteps as \u201cphony scandals,\u201d his spokesperson insisting that \u201cthis is the most transparent White House in history.\u201d He is simply embarrassed. There has been a profound clerical mix-up, a grievous grammatical error. That is all it is, but that is the reason so many internal reports, emails, and other items have been withheld \u2013adolescent embarrassment. We need to get the person who made these transcription errors. Maybe it was Louis Lerner \u2013 or is that Lois? Maybe it was someone at the Veteran\u2019s Administration. A lot of errors seem to come from there. Maybe it was a video made by some conservative English teacher or film producer. Anyway, everything official has rather awkwardly become officious.\n\nBut then, maybe this \u201cword confusion\u201d thing goes wider. Maybe, beyond \u201cofficial\u201d becoming \u201cofficious,\u201d there are other systemic semantic lapses. Maybe, instead of the \u201cmost transparent White House in history,\u201d they meant \u201cmost transgressive,\u201d \u201cmost transfixed\u201d or maybe just \u201cmost transcendent.\u201d Who knows? Maybe, rather than promoting the \u201caudacity of hope,\u201d the President meant \u201caudacity of dope,\u201d \u201cimportations\u201d not \u201cdeportations,\u201d and Department for \u201cvegans\u201d not for \u201cveterans.\u201d Who knows where all this confusion ends? At least we can take a deep breath. It is just a big misunderstanding. All sorts of words seem to be losing their meaning.\n\nYes, in official Washington, words seem upside down these days. Orwell would be proud \u2013 he predicted it all. What words may mean on a given day depends on who says them, when and where. Tomorrow the meaning can change. Promises from the highest official in the land melt away, even the official ones. The triumph of insensible language is dawning. And everywhere, things that have always been trusted, All-American, cherry topped and official, seem busted, despair again, photo-shopped and \u2013 yes \u2013 officious. Maybe it is time to demand that words keep their meanings, from the US Constitution on down. What do you think, should we make that official \u2013 before it is too late?", "article_metadata": {"description": "?A terrible confusion has occurred in Washington.
