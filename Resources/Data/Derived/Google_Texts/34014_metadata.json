Apparently not. Is it working anyway? Reality certainly seems to be pointing in that direction. Is the Affordable Care Act popular? Apparently not. Is it working anyway? Reality certainly seems to be pointing in that direction.\n\nJust this week, the evidence is overwhelming, with good news at the state and national level. We\u2019re seeing encouraging results when it comes to hospitals , prescription-drug savings , and consumer rebates\n\nBut sometimes, you need an image \u2013 or in this case, two related images \u2013 to drive the point home. Consider the before-and-after maps out of Kentucky.\n\nJ oe Sonka reported yesterday:\n\nThis week we mentioned the amazing new numbers from Kentucky\u2019s Department of Medicaid Services on what the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid has meant for the state. Perhaps the most notable piece of information is the county-by-county map of how the uninsured rate has plummeted, especially in eastern Kentucky. On the House floor on Wednesday, Congressman John Yarmuth made sure to show this map to all of his Republican colleagues who want to repeal the law and most of those Kentuckians\u2019 coverage:\n\nIt may be a little hard to see the maps in the video, but Yarmuth tweeted the graphic . The top map shows the uninsured rate in each of Kentucky\u2019s 120 counties \u2013 orange and red show the counties with the worst figures. The bottom map shows the shift in each county following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 green and blue point to the areas with higher percentages of insurance.\n\nIn all, how many of Kentucky\u2019s 120 counties saw improvements in their residents access to medical care? Literally all of them.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u201d works in areas where committed public officials have tried to make it work.
