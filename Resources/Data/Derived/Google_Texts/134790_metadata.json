I will go further and say that there are progressive reasons, as well as conservative reasons, to separate civil unions and holy matrimony. This is -- no matter that the newspapers say -- not an issue that is simply left vs. right.\n\nTo demonstrate, let's play a game. The following quotations are from two Southern Baptist leaders. One is a progressive position and the other conservative. Which is which?\n\nPastors should stop signing state-issued marriage licenses. They should stop immediately. ...\n\nOur society has been redefining marriage for a long time. There was a time society expected couples to care for each other, but now privacy laws shield medical information from spouses. There was a time when couples had to live together to be married, but now cohabitation is optional. There was a day when getting out of a marriage required a cause, but now \u201cno-fault\u201d divorce has eroded longevity in marriage and, I believe, much happiness.\n\n\n\nSomewhere along the way we parted waters. We have been using the same word, but meaning different things.\n\n\n\nThe church needs to shake itself free of old definitions of marriage. We must reject the state\u2019s contract view as its view.\n\nAnd then there is this Southern Baptist point of view:\n\n... Churches should only marry those who are accountable to the Church and to the gathered witnesses, and who are held to their vows. ...\n\nWhen a congregation certifies a biblically married couple to be also civilly married, the congregation is not affirming the state\u2019s definition of marriage. Instead, the Church is witnessing to the state\u2019s role in recognizing marriage as something that stands before and is foundational to society. We are bearing witness to the fact that these unions are the business of the larger society in ways other unions aren\u2019t.\n\nWe are witnessing that the state has no business in recreating marriage, but the state does have a responsibility to safeguard children, by holding mothers and fathers to their vows to each other and to the next generation.\n\nSo who is who?\n\nThe first option, the one that calls for cutting the tie that binds with the state, is from the Rev. Kyle Henderson of First Baptist Church of Athens, Texas, in a commentary for the progressive Baptist News Global website.\n\nThen that's the Rev. Russell Moore of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, a doctrinal conservative, arguing in favor of clergy continuing to sign state licenses, even in the current age when some states now affirm same-sex marriage.\n\nThis brings me to my column this past week, which focuses on the decision by Father Patrick Henry Reardon, an Orthodox priest in Chicago, to stop signing Illinois marriage licenses. Here are to key chunks of the column that framed my podcast chat with host Todd Wilken:\n\nThe veteran priest was convinced that he faced a collision between an ancient sacrament and new political realities that define a civil contract. His goal, he said, was not to \"put my people in a tough spot,\" but to stress that believers now face complications when they get married \u2014 period.\n\nThe question priests must ask, when signing marriage licenses, is \"whether or not you're acting on behalf of the state when you perform that rite. It's clear as hell to me that this is what a priest is doing,\" said Reardon, reached by telephone.\n\n\"Lay people don't face the sacramental question like a priest. They are trying to obtain the same civil contract and benefits as anyone else, and they have to get that from the state. It's two different moral questions.\"\n\nIt's crucial to realize that different churches -- congregational vs. hierarchical, in particular -- approach marriage in different ways. The Orthodox past that helps shape Reardon's decision, for example, includes centuries of performing marriage rites in cultures (think Islamic lands and the Communist era in Russia) that were not friendly to the church and its beliefs. When it comes to thinking about conflicts between church rites and civil realities, this is not Orthodoxy's first rodeo. However, not all Orthodox leaders agree with Reardon.\n\nThis is a complex issue. The key for me, in terms of journalism, is that newsroom leaders simply must -- if they have any interest in accurately covering this debate -- look at this as a theological and religious debate about marriage, not a showdown about gay rights and politics.\n\nBack to the column, which ends with an important statement from a leader of Orthodoxy here in North America. Read carefully:\n\nThe upcoming Supreme Court decision could \"mark a powerful affirmation of marriage between one man and one woman, ... or it can initiate a direction which the Holy Orthodox Church can never embrace,\" stated Metropolitan Joseph of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. \"Throughout the history of our faith, our Holy Fathers have led the Orthodox laity\" to unite to \"preserve the faith against heresy from within, and against major threats from societies from without.\"\n\nAt his altar, said Reardon, this means, \"I cannot represent the State of Illinois anymore. ... I'm not making a political statement. I'm making a theological statement.\"\n\nNote: Heresy \"within\" as well as threats \"from without.\" There are news stories ahead in both parts of that equation.\n\nEnjoy the podcast.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week's Crossroads podcast (click here to listen in) grew out of my \r\nlatest \"On Religion\" column, rather than a GetReligion post, so here is a \r\nbit of background on the subject -- which is the growing debate about \r\nwhether clergy in traditional faiths should continue to sign marriage \r\nlicenses from the state.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more, a good place to start is with \"The Marriage \r\nPledge,\" a document posted by the conservative, interfaith journal First \r\nThings.
