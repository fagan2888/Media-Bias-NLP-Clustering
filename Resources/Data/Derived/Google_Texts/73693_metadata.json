Under current law, anyone convicted of assaulting a physician or nurse rendering emergency medical care outside of a hospital or healthcare facility faces a fine up to $2,000 and/or up to one year in jail. Place the same assault inside the actual hospital, and the incident is treated as a lower misdemeanor, punishable by only up to six months in jail.\n\n\u201cI just read an OSHA report today that indicates that assaults in healthcare far exceed any other occupation or any other industry,\u201d said David LaRose, president of the International Association for Hospital Security and Safety. \u201cIt is a significant aspect of the healthcare industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to LaRose, emergency rooms are often the top target of violence. However, behavioral health departments and facilities are another primary target.\n\n[Also: Healthcare finance tips for safeguarding against cyberattacks]\n\nFor several years hospitals have initiated \u201cperimeters within perimeters,\u201d LaRose said \u2013 increased security in maternity wards to protect newborns or in the pharmacy to deter theft of drugs. Much of the new security attention is focused on protecting points of entry without impacting the \u201cpublic openness and accessibility\u201d mission of the hospital.\n\nLaRose said security spending is certainly going towards better locks, more security cameras and the obvious trappings of a more secure building. But the most important spending is on risk assessment and staff training.\n\nRisk assessment also requires a team approach \u2013 clinicians, support staff, security professionals, and outside security experts all need to participate. However, that\u2019s also where many hospitals fail: They don\u2019t ask enough questions of enough people.\n\n\u201cSometimes there wasn\u2019t enough assessment done before a solution was relied upon,\u201d LaRose said of problems he has seen. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw technology at something and say that\u2019s going to fix your problem. You can\u2019t just say that a staff member is going to fix your problem. That\u2019s why you really have to have a collaborative cohesive stakeholder meeting. You need to understand the workflow, you need to understand what the organization\u2019s goals are, what the culture is, who your customer and patients are.\u201d\n\nNo quick fix\n\nWhile healthcare administrators may look fora silver bullet cure to violence in their facilities, the solution is actually very practical, said William (Bill) Nesbitt, president of Security Management Services International, a leading security firm serving the healthcare industry.\n\n\u201cGenerally, physical security really applies to things like locks, access control systems and fencing \u2013 actual devices and security officers. It is in fact very situational,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things we do when we go into any site, no matter where it is, is that we\u2019re looking to find out what the crime environment is like,\u201d Nesbitt said. \u201cThe threat environment is so different from one locale to another. There are sociological differences. There are ethnic differences. We look at what kind of history does the hospital have. We\u2019ll go back through two or three years of incident reports to see if there are patterns and the kinds of things that go on.\u201d\n\nBut there is one thing that all hospitals and healthcare centers have in common when it comes to security and safety, Nesbitt said. The facility needs to be open to everyone. But just how open should depend on how each visitor is assessed from a risk perspective.\n\n\u201cProbably the most vulnerable is the emergency department, especially if you\u2019re a level one trauma center\u201d Nesbitt says. \u201cThat\u2019s where the sexual assault victims will be coming in, the gunshot victims, victims of other violence, people high on PCP or something, people with psychological problems.\u201d\n\nTraining for employees is on the rise, and Nesbitt said he is encouraged that extreme acts of violence against healthcare workers may decline.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is getting better is the training programs that train people within hospitals on how to deal with adverse behavior,\u201d Nesbitt said, which can often mean knowing how to diffuse a hostile situation before it becomes violent.\n\nAnd while shootings or armed threats can definitely prompt security overhauls, it\u2019s not the only type of encounter that prompts hospitals to seek out a security provider.\n\n\u201cIn some cases it definitely is an incident,\u201d Nesbitt said. \u201cIn some cases it is a member of staff that starts to express feelings that they don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could also be property crime \u2013 cars being broken into in the parking lot, purse snatches in the parking lot,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\nWhatever the security challenge or crime,, the first line of defense should be the employees themselves.\n\n\u201cThe most important single factor in keeping the hospital safe is getting the employees involved in being the solution. That takes some training,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/emergency-room-violence-prompts-hospitals-tighten-security", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/security%20guard.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Security spending geared towards better locks, security staff and more cameras, but the most important spending is on risk assessment and staff training.", "title": "Emergency room violence prompts hospitals to tighten security"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/security%20guard.jpg"}, "description": "Security spending geared towards better locks, security staff and more cameras, but the most important spending is on risk assessment and staff training.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Emergency room violence prompts hospitals to tighten security"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Several recent high-profile attacks against healthcare workers in U.S. hospitals have exposed dangerous flaws with security at healthcare providers, prompting hospitals administrators and even lawmakers to look for ways to better safeguard staff.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Risk assessment also requires a team approach \u2013 clinicians, support staff, security professionals, and outside security experts all need to participate.\nIn California, a bill recently approved in the state Assembly seeks to close one dangerous loophole in hospital security.\n\u201cIt is a significant aspect of the healthcare industry.\u201dAccording to LaRose, emergency rooms are often the top target of violence.\nLaRose said security spending is certainly going towards better locks, more security cameras and the obvious trappings of a more secure building.\nSecurity guardSeveral recent high-profile attacks against healthcare workers in U.S. hospitals have exposed dangerous flaws with security at healthcare providers, prompting hospitals administrators and even lawmakers to look for ways to better safeguard staff."}
