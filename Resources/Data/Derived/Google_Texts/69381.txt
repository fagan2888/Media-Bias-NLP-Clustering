WASHINGTON–The Federal Reserve may wait until 2015 to propose a rule on loss-absorbing bank debt that is considered central to the job of preventing taxpayer-backed bailouts, a senior official said Tuesday.

Mark van Der Weide, deputy director of the Fed’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, said the Fed isn’t likely to reveal its closely-watched proposal until it first tries to reach consensus with international regulators — a process that appears likely to slip into next year.

The “first best outcome” is international consensus on a rule “that creates a level playing field and maximum confidence,” Mr. van Der Weide said.

The rule in question would force bank holding companies to issue a minimum amount of long-term debt. If a bank were failing, the holders of that debt could re-capitalize a new company, rather than taxpayers providing those funds. Banks consider the rule crucial to ending the perception that they are “too big to fail” and need government help, but unwinding any global bank will also require international cooperation.

The Financial Stability Board, a group of global regulators, is coordinating international talks on the debt rule. Mr. van Der Weide said the participants still have gaps in what they believe an appropriate requirement would be, but they want to agree on a proposal by November and finalize it next year. “Our hope is that process proceeds well” and the U.S. implements its own rule soon after, he said.

Mr. van Der Weide said the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have been coordinating in developing the minimum debt rule for U.S. banks. He and Arthur Murton, the top FDIC official in charge of the matter, agree on where that level should be set, but there is “much more heterogeneity in international conversations,” Mr. van der Weide said.
