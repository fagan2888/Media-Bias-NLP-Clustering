White House press secretary Jay Carney attempted to re-write history Monday when he claimed that the Obama administration had never set a 7 million-policyholder goal for the Affordable Care Act.

At the White House press briefing, CBS’s Major Garrett asked Carney why the administration was now backtracking from the “7 million-person enrollment figure that Kathleen Sebelius, Marilyn Tavenner and various other incarnations said was a goal and a legitimate goal and a reachable goal,” according to the C-SPAN video.

When Carney attempted to say the figure was a mere Congressional Budget Office estimate, and that other estimates varied, Garrett interrupted him with a telling quote.

“But, I mean, Kathleen Sebelius said on Sept. 30 — this is a direct quote: ‘I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014,’” he said.

When Carney tried to spin it, Garrett interrupted him again.

“This sounds like she’s embracing that, not just conceptually, but she said that’s what success looks like,” Garret said.

An NBC News video, dated Sept. 30, confirms Garrett’s assertion.
