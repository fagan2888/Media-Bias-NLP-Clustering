A teenager is recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest after a drive-by shooting Saturday afternoon in north Wichita.

It happened at about 1:45 p.m. in the 2700 block of Fairview Ave. That's near 26th and Waco.

Wichita police say and 18-year-old man told officers he was at a home with three other people when two men drove by in a gold colored two-door car, one of them unloading multiple shots from a gun.

The victim was shot in the chest and taken to Via Christi St. Francis hospital in critical condition. He has since been updated to serious condition.

The victim told officers he did know the shooter, giving them a name, but police were not releasing it as of Sunday afternoon.

Police are still looking for the suspect. No one else was hurt.
