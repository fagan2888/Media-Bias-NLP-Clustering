The Patriots needed the ball back, but the Packers completed a first down that would allow them to run out the clock.\n\nOn the Patriots sideline, cameras took close-ups of a frustrated Tom Brady shouting \u201cfudge\u201d three times.\n\nAdditional Images Many Mainers say they aren\u2019t bothered by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady\u2019s cussing, which was caught on national television during a New England loss to the Green Bay Packers, and in fact say the incident\u2019s been \u201cblown out of proportion.\u201d Related Headlines Patriots look to run away from Jets Today's Poll Obscenities on camera Are you offended by professional athletes swearing (silently) on camera during televised games? Yes No\n\nSearch photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nOnly he didn\u2019t say fudge.\n\nBrady\u2019s obscenities soon went viral, as did the ensuing criticism of the quarterback. Even the Federal Communications Commission received three complaints about Brady\u2019s choice of language.\n\nThe incident has prompted discussions about the acceptance of profanity in competitive sports \u2013 from the major leagues all the way down to the high school level. As well, it\u2019s kindled debate about whether being a role model means having to be squeaky clean.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Brady has been shown swearing on the football field. Nor is he the first athlete to be caught on camera uttering an obscenity.\n\nDavid Ortiz\u2019s use of the same profanity became a rallying cry for the Red Sox and the city of Boston through a season that ended with the 2013 World Series championship.\n\nNobody complained then. So what the heck is the big deal now?\n\n\u201cI think anybody who is involved in competition will get frustrated and use profanity as a way to release that frustration,\u201d said Bill Gayton, a University of Southern Maine professor who specializes in sports psychology.\n\n\u201c(Swearing) is an expression of frustration and anger. It is used to help people defuse (their anger) and calm themselves down so they don\u2019t get overaroused.\u201d\n\nBut for high school athletic directors, the use of obscenities by student-athletes is an issue.\n\n\u201cThe privacy of the locker room is one thing,\u201d said Deering High\u2019s Mel Craig. \u201cBut when you\u2019re on the sideline or in a position where the media, or the parents, or even your teammates can hear you, you are held to another standard. You are representing the uniform, the community. You have to be careful.\u201d\n\nMarshwood High\u2019s Rich Buzzell reminds his players that someone is always watching \u2013 \u201cmost likely a little kid who wants to be like you\u201d \u2013 but he knows it would be naive to think that students don\u2019t swear.\n\nLibby Pomerleau, a junior at Saco\u2019s Thornton Academy who plays field hockey and softball, said she hears obscenities on every playing field.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, it happens with all sports,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game.\u201d\n\nPomerleau said she doesn\u2019t swear; instead she tries to internalize her thoughts. But \u201cfor others, I know it is hard to keep control. Some of those games get pretty heated.\u201d\n\nHEAT OF THE MOMENT MAY PREVAIL\n\nPro athletes know they are held to high standards. But sometimes, stuff happens.\n\nAndrew Campbell, a defenseman for the Portland Pirates, said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the ice in the midst of the battle, you say stuff that sometimes you wish you didn\u2019t say. But it\u2019s an emotional game. It\u2019s a physical game.\n\n\u201cYou want to be a role model. That\u2019s what you focus on away from the rink, doing the right things, being the right person. But stuff can roll off the tongue pretty quickly when you\u2019re in the heat of the moment out there.\u201d\n\nDan Lebowitz, executive director of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University in Boston, said pro athletes are held to a high standard \u2013 but it\u2019s important to realize star athletes are human, too.\n\n\u201cWith those expectations that we hold them to,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s also OK to recognize that human fallibility intersects with those expectations.\u201d\n\nEven college coaches admit they are guilty at times of using the obscenity Brady did.\n\nGary Fifield, the women\u2019s basketball coach at the University of Southern Maine, has heard it as well on the court. Has he uttered it? \u201cProbably,\u201d he said, with a slight laugh. \u201cHighly likely.\u201d\n\nJack Cosgrove, the University of Maine football coach, said, \u201cI know I\u2019m guilty of it, whether in football or everyday life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t use that word, but I use it. I\u2019m an emotional guy. As much as I try to keep them in check, there are moments like that. \u2026 Of course, mine are not on a national stage, like Tom Brady.\u201d\n\nBrady said he wished he didn\u2019t swear as much he does. But, he said, what\u2019s to be expected when there\u2019s a camera in his face during a game?\n\n\u201cBlame CBS and NBC for putting it on TV. Don\u2019t blame me,\u201d Brady told Boston-based sports talk radio station WEEI.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not choirboys, I know that. You bring us up to a certain level of intensity to the game, your job is to go out there and physically, emotionally, mentally dominate the game. You don\u2019t do that at church on Sunday. You\u2019ve got to go to the football field for that.\u201d\n\n\u2018BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION\u2019\n\nGayton, who has worked with a number of pro hockey teams over the years, understands why some people might be upset about Brady\u2019s outburst. But he said it is difficult to watch any sporting event \u2013 \u201cmaybe with the exception of golf,\u201d he said \u2013 and not witness profanity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem if a parent wants to get upset about exposing their children to profanity,\u201d said Gayton. \u201cBut the concept of outlawing profanity in the National Football League? That\u2019s like asking people not to breathe.\u201d\n\nLebowitz said Brady in particular deserves the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at his extended career, he has comported himself with all the dignity and class that you would want someone to comport oneself with,\u201d Lebowitz said.\n\n\u201cThis one instance, where he was shown using profanity, does it make him less of a person? I find this has been blown well out of proportion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this any different than someone reading a bad quarterly earnings statement at IBM? They might react the same way, only the cameras wouldn\u2019t be there recording it.\u201d\n\nJoe Esposito, a junior at Portland High who plays football and basketball, said: \u201cI think this has been overblown. Football is an intense game and words are said in the heat of battle that you wouldn\u2019t say under normal circumstances.\n\n\u201cI still consider Tom Brady a role model. He\u2019s done a lot for charity and the city of Boston.\u201d\n\nThornton\u2019s Pomerleau said her little brother looks up to Brady as a role model and should continue to.\n\n\u201cI think the swearing is definitely a negative thing and people look down on it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut of all the things that adults can be caught doing, swearing is one of the minimal things.\u201d\n\nStaff Writers Glenn Jordan and Tom Chard contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did the Patriots quarterback cross the line with his string of epithets?", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Did the Patriots quarterback cross the line with his string of epithets?", "title": "Tom Brady's cusses get people talking - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/557920_167822-pats1.jpg", "height": 713}, "updated_time": "2014-12-21T07:02:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/21/bradys-cusses-get-people-talking/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Did the Patriots quarterback cross the line with his string of epithets?", "title": "Tom Brady's cusses get people talking - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/557920_167822-pats1.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "New England Patriots", "published_time": "2014-12-21T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-21T07:02:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde291\"", "article_summary": "On the Patriots sideline, cameras took close-ups of a frustrated Tom Brady shouting \u201cfudge\u201d three times.\n\u201cI still consider Tom Brady a role model.\nGary Fifield, the women\u2019s basketball coach at the University of Southern Maine, has heard it as well on the court.\nFootball is an intense game and words are said in the heat of battle that you wouldn\u2019t say under normal circumstances.\nThe New England Patriots trailed the Green Bay Packers, 26-21, in the final minutes of their game three weeks ago."}
