Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu steps to the podium in the House chamber. He\u2019s come not to praise President Barack Obama, but to bury Obama\u2019s anti-nuclear negotiations with Iran, in perhaps the most polarizing speech in Washington\u2019s recent history. Obama, however, made a few moves too, increasing the pressure on a high-stakes speech. And given another bad news cycle (see below), Clinton\u2019s probably happy to let Netanyahu grab the spotlight for a day or two. Here\u2019s your Three-Minute Briefing, Bibi Edition, all the News You Can Use about Netanyahu (and other stuff) in 180 seconds or less.\n\nA Little Chin Music: After House Republicans invited him to the metaphorical dinner, Bibi set the table on Monday with a toned-down but defiant speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Conference, criticizing the Obama administration for endangering Israel through peaceful negotiations instead of doing the talking with a few fighter jets over Tehran. While Netanyahu was warming up, though, Obama threw a couple high, hard fastballs at Bibi in an exclusive sit-down with Reuters news service. Obama criticized Netanyahu\u2019s assertion that the White House is about to sell out Israel in Iran negotiations, and suggested Netanyahu - who complained about the side deals that got Tehran to the bargaining table - doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about: \u201c[He\u2019s] made all sorts of claims: \u2018This was going to be a terrible deal. This was going to result in Iran getting 50 billion dollars worth of relief. Iran would not abide by the agreement.\u2019 None of that has come true.\u201d Watch the full interview here.\n\nDear Mr. President: Meanwhile, some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee are giving the multilateral talks with Iran some serious side-eye, and turning a screw or two on the White House. Committee chair Ed Royce, a California Republican, and Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat, are circulating a letter of concern around Capitol Hill, gathering signatures before sending it to the Oval Office. Royce and Engel are concerned that Obama\u2019s going to get a bad deal if he gives peace a chance, they want some say in the matter and they\u2019re ready to dish up another helping of marginally effective sanctions if things go south.\n\nDitch City: In the opposite of a whip count, 53 Democrats are skipping the big speech, and that number could grow a bit as fence-sitters make up their minds. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the biggest no-show so far; she announced Monday evening that she\u2019d ditch the speech in solidarity with Obama and the party, and smacked Boehner for creating a mess. Perhaps she\u2019s going to use the time to prepare her assault on the massive Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, an Obama second-term priority.\n\nPutting \u201cDis\u201d in Dysfunctional: Bibi and Barry\u2019s bad romance has a long history and has been an uncomfortable marriage, almost from day one. CNN Online\u2019s got a pretty good explainer from last fall, describing the long history of injury (Netanyahu, with Vice President Joe Biden in town, unveiling plans for new West Bank settlements) and insult (one senior White House official called Netanyahu chickensh*t) between the two men, who work together because they have to. If their psychodrama were a movie, the tagline would be, \u201cThis time it\u2019s personal.\u201d\n\nAnyone Check StubHub?: It\u2019s a truism of life: The more exclusive the event, the more everyone wants to go. But the bad blood between Bibi and Barry has made Netanyahu\u2019s speech the hottest event in Washington since the British torched the Capitol during the War of 1812. Problem is, there are very, very few tickets to go around, and that\u2019s left the wonks and power players frustrated, sad and relegated to watching it on a screen of some sort in a comfy chair. With maybe a beverage or food, which isn\u2019t allowed in the Capitol gallery. And without security hassles. Sometimes, it\u2019s an unjust world.\n\nTreason, Party of One: It\u2019s been an open question since House Speaker John Boehner asked Netanyahu to come on over for a chat with Congress: did Boehner\u2019s breach of protocol, essentially a middle finger to the White House, actually violate the Constitution? Yes, says Reuters, because the Constitution Republicans love so much specifically says presidents have the exclusive power to \u201creceive ambassadors and other public ministers from foreign governments.\u201d Except, apparently, when the Congress doesn\u2019t like him.\n\nTweet of the Morning:\n\nBeing a traitor has never been more patriotic. \u2014 William K. Wolfrum (@Wolfrum) March 3, 2015\n\nOther Stuff:\n\nYou\u2019ve Got Mail: More smoke\u2019s coming from under the hood of the Hillary Clinton juggernaut. Today\u2019s bad headline comes from the New York Times, which reveals Madame Secretary conducted official State Department business from her personal email account, probably to skirt public disclosure rules. Besides providing new ammo to conservatives (\u201cBenghazi!\u201d) it\u2019s not a good look for Clinton, already under fire for big-dollar speeches that built her family\u2019s foundation into a billion-dollar empire with a cutthroat culture that makes \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d look like \u201cSesame Street.\u201d Not to mention former President George W. Bush got in hot water for doing the same email thing.\n\nSouvenirs from Planet CPAC: Some Republican presidential aspirants walked away from last week\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference beauty contest with a few nice trophies, U.S. News\u2019 David Catanese reports. Right-wing/libertarian heroes Rand Paul and Scott Walker finished one-two in the straw poll, with Jeb Bush finishing fifth behind Herman Cain Ben Carson. But The Smart Bush didn\u2019t leave empty-handed, delivering a polished, at-ease performance that tamed -- for the moment -- the archconservatives who think he\u2019s a faker.\n\nIf the Phone\u2019s Not Ringing, It\u2019s Probably Hillary: They\u2019re both progressive standard-bearers, they fear the middle class is vanishing and fiery, anti-Wall Street populist rhetoric is their calling card. But Elizabeth Warren\u2019s an arena-rock superstar while Sen. Bernie Sanders, by comparison, couldn\u2019t fill a phone booth at Netroots Nation. He\u2019s wondering why Clinton, reached out to Warren, a freshman, and not him when she wanted lessons on how to speak liberal, and he\u2019s still waiting on that 3 p.m. call. Note to Bernie: it might be the hair. Or the fact that you\u2019re a bit of a downer.\n\nStat of the Day: Chance that a high-risk patient admitted to a U.S. teaching hospital for heart failure will die: 1 in 4.
