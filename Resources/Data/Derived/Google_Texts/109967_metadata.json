This is the list of Upshot features that the writers, photo editors and graphics editors most liked doing for you:\n\nDerek Willis:\n\nHe enjoyed looking into the small, but mysterious, Virgin Islands Republican Party fund-raising operations. He also outlined how ActBlue became a powerful force in political fund-raising and how Facebook was starting to change how campaigns are conducted.\n\nAlan Flippen:\n\nHe smashed a ludicrous bit of received wisdom with No, Celebrity Deaths Do Not Come in Threes, as he says, \u201cjust for the fun of it.\u201d\n\nNeil Irwin:\n\nNeil can write on just about any topic, and his favorites reflect that scope. The Fried Calamari Index remains a favorite for all of us:\n\nWhy World War I Matters to Today\u2019s Economy\n\nSpecial Sauce for Measuring Food Trends: The Fried Calamari Index\n\nOf Kiwis and Currencies: How a 2% Inflation Target Became Global Economic Gospel\n\nJosh Barro:\n\nJosh took on loads of serious topics but got the biggest kick out of peeling off the skin of the fruit industry, first with his despised honeydew melons \u2014 That Honeydew Melon Looks Good, but Does Anyone Eat It? \u2014 and then with berries \u2014 Americans Are Eating a Lot More Berries. Here\u2019s Why. \u201cI learned new things that took the piece in a direction I didn\u2019t expect. (Reporting!)\u201d\n\nMargot Sanger-Katz:\n\nMargot liked the whole package of stories she and Kevin Quealy developed on who gained insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cBut I kind of loved the Medicaid expansion story, because it was a crazy and interesting thought experiment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe also felt good about the piece she did with Amanda Cox on the importance of insurance shopping because it saved people money if readers took their advice.\n\nShe said her other favorite was \u201cKevin\u2019s cool animated porcupine chart on the incredible shrinking Medicare budget.\u201d\n\nAmanda Cox and Josh Katz:\n\nThey worked as a team on creating the amazing Leo, our Senate election forecasting model. And it is their favorite project.\n\nJosh said he also got a kick out of his examination of the 11 most interesting Senate races and the college football fan maps, where his spatial smoothing algorithms clarified the raw data from Facebook.\n\nNate Cohn:\n\nNate spent the year tracking the Senate elections. He said the most fun was, not surprisingly, election night as the results poured in. His favorite thing was the election night results page, built with Amanda, which was nothing short of a revolutionary way to display election night results.\n\nKevin Quealy:\n\nKevin has wanted to explain N.F.L. playoff scenarios for a couple of years now. \u201cThe text-only version is about as good as you can do without writing your own software, but even that involves head-scratching and it\u2019s easy to get wrong (which we did, at least once!),\u201d he said. \u201cThe N.F.L. playoff simulator and mapping the playoff paths for every team show how technology can help you understand something in a way that just wasn\u2019t possible before.\u201d He says all the hard parts of this were done by his colleague Mike Bostock. In a similar way, our live-updating of the 984 Ways the United States Can Advance to the Next Round let you enjoy the U.S.-Germany World Cup game and let you watch the game like an expert without having to do any math on bar napkins.\n\n\u201cAnd of course I\u2019ll always love the 4th down bot, who was introduced to the Bills head coach in a news conference this year,\u201d he said.\n\nGregor Aisch:\n\nThe graphic editor who invented the way for The Upshot reporters to easily make charts turned North Dakota upside down. He showed the state\u2019s oil wells above ground to illustrate the stunning magnitude of the boom. He also said one of his most fun projects was the state migration graphics , one of the most popular features we did this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDarcy Eveleigh:\n\nOur photo editor had the most fun with historic photos, which is one of the hallmarks of The Upshot. Some of her favorite photo essays were Halloween 1964, Black Voter Turnout in 1964, Painkiller Abuse and Terrorism in 1964.\n\nClaire Cain Miller:\n\nClaire said her article on the financial bonus fatherhood brings at work was fun \u201cbecause the data surprised both men and women.\u201d\n\nShe said the article on paternity leave was particularly gratifying because of the number of readers she heard from who said they approached their employers about paternity leave after reading it.\n\nAnd the article about how robots are taking the jobs of a new and different class of worker was a favorite \u201cbecause I learned so much while reporting it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was interesting to tell a different side of a story I\u2019ve been covering for years \u2014 how technology is changing our lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150101101016, "twitter": {"description": "What Do Fruit, Robots and Celebrity Deaths Have in Common?", "title": "Upshot Highlights, 2014", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/upshot/upshot-highlights-2014.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003423512"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "darlin", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/07/upshot/07vigop-copy/07vigop-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/upshot/upshot-highlights-2014.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003423512", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/upshot/upshot-highlights-2014.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 1, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Fruit,United States Politics and Government,World Cup 2014 (Soccer)", "news_keywords": "Fruit", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Damon Darlin", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/07/upshot/07vigop-copy/07vigop-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DAMON DARLIN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "What Do Fruit, Robots and Celebrity Deaths Have in Common?", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/07/upshot/07vigop-copy/07vigop-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "What Do Fruit, Robots and Celebrity Deaths Have in Common?", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/damon_darlin/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-01-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "World Cup 2014 (Soccer)", "published": "2015-01-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "02up-best", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150104145635, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/upshot/upshot-highlights-2014.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/07/upshot/07vigop-copy/07vigop-videoSixteenByNine1050.gif", "type": "article", "description": "What Do Fruit, Robots and Celebrity Deaths Have in Common?", "title": "Upshot Highlights, 2014"}, "pdate": 20150101, "des": "World Cup 2014 (Soccer)", "articleid": 100000003423512, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Upshot Highlights, 2014", "col": "Our Favorite Things", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11f1\"", "article_summary": "PhotoYou may have read the list of the articles that the readers of The Upshot liked the most.\nGregor Aisch:The graphic editor who invented the way for The Upshot reporters to easily make charts turned North Dakota upside down.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyDarcy Eveleigh:Our photo editor had the most fun with historic photos, which is one of the hallmarks of The Upshot.\nThis is the list of Upshot features that the writers, photo editors and graphics editors most liked doing for you:Derek Willis:He enjoyed looking into the small, but mysterious, Virgin Islands Republican Party fund-raising operations.\nSome of her favorite photo essays were Halloween 1964, Black Voter Turnout in 1964, Painkiller Abuse and Terrorism in 1964."}
