Because Medicaid costs are shared by the federal and state governments, net savings to the state would be $56 million.\n\nOther, more targeted cuts would reduce provider reimbursements by a total of $9 million, with state savings of $3 million.\n\nHigher patient copays would generate $8 million in savings, of which $3 million would accrue to the state.\n\nA proposed reduction in mental health services would generate $54 million in savings by limiting outpatient rehabilitation provided to adults. The state share of the savings would be $20 million.\n\nThe remainder of the cuts would restrict eligibility for specific services. For example, reducing dental benefits for pregnant women would lower total outlays by $4 million and save the state $1.5 million. Restricting the number of eyeglasses provided to children would save $347,055, netting the state $129,347.\n\nHealth Care Authority spokeswoman Jo Kilgore said reductions are necessary to enable her agency to maintain existing programs with the funds available to it.\n\nKilgore said the agency would have needed about $104 million in additional state funding to offset a $50 million reduction in federal matching funds, $40 million in added expenses caused by a growing caseload and a $14 million reduction in earmarked tobacco-tax revenue.\n\nThe federal match is being cut because Oklahoma\u2019s economy is doing better than those of other states. The formula-based reduction has nothing to do with Oklahoma\u2019s rejection of the Obama administration\u2019s proposed Medicaid expansion, Kilgore said.\n\nThe budget approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Mary Fallin last month provided the agency with essentially flat funding for 2015.\n\n\u201cIt basically is what it is,\u201d Kilgore said. \u201cIt\u2019s our need versus what our appropriation was, and trying to balance those two.\u201d\n\nOklahoma\u2019s total Medicaid spending last year was $4 billion, of which $907 million was provided by the state.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "The Oklahoma Health Care Authority will consider $252 million in Medicaid cutbacks at its board meeting on Thursday, including new limits on patient", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kgou.org/post/oklahoma-health-authority-weighs-252-million-medicaid-cuts", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kgou/files/styles/medium/public/201403/stethoscope.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Oklahoma Health Care Authority will consider $252 million in Medicaid cutbacks at its board meeting on Thursday, including new limits on patient", "title": "Oklahoma Health Authority Weighs $252 Million In Medicaid Cuts"}, "story_id": 325162710, "twitter": {"site": "@kgounews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@OklahomaWatch"}, "author": "Oklahoma Watch, Warren Vieth", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Oklahoma Health Authority Weighs $252 Million In Medicaid Cuts"}, "nid": 31959, "datePublished": "2014-06-24", "keywords": "SoonerCare, Medicaid", "wordCount": 594, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a6f\"", "article_summary": "Other, more targeted cuts would reduce provider reimbursements by a total of $9 million, with state savings of $3 million.\nA proposed reduction in mental health services would generate $54 million in savings by limiting outpatient rehabilitation provided to adults.\nBecause Medicaid costs are shared by the federal and state governments, net savings to the state would be $56 million.\nHigher patient copays would generate $8 million in savings, of which $3 million would accrue to the state.\nFor example, reducing dental benefits for pregnant women would lower total outlays by $4 million and save the state $1.5 million."}
