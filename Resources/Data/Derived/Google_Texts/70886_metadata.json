(Photo: Alyssa Bloechl/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo\n\nIn 10 years, the Community Clinic of Door County served thousands of people who had little or no insurance. The doors of the clinic closed at the end of March, but the mission of serving people in need will continue to live on through the goodwill of a donation.\n\nAs the staff at the Community Clinic helped their patients transition to new providers and services in the last months of operation, pieces of a puzzle were moving together to give the clinic one last opportunity to help others.\n\nThrough the grace of serendipity and perhaps a higher power, all of the Community Clinic\u2019s medical equipment, exam tables, microscopes, unused needles, family planning items, scales and much more were donated to City on a Hill in Milwaukee for its new free clinic space.\n\nExecutive Director of City on a Hill Diane De La Santos said the facility provides health and educational services in a holistic manner to impoverished people living in the surrounding communities, addressing the many symptoms of poverty in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cWe serve holistically because if we were only to meet one need of a person in poverty, we have not helped that person,\u201d De La Santos said. \u201cThere are too many obstacles to pull yourself out.\u201d\n\nCity on a Hill works to end poverty first by giving children and young adults the educational, emotional, family, faith and life skills they need to succeed, with the goal of breaking the generational poverty cycle. Second, the nonprofit provides a free clinic, education on diabetes, providing food and medication needs and more. Additionally, they provide poverty education to their communities so people can become part of the change.\n\nThe free health clinic has been open since 2001 at City on a Hill and has been growing each year since. In 2015 alone, more than 1,500 people were served. The clinic is run primarily by volunteers, including medical professionals, and one staffed nurse practitioner.\n\nVolunteers move furniture out of the Community Clinic on March 19.

The outreach events offer doctor visits, educational programming, hot food and counselors.\n\nAs more people used the clinic, it became obvious City on a Hill needed more space. Last year they received two grants from Aurora Healthcare, one of which was to renovate an old clinic on their property that could not be used because of code violations.\n\nWith barely enough money to renovate, De La Santos was at a loss for where to get supplies to operate. The faith-based organization turned to God, who has been providing them with what they needed for years.\n\nJane Herlitz, former director at the Community Clinic, said she had made a connection with De La Santos, through a member of her church, Sturgeon Bay Community Church. Learning that City on a Hill had earned the grant but did not have funds for supplies, Herlitz knew what the Community Clinic could do to help.\n\nOn March 19, a large truck and trailer rolled up to the Community Clinic and a loading team from the church loaded the materials destined for Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cThe services we offered to this community were important,\u201d Herlitz said. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful the supplies are not going to waste and we can end our services on a positive note.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got everything we needed,\u201d De La Santos said. \u201cIt was wonderful.\u201d\n\nThe renovated clinic will have many benefits. The current clinic space has one exam room, and the new space will have five. Additionally, patients will have access to more privacy, a pharmacy, waiting room, children\u2019s area, offices for the doctors and more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely grateful to the team at the Community Clinic of Door County and Sturgeon Bay Community Church for making it possible to equip a clinic hundreds of miles away,\u201d De La Santos said. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to God for making the connection we could have never made on our own.\u201d\n\nHistory\n\nBefore becoming City on a Hill, back in the late 1800s, an old farmhouse in the same location was used as a hospital run by Christians who worked to care for the medical needs of the poor. After years of growth and funding came in, Lutheran Hospital was running as a charitable organization. Eventually, it merged with another hospital to become Good Samaritan Medical Center.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Aurora Health Care, which owned the hospital at the time, took the services of the hospital and merged them at a different location in Milwaukee, leaving large buildings empty. In 2000, the local Assemblies of God ministry and the national Convoy of Hope group hosted a community event offering a job fair, meals, health services and more, all in the vacant hospital\u2019s parking lot. The nearly 8,000 attendees showed Aurora there was potential for further work on this site.\n\nWorking with Urban Ministry Center, four buildings were transferred to create a nonprofit, now known as City on a Hill. The hill is now back to the original mission, serving the poor in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Community Clinic, like City on a Hill, served people in need in Door County who could not afford to receive care without insurance. It was not classified as a free clinic, but service fees were offered based on the ability to pay.\n\nAccording to one of the Community Clinic\u2019s founders, integrative health practitioner Jo Guenzel, the clinic it was formed as a spin-off of the former Open Door Community Health Center, which was housed in Door County Memorial Hospital. When the Community Clinic opened in 2000, Aurora Health Care was moving into Sturgeon Bay and donated a lot of equipment to the Clinic.\n\nAbout a year ago, the board of directors made the decision to close the Clinic. Herlitz said they recognized that with the Affordable Care Act in place, their clientele was significantly decreasing. One of the Clinic\u2019s board members, Jeanne Rable, was certified to assist people enroll in the marketplace, and did so with many of the Clinic's clients.\n\n\u201cWe did not want to enable the process, we wanted more self-sufficient people in our community,\u201d Herlitz said. \u201cAnd it allowed our clients more well-rounded medical care.\u201d\n\nStory on the Open Door Community Health Center that appeared in the Advocate in 2000. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nGuenzel said she thinks the story is beautiful because there were so many amazing and supportive people and organizations who cared about the clinic\u2019s success, and now they get to see their hard work live on in another similar organization.\n\n\u201cThe closing was emotional, but we closed in the spirit of success,\u201d Guenzel said. \u201cIt closed because of a good thing \u2013 we're now closer to everyone being covered and taken care of medically.\u201d\n\nThe free clinic at City on a Hill is set to open in June. A portion of the supplies from the Community Clinic are also being donated to Coventry Care, a free clinic operated in Sister Bay by Dr. Joan Traver and nurse practitioner Martha Coventry.\n\n-abloechl@doorcountyadvocate.com, Twitter @alyssabloechl, Facebook Alyssa Bloechl\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1TFvOXD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In 10 years, the Community Clinic of Door County served about five thousand people who had little to no insurance and living in poverty.", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "In 10 years, the Community Clinic of Door County served about five thousand people who had little to no insurance and living in poverty.", "title": "Clinic supplies donated to help City on a Hill", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/door-co/news/2016/05/23/clinic-supplies-donated-help-city-hill/84553500/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 10 years, the Community Clinic of Door County served about five thousand people who had little to no insurance and living in poverty.", "title": "Clinic supplies donated to help City on a Hill", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/20/WIGroup/GreenBay/635993534197676548-DCA-0521-Comm-Clinic.JPG", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/AlyssaBloechl/?ref=hl"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Door County Community Clinic, City on a Hill, supply donation, poverty"}, "article_summary": "When the Community Clinic opened in 2000, Aurora Health Care was moving into Sturgeon Bay and donated a lot of equipment to the Clinic.\nLearning that City on a Hill had earned the grant but did not have funds for supplies, Herlitz knew what the Community Clinic could do to help.\nThe free health clinic has been open since 2001 at City on a Hill and has been growing each year since.\nBuy Photo The closed Door County Community Clinic's supplies have been donated to Milwaukee's City on a Hill .\nA portion of the supplies from the Community Clinic are also being donated to Coventry Care, a free clinic operated in Sister Bay by Dr. Joan Traver and nurse practitioner Martha Coventry."}
