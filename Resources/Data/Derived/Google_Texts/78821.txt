Even five years after its enactment, the Affordable Care Act continues to draw strong opposition. And while its still the early days for the ACA, so far theres no evidence of any major disruption to the existing employer-sponsored insurance market, said Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist and proponent of the law, during a recent event hosted by Sun Life Financial and Bloomberg.

He attributed widespread skepticism about the law to politics, saying theres a continued enormous lack of understanding about what the law does that I think is a direct result of the large level of [political] opposition to it.
