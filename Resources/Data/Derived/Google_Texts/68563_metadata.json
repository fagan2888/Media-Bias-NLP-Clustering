Her father, Moon Landrieu, served eight years as mayor of New Orleans before he became Jimmy Carter\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development. Her younger brother Mitch was reelected as mayor of the Big Easy in February.\n\nLandrieu is now facing a reelection battle of her own, and it will be the most difficult of her career. For Republicans, recapturing a majority in the U.S. Senate may hinge on her defeat.\n\nThe race is shaping up to be bellwether of sorts for the GOP\u2019s chances to take over the Senate. The latest polls show her running neck and neck with her most formidable Republican opponent, Bill Cassidy, a 56-year-old congressman, but it won\u2019t be an easy fight.\n\nThe nonprofit group Americans for Prosperity, which has spent nearly $30 million already this election cycle, is running ads against Landrieu in every media market in the state. But a source close to the group says the Louisiana race ranks just \u201csixth or seventh\u201d on the group\u2019s target list, behind races in West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Alaska (in the first three of those states, the Republican is running for an open seat).\n\nAs it happens, the GOP needs to pick up six seats to recapture a Senate majority \u2014 a win in Louisiana could put the GOP over the top.\n\nLandrieu, 58, has held public office for virtually her entire adulthood. She was elected to the Louisiana state house at the age of 25 and has fought to stay in public life: After losing a gubernatorial bid in 1995, she put her defunct campaign infrastructure to good use, turning it around to run a successful campaign for the state\u2019s open Senate seat the following year.\n\nIn 1996, she had the help of President Clinton, who barnstormed the South on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates. She was also aided by Louisiana\u2019s jungle-primary system, in which candidates of both parties appear on a single ballot. As six conservative Republicans duked it out among themselves, Landrieu gained ground. In the runoff, she beat Republican state representative Woody Jenkins by three tenths of a percentage point.\n\nRepublicans saw their next chance to take the seat in 2008 (in 2002, Republicans ran Suzie Terrell, a former elections commissioner with little name recognition). Much had changed in the years since Landrieu was first elected to federal office: George W. Bush carried the once-Democratic state in two close national elections, and Bobby Jindal was elected governor, while Democratic voter registration continually declined. Democrats accounted for 52 percent of Louisiana voters in 2008, down from 60 in 2000 (that number stands at 48 percent today, still higher than the registered Republican tally, 28 percent). Hurricane Katrina, too, had displaced more than 90,000 mostly African-American Democrats from New Orleans.\n\nBut Landrieu\u2019s challenger, John Kennedy, wasn\u2019t the ideal candidate for the increasingly red state: He had run for an open seat Senate seat in 2004 as a Democrat, and David Vitter emerged victorious in that election. As state treasurer in 2004, he had endorsed John Kerry, but he ran against Landrieu as a supporter of the Bush agenda. Landrieu was able to repurpose the opposition research Republicans had produced on Kennedy in his state-treasurer race, and one of her attack ads closed, \u201cJohn Kennedy, one confused politician.\u201d And, of course, Landrieu had Candidate Obama, in a state with a substantial share of black voters, to buoy Democratic and African-American turnout.\n\nOver the past six years, Louisiana has become even more favorable to Republicans. In fact, Landrieu remains the only Democrat elected to statewide office. Since 2011, when Republicans gained control of the state senate for the first time since Reconstruction, the GOP has controlled every major statewide office. Mitt Romney carried the state by 17 points.\n\nLandrieu has maintained her position in part by balancing the demands of the national Democratic party with the views of her constituents. She supports the Keystone pipeline and opposes cap-and-trade legislation. She recently became chairman of the Senate energy committee, where she can, and surely will, push for offshore oil and gas development, a move backed by the many companies that do business off Louisiana\u2019s Gulf Coast.\n\nIn 2014, though, neither Bill Clinton nor Barack Obama is boosting Democratic fortunes at the top of the ticket, and right now, the Democrats\u2019 troubled health-care bill appears likely to overshadow all other issues.\n\nMany endangered Democrats have pled ignorance and turned quickly on the Affordable Care Act this year, but Landrieu has done a more delicate dance. She proposed a bill to allow people to keep health-insurance plans canceled due to the law, but she\u2019s refused to back down from the president\u2019s promise that Americans \u201ccan keep their plans.\u201d She told The Weekly Standard in October, \u201cWe said when we passed that, \u2018If you had insurance that was good insurance that you wanted to keep it, you could keep it.\u2019\u201d She also said in August that traveling to Europe made her ashamed of her own country because \u201ctheir workers all manage to have health insurance that can\u2019t be taken away.\u201d\n\nEnter Bill Cassidy, M.D., the Republican congressman determined to make Landrieu pay for her support for the law. A physician who has spent years treating the indigent in Louisiana\u2019s charity-hospital system, Cassidy says he ran for Congress in 2008 so that he could play a role in the national health-care debate.\n\nOver lunch at George\u2019s, a dimly lit dive that sits under an I-10 overpass in Baton Rouge, Cassidy rails against Louisiana\u2019s state hospital system, which he believes augurs poorly for the fate of Obamacare. By way of illustration, he tells me about a coworker, a Ugandan doctor who, after navigating his truck through the potholes that litter the drive to the entrance of the old Earl K. Long Medical Center, which closed last year, exclaimed, \u201cI thought I was in Kampala!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the bureaucrat has the power, the patient\u2019s service suffers,\u201d Cassidy says. President Obama and the Democrats who crafted the Affordable Care Act \u201cnever had my formative experience.\u201d\n\nThat experience includes nearly three decades working with poor and uninsured patients, who constitute an above-average share of Louisiana\u2019s population. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, he mobilized a group of volunteers to convert an abandoned Kmart into a field hospital where he and others treated storm victims.\n\nCassidy specializes in liver disease and, when he is back home in Baton Rouge, oversees a hepatitis clinic, treating patients and working with medical students and residents. \u201cMy real love is liver disease,\u201d he says at one point during rounds at his clinic, a statement that may never have been uttered by a congressman.\n\nHe is tall and square-jawed, with a serious mien, but he is quick-witted and almost joyous with patients and with his students. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good man, you\u2019re making some good changes in your life,\u201d he tells a 41-year-old African-American man who has come to the clinic suffering from both Hepatitis C and HIV. Inspecting his arms, Cassidy asks, \u201cDid you used to donate blood or shoot drugs?\u201d Then, surveying extensive burn marks across the man\u2019s chest, he inquires about them and learns the patient was scorched in a fire as a three-year-old. Cassidy puts his large hand on the patient\u2019s shoulder and exhales. \u201cOh, man, I just feel sorry for you when you were three years old, buddy.\u201d Before heading out of the exam room, he stiffens a bit and tells him, \u201cAgain, I\u2019m Dr. Cassidy, and I\u2019m also your congressman. If I can serve you as your congressman, let me know.\u201d\n\nCassidy is not a career politician, and he takes flak from the right for not being conservative enough. In 1988, he supported Michael Dukakis over George H. W. Bush, and in 2002 he donated $500 to Landrieu, something she will surely throw at him in forthcoming debates. (The same year, Cassidy\u2019s wife donated $1,000 to Landrieu\u2019s runoff opponent, Suzie Terrell.) The Senate Conservatives Fund has endorsed Cassidy\u2019s tea-party opponent, Air Force veteran Rob Maness, who has yet to gain ground in public polls.\n\nThe congressman tells me he\u2019s gotten increasingly conservative over the years. \u201cThe facts of life are conservative,\u201d he says.\n\nAnticipating some of these attacks, Cassidy has gone out of his way to buck the party establishment. He lost his role on the GOP whip team earlier this month after opposing House leadership\u2019s stance, and wasn\u2019t shy about broadcasting it. He also resisted House speaker John Boehner\u2019s attempt to put the issue of immigration on the table this year (Landrieu voted for the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration bill last year).\n\nAt this early stage in the campaign, Cassidy seems to be getting traction. The most recent poll by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling has him essentially tied with Landrieu. He is among the top five fundraisers on the Republican side in this election cycle \u2014 indeed, he\u2019s raised nearly as much money so far as Landrieu herself (Landrieu has more cash on hand, though, $5.8 million to Cassidy\u2019s $4.2).\n\nLouisiana\u2019s jungle primary, which goes to a runoff if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, takes place this November 4, general-election day in the rest of the country. If Landrieu and Cassidy finish as the top two, the runoff would be December 6 \u2014 and Cassidy could literally be the candidate who takes back the Senate for the GOP.\n\n\u2014 Eliana Johnson is media editor of National Review Online.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Tue, 2014-02-25 04:00", "sailthru.author": "Eliana Johnson", "description": "Baton Rouge, La. \u2014 Mary Landrieu is Louisiana political royalty, but her reign as the state\u2019s senior senator may come to an end this fall.\n\nLike California\u2019s Jerry Brown, New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo, and Arkansas\u2019s Mark Pryor, Landrieu was born into Democratic politics.

Her father, Moon Landrieu, served eight years as mayor of New Orleans before he became Jimmy Carter\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development. Her younger brother Mitch was reelected as mayor of the Big Easy in February.\n\nLandrieu is now facing a reelection battle of her own, and it will be the most difficult of her career. For Republicans, recapturing a majority in the U.S. Senate may hinge on her defeat.\n\nThe race is shaping up to be bellwether of sorts for the GOP\u2019s chances to take over the Senate. The latest polls show her running neck\u00a0and\u00a0neck with her most formidable Republican opponent, Bill Cassidy, a 56-year-old congressman, but it won\u2019t be an easy fight.\n\nThe nonprofit group Americans for Prosperity, which has spent nearly $30 million already this election cycle, is running ads against Landrieu in every media market in the state. But a source close to the group says the Louisiana race ranks just \u201csixth or seventh\u201d on the group\u2019s target list, behind races in West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Alaska (in the first three of those states, the Republican is running for an open seat).\n\nAs it happens, the GOP needs to pick up six seats to recapture a Senate majority \u2014 a win in Louisiana could put the GOP over the top.\n\nLandrieu, 58, has held public office for virtually her entire adulthood. She was elected to the Louisiana state house at the age of 25 and has fought to stay in public life: After losing a gubernatorial bid in 1995, she put her defunct campaign infrastructure to good use, turning it around to run a successful campaign for the state\u2019s open Senate seat the following year.\n\nIn 1996, she had the help of President Clinton, who barnstormed the South on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates. She was also aided by Louisiana\u2019s jungle-primary system, in which candidates of both parties appear on a single ballot. As six conservative Republicans duked it out among\u00a0themselves, Landrieu gained ground. In the runoff, she beat Republican state representative Woody Jenkins by three tenths of a percentage point.\n\nRepublicans saw their next chance to take the seat in 2008 (in 2002, Republicans ran Suzie Terrell, a former elections commissioner with little name recognition). Much had changed in the years since Landrieu was first elected to federal office: George W. Bush carried the once-Democratic state in two close national elections, and Bobby Jindal was elected governor, while Democratic voter registration continually declined. Democrats accounted for 52 percent of Louisiana voters in 2008, down from 60 in 2000 (that number stands at 48 percent today, still higher than the registered Republican tally, 28 percent). Hurricane Katrina, too, had displaced more than 90,000 mostly African-American Democrats from New Orleans.\n\nBut Landrieu\u2019s challenger, John Kennedy, wasn\u2019t the ideal candidate for the increasingly red state: He had run for an open seat\u00a0Senate seat in 2004 as a Democrat, and David Vitter\u00a0emerged victorious in that election. As state treasurer in 2004, he had endorsed John Kerry, but he ran against Landrieu as a supporter of the Bush agenda. Landrieu was able to repurpose the opposition research Republicans had produced on Kennedy in his state-treasurer\u00a0race, and one of her attack ads closed, \u201cJohn Kennedy, one confused politician.\u201d And, of course, Landrieu had Candidate Obama, in a state with a substantial share of black voters, to buoy Democratic and African-American turnout.\n\nOver the past six years, Louisiana has become even more favorable to Republicans. In fact, Landrieu remains the only Democrat elected to statewide office. Since 2011, when Republicans gained control of the state senate for the first time since Reconstruction, the GOP has controlled every major statewide office. Mitt Romney carried the state by 17 points.\n\n#page#Landrieu has maintained her position in part by balancing the demands of the national Democratic party with the views of her constituents. She supports the Keystone pipeline and opposes cap-and-trade legislation. She recently became chairman of the Senate energy committee, where she can, and surely will, push for offshore oil and gas development, a move backed by the many companies that do business off Louisiana\u2019s Gulf Coast.\n\nIn 2014, though, neither Bill Clinton nor Barack Obama is boosting Democratic fortunes at the top of the ticket, and right now, the Democrats\u2019 troubled\u00a0health-care bill appears likely to overshadow all other issues.\n\nMany endangered Democrats have pled ignorance and turned quickly on the Affordable Care Act this year, but Landrieu has done a more delicate dance. She proposed a bill to allow people to keep health-insurance plans canceled due to the law, but she\u2019s refused to back down from the president\u2019s promise that Americans \u201ccan keep their plans.\u201d She told The Weekly Standard in October, \u201cWe said when we passed that, \u2018If you had insurance that was good insurance that you wanted to keep it, you could keep it.\u2019\u201d She also said in August that traveling to Europe made her ashamed of her own country because \u201ctheir workers all manage to have health insurance that can\u2019t be taken away.\u201d\n\nEnter Bill Cassidy, M.D., the Republican congressman determined to make Landrieu pay for her support for the law. A physician who has spent years treating the indigent in Louisiana\u2019s charity-hospital system, Cassidy says he ran for Congress in 2008 so that he could play a role in the national health-care debate.\n\nOver lunch at George\u2019s, a dimly lit dive that sits under an I-10 overpass in Baton Rouge, Cassidy rails against Louisiana\u2019s state hospital system, which he believes augurs poorly for the fate of Obamacare. By way of illustration, he tells me about a coworker, a Ugandan doctor who, after navigating his truck through the potholes that litter the drive to the entrance of the old Earl K. Long Medical Center, which closed last year, exclaimed, \u201cI thought I was in Kampala!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen the bureaucrat has the power, the patient\u2019s service suffers,\u201d Cassidy says. President Obama and the Democrats who crafted the Affordable Care Act \u201cnever had my formative experience.\u201d\n\nThat experience includes nearly three decades working with poor and uninsured patients, who constitute an above-average share of Louisiana\u2019s population. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, he mobilized a group of volunteers to convert an abandoned Kmart into a field hospital where he and others treated storm victims.\n\n#page#Cassidy specializes in liver disease and, when he is back home in Baton Rouge, oversees a hepatitis clinic, treating patients and working with medical students and residents. \u201cMy real love is liver disease,\u201d he says at one point during rounds at his clinic, a statement that may never have been uttered by a congressman.\n\nHe is tall and square-jawed, with a serious mien, but he is quick-witted and almost joyous with patients and with his students. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good man, you\u2019re making some good changes in your life,\u201d he tells a 41-year-old African-American man who has come to the clinic suffering from both Hepatitis C and HIV. Inspecting his arms, Cassidy asks, \u201cDid you used to donate blood or shoot drugs?\u201d Then, surveying extensive burn marks across the man\u2019s chest, he inquires about them and learns the patient was scorched in a fire as a three-year-old. Cassidy puts his\u00a0large hand on the patient\u2019s shoulder and exhales. \u201cOh, man, I just feel sorry for you when you were three\u00a0years old, buddy.\u201d Before heading out of the exam room, he stiffens a bit and tells him, \u201cAgain, I\u2019m Dr. Cassidy, and I\u2019m also your congressman. If I can serve you as your congressman, let me know.\u201d\n\nCassidy is not a career politician, and he takes flak from the right for not being conservative enough. In 1988, he supported Michael Dukakis over George H. W. Bush, and in 2002\u00a0he donated $500 to Landrieu, something she will surely throw at him in forthcoming debates. (The same year, Cassidy\u2019s wife donated $1,000 to Landrieu\u2019s\u00a0runoff\u00a0opponent, Suzie Terrell.) The Senate Conservatives Fund has endorsed Cassidy\u2019s tea-party opponent, Air Force veteran Rob Maness, who has yet to gain ground in public polls.\n\nThe congressman tells me he\u2019s gotten increasingly conservative over the years. \u201cThe facts of life are conservative,\u201d he says.\n\nAnticipating some of these attacks, Cassidy has gone out of his way to buck the party establishment. He lost his role on the GOP whip team earlier this month after opposing House leadership\u2019s stance, and wasn\u2019t shy about broadcasting it. He also resisted House speaker John Boehner\u2019s attempt to put the issue of immigration on the table this year (Landrieu voted for the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration bill last year).\n\nAt this early stage in the campaign, Cassidy seems to be getting traction.\u00a0The most recent poll by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling has him essentially\u00a0tied\u00a0with Landrieu. He is among the top five fundraisers on the Republican side in this election cycle \u2014 indeed, he\u2019s raised nearly as much money so far as Landrieu herself (Landrieu has more cash on hand, though, $5.8 million to Cassidy\u2019s $4.2).\n\nLouisiana\u2019s jungle primary, which goes to a runoff if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, takes place this November 4, general-election day in the rest of the country. If Landrieu and Cassidy finish as the top two, the runoff would be December 6 \u2014 and Cassidy could literally be the candidate who takes back the Senate for the GOP.\n\n\u2014 Eliana Johnson is media editor of National Review Online.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill Cassidy: The End of the Landrieu Line?, by Eliana Johnson, National Review"}, "tweettext": "Bill Cassidy: The End of the Landrieu Line?", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Bill Cassidy: The End of the Landrieu Line?", "keywords": "Eliana Johnson", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Bill Cassidy: The End of the Landrieu Line?, Eliana Johnson, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Eliana Johnson, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedf2\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Eliana Johnson is media editor of National Review Online.\nIn the runoff, she beat Republican state representative Woody Jenkins by three tenths of a percentage point.\nLandrieu has maintained her position in part by balancing the demands of the national Democratic party with the views of her constituents.\nThe latest polls show her running neck and neck with her most formidable Republican opponent, Bill Cassidy, a 56-year-old congressman, but it won\u2019t be an easy fight.\nSince 2011, when Republicans gained control of the state senate for the first time since Reconstruction, the GOP has controlled every major statewide office."}
