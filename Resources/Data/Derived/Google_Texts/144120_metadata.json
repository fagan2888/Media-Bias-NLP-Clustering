The full report is available at coloradohealthinstitute.org.\n\nWith an estimated $38 billion annual budget, ColoradoCare would rank \u201cahead of well-known companies such as American Express,\u201d Nike and McDonald\u2019s. It would be financed by a combination of new taxes \u2014 a 3.33 percent payroll deduction for employees and a 6.67 percent payroll tax for employers \u2014 as well as federal and state money that currently pays for health coverage, the report stated.\n\nWhile the full report may clear up some questions on paper, politicians, health care providers and Colorado residents remain divided or confused on how the measure \u2014 which would replace the Affordable Care Act in the state, terminating its mandates and subsidies \u2014 would work on the ground.\n\nAn administrator with Telluride Medical Center said it\u2019s unclear how universal health care would affect the organization. Workers at Tri-County Health also said it\u2019s not certain what the system would look like for their organization if implemented.\n\n\u201cOur role might increase because everyone would need help getting on ColoradoCare \u2026 or perhaps it might not be needed at all,\u201d said Erich Lange, a community engagement specialist with Tri-County Health who works in enrollment services in Telluride and the West End.\n\nHe added that any program that reduces the complexities of applying for health insurance would be beneficial.\n\nLocally, some politicians, including San Miguel County Commissioner Joan May, have expressed support and contributed to the cause by helping to gather the signatures needed to put the measure to a vote.\n\n\u201cThe big thing for our county is that healthcare is very expensive here because of the distance for major providers and the cost for providing healthcare. Even with Obamacare, health insurance is very expensive in rural areas. I think that\u2019s why we in those rural areas are even more invested in getting affordable care, which I think (Amendment 69) will provide,\u201d May said in an earlier interview.\n\nBut Club 20 \u2014 one group that represents and advocates for Western Slope communities \u2014 has voiced opposition to the amendment, saying it will force the county\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest\u201d health care providers out of state.\n\nBoth May and Brian Ahern, the alternate voting member for San Miguel County on the Club 20 board of directors, are Democrats.\n\nOpinions don\u2019t appear to fall cleanly along party lines at the state level, either: Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, opposes the amendment, along with State Treasurer Walker Stapleton. High-profile backers include Sen. Irene Aguilar, D-Denver.\n\nA spokeswoman for Hickenlooper did not reply to The Planet\u2019s emailed requests for comment Tuesday, and the governor\u2019s web site did not contain a statement on the reasons behind his opposition.\n\nRead all of The Daily Planet\u2019s 2016 election coverage at\n\nbit.ly/tridevotes2016.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Telluride Daily Planet", "description": "If Amendment 69 were to pass this November, it would put into place a taxpayer-funded universal health care system for Colorado that proponents say would insure about 83 percent of the state\u2019s population while generating revenues that rival or exceed some of the nation\u2019s most well-known companies, according to a recently released report.", "title": "Estimated ColoradoCare revenues would dwarf those of Nike, McDonald\u2019s", "url": "http://www.telluridenews.com/news/article_db7303c4-0100-11e6-b9e9-5bbebedc2872.html", "image": "http://telluridenews.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TelluridePlanet", "card": "summary"}, "description": "If Amendment 69 were to pass this November, it would put into place a taxpayer-funded universal health care system for Colorado that proponents say would insure about 83 percent of the state\u2019s population while generating revenues that rival or exceed some of the nation\u2019s most well-known companies, according to a recently released report.", "fb": {"app_id": 310347052497473}, "keywords": "news", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "With an estimated $38 billion annual budget, ColoradoCare would rank \u201cahead of well-known companies such as American Express,\u201d Nike and McDonald\u2019s.\nAn administrator with Telluride Medical Center said it\u2019s unclear how universal health care would affect the organization.\nWorkers at Tri-County Health also said it\u2019s not certain what the system would look like for their organization if implemented.\nBut Club 20 \u2014 one group that represents and advocates for Western Slope communities \u2014 has voiced opposition to the amendment, saying it will force the county\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest\u201d health care providers out of state.\nBoth May and Brian Ahern, the alternate voting member for San Miguel County on the Club 20 board of directors, are Democrats."}
