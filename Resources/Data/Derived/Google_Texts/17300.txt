Transgender Americans seeking gender reassignment surgeries are finding relief through Obamacare, The Daily Beast reported on Monday.

Federal laws banning health insurance discrimination against transgender people, combined with Obamacare’s ban on denying coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, have paved a path for transgender patients who wish to make the transition from one gender to another.

“The federal anti-discrimination regulations have yet to be written, but California insurance regulators have said that companies must treat transgender patients the same as other patients,” reports The Daily Beast. “For example, if plans cover hormones for post-menopausal women, they must also cover them for transgender women. Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled, lifted its ban on covering sex reassignment surgery earlier this year.”

What gets covered varies from Obamacare policy to policy. But Transgender Law Center program administrator Anand Kalra says, “The law and policy are on a transgender person’s side for the first time.”

Nationally, Obamacare is more unpopular than ever. The latest Kaiser Health poll finds that an all-time low of just 37% of Americans now support President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement.

Over the next ten years, Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion.
