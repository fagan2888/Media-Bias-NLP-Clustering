But the email that went around last week from ride-for-hire app company Uber about its new and exciting partnership with UN Women to \u201cStep it Up for Gender Equality\u201d by hiring 1,000,000 women might have been the most laughable yet.\n\nOr it would be laughable, if the UN didn\u2019t appear to actually have put its stamp on Uber\u2019s latest branding ploy.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cWhy Do We Feel So Ashamed About Sex\u201d\n\nSee, Uber sort of has a woman problem. The company, which created an app by which professional and amateur drivers can sign up to drive around passengers for a fee, is facing complaints by its female customers, that drivers have sexually harassed them\u2014or even, in one lurid case, kidnapped and raped them. An executive with the company had to apologize after making statements at a party about digging up personal dirt on a female journalist. Perhaps Uber has some business reasons to promote itself as a woman-friendly company.\n\nSo Uber will fix its problems by hiring women to drive for it. One million women, if its press release, with a big blinking \u201c1,000,000\u201d at the top, is to be believed. Though Uber doesn\u2019t even have a million drivers yet, and is a little unclear on how it plans to achieve this lofty goal, its release\u2014co-signed by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and UN Women executive director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka\u2014declares that Uber and the UN will \u201cwork together around the world toward a shared vision of equality and women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d and \u201cinvest in long-term programs in local communities where we live and work.\u201d\n\n\u201cHiring\u201d is a bit of a stretch since the company both expects drivers to pass background checks and also counts its drivers as \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d That means that rather than being employees who are eligible for benefits like health care, family leave, and paid vacation, its workers make what they are paid for each individual ride, less Uber\u2019s cut. They are also responsible for providing and maintaining their own cars. The benefit for drivers is that they can turn off the app when they don\u2019t feel like working, allowing them to make their own schedule and perhaps drive part-time while holding down another job or doing other freelance work. The downside is that there is little protection or support for drivers.\n\nA group of California Uber drivers have even filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that they are misclassified\u2014that they fit the legal definition of employees, not independent contractors, and thus are owed compensation for the costs of doing business that they have so far been footing. In addition, the suit [PDF] also claims that Uber prevents the drivers from getting tipped by telling customers gratuity is included and then not turning over to drivers the total tip.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cGrow the Eff Up!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little sharing about this sharing economy. Uber is not a \u201cride-sharing\u201d app; as its press release touting the jobs it will create attests, it is a company that hires employees to do a job. Its major innovation is the creation of an app\u2014which, Mike Konczal at The Nation points out, isn\u2019t actually that hard to build and even easier to maintain once built.\n\nThe thing is, as I\u2019ve written elsewhere, these jobs aren\u2019t new. They\u2019re putting a shiny high-tech futuristic gloss on old practices like piecework\u2014women of a century ago used to assemble garments at home, paid by the piece rather than by the time it took to do the work\u2014and temporary labor. The temp industry in particular, as sociologist Erin Hatton writes in her book The Temp Economy: From Kelly Girls to Permatemps in Postwar America, got its start by exploiting sexist stereotypes of women workers. Temp work, in other words, has always been gendered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ride-for-hire app company has a well-known woman problem.
