But it is travel related,\u201d said Dr Fauci, speaking in a television interview on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that we will have local transmission; in other words, people who get infected in the United States, get bitten by a mosquito, but who have never left the continental United States.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect that that will happen as we get to the more robust mosquito season in the next month or so.\u201d\n\nDr Fauci said that the disease\u2019s arrival was inevitable, so the priority should be in limiting mosquito breeding grounds and installing screens in homes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that those local outbreaks don\u2019t become sustained and don\u2019t become disseminated,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we need to have a very, very forceful preparation right now before that happens.\u201d\n\nZika is transmitted via mosquitos and, it is now known, sexual contact. While most people develop a fever which passes quickly, pregnant women have given birth to babies suffering from severe brain damage. In some cases adults have also become paralysed from the virus.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.Level": 5, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/zika-to-be-transmitted-in-the-us-within-weeks-warns-expert/", "image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/04/25/95399404_Zika-xlarge_trans++eo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpg", "site": "@TelegraphNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Zika 'to be transmitted in the US within weeks,' warns expert"}, "keywords": "zika-virus,vaccines,usa,standard,world-news,health,news", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/2016/05/23", "DCSext.Content_Type": "story", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "DCSext.articleId": "AmCB13YdkRk3", "tmgads.pagetype": "story", "tmgads.section": "news-2016", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/themes/cars/img/favicon/mstile-150x150.png", "tmgads.channel": "news", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/themes/cars/img/favicon/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/themes/cars/img/favicon/mstile-70x70.png", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": 2016, "tmgads.keywords": "zika-virus,vaccines,usa,standard,world-news,health,news", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/themes/cars/img/favicon/mstile-310x310.png", "DCSext.author": "Harriet Alexander", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/themes/cars/img/favicon/mstile-144x144.png", "tmgads.articleid": "AmCB13YdkRk3", "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "og": {"url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/zika-to-be-transmitted-in-the-us-within-weeks-warns-expert/", "site_name": "The Telegraph", "image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/04/25/95399404_Zika-xlarge_trans++eo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Zika 'to be transmitted in the US within weeks,' warns expert"}, "tmgads.businessSegment": "news", "DCSext.Genre": 5, "DCSext.cf": 1, "DCSext.cd": 0, "tmgads.zone": "news.2016.05.23", "DCSext.cn": 0, "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2016-05-23 14:38"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe already have Zika in the United States.\n\u201cWe need to make sure that those local outbreaks don\u2019t become sustained and don\u2019t become disseminated,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe concern is that we will have local transmission; in other words, people who get infected in the United States, get bitten by a mosquito, but who have never left the continental United States.\nWhile most people develop a fever which passes quickly, pregnant women have given birth to babies suffering from severe brain damage.\nBut it is travel related,\u201d said Dr Fauci, speaking in a television interview on Sunday."}
