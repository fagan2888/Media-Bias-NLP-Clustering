An Arvada woman chose to spend her Labor Day showing her appreciation for law enforcement.

An unidentified woman walked into the Lake Arbor police station in Arvada on Monday with a request: she wanted to hug a police officer, according to the Arvada Police Department Facebook page.

The woman was upset about “the recent loss of of so many officers across the country,” the department said.

After requesting to show the police department some affection, Officer Chris Steiner came out to get an embrace.

“While a bit of a reach because of his size, she managed to get ahold of him and hugged him great,” the department’s post said. “Not once but twice!”
