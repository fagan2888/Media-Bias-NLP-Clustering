She did not respond to requests to speak about her political activism.\n\n\"Her experience with public exposure and scrutiny has taught her not to let her guard down,\" said Republican political strategist Bill Miller. \"She's become a very formidable woman.\"\n\nChris and Taya Kyle have become stars of the state's Republican establishment, with Governor Greg Abbott setting up a day to honor the memory of Chris Kyle, who was killed in 2013 by a troubled veteran he was trying to mentor.\n\nTaya Kyle last year endorsed former Governor Rick Perry in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. She now endorses U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nIn the sheriff's race, she may be the difference in the campaign of Bill Waybourn, a former suburban Fort Worth police chief, analysts said.\n\nWaybourn, backed by the conservative Tea Party movement, is challenging Anderson, a fellow Republican, who gained national attention in calling for the apprehension of Couch. The teen, whose lawyer said his wealth distorted his moral compass, fled to Mexico in December apparently to avoid apprehension for violating the probation deal that kept him out of jail for a drunken driving wreck in 2013 that killed four people.\n\nKyle, 41, has not indicated any intention to seek elective office, but analysts said that should not be ruled out.\n\n\"Once someone gets involved and gets their hands wet in politics, it\u2019s hard to get out,\" Miller said.\n\n(Reporting by Marice Richter; Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - The widow of a slain Navy SEAL whose story was turned in", "title": "Wife of 'American Sniper' making waves in Texas Republican politics", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/29/Wife-American-Sniper-making-waves-Texas-Republican-politics", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/texas-kyle_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/29/Wife-American-Sniper-making-waves-Texas-Republican-politics", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/texas-kyle_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - The widow of a slain Navy SEAL whose story was turned in", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - The widow of a slain Navy SEAL whose story was turned into the hit movie \"American Sniper\" has become a prominent figure in Fort Worth Republican politics even though her name does not appear on Tuesday\u2019s primary ballot.\n\"Her experience with public exposure and scrutiny has taught her not to let her guard down,\" said Republican political strategist Bill Miller.\nIn the sheriff's race, she may be the difference in the campaign of Bill Waybourn, a former suburban Fort Worth police chief, analysts said.\n\"Once someone gets involved and gets their hands wet in politics, it\u2019s hard to get out,\" Miller said.\nTaya Kyle last year endorsed former Governor Rick Perry in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination."}
