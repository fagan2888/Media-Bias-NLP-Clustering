Here\u2019s the spot hitting Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina, paid for by her opponent, GOP Rep. Thom Tillis:\n\nPolitico says this is a Web ad, but it\u2019s very likely this is how countless attack ads to come will feature this newly minted GOP falsehood. The ad says:\n\nKay Hagan votes with Barack Obama 96 percent of the time. What will it take to change her mind? How many families will have to lose good health coverage? How many workers will have to lose their jobs? How many people will have to pay for Kay Hagan\u2019s loyalty to Obama?\n\nAs the narrator talks about workers losing their jobs, the ad flashes a padlocked factory on the screen, with the words: \u201cCongressional Budget Office estimates 2 million lost jobs do to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what the CBO estimated, of course. Indeed, even CBO director Douglas Elmendorf directly contested the characterization of jobs being \u201clost\u201d during yesterday\u2019s House hearing, noting that when people decide to ease up on work for good reasons, \u201cwe don\u2019t sympathize. We say congratulations.\u201d Elmendorf even added that those impacted this way could include older people who decide to retire earlier than they otherwise might have, or spouses who choose to reduce work hours to stay home with a new baby.\n\nIt\u2019s worth appreciating the perverse nature of the lie on display here. Because Republicans are absolutely wedded to their \u201cObamacare is a job killer\u201d talking point, the CBO report\u2019s findings are being distorted into proof that the law will inflict job losses on millions of workers who, in this telling, become Obamacare\u2019s helpless victims \u2014 a labor demand argument. In reality, the report actually found it would impact the choices workers receiving the law\u2019s benefits make \u2014 a labor supply argument.\n\nSome conservatives have dealt with the report\u2019s actual findings directly by arguing they prove the case against the law \u2014 that government subsidies reduce the incentive to work. Many of the good wonky writers \u2014 Jonathan Cohn, Brian Beutler, Jonathan Chait, Jared Bernstein \u2014 have already engaged this argument effectively. But that is at least a legitimate debate to have within the context of the CBO\u2019s findings.\n\nHowever, the point is that, for the purposes of political attacks, Republicans don\u2019t want that to be the debate. The argument over the pluses and minuses of expanding health care to those who lack it \u2014 whether it\u2019s good because it creates economic flexibility, or bad because it fosters dependency \u2014 takes the debate on to turf GOP operatives would prefer to avoid. That\u2019s in keeping with the larger story here, which is that Republicans don\u2019t want any debate about the law\u2019s benefits. They have focused relentlessly on supposed victims of Obamacare horror stories about \u201clost\u201d coverage and rising premiums (see \u201cBette in Sokane\u201c), while pretending those benefitting from it simply don\u2019t exist and in some cases explicitly working to prevent their own constituents from joining the ranks of the law\u2019s beneficiaries.\n\nSimilarly, the CBO report must be distorted beyond recognition into fodder for a story only about people being victimized by the law \u2014 by Obamacare-created job losses inflicted on them. The above ad is only the beginning of this, and we\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of it.\n\n* OBAMACARE FOES DUMB DOWN DEBATE: Related to the above: Don\u2019t miss E.J. Dionne\u2019s column pushing back on misrepresentations of the CBO report, in which he details why working less might be a good option for some people, since broadening coverage to create flexibility is one of the law\u2019s goals. Also, Dionne flags a nugget in the report that\u2019s gone oddly overlooked:\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes an economic benefit when some share of the labor force reduces hours or stops working altogether. At a time of elevated unemployment, others will take their place. The CBO was careful to underscore \u2014 the CBO is always careful \u2014 that \u201cif some people seek to work less, other applicants will be readily available to fill those positions and the overall effect on employment will be muted.\u201d\n\nAlso, as noted here yesterday, the CBO director himself confirms that the law will lead to a rise in labor demand, which in this kind of economy will reduce unemployment.\n\n* GOP DEBT CEILING STRATEGY TAKES ANOTHER TURN: The Post has the latest:\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner scrambled to sell a new debt-ceiling solution to his Republican colleagues on Wednesday, encouraging them to demand a restoration of recently cut military benefits in exchange for a one-year extension of the federal government\u2019s borrowing authority\u2026.Boehner\u2019s approach \u2014 moving toward a possible tweak to federal pension funding \u2014 signals a departure from past debt-ceiling debates, in which Republicans have frequently demanded sweeping conservative measures in exchange for an extension. It also underscores Boehner\u2019s desire to avoid a partisan standoff with the White House ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nAt this point, Republicans are not even trying to extort conservative priorities, because they know they need Dem support to avoid another damaging hostage crisis. So why not a clean increase at this point?\n\nMeanwhile, check out James Downie\u2019s excellent look at how the folly of the GOP debt ceiling position actually had Republicans entertaining a hostage demand that would have increased the deficit Republicans care so much about.\n\n* HERE COMES THE GOP ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE: So reports The Hill:\n\nCantor intends to move a repeal-and-replace bill before the midterm elections in November, according to a source familiar with the situation\u2026.A source close to Cantor noted the similarities of the plans and general agreement among members of the party that an alternative should include the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, the creation of high-risk pools for individuals with pre-existing conditions and medical malpractice reform.\n\nThe question then will be: is there any alternative that can actually pass the GOP-controlled House? Until there is, the GOP plan will be, in effect, to go back to the old system.\n\n* OBAMA QUEST FOR FAST TRACK AUTHORITY IN TROUBLE? The Wall Street Journal has a good piece detailing how Obama\u2019s quest for fast track authority is in trouble in Congress, partly because Dem leaders are leery, but also because even Republicans are balking at giving him that authority. Key factoid: while only 27 House Republicans opposed giving George W. Bush this authority in 2002, now some 60 House Republicans might be opposed, because they are \u201creluctant\u201d to grant these powers to you-know-who.\n\nAs WSJ delicately notes, this is the case even though \u201cRepublicans have traditionally backed trade measures.\u201d\n\n* DEMS TO RAMP UP ATTACKS ON KOCH BROTHERS: In Louisiana, Dems are set to hold a press call today to draw attention to the Koch-founded Americans for Prosperity\u2019s agenda, as pushback against AFP\u2019s ad blitz against Senator Mary Landrieu, hitting the group\u2019s opposition to Senate flood insurance reform, a big issue in Louisiana. With Dems growing alarmed about AFP money, expect a more aggressive effort to tie GOP opponents directly to the Kochs \u2014 with a focus on their agenda in states where they\u2019re advertising, and nationally \u2014 in coming weeks.\n\n* THE DEM GAME PLAN FOR 2014: Ashley Parker has a good piece detailing the extensive efforts underway by Dems to ensure good turnout among Dem constituencies in the 2014 Senate races. The challenge is formidable:\n\nThe Democratic Senate campaigns face considerable challenges. The voting rates of core Democratic constituencies \u2014 African Americans, Hispanics, unmarried women, younger voters \u2014 historically drop off considerably in midterm elections\u2026.Moreover, in many of the states, especially those where the Obama campaign had little real presence, they are basically starting from scratch. Young voters, for instance, are highly mobile and often have to be registered again because they have moved in the past two years.\n\nAs noted here the other day, turning out constituencies such as minorities and low income and unmarried women will be pivotal to Dem hopes of holding the Senate, and pocketbook issues will be used to mobilize those constituencies.\n\nWhat else?", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP distortions of the CBO report find their way into a new ad.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "GOP distortions of the CBO report find their way into a new ad.", "title": "Morning Plum: Republicans double down on another Big Lie about Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/02/06/morning-plum-republicans-double-down-on-another-big-lie-about-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/07/Capitol__Fiscal_Cliff_03074-1705_new.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/02/06/morning-plum-republicans-double-down-on-another-big-lie-about-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, Obama, cbo report, cbo report on obamacare, congressional budget office, gop alternative to obamacare, eric cantor,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, Obama, cbo report, cbo report on obamacare, congressional budget office, gop alternative to obamacare, eric cantor,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dee\"", "article_summary": "Key factoid: while only 27 House Republicans opposed giving George W.
