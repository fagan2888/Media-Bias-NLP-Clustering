DailyMail\n\nAn Australian man\u2019s vacation to Bali, Indonesia, has morphed him into something little boys and even some grown adults wish they could be: a real-life Spider-Man. Dylan Thomas, a 21-year-old from Western Australia, awoke to an unusual 2-inch red trail from his naval to his chest, which grew to 2 or 3 inches later, resembling an insect bite, according to doctors at Bali International Medical Centre. A day later, after waking up with painful blisters, a dermatologist gave Thomas an unexpected and unusual diagnosis: A tropical spider had burrowed itself into his appendix scar to his stomach and crawled through his body for three days.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit bigger than the size of a match head. It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days,\u201d Thomas told NT News.\n\nInitially, Thomas was given an antihistamine cream to treat what doctors originally thought was an insect bite. \u201cIt was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,\u201d said the tourist about the red mark. However, it wasn\u2019t until Thomas woke up the next morning that he started feeling the pain of the bite. \u201cThat\u2019s when it became painful, it was a searing burn,\u201d he said.\n\nA visit to the dermatologist confirmed Thomas\u2019s suspicions it wasn\u2019t an insect bite but an eight-legged creature that burrowed its way through a small scar from a recent surgery for appendix removal. According to Thomas, doctors retrieved a tropical spider from his abdomen. Doctors have put the spider in a container to take it away for testing to determine the species of the spider that inhabited the tourist\u2019s body for three days, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nSpider burrows through man's appendix scar and crawls under his skin http://t.co/pbNc9kGcjA pic.twitter.com/DVVTvY5NtC \u2014 Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) October 16, 2014\n\nSkeptics like Christopher Buddle, an associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, have several qualms with Thomas\u2019s unusual account. \u201cI think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: It is not plausible, and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'\u201d Buddle wrote in an email to Snopes.com. He believes the spider moving up the body defies logic and what is known about the biology of spiders. Moreover, like the rest of us, he is skeptical because the spider itself has not been presented.\n\nWhether or not Thomas\u2019s account is true has yet to be determined, but a previous account has found eight-legged creatures have made their way inside the human body for days. A woman referred to only as Ms. Lee, arrived at China's Changsha Central Hospital of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery complaining of an itchy ear hoping doctors could treat her, RedNet News reported. When Dr. Liu Sheng took a look inside her ear, he found a spider living in the woman\u2019s ear canal. Apparently, the spider crawled into her ear canal while she slept and lived inside her for five days.\n\nLike the popular Internet phrase goes, \u201cpics or it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "spider-man, spider bite, insect bite, appendix removal, appendix scar, stomach", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Australian tourist on vacation in Bali discovered a tropical spider lived in his body for three days after burrowing itself into his appendix scar.", "title": "Man Finds Spider Living In His Body...
