But there will be no celebrities flanking them on Capitol Hill, as the stars that helped launch the initiative are now being advised to walk away.\n\nOne well-placed Hollywood agent told FOX411 that while Obama and ObamaCare are separate issues, and that you can support one without the other, public relations teams across the industry are cautioning their clients to now lay off the latter. Even Oprah Winfrey, one of the President\u2019s most influential mouthpieces during his first election, reportedly refused to get on-board and lend a hand.\n\n\u201cHollywood has gone from pushing #getcovered to heading for cover,\u201d Dan Gainor, VP of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center told FOX411. \u201cStars like Lady Gaga and Sarah Silverman pushed their ObamaCare propaganda to more than 67 million fans on social media. But don\u2019t expect them to be honest about the situation.\u201d\n\nGeorgia attorney Patrick Millsaps, who served as chief of staff of Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign and manages several Hollywood names, said celebrities, like most public figures, know where to draw the line.\n\n\u201cThey are starting to realize they too were sold a bill of goods and aren\u2019t going to be accomplices in a continued fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an easy decision for a manager \u2013 you can\u2019t let your client promote a crappy product.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of my Hollywood friends still believe in this guy,\u201d Millsaps added. \u201cBut I think their faith is being tested.\u201d\n\nPublicist Ronn Torossian of 5WPR agreed. \u201cWhen things go wrong, naturally celebrities won\u2019t want to be outspoken. But don\u2019t expect them to be quiet for long,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will stand up again as soon as President Obama asks them to.\u201d\n\nEnter Scarlett Johansson. One of President Obama\u2019s best celebrity friends (she revealed during his campaign that the two were text buddies), Johansson has lent her voice to a Planned Parenthood message that\u2019s played when calls are placed to some of their health centers. \u201cDid you know you may be able to enroll in new, more affordable health insurance plans?\u201d Johansson asks before directing callers to a Planned Parenthood section on the new Affordable Care Act website.\n\nWhether callers can get through to that web address is, obviously, another issue.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1":
