It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get out of this rut that we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAccording to OECD data, U.S. workers average 1789 hours of work per year, above the global average for developed countries. Among those with full-time jobs the average work week is 47 hours, according to polling by Gallup, while for part-time workers the average is about 26 hours per week.\n\nDemocrats immediately attacked, arguing that Bush was callously calling for more to be squeezed out of hard-working Americans. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) released a statement to The Associated Press saying the choice of words was \u201ceasily one of the most out-of-touch comments we\u2019ve heard so far this cycle.\u201d A follow-up tweet punched home the narrative that Bush was suggesting American workers were lazy and needed to work harder:\n\nEnjoying some time away from work? Jeb Bush thinks Americans need to work longer hours: pic.twitter.com/2n8XwwvRcU \u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) July 8, 2015\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor, about 6.5 million Americans are stuck in part-time rather than full-time jobs due to economic conditions. An aide told the AP that Bush\u2019s intent was to highlight how many Americans have been working less than they want to due to President Obama\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cUnder President Obama, we have the lowest workforce participation rate since 1977, and too many Americans are falling behind,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOnly Washington Democrats could be out-of-touch enough to criticize giving more Americans the ability to work, earn a paycheck, and make ends meet.\u201d The average hours worked of part-time workers has fallen sharply from just 15 years ago, something critics claim is partly due to Obamacare classifying a 30-hour job as \u201cfull time.\u201d (RELATED: Obamacare\u2019s Biggest Impacts: Americans Losing Hours, Losing Coverage)\n\nUpdate: A transcript of the event forwarded to The Daily Caller News Foundation by a Bush campaign spokeswoman shows that Bush clarified his comments to New Hampshire reporters Wednesday night. When asked whether working \u201cmore hours\u201d meant more Americans getting full-time work, Bush replied people needed to be \u201cgiven the opportunity to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncomes need to grow,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to grow in an environment where the costs of doing business are so extraordinarily high here\u2026 If anyone is celebrating this anemic recovery, then they are totally out of touch. The simple fact is people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you are going to see people lose hope. And that\u2019s where we are today.\u201d\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
