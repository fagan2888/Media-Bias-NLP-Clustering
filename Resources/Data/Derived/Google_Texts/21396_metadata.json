He shocked even Megyn Kelly when he told her that \u201csome people\u201d want others on welfare and are deliberately holding the economy down in order to keep them on it. Carson couldn\u2019t say \u201cexactly\u201d who these people are but it was pretty clear he meant the Obama administration.\n\nCarson appeared on The Kelly File on May 22 after he \"fired up\" The View, as FoxNews.com put it, over his comments about welfare.\n\n\u201cDo you think that people who are on welfare want to be on welfare?\u201d Kelly asked.\n\nNot only did Carson think so, he saw some kind of conspiracy going on:\n\nI think some do. I think some people have that as a way of life. It\u2019s generational. It\u2019s inter-generational. And after the great progress that we made after the struggles of the civil right (sic) movement, I think perhaps the worst thing that happened is a lot of \u2013 some well-meaning and some not so well-meaning - folks came along and started patronizing these individuals and saying, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t really do anything and you know, we\u2019ll take care of you, you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d In some cases, it was to assuage their guilt. In some cases, they genuinely felt that they couldn\u2019t really help themselves. \u2026We\u2019re going from a can-do society to a \u201cwhat can you do for me?\u201d society. That never leads to the elevation of a society. That always leads to the decline of a society. \u2026I\u2019m happy for people who truly need help to get help. And, like I said before, you know, we have the ability in this nation to get the economy moving. I actually believe that perhaps some of the things that are going on right now - which could be easily remedied - are not being remedied in order to keep the economy depressed. Because there would be no appetite for many of the social programs if people were doing well.\n\nKelly broke in. She asked, obviously incredulous, \u201cWhat, are you thinking President Obama and his colleagues are up there saying, \u2018How can we keep unemployment high? How can we keep the American society down?\u2019\u201d\n\nCarson continued:\n\nI think there may be some people \u2013 I don\u2019t know exactly who they are \u2013 but it seems to me like it would be relatively easy to fix some of this stuff. Everybody agrees. The president has said. The Republicans have said. The Democrats have said that our corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the world needs to be lowered. Have they lowered it? No. Have they done anything about our arcane, just ridiculous taxation system? No. Do they talk about it? Yes.\n\nCarson may be a brilliant surgeon but he sure is a dope in a lot of other arenas. Just two days later, he called the VA scandal \u201ca gift from God\u201d to show us the upcoming evils of ObamaCare. You may recall that last fall, he called ObamaCare \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. ...(I)t is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.\u201d\n\nWatch Carson expound his conspiracy theory below.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "sD17XGdtix62gL1CEGXceWWBkxySYSQqE80kqo/dohc=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/ben_carson_accuses_obama_administration_of_deliberately_depressing_the_economy_to_keep_people_on_social_programs_05262014", "type": "article", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "title": "Ben Carson Accuses Obama Administration Of Deliberately Depressing The Economy \u2013 To Keep People On Social Programs"}, "Title": "Ben Carson Accuses Obama Administration Of Deliberately Depressing The Economy \u2013 To Keep People On Social Programs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaac4\"", "article_summary": "Not only did Carson think so, he saw some kind of conspiracy going on:I think some do.\n\u201cDo you think that people who are on welfare want to be on welfare?\u201d Kelly asked.\nCarson couldn\u2019t say \u201cexactly\u201d who these people are but it was pretty clear he meant the Obama administration.\nIt\u2019s hard to go too far with an Obama conspiracy theory on Fox but Dr. Ben Carson managed to do it on The Kelly File last week.\nCarson appeared on The Kelly File on May 22 after he \"fired up\" The View, as FoxNews.com put it, over his comments about welfare."}
