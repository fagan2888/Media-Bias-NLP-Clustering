All I could think about was graduating from the academy, successfully completing field training, and getting started with my law enforcement adventure.\n\nI wish someone would have said, \u201cHey kid, you need to start planning for retirement,\u201d so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say to all of you. Rookies, veterans, and everyone in-between must plan for the day that they hang up the gun belt.\n\nNo matter how much time you have on the job, there are three things you must think about NOW to plan for retirement.\n\n#1. It\u2019s Never Too Soon to Plan Ahead\n\nEvery police academy should bring in a financial planner to talk to recruits. Many new cops go from college, the military, or lesser paying jobs to a decent salary and then too many businesses want to sell them a car, a house and lots and lots of credit cards.\n\nI wish I\u2019d spent more of my early career learning how to save and invest and less time seeing how many boutiques and gun shops would give me a big line of credit. Fortunately, I dumped the credit cards within a year and had enough sense to listen to some of my more senior co-workers when they urged me to invest in a deferred compensation plan.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cPay yourself first.\u201d If you\u2019re young, start by having a set amount of money taken out of your check every single pay period and invest it. Put that money into something that will penalize you if you take it out too early. Generally speaking, the younger you are, the more risks you can take, but get professional advice.\n\nIf you\u2019re at a midpoint in your career and haven\u2019t done much about retirement beyond your pension, don\u2019t wait any longer! Assess your debt and your savings. Start \u201cfeeding the pig\u201d as those TV commercials say, any amount of savings and investment counts. If you\u2019re toward the end of your career and haven\u2019t saved enough, then begin looking at secondary employment. Is there something you enjoy doing that could earn you enough money to supplement your pension?\n\nRegardless of where you are at in your career, make sure you are familiar with your agency\u2019s pension plan. Pensions used to be a given and they used to be untouchable, but this is no longer the case. Ask retired Detroit cops.\n\nJust like on the street, make sure you have a back up plan.\n\n#2. Figure Out What Retirement Means to You\n\nWhen you\u2019re on your 13th hour of a 12-hour shift, it\u2019s easy to dream about retirement as simply \u201cnot having to go to work.\u201d However, you\u2019ve got to think past those first few weeks of sleeping in.\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent most of your adult life in a profession that requires the passion, commitment and sense of mission that law enforcement does, there\u2019s a good chance that having nothing to fill your time will become tedious, boring or even depressing. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to work, but as Dave Smith writes, you\u2019ve got to make the transition to retirement \u201ca path to a new adventure in your life.\u201d\n\nSome police officers want to retire and travel the country or spend more time with family. Others are hoping to launch a second career or make their \u201coff duty\u201d job or business their primary source of employment. Long before you retire you need to start figuring out what you want your retirement to look like.\n\n#3. Make Health Your Priority\n\nIn the 1970s, the Cooper Institute for Aerobic Research conducted a study that concluded that on average, retired police officers die within five years of retirement. If that\u2019s still true, then I don\u2019t have long to live, but I\u2019m guessing this is no longer true.\n\nPeople \u2014 not just cops \u2014 are living longer every year. But longevity doesn\u2019t always equal quality. Make physical and mental wellness a big part of your retirement plans.\n\nKeep your weight down. Obesity is unhealthy at any age, but as you age, the negative impact increases dramatically. Alcohol and tobacco \u2014 as all things \u2014 should be consumed only in moderation.\n\nExercise regularly, but make sure the fitness program you\u2019re on isn\u2019t unnecessarily beating up your bones and joints. My husband and I both wish we\u2019d stopped distance running at age 40. There\u2019s nothing wrong with running, but with our mutual history of injuries, there were much better ways to stay fit than continuing to pound the pavement, and we\u2019re paying for it now.\n\nYou must be intimately familiar with your retiree health care plan before you \u201cpull the pin\u201d on retirement, especially with the Affordable Care Act taking over our health care system. Cops all over this country are getting unhappy surprises in the mail when it comes to reduced coverage and higher premiums.\n\nPay attention to your mental health as well as your physical well-being. It could be that you have unresolved issues from a critical incident, you\u2019re having a hard time making the transition to retirement, you feel depression settling in, or something else entirely.\n\nDon\u2019t suffer in silence \u2014 reach out for help.\n\nOrganization like Safe Call Now can help both current and retired law enforcement officers seek help confidentially.\n\nI thought I\u2019d work until mandatory retirement. However, because of my busy \u201cside job\u201d and my family priorities I ended up retiring after \u201conly\u201d 29 years on the job. It was a decision I absolutely don\u2019t regret, but I do wish I could go back and tell my 21-year-old rookie self, \u201cHey kid, make sure you start planning for retirement.\u201d\n\nAbout the author Sergeant Betsy Smith has more than 30 years of law enforcement experience, retiring as a patrol supervisor in a large Chicago suburb.
