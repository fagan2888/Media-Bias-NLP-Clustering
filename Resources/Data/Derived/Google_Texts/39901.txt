Bush, 90, was "taken by ambulance to the Houston Methodist Hospital [in Texas] as a precaution," the spokesman said, adding that he would be "held for observation, again as a precaution."

The Republican politician was previously hospitalized during the holiday season in 2012, according to Reuters. At the time, he was being treated for bronchitis, and had to remain in the hospital for seven weeks.
