That's up 4.8 million, or 46%, from December 2013.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act triggered a major overhaul of the health insurance market by guaranteeing people coverage regardless of their medical conditions and providing financial subsidies to lower-income consumers.\n\nThe healthcare law also requires most Americans to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nNearly half of Californians continue to get their health benefits through their employer, but the percentage of California firms offering coverage to workers has been falling in recent years.\n\nFifty-eight percent of California employers offered coverage to their workers last year, compared with 69% in 2010, according to the California HealthCare Foundation.\n\nThe analysis of the individual market published Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation relied on insurers' state regulatory filings as of Dec. 31. The figures don't include the entire open enrollment period, which ended in February.\n\nThe Covered California exchange has about 1.4 million people enrolled. Consumers can also buy policies outside the state marketplace, but there are no federal premium subsidies available outside government-run exchanges.\n\nState officials are reminding people they have until Thursday to qualify for a special enrollment period. Consumers can simply attest that they were unaware of the health law's financial penalties for being uninsured.\n\nMore than 33,000 Californians have cited that reason for enrolling during the extended period since late February, according to the exchange.\n\nConsumers who experience other qualifying events, such as moving or losing job-based insurance, can also sign up during special enrollment. The state's Medi-Cal program is open year-round.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "California's individual health insurance market grows 64% to 2.2 million", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The number of Californians buying individual health insurance soared 64% to nearly 2.2 million as Obamacare took full effect last year, a new report shows.", "title": "California's individual health insurance market grows 64% to 2.2 million", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-california-health-insurance-20150429-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55411556/turbine/la-fi-california-health-insurance-20150429", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, covered california, health insurance", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83415241", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-29", "Description": "The number of Californians buying individual health insurance soared 64% to nearly 2.2 million as Obamacare took full effect last year, a new report shows.
