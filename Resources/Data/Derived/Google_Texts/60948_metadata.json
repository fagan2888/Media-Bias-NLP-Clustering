OK Related Issuers Related Research Announcement: Moody's: Healthcare Quarterly looks at developments in US healthcare in 2015 Global Credit Research - 13 Jan 2015 New York, January 13, 2015 -- High on the list of developments in the US healthcare industry in 2015 will be the continuing unprecedented wave of consolidation, Moody's Investors Service says in its latest edition of Healthcare Quarterly. In the first issue of the year, the rating agency looks at six subsectors of the industry in which mergers and acquisitions will be a key driver of credit quality. Among other topics covered are the Affordable Care Act, pressures on reimbursement and new product launches. \"Branded pharmaceutical companies will continue to be active acquirers in 2015, with large and diverse companies looking to supplement their pipelines with high-potential products developed by smaller firms,\" says Senior Vice President, Michael Levesque. \"We consider this to be credit negative because of the high financial leverage associated with acquisitions and the risks that come with acquired assets, which are often still in the pipeline.\" Moody's also expects consolidation to continue among generic drug makers. \"As operating costs rise and major customers consolidate, scale is becoming increasingly important for small to midsize firms,\" says Vice President -- Senior Credit Officer, Jessica Gladstone. \"Large-scale consolidation will be difficult for the biggest companies due to antitrust concerns, but these players likely will be on the hunt for branded assets in the US or branded generics elsewhere.\" Among companies, Teva and Mylan are expected to be the most active acquirers, she adds. And continuing consolidation among hospitals and hospital systems in 2015 will be credit negative for the acquirers due to integration risks and the increase in leverage where a purchase is financed with debt. Struggling smaller hospitals could however gain from being bought by larger, stronger systems. The larger, for-profit operators HCA, Tenet and Community are likely to continue looking for targets that fill out existing markets or provide opportunities to enter new ones. Hospitals in general will continue to benefit from a reduction in the number of patients without health insurance as the Affordable Care Act continues to gain traction, Moody's says. M&A will also continue among medical device makers, prompted in part by the slew of major transactions announced in 2014. Moody's considers this to be credit negative for companies that incur significant debt to fund their purchases, but credit positive for those that can diversify their product lines and profitability while limiting the amount of incremental debt they take on.
