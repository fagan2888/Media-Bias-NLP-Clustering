That\u2019s not unusual for a college football player, except in his case the state is Nuevo Leon, Mexico.\n\nHe also played one year of college football there before transferring to Colorado as the final recruit in coach Mike MacIntyre\u2019s first CU class in 2013. MacIntyre is glad he did.\n\nGonzalez kicked the game-winning field goal in overtime Saturday night, lifting the Buffs to a 27-24 victory over Colorado State in the Rocky Mountain Showdown.\n\nGonzalez\u2019s parents drove 18 hours from Mexico to see him play in that game and the next two, but he didn\u2019t have time to look for them in the crowd of 66,253 at Sports Authority Field at Mile High after his 32-yard game- winner. He was mobbed by jubilant teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun kicking the game-winner, especially if your family is here,\u201d said Gonzalez, a senior in school but a junior in eligibility. \u201cAll the players were jumping on me.\u201d\n\nBut his heroics raised a question: How much American football is there in Mexico?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of universities in Mexico that play American football,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of high schools too. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard that question.\u201d\n\nGonzalez started out as a soccer player but quit when he was 12. He developed an interest in American football and went out for a club team. \u201cI just didn\u2019t like soccer that much,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI mean, I like it, but I wanted to try something different.\u201d\n\nAt first he wanted to be a wide receiver, but then he got a chance to kick.\n\n\u201cA parent of a friend of mine who used to play soccer with me, he told the coach, \u2018You should try this guy as a kicker, he has a really good leg,\u2019 \u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey tried me and my first kick was a kickoff. It\u2019s pretty different than a soccer ball, so it was a really bad hit, but they taught me how to do it, the different technique. I guess I did pretty good. The coach was like, \u2018You\u2019re going to be the kicker-slash-wide receiver.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long before Gonzalez started dreaming about playing Division I football in the United States, so he quit playing receiver to focus on kicking.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen these guys, they\u2019re really fast, really athletic guys,\u201d said Gonzalez, 6-foot and 215 pounds. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I have a good chance being a wide receiver, because I\u2019m not super tall and super fast.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to specialize in kicking,\u2019 and, hey, I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nGonzalez played one year of college football at Monterrey Tech in Mexico, but by then he was attending kicking camps in the U.S. Colorado special-teams coordinator Toby Neinas heard about him, liked what he saw on video and flew to Mexico to see him kick in person. That clinched it for Neinas, and CU offered Gonzalez a spot.\n\nAs a transfer in 2013, Gonzalez had to sit out a year. Last year he kicked once, a kickoff in the opener against CSU, but because of lingering effects of a sport hernia he shut it down for the season.\n\nThis year he was 5-for-5 on field goals \u2014 including a 52-yarder in the first quarter Saturday night \u2014 before having one blocked just before halftime. He missed a 48-yarder on the final play of regulation, but MacInyre had faith in him in overtime.\n\n\u201cHe is a phenomenal young man,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cHe gets it, he understands life, he\u2019s so thankful to be here. He was, \u2018I\u2019ll just kick it again,\u2019 and he did. Of course I was nervous, but I knew I would make that.\u201d\n\nCSU got the ball first in overtime. CU\u2019s Tedric Thompson blocked a 27-yard field goal, setting up Gonzalez for the winner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s my first opportunity to kick a game-winner,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt just happened to be I was the last guy to put three points on the scoreboard. I didn\u2019t win the game. The offense, the defense did everything. The offense put me in a great position to make the field goal.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer\n\nEye on \u2026The Colonels\n\nNicholls State at Colorado, 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Folsom Field, Pac-12 Network\n\nFor the record: The Colonels are 0-2 after losing 20-10 to Incarnate Word of San Antonio.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Nicholls State\u2019s defense had one of its better games, holding an opponent to fewer than 30 points and 300 total yards.\n\nWho\u2019s not: Nicholls State\u2019s offense.
