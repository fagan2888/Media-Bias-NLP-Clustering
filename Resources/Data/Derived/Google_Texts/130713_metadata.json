But apparently she forgot to alert President Barack Obama of her advice, resulting in a bit of hypocrisy on the part of the First Family.\n\nThe Presidemt took questions from the White House press corps during an end-of-the-year news conference Friday before the First Family jets off on a 17-day Hawaii vacation. While there was little talk of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 despite the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 announcement surrounding the legality of catastrophic plans \u2014 CNN\u2019s Brianna Keiler did take the time to ask the President what his New Year\u2019s resolution is.\n\n\u201cMy New Year\u2019s resolution is to be nicer to the White House press corps,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou know? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s promise for 2014 is far different from First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s suggested New Years resolution for the rest of America \u2014 to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nApparently the President and First Lady didn\u2019t share talking points.\n\nAppearing on Sirius XM\u2019s \u201cThe Joe Madison Show\u201d on Thursday morning, Michelle Obama encouraged young Americans to get covered under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis act provides a safety net for millions and millions of Americans but we have to take the next step to go check it out, sign up and make sure that we\u2019re covered,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should be our New Year\u2019s resolutions to ourselves. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nNeither President Obama nor White House Press Secretary Jay Carney have said whether or not the First Family has selected plans through the Affordable Care Act, effectively dodging the question each time it is asked.\n\nBut maybe President Obama should take his wife\u2019s advice and have his New Year\u2019s resolution reflect the need for his signature law \u2014 the one that bears his name \u2014 to succeed.\n\nCheck out the President\u2019s exchange below, courtesy of POLITICO.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama had a suggestion for the American people regarding their New Year's resolution.
