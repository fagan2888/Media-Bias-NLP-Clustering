We have become the Regulatory States of America, with our republic operating under a vast regulatory apparatus in Washington that has become the Fourth Branch of Government.\n\nFederal regulators, who are not elected by the people nor are they in any way accountable, hold the power to issue regulations affecting nearly every aspect of our lives. These are regulations, not laws, but they have the force of law and can send a citizen to prison if violated, the same as any law passed by Congress or a state legislature.\n\nIn Mark Levin\u2019s new book, Plunder and Deceit, he notes that in the last decade the executive branch of our federal government has issued 36,877 regulations, about 3,500 per year. Those new regulations cover more than 768,000 pages in the federal registry. That\u2019s nearly 80,000 new pages per year.\n\nHow much paper is that?\n\nIn January 2014, Senator Mike Lee of Utah released a stunning photograph of his display of the 2013 Federal Registry of regulations, three massive stacks of paper equally 80,000 pages. If stacked upright, it would reach to 11 feet.\n\nBy contrast, Congress, our law-making body, has passed just 1,706 laws in that same ten-year period, and it\u2019s under these laws that the regulators freely operate.\n\nOne example of regulatory chaos is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in 2002 under George W. Bush in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom fiascos, which fastened a vast amount of oppressive and costly accounting regulations on private companies, yet, interestingly enough, did not apply those same strict practices on the federal accounting books.\n\nPresident Obama, however, has taken regulations to new heights. Obamacare is a good example of how the regulatory state operates. The Affordable Care Act is a law of some 2,700 pages and 2.8 million words, yet added 11 million words to the U.S. Regulatory Code.\n\nOverall, under Obama, the government has continually added an average of nearly 18,000 regulations per year.\n\nThe President recently unveiled a new Clean Power Plan to get control of the looming threat of global warming, which he has stated is a graver danger than ISIS, Iran, and global terrorism.\n\nThis plan, which calls for a reduction of carbon emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, would destroy the vital coal industry, bankrupt the coal-producing states, and, to use Obama\u2019s own words from his pre-Presidential days, \u201cnecessarily sky-rocket\u201d the average American\u2019s power bill, all in the hopes of lowering the globe\u2019s temperature by 0.03 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.\n\nIt will be implemented, not on the expressed basis of a congressional law, but through the regulatory powers of the EPA. And none of it will have authority from the Constitution.\n\nSuch massive regulations, more so than anything else, are choking the life out of business and grinding down our economy.\n\nThe Republican Congress should stop the new job-killing, economy-destroying Clean Power Plan, while repealing Obamacare and Sarbanes-Oxley without delay.\n\nFurthermore, it should take control of the regulatory state emanating from the executive branch and institute much-needed reform, which should encompass at least three actions:\n\n(1) Implement an immediate regulatory moratorium, or \u201ccooling off period,\u201d so that Congress can gain control of the out-of-control regulatory state.\n\n(2) All existing regulations already on the books must be reviewed and approved by Congress during the moratorium period.\n\n(3) No future regulations shall go into effect without the approval of Congress.\n\nThese reforms of the regulatory code, as well as a similar overhaul of the tax code, will provide major relief to American businesses of all sizes and provide a genuine boost to the economy.\n\nRevolutionary Americans in 1776 used the slogan \u201cNo Taxation Without Representation.\u201d To tax a free man without his having consented to it through his representative was seen as tyrannical. We must view federal regulations through the same lens and demand that members of Congress do what they were elected to do \u2013 represent the people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal regulators, not elected by the people hold the power to issue regulation affecting nearly every aspect of our lives.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Federal regulators, not elected by the people hold the power to issue regulation affecting nearly every aspect of our lives.", "title": "No Regulation Without Representation - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/tea-party-musket-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/11/no-regulation-without-representation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Federal regulators, not elected by the people hold the power to issue regulation affecting nearly every aspect of our lives.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/tea-party-musket-AP.jpg", "title": "No Regulation Without Representation - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,regulation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-09-11T12:31:53-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "It will be implemented, not on the expressed basis of a congressional law, but through the regulatory powers of the EPA.\nWe must view federal regulations through the same lens and demand that members of Congress do what they were elected to do \u2013 represent the people.\nRevolutionary Americans in 1776 used the slogan \u201cNo Taxation Without Representation.\u201d To tax a free man without his having consented to it through his representative was seen as tyrannical.\nThe Republican Congress should stop the new job-killing, economy-destroying Clean Power Plan, while repealing Obamacare and Sarbanes-Oxley without delay.\n(2) All existing regulations already on the books must be reviewed and approved by Congress during the moratorium period."}
