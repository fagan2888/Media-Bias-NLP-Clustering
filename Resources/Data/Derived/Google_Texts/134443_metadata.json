Aspen Public Radio\u2019s Marci Krivonen reports.\n\nMoving from paper medical records to an electronic system can take a toll on hospitals. It requires lots of staff time and potentially a high price tag. NPR reports many cash-strapped small-town hospitals are merging with larger health facilities in order to implement the change.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case at Aspen Valley Hospital.\n\n\"In the case of Aspen Valley Hospital, we\u2019re much busier than your normal small, rural hospital. Our revenues are probably five or six times bigger than most critical access hospitals,\" says Terry Collins.\n\nHe's Chief Financial Officer at Aspen Valley Hospital. Phase one of moving from paper to electronic records will cost the hospital $1.4 million up-front but, over time, it will save the hospital money. Collins says it\u2019s well worth it.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to have the money to do it, but that\u2019s not the primary consideration. The primary consideration is how do we deliver the best quality health care that we can for our patients and implementing an electronic health record is definitely going to do that.\"\n\nAlready, about 40 doctors at the hospital are using an electronic system to collect data on patients, share them with other health care providers and to measure the quality of health care.\n\nUp next will be the emergency department will make the switch. Aftab Shams is spending much of his time on this. He\u2019s the interim director of I.T. at the hospital.\n\n\"It\u2019ll transform the emergency department, totally. So, instead of picking up a sheet of paper when someone comes in and you triage the patient on a sheet of paper, it\u2019ll be electronic. The physicians and clinicians may be using a mobile device,\" he says.\n\nRight now, doctors read a clipboard that lists where patients are and which rooms are open. It\u2019s a system that can lead to a lack of coordination when the E.R. gets busy. When the digital switch happens, a monitor will replace the clipboard.\n\n\"You\u2019re not going to change how the patient gets treated. We\u2019re going to make sure that the information is available out there to the providers in a quicker fashion, and in such a way so that they can treat the patient better, faster and more accurately, so that the patient gets better faster and more accurately,\" says Shams.\n\nBut that efficiency may not be seen right away. And, the costs to maintain security and keep up such a system will be high, especially for rural hospitals. Brock Slabach is Senior Vice President at the National Rural Health Association.\n\n\"It\u2019s not uncommon for maintenance costs directly to the vendors to be anywhere from $5000, $10,000, $15,000 per month. That\u2019s a significant operational expense for many rural hospitals to afford.\"\n\nAlready, more than 80 percent of the country\u2019s 2000 rural hospitals have started switching to electronic files. One of those is Delta County Memorial Hospital in Delta. CEO Jason Cleckler says their switch to electronic files cost $4 million dollars and he\u2019s not sure yet whether it was worthwhile.\n\n\"I will say that it\u2019s been very difficult for this hospital and, I would venture to say, for other hospitals too, mainly because of the expense,\" Cleckler says.\n\nThe hospital made the switch two years ago to escape penalties handed down from the federal government. Although it\u2019s been difficult, Cleckler says he\u2019s hopeful the sharing of patient information with other medical facilities will eventually prove beneficial.\n\n\"I think it will eventually cut down on some medical errors, some of the clerical mistakes, or misreading somebody\u2019s handwriting, that kind of thing. We haven\u2019t fully realized those things quite yet.\"\n\nAspen\u2019s system isn\u2019t as far along. The local emergency department will be outfitted with its digital system by the end of the year.", "article_metadata": {"category": "APR Local News", "description": "While hospitals across the country work to transition from old-fashioned paper records to electronic data, some doctors in Aspen have already \u201cgone", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://aspenpublicradio.org/post/aspen-valley-hospital-brings-electronic-medical-records", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kajx/files/styles/medium/public/201405/photo_%281%29.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "While hospitals across the country work to transition from old-fashioned paper records to electronic data, some doctors in Aspen have already \u201cgone", "title": "Aspen Valley Hospital Brings On Electronic Medical Records"}, "story_id": 314485221, "twitter": {"site": "@aspenpubradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@aspenpubradio"}, "author": "Marci Krivonen", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Aspen Valley Hospital Brings On Electronic Medical Records"}, "nid": 18814, "datePublished": "2014-05-21", "keywords": "Aspen Valley Hospital, electronic medical records, health care, Affordable Care Act, Delta County Memorial Hospital, rural hospitals", "wordCount": 847, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\"In the case of Aspen Valley Hospital, we\u2019re much busier than your normal small, rural hospital.\nThat\u2019s not the case at Aspen Valley Hospital.\nHe's Chief Financial Officer at Aspen Valley Hospital.\nMoving from paper medical records to an electronic system can take a toll on hospitals.\nPhase one of moving from paper to electronic records will cost the hospital $1.4 million up-front but, over time, it will save the hospital money."}
