LOUIS \u2014 At an Obamacare Town Hall meeting, House Speaker Tim Jones, R-Eureka, was one of several to address a full audience at the Maryville University auditorium about their views of the past, present and future of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nJones was the first of three speakers to address the audience at the event hosted by 97.1 FM News Talk \u2014 a conservative radio station \u2014 and said his role was to present the \u201cpolitical and legal realities\u201d surrounding the ACA. Looking into the act\u2019s past, Jones said it was birthed as a massive and political piece of legislation. Over the past nearly fours years since its implementation, Jones added that he\u2019s only met two people who have read the full text.\n\nBunnie Gronborg of Missouri Health Care for All said Vincent Blair was the only non-biased speaker and that Dr. Randy Tobler stated incorrect information.

House Speaker Tim Jones Jamie Allman acted as the emcee at the Obamacare Town Hall meeting (Photos by Brittany Ruess)\n\n\u201cThey said it\u2019s hard to understand,\u201d Jones said.\n\nWith that, he said changes and challenges to the bill continue to make it more complex.\n\n\u201cThere are tens of thousands of thousands of regulations being drafted everyday,\u201d Jones said. \u201cFolks, the bill\u2019s not done yet. They are still drafting regulations everyday to try and implement the bill because this has been the hardest entitlement to ever implement in our nation\u2019s history. Think about that. We are now three-and-a-half, four years post passage of this bill and we still don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going to do or exactly how it\u2019s going to do it.\u201d\n\nLater in the event, health insurance broker Vincent Blair addressed the uncertainty surrounding the bill, as it has no precedent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in unchartered waters,\u201d he said.\n\nJones made the point to the audience that the ACA bill was passed by Democrats only.\n\n\u201cThat should tell you something about the bill. It\u2019s political. It\u2019s a political issue. It was because one party wanted to say they did something for health care,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to tell you the reality is that it has not addressed the true issue of healthcare, which is cost.\u201d\n\nJones said three \u201cpolitical realities\u201d have helped him understand where Missourians stand on this issue.\n\n\u2013 1. About 72 percent of Missourians voted against the ACA\u2019s implementation of an individual mandate when they voted \u201cyes\u201d on Prop C.\n\n\u2013 2. Two years after Prop C, Jones said about 62 percent of Missourians voted against the \u201csecond most fundamental part of Obamacare: state-based health care.\u201d\n\n\u2013 3. In 2012, Missouri voters chose former Gov. Mitt Romney for the presidency. During his campaign, Romney promised to try and abolish the ACA.\n\n\u201cRomney said it over and over again and he was consistent,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe was elected in this state by over 11-and-a-half percent of the vote, which is a political landslide. As someone in [the] business, I can tell you that.\u201d\n\nJones also said that the opinion of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was that the ACA wasn\u2019t a mandate, but a tax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the largest tax ever forced on America,\u201d Jones said. \u201cCongress can tax a ham sandwich so they can surely tax your health care and make you purchase a product, something which has never happened in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nJones also discussed how he has seen an increasing amount of labor unions wanting to be exempt from the bill.\n\n\u201cWhat a strange world we now live in,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the groups that was principally behind the passage of takeover of one-sixth of our economy because they thought it would help their guy get reelected is now opposed to his signature item. I just read a letter the other day from of one of the heads from one of the largest national unions and they said we now realize that we may not be able to keep the health care plans that you said we could, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nJones had a bottom line.\n\n\u201cCost is going up. Choice is going down. And people are going get grants and waivers,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMy side of the aisle was called crazy at the national election. Every single one of those things has come true\u2026Politically, we are stuck between two elections.\u201d\n\nUnless Republicans take the U.S. Senate majority, Jones said the potential for \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d ACA change would not be until the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like what you have right now; If you don\u2019t like it \u2014 and I think I know where the majority of Missourians are \u2014 then you need to drag your aunts, uncles, friends, cousins, brothers and sisters to the polls in 2014 and 2016 and see if Missouri can continue to lead the way on a bill that I believe has caused more damage than good and will continue to do so,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "ST.
