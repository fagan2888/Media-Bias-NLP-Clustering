Not only that, some people\u2019s health insurance policies are being dropped while others\u2019 rates are rising.\n\nBut a leading Native American health advocate in New Mexico says that American Indians and Alaska Natives have fewer reasons to be anxious about the upcoming deadline for the new health insurance law.\n\n\u201cNative health care consumers have no reason to panic,\u201d said Roxane Spruce Bly, director of Healthcare Education and Outreach for the Native American Professional Parent Resources based in Albuquerque. \u201cIn general, I think there\u2019s a lot of anxiety for consumers around the country because they need to enroll in coverage by March 31, 2014, to avoid a penalty or a fee.\n\n\u201cFor many Native American consumers, they are feeling that same sense of anxiety,\u201d said Spruce Bly, who is from the Pueblo of Laguna. \u201cThey actually have plenty of time before they have to make a decision concerning their options for health coverage. There\u2019s a big difference between a tribal consumer and a non-tribal consumer. It\u2019s pretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nUnder provisions of the Affordable Care Act, tribal members can apply for an exemption to the mandate to have coverage by the end of next March. They will continue to have the opportunity to enroll each proceeding month in a health plan through the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, or NMHIX.\n\nMany Native health care providers working in the field of ACA advocacy and outreach to NMHIX tribal communities are concerned that many Natives are not paying attention to Obamacare because they believe they already have health insurance through the Indian Health Service (IHS), and all of their medical costs will be automatically covered.\n\n\u201cMost of the Pueblo Indians think that IHS is insurance, but it doesn\u2019t cover everything,\u201d said Gov. Mark Mitchell of the Pueblo of Tesuque. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen when you don\u2019t have health insurance. Then you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\n\u201cHere at Tesuque, we appointed one of our former governors to address this issue and gather information about the Affordable Care Act,\u201d added Gov. Mitchell. \u201cSo he\u2019s doing that and we\u2019re trying to take care of the elders first and then move on from there. Hopefully we\u2019re doing the right thing for them, notifying them and letting them know about this new insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of American Indians who rely on the Indian Health Service who are healthy, they don\u2019t necessarily recognize that if you need services outside the IHS, they may not be available,\u201d said Spruce Bly. \u201cSo until you become seriously ill or have a significant health problem you may not realize that it\u2019s not the same as insurance. There\u2019s no protection for medical expenses.\u201d\n\nShe explained that regardless of your income (you could be a Native American millionaire), if you\u2019re a tribal member from a federally recognized tribe and you purchase your plan through the exchange \u2013 if you get your benefits through the IHS or another Indian health provider, there is no cost.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you end up needing surgery,\u201d she noted. \u201cIn a normal situation your costs would be, say, $2,500. If you bought your plan through the exchange and get your referral from an Indian health provider, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay any out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\u201cSo you could actually get a no-cost, private health insurance plan and have no costs to carry. I can\u2019t overstate this,\u201d said Spruce Bly, who is providing outreach to tribal members in New Mexico about the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. \u201cThere are real opportunities for Indian people to get coverage like never before. The implications for Indian health providers, when they can capitalize on those reimbursements \u2013 we could be looking at a dramatic increase in services.\u201d\n\nIndian health experts including Ed Fox, Port Gamble S\u2019Klallam Tribal Health Director, believe it\u2019s up to tribal leaders to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act. As a member of a tribal advisory group to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Fox estimates the ACA could bring in up to $4 billion for Indian health providers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be extremely careful about how those reimbursements come into IHS,\u201d said Gov. Mitchell. \u201cI think all the New Mexico tribes are going to utilize that. For example, when some of our tribal members go to IHS for any special help, when we send them out for referrals, the IHS doesn\u2019t have the money to cover those costs. What happens is the bill gets sent out to our individual members. We\u2019ve been working hard to straighten that out.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now the IHS is funded at only 54 percent of the actual need,\u201d said Spruce Bly, \u201cbut if enough Indians start using the exchange system that money (the reimbursements) could go right back into the (IHS) system. It\u2019s pretty astounding actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur members (at Tesuque) have been refused service because the IHS doesn\u2019t have the money to cover treatment,\u201d said Gov. Mitchell. \u201cLately, what I\u2019ve seen and heard is that wherever our members get referred, the (non-Indian hospitals or specialists) are not accepting because the feds are not paying their bills. That\u2019s why we\u2019re brainstorming and looking at Obamacare, to see whether it can help us or hurt us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "American Indians and Alaska Natives have fewer reasons to be anxious about the upcoming deadline for the new health insurance law.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/09/health-coverage-could-improve-affordable-care-act-education-152601", "type": "article", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Health Coverage Could Improve With Affordable Care Act Education"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-09T14:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Health Coverage Could Improve With Affordable Care Act Education"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/09/health-coverage-could-improve-affordable-care-act-education-152601", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Indian Health Service, Obamacare Enrollment, Health Insurance, Roxane Spruce Bly, Healthcare Education and Outreach, Native American Professional Parent Resources, Gov.
