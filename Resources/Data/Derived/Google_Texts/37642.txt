Kaiser Permanente will now cover services for transgender Coloradans in its insurance plans, the company said Tuesday.

“Kaiser Permanente is committed to reducing health disparities and providing culturally competent care to all of our patients,” the HMO said in a statement. “

In March, the Colorado Division of Insurance issued a directive reminding insurers that it is against state law to discriminate based on sexual orientation, including those who are transgender.

After that directive, Kaiser began reviewing its policies on transgender services, the company stated.

” The availability of coverage for Transgender health services is an evolving area in the health care industry,” Kaiser Permanente stated. “We look forward to further guidance from the Division of Insurance, and participation in this important, ongoing discussion with other stakeholders.”

Kaiser Permanente joins only the Colorado HealthOP cooperative insurance plan as the only insurers covering transgender health care, according to One Colorado, an advocacy group for the states lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents.

Kaiser said, “For patients with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria in plans that are under Colorado Division of Insurance oversight, coverage includes many medical services, including behavioral health, medical testing, hormone therapy for members who have a drug benefit, and transgender surgery. General exclusions and limitations that apply to all services also apply to transgender services.”

“But two insurers is not enough,” One Colorado health policy director Ashley Wheeland said in a statement.

“We believe that transgender Coloradans and their employers deserve the same options in picking any health plan, and we hope we can soon say in the state of Colorado that all of our health plans cover the services that our transgender friends need.”
