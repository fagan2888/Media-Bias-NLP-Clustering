Then, Republicans roared back in 2010 \u2013 but that was only because old, white, angry tea party men showed up at the polls. Luckily in 2012, the story continues, the American public reaffirmed that Republicans are, in fact, crazy Right-wingers, by granting Obama a second term.\"\n\nThat's one way of interpreting recent history, to be sure. But then, how do you explain what happened on Tuesday?\n\nOne plausible theory for what happened in the Midterms might be that voters were not so much approving a conservative mandate, as they were rejecting Mr Obama's policies, and that in the 2016 presidential elections, the electorate will be much more diverse.\n\nHowever, it would also be a mistake for us to underplay the importance of what happened. Republicans crushed the Democrats, easily taking control of the US Senate \u2013 and adding a dozen, or so, House seats to their majority in the lower chamber of the US Congress.\n\nThey also won important governorships in ultraliberal states like Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois \u2013 and (at the state house level) will now control 67 of the 98 partisan legislative chambers in America. This was an across-the-board drubbing.\n\nAnd if Republicans can avoid gloating over last Tuesday's results \u2013 if they can avoid overplaying the significance of what just happened \u2013 there is reason to believe they might have a real shot continuing this trend and winning the presidency in 2016.\n\nHere's why: Though Republicans should not assume the 2016 electorate would look like it did in 2010 or 2014, neither should Democrats assume 2016 would look like 2008 or 2012 (when Obama was on the ballot).\n\nYes, the electorate will be younger and less white in 2016 than in 2014 \u2013 but one important and unanswered question lingers: Can Democrats turn out their base voters in such high numbers when Mr Obama isn't on the ballot?\n\nAdditionally, Republicans are making strides \u2013 in terms of catching up to the Democrats' data and technological advantage, and in terms of electing candidates who look more like the rest of America, a trend that continued on Tuesday. With Hispanic Republican Senators like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz \u2013 and governors like Nevada's Brian Sandoval and New Mexico's Susana Martinez, coupled with Indian American governors like South Carolina's Nikki Haley and Louisiana's Bobby Jindal \u2013 the GOP already boasted a stronger bench of high-profile minority elected officials than the Democrats.\n\nBut Tuesday's election only increased this advantage. Sen. Tim Scott (who was previously appointed to the Senate) became the first black senator in the deep south since 1881 with his victory in South Carolina. Utah's Mia Love became the Republican's first black woman elected to Congress, and also the first Haitian-American. New York's Elise Stefanik, 30, became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. And Senators-elect Joni Ernst and Shelley Moore Capito became the first women ever elected to the US Senate in their respective states of Iowa and West Virginia.\n\nPerhaps most important, though, is the fact that the Republican Party seems to have matured. In recent cycles, tea party conservatives and establishment Republicans, alike, nominated candidates who ended up saying controversial things that cost them elections.\n\nThis time around, the GOP seems to have learned their lesson. They nominated a slate of qualified and serious conservative candidates, avoiding the kinds of controversies that might have made it easy to label them as crazy or \"fringe\" candidates.\n\nRepublican leaders went out of their way to support quality candidates during the primary contests, and to incentivise good behaviour thereafter.\n\nWhat is more, many of the red meat hurling conservative candidates who arrived in Washington in 2010 and 2012 matured along the way \u2013 chastened by the government shutdown that damaged the Republican brand even further. No, they haven't turned into raging moderates or liberals, but they have become more pragmatic and sagacious. And on Tuesday, it showed.\n\nMatt Lewis is a senior contributor at The Daily Caller website in Washington DC", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSAGenre": "uselection", "twitter": {"player": {"width": 560, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/player.swf?keepEmbedCode=true&autoplay=1&embedCode=5ieThlcToVmB4WajJIRCinXn761Ta_UU&adSetCode=b20883587d124da4a8f29205f8be38ea", "height": 315}, "image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03089/Republican_challen_3089237a.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "player"}, "keywords": "US Election,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;North_America;USA;US_Politics;US_Election", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/us-election", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "American Way: Can Republicans build on Midterms to win 2016 presidential election?", "section-id": 6536, "GSACategory": "worldnews", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-us_election", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/uselection", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 11218064, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "Republicans seem to have learned lessons from recent past by promoting qualified and serious conservative candidates &ndash; but can they now push on and win in 2016?", "tmgads.channel": "news", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-08", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-us_election", "last-modified": "2014-11-08", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 729, "embedcount": 0, "tag": "US Election", "subsection": "US Election", "videocount": 1, "internallinkcount": 7, "imagecount": 0, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 11218064, "tmgads.articleid": 11218064, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Republicans seem to have learned lessons from recent past by promoting qualified and serious conservative candidates &ndash; but can they now push on and win in 2016?", "title": "American Way: Can Republicans build on Midterms to win 2016 presidential election?", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/11218064/American-Way-Can-Republicans-build-on-Midterms-to-win-2016-presidential-election.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03089/Republican_challen_3089237a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "GSAChannel": "news", "author": "By Matt Lewis", "GSAChannelName": "News", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"American Way: Can Republicans build on Midterms to win 2016 presidential election?  \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/11218064/American-Way-Can-Republicans-build-on-Midterms-to-win-2016-presidential-election.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03089/Republican_challen_3089237a.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11218064\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-08T15:20:46Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"TMG\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"US Politics\",\"US Election\"]}", "tmgads.videosrc": "tmg", "DCSext.Genre": "us-election", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.us-election", "DCSext.author": "By Matt Lewis", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-11-08 15:20"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e88\"", "article_summary": "Luckily in 2012, the story continues, the American public reaffirmed that Republicans are, in fact, crazy Right-wingers, by granting Obama a second term.\"\nRepublican leaders went out of their way to support quality candidates during the primary contests, and to incentivise good behaviour thereafter.\nIn recent cycles, tea party conservatives and establishment Republicans, alike, nominated candidates who ended up saying controversial things that cost them elections.\nThen, Republicans roared back in 2010 \u2013 but that was only because old, white, angry tea party men showed up at the polls.\nUtah's Mia Love became the Republican's first black woman elected to Congress, and also the first Haitian-American."}
