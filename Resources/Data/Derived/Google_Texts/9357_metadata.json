(AP) - The political fallout from South Dakota\u2019s investment-for-visa scandal is likely over, but state officials are still investigating how to claw back roughly $1 million in public funds.\n\nA legislative audit committee released a report this week that found that a former state official who committed suicide last year was solely to blame for the missing money, which spawned state and federal investigations. But the state is still examining how to reclaim the missing funds and legal fees stemming from a lawsuit, and evaluating whether a company involved in the scandal should be considered a financial institution - and therefore subject to banking taxes.\n\nThe handling of the EB-5 federal investment program in South Dakota was scrutinized during this election season. Former Gov. Mike Rounds faced accusations over his management of the program, but he overcame the criticism to become South Dakota\u2019s newest U.S. senator.\n\nThe state Government Operations and Audit Committee\u2019s final report said Richard Benda was the only person responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in \u201cmisdirected\u201d funds. Missing from the report were others Democrats have accused of having a hand in the program\u2019s mismanagement, including Rounds and Joop Bollen, a former state administrator who oversaw the program as a public employee and as part of a private company.\n\nSouth Dakota was one of the pioneers in EB-5 financing under Bollen and Benda, a former Governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development secretary. The program recruits wealthy immigrant investors for projects in exchange for green cards. Benda\u2019s suicide came as state officials prepared felony theft charges against him in connection with the financial misconduct, which left the state short of more than $500,000.\n\nGov. Dennis Daugaard\u2019s top aide Tony Venhuizen told The Associated Press Friday that Pierre attorney Paul Bachand is still working through the state\u2019s options to reclaim the money.\n\nThe South Dakota Board of Regents is also evaluating how to recover about $510,000 in fees related to a lawsuit against the state. An arbitrator in early October dismissed the breach-of-contract lawsuit filed against the state in 2008 by California-based Darley International and later that month denied the state\u2019s attempt to recover attorney fees and costs.\n\nDarley filed the lawsuit against the South Dakota International Business Institute, where Bollen administered the EB-5 visa program while he worked for the public institute at Northern State University. Darley had an agreement to recruit investors in China for South Dakota projects.\n\nBoard of Regents CEO Jack Warner said the regents are exploring opportunities to reclaim the funds, but declined to comment further. Bollen on Saturday declined to comment on the matter.\n\nDemocrats want a more thorough accounting of Bollen\u2019s role in the program\u2019s troubles and have criticized Bollen for moving the program under a privately run company he created. The program was privatized in 2009 and turned over to SDRC Inc., a company which Bollen had founded and served as president.\n\nSDRC Inc. continues to oversee existing EB-5 projects, and now South Dakota\u2019s Division of Banking is considering whether the company should be considered a financial institution because it administers some loans. Such a determination could result in SDRC Inc. owing millions in banking taxes.\n\nBanking Division director Bret Afdahl on Friday said that the state is waiting on some documents before deciding whether to label SDRC Inc. a bank. Meanwhile, the state Revenue Department has signaled that if SDRC is deemed a financial institution, it will work to collect bank franchise taxes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The political fallout from South Dakota's investment-for-visa scandal is likely over, but state officials are still investigating how to claw back roughly $1 million in public funds.", "Author": "JAMES NORD", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/6/south-dakota-officials-wrapping-up-eb-5-loose-ends/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The political fallout from South Dakota\u2019s investment-for-visa scandal is likely over, but state officials are still investigating how to claw back roughly $1 million in public funds.", "title": "South Dakota officials wrapping up EB-5 loose ends"}, "twitter": {"title": "South Dakota officials wrapping up EB-5 loose ends", "description": "The political fallout from South Dakota's investment-for-visa scandal is likely over, but state officials are still investigating how to claw back roughly $1 million in public funds.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "The handling of the EB-5 federal investment program in South Dakota was scrutinized during this election season.\nSouth Dakota was one of the pioneers in EB-5 financing under Bollen and Benda, a former Governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development secretary.\nDarley had an agreement to recruit investors in China for South Dakota projects.\nThe South Dakota Board of Regents is also evaluating how to recover about $510,000 in fees related to a lawsuit against the state.\nDarley filed the lawsuit against the South Dakota International Business Institute, where Bollen administered the EB-5 visa program while he worked for the public institute at Northern State University."}
