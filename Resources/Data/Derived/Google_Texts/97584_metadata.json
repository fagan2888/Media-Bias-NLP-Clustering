Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, who disclosed that his daughter works for Clinton\u2019s campaign, asked if she\u2019ll drop out of the race if indicted by the Department of Justice for mishandling classified information.\n\nClinton said the usual bits that what she did was a mistake, but that it wasn\u2019t prohibited\u2013and that the emails she written that contained classified information, which total to about 104, were retroactively classified. She cited former Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s emails undergoing the same classification process. Moreover, she felt that the real issue is over-classification. Ramos asked again if she\u2019d drop out if indicted.\n\n\u201cOh for goodness, that\u2019s not going to happen; I\u2019m not even answering that question,\u201d snapped Clinton, which drew loud applause from the audience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I'm not even answering that question\" .05/27/2016 8:38:34AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"I'm not even answering that question\"", "title": "Clinton Refuses To Answer If She\u2019ll Drop Out Of 2016 Race If Indicted By DOJ", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/10/clinton-refuses-to-answer-if-shell-drop-out-of-2016-race-if-indicted-by-doj-n2131139", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/69/390761b6-5836-41d6-ad09-e8d98d128d45.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"I'm not even answering that question\"", "title": "Clinton Refuses To Answer If She\u2019ll Drop Out Of 2016 Race If Indicted By DOJ", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/10/clinton-refuses-to-answer-if-shell-drop-out-of-2016-race-if-indicted-by-doj-n2131139", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/69/390761b6-5836-41d6-ad09-e8d98d128d45.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Clinton Refuses To Answer If She\u2019ll Drop Out Of 2016 Race If Indicted By DOJ, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Ramos asked again if she\u2019d drop out if indicted.\nUnivision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, who disclosed that his daughter works for Clinton\u2019s campaign, asked if she\u2019ll drop out of the race if indicted by the Department of Justice for mishandling classified information.\nDuring CNN\u2019s Democratic debate last night, Hillary Clinton decided to once again launch countermeasures over the controversy surrounding her private email system.\n\u201cOh for goodness, that\u2019s not going to happen; I\u2019m not even answering that question,\u201d snapped Clinton, which drew loud applause from the audience.\nClinton said the usual bits that what she did was a mistake, but that it wasn\u2019t prohibited\u2013and that the emails she written that contained classified information, which total to about 104, were retroactively classified."}
