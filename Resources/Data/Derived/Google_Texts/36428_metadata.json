Vidalies said there should be penalties for those involved.\n\nAsked whether the Socialist government should intervene more directly in the dispute given its 17 percent stake in the business, Vidalies said nationalization was not on the cards.\n\n\"That (stake) is the result of history.... The state is a shareholder (but) we are not in a situation today where the solution will be nationalization of Air France. If it is that behind your question, then the answer is no.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Marine Le Pennetier, writing by Andrew Callus; editing by Adrian Croft and Susan Thomas)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "PARIS (Reuters) - Violent acts by workers at the headquarters of troubled flag carrier", "title": "Air France shirt-ripping scenes a national embarrassment: ministers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/06/French-PM-calls-severe-punishment-after-violence-Air-France", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/airfrance-employment_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/06/French-PM-calls-severe-punishment-after-violence-Air-France", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/airfrance-employment_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "PARIS (Reuters) - Violent acts by workers at the headquarters of troubled flag carrier", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc165\"", "article_summary": "The state is a shareholder (but) we are not in a situation today where the solution will be nationalization of Air France.\nLike other European carriers, Air France, part of the Franco-Dutch group Air France KLM, faces harsh competition on short-haul routes from a new generation of low cost airlines and on long-haul routes from Gulf-based airlines backed by their countries' sovereign wealth.\nAir France has launched a legal complaint over Monday's incident, which has been condemned by management, unions, and government officials alike.\nAir France officials say failure to secure the air crews' agreement for the plan has now forced them to come up with a more draconian one, which cuts 2,900 jobs and pulls the airline out of 10 percent of its long-haul routes.\n\"This image hurts our country,\" said Prime Minister Manuel Valls, as pictures of senior Air France officials with their shirts ripped and torn off adorned newspaper front pages around the world."}
