Not really. Even it passed the Senate somehow and won President Obama\u2019s signature, it merely allows insurers to sell non-grandfathered policies. Just as the Obama \u201cfix\u201d cannot make insurers offer their current \u201csubstandard\u201d plans to consumers \u2013as California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones told reporters, the Upton bill is equally toothless.\n\nHere\u2019s a Venn diagram put out by the White House on the difference between its and the House proposal. (HT @Drew_Hammill @DavidMDrucker).\n\nPlease note both measures allow providers to do something they do not want to do.\n\nNCPA Senior Fellow Devon Herrick doesn\u2019t see how the bill, were it to pass the Senate and win President Obama\u2019s signature, can fix the problem.\n\n\u201cAt this point it would be all but impossible to force insurers to restore plans they have already cancelled in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Insurers have spent years working to comply with the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s next to impossible to\n\ntell an insurer to cancel a plan (designed) to comply with the law in the first place.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the NCPA\u2019s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The key is:\n\nSolution: Offer people the same tax relief for health insurance, regardless of where it is obtained or purchased \u2013 preferably in the form of a lump-sum, refundable tax credit.\n\nThe NCPA approach is similar to John McCain\u2019s plan.\n\nEqual tax treatment for health coverage. The Senator would replace the special tax breaks for employer-based health insurance with a univer\u00adsal system of health care tax credits for the pur\u00adchase of health insurance. These health care tax credits of $5,000 for a family and $2,500 for an individual would be indexed annually for infla\u00adtion and would be available to Americans regard\u00adless of income, employment, or tax liability. Even prominent critics concede that such a tax change is a principled and far-reaching proposal.[2] This change alone would lay the groundwork for unprecedented consumer choice and competi\u00adtion in the health care sector.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t Republicans shouting about this approach? Because it too could produce radical changes in how many consumers get health care.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Debra J.
