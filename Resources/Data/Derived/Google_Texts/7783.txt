The Great Plains Zoo welcomes a new member to its collection of animals.

On Tuesday, September 3, four-year-old Reticulated Giraffe, Solstice, gave birth to her first calf. The baby Giraffe is a male and stands six feet tall and weighs 146 lbs.

Solstice was able to give birth on her own while the Zoo’s veterinary and animal care staff monitored.

A giraffe gives birth standing up after a 15 month gestation period. The calf drops more than five feet to the ground, which doesn’t hurt the calf, only causing it to breath. It takes only an hour for the calf to stand on its own.

The mother and calf can be seen through the viewing windows in the Giraffe Barn at the Great Plains Zoo.

The Great Plains Zoo and Delbridge Museum of Natural History is open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
