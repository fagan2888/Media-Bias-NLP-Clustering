Vocap Ventures led the investment joined by VegasTechFund and angel investors Joanne Wilson and Jason Calacanis.\n\nIncluded in the \u201cindie food\u201d category are artisan, small batch, handmade, organic, gluten-free and other packaged specialty foods that are \u201cmade by people not corporations, and typically involve a recipe,\u201d said Mouth\u2019s founder and Chief Executive Craig Kanarick. \u201cIt\u2019s about the art of the food, instead of the art of the farmer. We don\u2019t sell things like carrots and milk,\u201d he added.\n\nThe New York company is bucking two recent trends in food technology and venture capital: It doesn\u2019t deliver groceries within a day (like Farmigo, GoodEggs, Instacart, or Relay Foods) nor is it a marketplace that sells, but doesn\u2019t hold food inventory (like Goldbely or Food-Hub).\n\nThe Mouth team scours the country for the best food makers and products, buying select tasty treats in bulk, then photographing, warehousing, marketing, packaging and shipping them directly to customers. \u201cWe\u2019re not Etsy. We\u2019re not a magazine. And we\u2019re not an open marketplace. But we curate very seriously, and think our customers benefit from our attention to every detail of the experience,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nThe site typically features 700 products at a time, and today about 10% of these are sold exclusively online via Mouth.com, Mr. Kanarick said. His company also has a small brick-and-mortar store in New York, which isn\u2019t yet open to the public but has secured a liquor license.\n\nMouth.com offers individual items\u2013like Gracious Gourmet\u2019s spiced sour cherry spread ($9), Rick\u2019s Picks\u2019 kosher organic dill pickles ($14) or the port wine caramel bar by Sweeteeth ($7)\u2013along with monthly subscriptions, gift boxes, and a V.I.P. concierge service for customers with a large number of orders.\n\nAccording to a 2013 report by the Specialty Food Industry Association, total specialty food sales in 2012 topped $85.87 billion. Online sales of specialty foods comprised a small but growing portion of those sales, said Mr. Kanarick.\n\nAn investor in several consumer packaged goods and retail startups, Joanne Wilson, said she invested in Mouth partly due to the founders\u2019 excellent track record in business. For his part, Mr. Kanarick was the co-founder and former chief strategic officer of still-thriving digital agency Razorfish.\n\nMs. Wilson views Mouth as a digital brand able to stand alongside iconic specialty food stores and farmer\u2019s markets in the U.S., like Pike Place Market in Seattle or the Greenmarket Farmers Markets in New York.\n\nThe investor believes the company should pursue an \u201c80-20 strategy,\u201d making 20% of its revenue offline and 80% online. She pointed to e-commerce companies like JAand Inc., better known as Warby Parker, and Bonobos Inc. that have generated a meaningful portion of sales via brick-and-mortar stores over time.\n\nMr. Kanarick said the company will use the funding to continue to find and add products to its site, market its own brand, and vendors\u2019 products across the U.S., and to continue to improve its Internet and mobile websites. The company does not currently have a native mobile app.\n\nWrite to Lora Kolodny at lora.kolodny@wsj.com.
