Politics is only for tomorrow, for the vote,\u201d she added.\n\nInside a huge beer tent, the economic crisis which has divided politicians in the race for the chancellery is little in evidence \u2014 waitresses in Bavaria\u2019s low-cut dirndl dresses and waiters in lederhosen leather shorts ferry litre-sized glasses, known as a Mass, of frothy beer up and down the aisles.\n\n\u201cThe crisis? No, it hasn\u2019t affected me,\u201d said Thomas Peekl, a student from the wealthy neighbouring region of Baden-Wuerttemberg. \u201cThe German economy is solid,\u201d he added, saying he would vote on Sunday for Merkel\u2019s conservatives.\n\nMasses of giant pretzels, pork, dumplings and other traditional Bavarian foods were being washed down with the beer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, tomorrow we have to go and vote. That\u2019s why we\u2019re drinking one less beer \u2014 just one, mind,\u201d joked Holger Arendt.\n\nSeventeen-year-old student Maximilian Bissinger, from the outskirts of Munich, expressed shock at how many people showed no interest in politics ahead of the crunch election in which Merkel\u2019s coalition is fighting for every vote.\n\n\u201cPoliticians want to be seen here, they want to appear close to the people. But people don\u2019t care. They are here for the beer,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the Oktoberfest started life more than 200 years ago, this year\u2019s event is the 180th edition as the party was cancelled during two world wars, two cholera outbreaks, Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Bavaria and the hyperinflation of the 1920s.\n\nThe rising price of beer always touches off a debate, and this year was setting festival-goers back between 9.40 and 9.85 euros ($13-13.3) for a Mass.\n\nThe festival, which runs to October 6, was originally held in October as the name suggests to celebrate a royal wedding, but was brought forward by one month to take advantage of better weather.\n\nThe format has been exported around the world and versions of the festival can be found as far afield as China, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Russia and Australia.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u2018Beer today, vote tomorrow\u2019 say German Oktoberfest revellers", "title": "\u2018Beer today, vote tomorrow\u2019 say German Oktoberfest revellers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/21/beer-today-vote-tomorrow-say-german-oktoberfest-revellers/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-21T14:25:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-21T14:25:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Beer"}, "article_summary": "MUNICH \u2014 Single-minded revellers gathered for the world-famous Oktoberfest beer festival Saturday, hoping the heady atmosphere of ale, lederhosen and oompah music will not be flattened by Germany\u2019s election fever.\nPolitics is only for tomorrow, for the vote,\u201d she added.\nMasses of giant pretzels, pork, dumplings and other traditional Bavarian foods were being washed down with the beer.\n\u201cThe German economy is solid,\u201d he added, saying he would vote on Sunday for Merkel\u2019s conservatives.\n\u201cToday we forget everything, it\u2019s a party,\u201d retired nurse Gabriele Wahn, 65, from western Saarland state said, admitting she liked the atmosphere but did not drink beer."}
