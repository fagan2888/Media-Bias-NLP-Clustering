Story highlights Dr. Jill Biden's spokesman confirmed she'd support her husband Joe Biden running for president

The vice president's wife had been thought to oppose a campaign

Washington (CNN) If Vice President Joe Biden decides to run for president, his wife appears to be on board.

Dr. Jill Biden had been thought to oppose a 2016 run, but on Sunday her spokesman didn't dispute an NBC News report that she is "not an obstacle" to a Joe Biden bid for the Democratic nomination.

"Of course Dr. Biden would be on board if her husband decides to run for president but they haven't made that decision yet," Jill Biden spokesman James Gleeson said in a statement.

Joe Biden is still weighing a 2016 bid -- which would involve taking on Hillary Clinton's high-powered campaign and the insurgent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- in the wake of the death of Biden's son, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden.

The vice president has said he is still trying to determine whether he is emotionally prepared to fully commit to what would be his third presidential campaign. His first two came in 1988 and 2008.
