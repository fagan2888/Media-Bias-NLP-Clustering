I don`t have a bus pass ... if I didn`t have my dad, I don`t know what I would do. I`d have to commit a crime to go back to the prison.\"\n\nEl Paso County Undersheriff Paula Presley oversees operations at the second largest jail in the state. She says approximately80 percent of the inmates at the El Paso County jail are diagnosed with mental illness or have other serious medical issues when they arrive.\n\nPresley told FOX31 Denver, \"Sadly they know enough to understand that once they get into our custody, they are going to be treated.\"\n\nPresley says sick care-seekers like Mark Whitney can triple the costs of an average jail stay.\n\nDespite the jail funding a full treatment center behind bars, plus a six-figure annual after-care program, this groups recidivism rate keeps climbing.\n\n\"Sometimes it`s intentional,\u201d says Presley. \u201cOnce they run out of resources on the street - which may be immediately upon their release - they have to find a way to get the help they need.\"\n\nWhitney`s 83-year-old father, Ken, says his son's been banned from nearly every local motel and residential treatment facility. He says, sadly, jail health care has been a good option. His son must take his mental health medications and guards kept him from hurting himself.\n\nKen Whitney had hoped a new state public health program called ACC, or the Affordable Care Collaborative, might finally get Mark help, but not so far.\n\n\u201cI think they were at a loss as what to do to help him.\"\n\nOf the approximately 500,000 Colorado Medicaid patients screened by the ACC so far, only one-half of one percent are labeled \"super utilizers\" like Whitney; that\u2019s only 3,004 clients statewide. That tiny, but expensive group annually cost taxpayers around $76 million in public health care.\n\nAnd for Mark Whitney, unless someone or some agency figures out what to do with him the costs will keep rising.\n\nWhitney says he will not stop asking for help, even though at times, he feel like he\u2019s all alone.\n\n\"Since I have a history of doing this to myself, they think I`m hopeless - just a bad apple or both - well there`s nothing we can do for this guy so they`ve given up in a lot of ways.\"\n\nMr. Whitney is on the political radar not only for his enormous (and still growing) public health care tab, but for an encounter he had last summer with Colorado Lt. Governor Joe Garcia.\n\nWhitney tells FOX31 Denver he\u2019d been drinking and was upset about being denied entry into an emergency room, so he walked up the Garcia's private residence in Colorado Springs and banged on the door asking for help. Records show Garcia answered the door, and then called police. His staff declined to comment further on the matter.\n\nWhitney says he thought it was the mayor\u2019s house, but when he found out the truth, he hoped it would have a positive effect. He told FOX31 Denver, \u201cThe police came and told me about it. \u2018You know whose door you knocked on?\u2019 I thought, okay, maybe he should hear about this \u2013 I thought how ironic.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- A Colorado man who wouldn`t stop calling 911 for medical help spent 203 days in jail even though a judge thought just ten days was enough.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 A Colorado man who wouldn`t stop calling 911 for medical help spent 203 days in jail even though a judge thought just ten days was enough.
