When you go to the caucus, if you go, on Monday night, look to your left and your right and imagine the people who are not there, the ones not participating in this so-called great example of “participatory democracy.” You will not see the voter who has too many health issues, the shift worker, the emergency services worker, the voter with social anxiety, the voter who got sick the last time they caucused, the voter who wants to vote in private, the abused woman who is still in hiding, the snow bird who is gone every winter, the voter on a business trip, the person in the hospital and the voter without child care.

We have encountered all these people while out canvassing. All of these people could have participated in selecting our presidential candidates if some form of early or absentee voting were available. Now some folks are worried that we would lose our first-in-the-nation status if we don’t do this caucus thing. Maybe they can be separated. And if not, is being first more important than disenfranchising large groups of voters?
