Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn says the City of Tampa is making it easier to sign up by making navigators available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at five parks & rec centers.\n\n\u201cWell, because there\u2019s a need. And because the more of our citizens that we get covered and have health care options, the better we are as a community. The better their quality of life is, the better the greater community\u2019s quality of life is. And so we stepped out early on when the President first announced and asked for our help. We\u2019ve been doing this for three years now. We\u2019re going to continue to do it. We registered 77,000 people in Hillsborough County last year. A-million-three (1,300,000) in the state of Florida. And so we\u2019re hoping to find those who have not signed up or not had the information available to them.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s 77,000 people got health insurance that didn\u2019t have it before?\n\n\u201cYes, 77,000 of our friends and neighbors and family members in Hillsborough County that did not have health care coverage that would have to walk into the emergency room as their primary provider, oftentimes with tragic results. They now have health care insurance. It\u2019s market-driven, they\u2019re paying for it. It\u2019s the right thing to do. And the fact that we can take that burden off of them \u2013 the burden that hangs over their head if they don\u2019t have health insurance \u2013 that\u2019s a good thing. And I don\u2019t care about the politics of this. This is the right thing to do and it\u2019s the best thing that we can do for the health of our community.\u201d\n\nWhere can people go and when is it open?\n\n\u201cYou can go to our community parks and recreation facilities. That is available online. There\u2019s about five of them that we\u2019ve opened. The hours, I think you could go online to find out what they are. \u201cThe navigators will be there to help you navigate the process. So we\u2019re trying to make this available to some of the targeted groups that are under-served. So we did it intentionally in neighborhoods where there is a high rate of uninsured folks. And we\u2019re hoping that they\u2019ll avail themselves to come down to our facilities, meet with the navigators. They will help you through the process. They\u2019ll get you signed up. They\u2019ll find the best plan for you. And you will have the burden lifted off your shoulders and off your family\u2019s shoulders.\u201d\n\nAnd, finally, is this for people who have no insurance or if they had this experience last year where they signed up and they\u2019re not sure whether to switch plans?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s both. I think they can look for other policies that are more cost-effective if they need to. But it\u2019s mainly for those who did not register the last time, who for whatever reason chose not to. This is an opportunity for them. I mean the tens of thousands that are still uninsured in Hillsborough County. To come and get signed up. Find a plan that makes sense for you. Find a plan that you can afford. And have health care insurance for you and your family.\u201d\n\nBelow is information provided by the City of Tampa:\n\nThese centers will be open from 4 to 7 p.m. on Tuesdays & Thursdays each week through the enrollment deadline of January 31, 2016.\n\nCyrus Green Center\n\n2101 East Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard\n\nForest Hills Center\n\n724 West 109th Avenue\n\nHunt Center at Al Lopez Park\n\n4810 North Himes Avenue\n\nLoretta Ingraham Center\n\n1615 North Hubert Avenue\n\nPort Tampa Center\n\n4702 West McCoy Street\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Navigators will not be available December 22 \u2013 January 1 due to the holidays.\n\nFor more information on how to enroll for healthcare, call (877) 813-9115 or: https://www.getcoveredamerica.org/connector/\n\nAccording to a news release from Health and Human Services, as of Wednesday, two million people have signed up for the federal marketplace so far this year with nearly 445,000 of those in Florida.
