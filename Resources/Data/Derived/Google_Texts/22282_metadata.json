(HMA), a Naples, Fla.-based for-profit company with 71 hospitals in 15 states. The lawsuits allege the fraud scheme at the hospitals, which are mostly in non-urban areas in the southeast, was engineered by top executives.\n\nHMA hospitals are accused of admitting inpatients who could have been treated as outpatients, in observation or released, DOJ says. HMA allegedly paid kickbacks to physicians for referrals, according to the lawsuits, one of which alleges HMA formed a joint venture and charged physicians a below-market price for a lucrative investment opportunity. The alleged misconduct led to inflated Medicare and Medicaid charges.\n\n\u201cThese are some eye-opening allegations if proven,\u201d says Philadelphia attorney Marc Raspanti, who represents two of the whistleblowers. He was surprised by \u201cthe degree to which HMA [allegedly] locked down referrals by physicians....Where was their compliance department? Where were their lawyers? I don\u2019t have answers to these questions.\u201d\n\nCFO Allegedly Told to \u2018Burn\u2019 Audit Report\n\nCompliance didn\u2019t fare so well at HMA, says Atlanta attorney Marlan Wilbanks, who represents two other whistleblowers. One of them, Ralph D. Williams, the former chief financial officer of Walton Regional Medical Center in Georgia, allegedly was told by a senior leader to \u201cburn\u201d an audit report that showed \u201coverutilization of inpatient admissions and underutilization of observation,\u201d his false claims lawsuit alleges.\n\nHMA allegedly sought to maximize admissions by setting corporate goals. It allegedly \u201ctracked and disseminated each of its hospital\u2019s inpatient admissions versus observations and set forth a delinquency rate and acuity goals for each hospital that failed to achieve the corporate goal for the percentage of various patient populations that should be admitted,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. It was akin to a competition among HMA hospitals, Wilbanks says. \u201cThis is the type of mess you get in when compliance is weakened by the corporate drive for profits,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother whistleblower filed a false claims lawsuit against Walton Regional Medical Center and Barrow Regional Medical Center, also in Georgia. Emergency department physician Craig Brummer, M.D., was an ED medical director at both hospitals. According to the complaint, he participated in daily ED \u201cflash meetings,\u201d during which \u201chospital administrators would pressure ED physicians by reviewing each patient in the ED that had not been admitted as an inpatient to see if that patient should have [been] or could be admitted; and to re-emphasize to the physicians the HMA mandate that they get more patients admitted to the hospital.\u201d\n\nPlan Was Allegedly Hatched by HMA Execs\n\nThe push to admit patients allegedly came from the top and filtered down to physicians. \u201cThe scheme was directed by top executives at HMA and executed via pressure applied on HMA divisional officers who in turn pressured hospital level executives, who pressured contract physician groups,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAlthough ED physicians don\u2019t write admission orders, HMA directed them to take steps to generate admissions, the lawsuit alleges. For example, ED physicians were required to use the HMA Pro-Med emergency department management computer system, which ordered tests based on a \u201cchief complaint\u201d entered by a nurse instead of the patient\u2019s medical condition as decided by a physician. \u201cHMA pressured ED physicians to follow HMA\u2019s \u2018testing guidelines\u2019 and monitored the physicians\u2019 activities in the Pro-Med system to see if they were properly implementing HMA\u2019s corporate mandates,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nIf physicians didn\u2019t play ball, HMA management would approach Brummer about removing them from the schedule, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nJoint ventures were the subject of one of the false claims lawsuits against HMA, which was filed by whistleblowers George Miller and Michael Metts, former CEO and CFO/compliance officer, respectively, of both Lancaster Regional Medical Center and Heart of Lancaster Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania. When they started their jobs in 2008, the CFO and CEO got the message they should complete as many joint ventures as possible because physician-owned hospitals were facing restrictions under the Affordable Care Act. In 2009, HMA completed 16 whole-hospital joint ventures, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nMiller and Metts were advised in the summer of 2008 to \u201ccapitalize on physicians who could refer patients\u201d to Heart of Lancaster by pursuing a \u201csyndication\u201d with them. Under the direction of a regional HMA vice president, the CEO and CFO tailored an HMA joint venture PowerPoint presentation for eligible staff physicians. If the physicians invested in the joint venture \u2014 a newly created LLC that would invest in the hospital \u2014 the physicians could expect an average return of 20% every year for five years based on one more patient admission per day, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nHMA would maintain majority ownership of the LLC, with a limited number of physicians allowed to buy 10%. The price for buying into the joint venture was artificially low, the lawsuit alleges. It was \u201ca heavily discounted investment opportunity utilized to induce targeted physicians to participate in the joint venture\u201d (e.g., a 20% \u201cmarketability discount to the wholesale value\u201d).\n\nThe lawsuit alleges more shenanigans with a joint venture involving Lancaster Regional Medical Center.\n\nHMA\u2019s joint ventures allegedly violate the anti-kickback law because an ownership interest was transferred for less than fair market value, the lawsuit contends. \u201cHMA provided an inducement to the joint venture physicians, one purpose of which was to encourage referrals to HMA facilities,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. This allegedly gives rise to false claims liability.\n\nHMA\u2019s outside counsel did not return a call from RMC. In a statement, HMA says \u201cas a matter of policy we do not comment on pending litigation. The existence of the government\u2019s investigation into the issues raised in the unsealed qui tam cases has been disclosed for some time in HMA\u2019s public SEC filings. While our legal team addresses these matters and continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing investigation, HMA associates and physicians who practice at our facilities are focused on providing the highest quality patient care in all of our hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe cases are United States ex rel.
