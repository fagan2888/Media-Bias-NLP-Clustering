In fact, it was the Soviets who were deep thinkers and the Americans who had the resources for new technology. But it was the Israelis, despite not having the brainpower, wealth, resources, or knowhow, who went out and learned how to put these pieces together and make them speak to each other, he said.\n\n\u201cAfter a period of soul-searching, the [Israelis] had a sense of urgency,\u201d said Gladwell. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the Soviet Union, as they were great on deep thinking theory, but bad on practice. You don\u2019t need to be the U.S. military, as it\u2019s not about new technologies anymore. Instead, you need to be Israel, who acted. They did this by believing that the task in front of them was of real urgency. It was due to their culture. Nothing of any real value will happen unless you are all convinced that we have a genuine crisis,\u201d he said to the audience, referring to American healthcare.\n\nGladwell\u2019s next story told a lesson in how to frame a problem. In the 1950s, the U.S. was spending more than five dollars on every ton of cargo shipped, placing a huge drain on the economy. While many others recognized this problem, none were able to frame the problem correctly and thus come up with a viable solution.\n\nThen came along Malcolm McLean, an American transport entrepreneur, who by realizing that the problem was about moving cargo from point A to point B\u2014and not about trucking or inventing new containers\u2014was able to cut the cost from $5.50/ton to 15 cents/ton, revolutionizing modern shipping. \u201cSuccess is only possible by an act of reframing,\u201d Gladwell said. \u201cOnly when people who can think about the right way to solve something, can they solve it.\u201d\n\nApplied to healthcare, Gladwell pointed out that Canadians didn\u2019t have the same struggle that Americans are currently having. \u201cWe agreed years ago how we wanted to frame the healthcare problem,\u201d said Gladwell, an English-Canadian. \u201cThere are many things to want in a healthcare system, such as freedom, innovation, technology, and low costs. [Canadians] wanted access and were willing to sacrifice all of those other things to get access. They agreed on a frame, and were thus able to pass, support, and successfully sustain universal healthcare ever since,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the amount of controversy that is being provoked with [the Affordable Care Act], we never had that conversation with ourselves,\u201d he continued, speaking of Americans. \u201cWhat do we want? We can\u2019t privilege everything we want simultaneously, and you can\u2019t solve a problem in isolation. There have to be multiple change agents. It has to be a collective effort.\"\n\nGladwell urged that you need to have a conversation about what you want before you can bring about meaningful change. \u201cYou need to have right frame. What are you trying to do and what are you trying to solve? And for American healthcare, it has to be everyone in the business of gathering and sharing data.\u201d\n\nGladwell\u2019s final story looked at the digital music industry revolution\u2014particularly the MP3 player, which first came along in 1998, marking the beginning of converting music to digital form. By 2007, Apple had sold 100 million iPods. Out of the digitization of so much music came musical interoperability, said Gladwell. \u201cBefore the digital music age, music was a prison to the device from which it was played,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you have complete interoperability and far greater consequences than anyone imagined\u2014no one predicted this revolution.\u201d\n\nWhile people in the music industry have been framing the transformation of their industry in terms of gloom and doom, Gladwell said it\u2019s really the opposite. During the first decade of the 21st century, revenue from live music performances tripled, Gladwell reported. \u201cThe industry found out that consumers didn\u2019t want to spend hours of browsing in record stores, but instead wanted one or two songs rather than the whole album. They wanted to spend their money on a real, live experience with a musician or band they loved. We returned to the way we listened to music for millennia, before detour during the 20th century,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Gladwell concluded, \u201cwhen we look at innovation, we make the mistake of thinking that innovation is specific to an individual invention or a device. The greatest transformation brought about by technology is when you bring the various pieces and have them work together in combination. It\u2019s the synergies that bring about the greatest changes in the world.\"", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe5b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe agreed years ago how we wanted to frame the healthcare problem,\u201d said Gladwell, an English-Canadian.\nOut of the digitization of so much music came musical interoperability, said Gladwell.\n\u201cOnly when people who can think about the right way to solve something, can they solve it.\u201dApplied to healthcare, Gladwell pointed out that Canadians didn\u2019t have the same struggle that Americans are currently having.\n\u201cBefore the digital music age, music was a prison to the device from which it was played,\u201d he said.\nGladwell urged that you need to have a conversation about what you want before you can bring about meaningful change."}
