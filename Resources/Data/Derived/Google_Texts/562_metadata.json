When these errors are the fault of the hospital, in theory malpractice lawsuits can compel the hospitals to pay for them, but in practice such lawsuits are so expensive and time-consuming that many lawyers whose pay depends on a victory won't take on anything less than a slam dunk.\n\n\"We'll never know if something has happened because of malpractice,\" John Goldberg of Harvard Law School told KHN, \"because it's not financially viable to bring a lawsuit.\"\n\nThere are no standardized policies for disputes over responsibilities for bad care outcomes, according to Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association's vice president of quality and patient safety policy. Some hospitals mandate transparency, with any necessary follow-up care at the hospital's expense, but that is not the case for most organizations.\n\nA number of hospital advocacy groups and agencies, from the American Medical Association to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, have endorsed more providers adopting such a policy. Massachusetts hospitals have also implemented a program aimed at making the post-error apology process more sincere and transparent and giving patients full information about compensation options.\n\nHowever, transparency is only one piece of the puzzle, according to the article, as many hospitals simply say an error was unavoidable, leaving patients or their insurance to cover the costs. Potential insurance liabilities mean hospitals also face pressure from employers to pay for unexpected care to defray the cost of insurance paying for the errors.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has worked to clear the air on who's responsible for certain errors; for example, Medicare will not cover fixing errors such as blood transfusions of the wrong type. The Affordable Care Act made similar classifications for Medicaid.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the KHN report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMass. hospitals rethink medical error response\n\nPhysician \"culture of perfection\" keeps medical errors high\n\nUpdated medical errors report shows progress\n\nCA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errors\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice risk", "article_metadata": {"description": "The question of who pays when something goes wrong in a healthcare setting seems simple enough, but the answer isn't straightforward due to so many variables,\u00a0according to\u00a0a report from\u00a0Kaiser Health News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthFinance", "description": "The question of who pays when something goes wrong in a healthcare setting seems simple enough, but the answer isn't straightforward due to so many variables,\u00a0according to\u00a0a report from\u00a0Kaiser Health News.", "title": "Financial responsibility for hospital medical errors: No easy answers", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthfinance.com/story/financial-responsibility-hospital-medical-errors-no-easy-answers/2015-11-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthfinance.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "healthcare costs,kaiser health news,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Malpractice,medical errors,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Physician Liability,To Err is Human,transparency", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "hospitals rethink medical error responsePhysician \"culture of perfection\" keeps medical errors highUpdated medical errors report shows progressCA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errorsHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice risk\nIt's been 16 years since the Institute of Medicine's landmark report \"To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System\" and two years since a study identified hospital medical errors as the nation's third-leading cause of death.\nPotential insurance liabilities mean hospitals also face pressure from employers to pay for unexpected care to defray the cost of insurance paying for the errors.\nSome hospitals mandate transparency, with any necessary follow-up care at the hospital's expense, but that is not the case for most organizations.\nThere are no standardized policies for disputes over responsibilities for bad care outcomes, according to Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association's vice president of quality and patient safety policy."}
