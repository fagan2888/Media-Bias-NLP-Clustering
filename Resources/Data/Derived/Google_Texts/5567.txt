Every child gets caught doing something stupid at some point, but not all of them get publicly humiliated for it on Facebook. A 12-year-old girl in Milwaukee experienced just that when her mom found out she was plotting a fight on a fake Facebook page.

Lorraine Walls was not a very happy mother when she found out her daughter, Luticia Green, created a fake Facebook identity after being forbidden from using the site. Green had been suspended for bullying and starting fights at school, and the Facebook freeze was her punishment.

“She had got caught sneaking a page on Facebook, twice,” Walls said. “She had already snuck back on Facebook, talking to some young guy, and plotting a fight with her friend.

When Walls figured out what was going on, she decided to teach her daughter a lesson by recording a video of her daughter apologizing for her bad behavior and publicly stating that she can no longer have a Facebook page or a boyfriend.

Although many have praised Walls for disciplining her child in this viral video, she has received backlash for statements like, “the next time she’s on Facebook and I catch her on Facebook, I’m beating the hell out of her.”

In an interview on CNN, Walls said that she would never actually hurt her daughter.

“She doesn’t get whoopings,” Walls clarified. “She’s not getting beat, she’s not getting abused.”

Walls, like any good parent, says she just wants the best for her daughter. Hopefully the 12-year-old learned her lesson.
