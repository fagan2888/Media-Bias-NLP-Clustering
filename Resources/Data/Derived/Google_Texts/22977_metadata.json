It's anticipated to carry on through Sunday in some regions.\n\nIt has already brought life to a standstill in many parts of the East Coast, including Washington, D.C. and New York City. Roads are inaccessible, public transit is shut down and in New York City, a police-enforced travel ban has gone into effect.\n\nNew York was originally predicted to see significantly less snowfall than many other affected areas, but the NWS has revised predicted snow totals up several times since the storm began. Now it's anticipating 24-30 inches for parts of the city.\n\nThe uptick in intensity has thrown the city into high alert. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for New York City on Saturday, joining multiple numerous states and cities farther south. Bus service in New York was suspended at noon, but transit workers are trying to keep the underground sections of the subway running.\n\nGov. Cuomo is also instituting a travel ban in the city, which took effect between 2:30 p.m. ET and 7 a.m. on Sunday. Drivers out on the road for non-emergencies during that time could be arrested. Broadway shows on Saturday have all been canceled, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has strongly urged any restaurants planning to stay open through the storm to shut down and send their employees home.\n\nThe D.C. area, where the entire public transit system is shut down all weekend, is expecting 2-3 feet of snow. Philadelphia is expecting up to 2 feet. You can see reported accumulations so far on the NWS site.\n\nAnd you can watch the storm's progress thanks to our friends at WNYC.\n\nAt least 10,000 flights have been canceled on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, FlightAware reports. United Airlines has canceled all of its Sunday flights at the two major airports in D.C. \u2014 and will have only very limited flights at Newark and other New York City airports. The major airports in the New York metro area remain open, but all flights there have been canceled.\n\nThe impact of so many cancellations stretches far beyond the storm's direct reach. On Friday, San Francisco had 15 percent of its flights canceled, and Detroit, Chicago and Orlando saw 10 percent of their flights drop off the boards.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have lost power \u2014 particularly in the Carolinas, where the storm dropped large quantities of ice as well as snow. In New Jersey alone, WHYY's Bobby Allyn reports that more than 40,000 people are without power.\n\nAuthorities continue to ask residents in storm-affected areas to stay home and stay off the roads. Driving is perilous in many areas: The Virginia Highway Patrol says they responded to nearly a thousand car crashes Friday night. At least 18 people have died due to the weather across the affected area, the AP reports.\n\nIn Kentucky, meanwhile, drivers on a stretch of Interstate 75 were stranded overnight as crashes shut down the roadway. The Kentucky State Police said on Twitter late Friday that the Red Cross set up shelters for motorists stranded by the interstate closure.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, the police tweeted that police officers and the National Guard were moving cars \"one at a time,\" and that emergency crews were bringing food, water and fuel to motorists trapped in their cars.\n\nA local TV reporter was stranded on the interstate in her news van, The Associated Press reports. \"Every time it looks like there's light at the end of the tunnel, more accidents and slide-offs are occurring,\" Caitlin Centner said, according to the wire service.\n\nOne traveling band \u2014 stuck on I-75 for 11 1/2 hours, according to their Twitter feed \u2014 sang through their woes.\n\nThe interstate has now been reopened, an official tells the AP, and no injuries were reported.\n\nMotorists on the Pennsylvania turnpike were also stuck, with some unable to move well into Saturday. The National Guard was called out to provide food and water to those motorists as well.\n\n\"Gov. Tom Wolf's office said the problems in Somerset County began after westbound tractor-trailers were unable to climb a hill,\" the AP reports. \"As traffic backed up behind them, more trucks also became unable to go up the hill, backing up all vehicles and preventing emergency crews from getting heavy-duty tow trucks to the scene and road crews from being able to clear the snow, officials said.\"\n\nThe AP spoke to a gymnastics team and a church group stuck on the turnpike, and both reported high spirits. The team noted that being stuck in cramped conditions wasn't too much of a challenge, since they were gymnasts, after all; the church group, returning to Indiana from an anti-abortion protest in D.C., told the wire service they were on a pilgrimage and \"there's going to be some suffering with that.\"\n\nBut the Duquesne men's basketball team, also trapped on the turnpike, was less sanguine. The coach told the AP the players were running out of leftover pizza.\n\nMeanwhile, as the storm is capturing the attention of millions of people, there isn't exactly agreement on what to call it.\n\nHurricanes are named by the National Hurricane Center, but there's no equivalent body for blizzards and snowstorms.\n\nThe Weather Channel \u2014 which has been naming winter storms since 2012 \u2014 dubbed the storm Jonas. (The name comes from a list recommended by a Latin club at a high school in Montana. The students are partial to mythology, and want you to know that if the Weather Channel ever gets to winter storm \"Yolo,\" that was not their idea.)\n\nBut not everybody is a fan of the Weather Channel's storm-naming: as NPR's Elise Hu wrote in 2013, it can easily be part of a \"hype cycle\" that doesn't serve the public interest. Identifying which winter storm systems are major events is also more subjective than identifying a hurricane.\n\nSo the National Weather Center has ignored the use of the name Jonas and is marking its tweets with the rather straightforward hashtag #WinterStorm.\n\nThe Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang, for its part, asked its readers to vote on the storm's name. Blizzard of 2016? (Not popular.) Snowtastrophe? (Meh, readers said.) Snownino? (Getting closer...)\n\nThe readership went with the Trumpian \"Make Winter Great Again,\" by a pretty wide margin.\n\nBut the Post's meteorologists overruled democracy. \"We've thought about it long and hard this morning and although Make Winter Great Again has the most votes \u2014 and is certainly hilarious \u2014 it doesn't make for a good name, or a good hashtag,\" they wrote.\n\nSo they opted for the runner-up, Snowzilla.\n\nWhatever you call it, this storm looks pretty dramatic from space.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Environment", "description": "The snow will glow white on the mountains tonight \u2014 the Appalachians, that is, from North Carolina through Pennsylvania.
