I would also like to thank the facilitators Anton Anday, Mitch Fisher, Steve Hodgson, Judy Rannow, Ron Strege and Jeff Whitrock, for giving of their free time to volunteer for this wonderful program.\n\nThrough this program, teens are given the opportunity to be directly involved in their community. The teens work with mentors, members of our community who also volunteer their time, who show the teens the ins and outs of how many programs in our city work and provide them insights on how to be a good leader. My son Cale was fortunate to be a member of this great group, and was able to give his input at a city meeting via an invitation from Portage County Executive Patty Dreier herself. Also, with mentor Sheriff Mike Lucas, my son was able to truly grow in many ways.\n\nThank you again to all of you who give of your time and talents to help our teens grow in the spirit of giving, helping and personal growth. You have a direct hand in forming our leaders of tomorrow.\n\nElaine Jakusz,\n\nStevens Point\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1MMShfg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Thanks to all the leaders and volunteers who worked on this great program for youth.", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "Thanks to all the leaders and volunteers who worked on this great program for youth.", "title": "Teen Leadership Portage County helped my son", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/06/17/teen-leadership-portage-county-helped-son/28901419/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to all the leaders and volunteers who worked on this great program for youth.", "title": "Teen Leadership Portage County helped my son", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db310633fbf7aa7cdb89abd31fb0f80a7495f6e0/c=212-0-801-589&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/17/StevensPoint/B9317756036Z.1_20150617214828_000_G2KB3LPLF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e65\"", "article_summary": "Teen Leadership Portage County (Photo: Screenshot)EDITOR: I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Lauri Rockman, coordinator of Teen Leadership Portage County.\nMy son Cale was fortunate to be a member of this great group, and was able to give his input at a city meeting via an invitation from Portage County Executive Patty Dreier herself.\nThank you again to all of you who give of your time and talents to help our teens grow in the spirit of giving, helping and personal growth.\nAlso, with mentor Sheriff Mike Lucas, my son was able to truly grow in many ways.\nThrough this program, teens are given the opportunity to be directly involved in their community."}
