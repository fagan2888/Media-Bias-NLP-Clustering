Today, nearly 150 years later, the actual process has made giant technological strides, but now, it\u2019s the topic that\u2019s explosive.\n\nWhile the White House has been encouraging Christmas dinner table conversation to center around Obamacare, in my experience, it is fracking that came into the conversation\u2014and when it did, the results had the potential to be as explosive as the early practice.\n\nOver the holidays two young adults came home for Christmas. Somehow hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d came into the conversation. Dad, a reader of my column whose employment is also peripherally connected to the oil-and-gas industry, spoke up in support of the practice that has unleashed America\u2019s natural resources and made us the world leader in energy production. His children, and their friends who had gathered in his home, were shocked and spouted the usual claims of water contamination, harsh chemicals, and flaming faucets. The topic became so explosive that his kids packed up and left before the festivities even began.\n\nI was in California for Christmas. I visited a cousin in Napa Valley whose adult son is in the wine business. He was at her home when I arrived. She told him what I do and stated that he had many friends in the oil-and-gas business. I smiled and said: \u201cI can talk oil, gas, coal, nuclear, fracking, whatever\u2026\u201d My cousin quickly interrupted and stated: \u201cWe probably don\u2019t want to talk fracking.\u201d I took the hint, and we moved on to another topic. Driving back to my brother\u2019s house, I wondered: \u201cWhen did fracking become an explosive topic.\u201d\n\nWith the Christmas prime rib consumed, my family and friends were still gathered around the table. Once again fracking came up. I shared the previous two recent stories. One woman asserted that if her sister, who was arriving in a few days from Boulder, Colorado, was there and we talked fracking, the results would be explosive, too.\n\nBecause they are not in the industry, I found that the group gathered around our table had misconceptions about the process that they\u2019d picked up from the media.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t have an exact date when the topic of fracking became explosive, I do know, from my speaking and writing on the topic, from radio interviews with listener call-ins, and private conversations, that the explosive reactions are due to a lack of understanding about the process\u2014with the two biggest concerns being about water and chemicals.\n\nWater\n\nAs I\u2019ve written previously, there are accusations that fracking is taking billions of gallons of water out of the hydrologic cycle. Especially in the southwest where water is scarce and drought conditions persist, this poses a problem.\n\nThe process of hydraulic fracturing has advanced from the first nitroglycerin \u201ctorpedo\u201d that was shot down a well hole on April 25, 1865, and well acidizing that was used in the 1930s to enhance productivity, to the modern mix of high pressure, water, and chemicals\u2014and it continues to evolve and become more economical.\n\nIn a piece addressing water used in fracking, The Economist describes the process this way: \u201cWater injected at high pressure into rock deep underground during the process of hydraulic fracturing, or \u2018fracking,\u2019 often returns to the surface as brine, having picked up a lot of salt on its journey. It is also contaminated with chemicals from the fracking process itself.\u201d\n\nToday, less and less freshwater is being used\u2014especially in the arid southwest where water for drinking and agriculture is at a premium. A typical frack job can use as much as 5 million gallons of water and lasts about 3 days. The procedure can result in decades of oil or gas production.\n\nWith the development of new technologies, the fracking process can be done with brackish water that may be as much as ten times as salty as seawater. A recentreport from Reuters, titled \u201cFracking without freshwater at a west Texas oil field,\u201d documents some of the advancements. Billions of gallons of brackish water are located far below the fresh water aquifers. Producers in west Texas are fracking with the brackish water from the Santa Rosa aquifer. They are then recycling the produced water\u2014a byproduct of oil and natural gas drilling, and the flowback water\u2014the fluid pushed back out of the well during fracking. Both forms of wastewater have historically been trucked to underground disposal wells.\n\nA couple of months ago, I participated in the Executive Oil Conference in Midland, Texas where a panel of water experts addressed the crowd of more than 800 attendees and discussed the new technologies.\n\nNow, instead of trucking wastewater to a remote location, mobile systems can treat the water onsite and condition it to meet almost any specification the driller wants\u2014resulting in a reduction of expensive truck traffic. The portable systems can treat 20,000-30,000 barrels of water per day. For bigger frack jobs, additional units can be added\u2014making the system totally flexible.\n\nThese new water solutions can reduce the total dissolved solids in the water from as high as 200,000 to below 200. For reference, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s standard for drinking water is 500. The same water can be recycled and used over and over again. Addressing the new technologies, James Welch, Global Business Development Manager, Water Solutions, with Halliburton, told the crowd: \u201cProduced water is not a waste. It is an opportunity. It is an offset to freshwater usage.\u201d Halliburton is able to fracture with water that\u2019s 280,000 TDS.\n\nThe result of these new procedures is, according to The Economist: \u201cClean water \u2026pure enough to be used for irrigation, or even drinking water. \u2026Alternatively, it can be re-injected into the ground during the next frack.\u201d\n\nRather than taking water out of the hydrologic cycle, the oil-and-gas industry is actually often taking formerly unusable water, using it in fracking and then cleaning it up to a level where it can be introduced into the cycle as either irrigation or drinking water.\n\nStan Weiner, Chairman and CEO at STW Resources, was one of the panelists. He summed up the new water solutions by saying: \u201cNow we\u2019ve figured out a way to clean it up economically. There\u2019s no reason not to use it. Companies nationwide, worldwide, all want to do this. We get no resistance from them. They want to see it work. It\u2019s a go.\u201d\n\nGE (as addressed in The Economist), Apache Corp. (as covered by Reuters), Halliburton, and STW Resources are just a handful of the many companies, which are developing revolutionary water treatment processes that neuter one of the biggest arguments against fracking.\n\nChemicals\n\nIn our Christmas conversation, someone asked: \u201cWhy do they need chemicals? Why don\u2019t they just frack with water?\u201d She\u2019d heard stories.\n\nI explained that the so-called chemicals are needed to provide lubrication for the tiny particles of sand that hold open microscopic cracks in the \u201cfractured\u201d rock that allow the oil or gas to escape. \u201cAs a woman, I am sure you\u2019ve had your fingers swell. That makes it hard to get your rings off.\u201d She nodded. \u201cWhat do you do then?\u201d I queried. \u201cSoap my hands up,\u201d she replied.\n\nBingo!\n\nThat is the role the chemicals play in the fracking process. But those chemicals are now mostly food-based and can be consumed with no ill effects\u2014both Governor Hickenlooper (D-CO) and CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer have had a drink.\n\nSo, even if the chemicals did somehow defy geology and migrate several miles from the fracked well through the layers of sedimentary rock to the aquifer, they are not harmful.\n\nTo illustrate the point, I am in the process of organizing what I am calling \u201cthe great New Mexico fracktail party.\u201d I have several state legislators lined up\u2014and am looking for more. I need to find an operator who is willing to invite us onsite when a frack job is being done. The legislators, industry folks, and anyone else who wants to participate, will be invited to the location with cocktail glass in hand (umbrella, fruit, olive\u2014whatever\u2014included). With media cameras rolling we\u2019ll pour the fracfluid from the tank to our glasses and toast to American energy freedom.\n\nMy sister-in-law asked: \u201cWhat about the flaming faucets?\u201d \u201cThose are real,\u201d I explained. \u201cBut they have nothing to do with fracking.\u201d Natural gas, or methane, was found in water wells long before any fracking was done in the area. In fact, it was the gassy smell that often alerted explorers to the potential oil and gas in the region. Oil-and-gas drilling didn\u2019t cause the flaming faucet phenomenon. Quite the contrary. The presence of gas near the surface brought about the \u201cdon\u2019t smoke in the shower\u201d adage. While the water is harmless to consume, a gas build up in the house could cause an explosion.\n\nLies about hydraulic fracturing are rampant. If fossil fuel opponents can spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about fracking\u2014with the goal of causing a federal fracking ban, they can virtually stop oil-and-gas development in America, as it is estimated that 90 percent of producing wells have been fracked. Without American ingenuity and increasing production, gasoline prices and utility bills will skyrocket. Economic ruin will reign. America will, once again be beholden to increasingly hostile foreign sources.\n\nA fracking conversation shouldn\u2019t be explosive. Today\u2019s hydraulic fracturing is really benign, American technology that is ecologically sound and economically advantageous. Keep these facts in mind. As my stories illustrate, not everyone will listen\u2014but if more people, such as my brother and sister-in-law, know the truth they can help de-fuse the explosive conversation.\n\n[Originally published on Townhall.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/01/the-secret-danger-liberals-dont-want-you-to-know-fracking-is-safe/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frack.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "The Secret Danger Liberals Don\u2019t Want You to Know: Fracking is Safe"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Today\u2019s hydraulic fracturing is really benign, American technology that is ecologically sound and economically advantageous.\nSomehow hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d came into the conversation.\nHydraulic fracturing started out as an \u201cexploding torpedo\u201d back in 1865.\nThat is the role the chemicals play in the fracking process.\nWith the development of new technologies, the fracking process can be done with brackish water that may be as much as ten times as salty as seawater."}
