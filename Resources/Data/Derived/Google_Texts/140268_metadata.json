Larry Buschon of Indiana, which passed the House in early-March, aimed at stopping fraud by requiring providers to enroll with states and report any terminated providers to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and require the states to pay back federal funds used toward improper payments.\n\nWhy Do You There Is So Much Fraud In Medicaid?
