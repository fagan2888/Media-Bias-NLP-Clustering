“The best part of my job is brainstorming ideas, finding the proper form and function and pairing that with original creative design” said Freeman.

Freeman also designed marketing for the McCoy Real Estate Team while dating Realtor Nikki McCoy. “I remember designing ads for Jennifer & Nikki then somehow I became a full-time Realtor and married my best friend/soul mate” said Bobby with a big smile on his face.

In his first year as an agent, Freeman received a Rising Star award from his Brokers. Since then he has achieved numerous sales awards and has recently been presented with the prestigious RE/MAX Hall of Fame Award.
