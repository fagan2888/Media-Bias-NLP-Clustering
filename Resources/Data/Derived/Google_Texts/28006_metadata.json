It can even be fatal,\u201d Hall said. \u201cSo the key is to get early, sound, reasonable treatment and to complete the whole course of medication.\"\n\nShe said there will be additional testing in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cIt does spread very slowly so even though we've started testing the close contacts this week\u2014 in fact we're doing testing today and tomorrow at the schools\u2014 we'll return in about 8-10 weeks to do additional tests because, again, you could be exposed and it could take a little bit for it to spread,\u201d Hall said.\n\nTB is spread through the air from one person to another when a person with TB in the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. People nearby can breathe in the bacteria and become infected.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said TB is not spread by shaking someone's hand, sharing food or drink, touching bed linens or toilet seats, sharing toothbrushes or kissing.\n\nIn 2014, there were 25 reported cases of TB in Pinellas County. In February, the Florida Department of Health announced historic lows for the incidence of TB statewide. For four years in a row, cases have dropped about 29 percent.\n\nThe symptoms of TB may include:\n\nA cough lasting three or more weeks that may produce discolored or bloody sputum\n\nUnintended weight loss\n\nFatigue\n\nSlight fever\n\nNight sweats\n\nChills\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nPain with breathing or coughing\n\nInformation for parents about the TB investigation (in English and Spanish) is posted at http://www.pinellashealth.com.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A possible case of tuberculosis at Pinellas Park High School has prompted free testing for students, teachers and staff who may have had close contact with", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/pinellas-park-student-suspected-tuberculosis", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201504/tuberculosis_sneezing.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A possible case of tuberculosis at Pinellas Park High School has prompted free testing for students, teachers and staff who may have had close contact with", "title": "Pinellas Park Student Suspected Of Tuberculosis"}, "story_id": 402618025, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DaylinaMiller"}, "author": "Daylina Miller", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Pinellas Park Student Suspected Of Tuberculosis"}, "nid": 10433, "datePublished": "2015-04-27", "keywords": "tuberculosis, bacterial infection, Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County, Pinellas County Schools", "wordCount": 487, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4e6\"", "article_summary": "The Department of Health of Pinellas County is investigating a possible case of tuberculosis that a Pinellas Park High School student may have.\nStudents are being tested Monday and Tuesday after the Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County was made aware of the case last week.\nThe disease is serious, but easily treated, said Maggie Hall, the public information officer for the Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County.\nIn 2014, there were 25 reported cases of TB in Pinellas County.\nA possible case of tuberculosis at Pinellas Park High School has prompted free testing for students, teachers and staff who may have had close contact with the 17-year-old who attends the school."}
