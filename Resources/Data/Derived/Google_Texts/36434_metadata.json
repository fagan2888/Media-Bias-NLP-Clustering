Seven \"eligibility specialists\" began working this week to help inmates complete their insurance applications, and they signed 22 inmates up for continuing care during their first day on the job.\n\nCounty health officials say they hope to create a \"warm handoff\" from in-custody care to civilian care. Often, uninsured inmates who can't afford medical bills forego treatment once they are released from jail.\n\n\"The jail is the primary place where many inmates receive care, and we are trying very hard to change that, said Nancy Griffith, the county's director of corrections health.\n\nNational jail standards require governing bodies to provide healthcare for inmates. Historically, the cost has fallen upon the local government running the jail.\n\nMultnomah County pays to provide mental health, dental, and medical care to 35,000 inmates yearly, at a cost of $15.7 million to the county, county spokeswoman Julie Sullivan said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the county will still be responsible for funding in-jail care of inmates who are on Medicaid, but the county could bill Medicaid for inmates' hospital trips of longer than 24 hours. That alone could bring a savings of $1 million annually.\n\nCounty officials believe new provisions in the Affordable Care Act could also allow inmates who are privately insured to bill their provider for services received while they are in jail, but have not yet had a trial.\n\nCounty officials estimate about 70 to 80 percent of the jail population is eligible for Medicaid, while up to 10 percent are privately insured.\n\n\"If there's a venue to be reimbursed and we're eligible, we're going to be pursuing that,\" said Vanetta Abdellatif, the county health department's director of integrated clinical services.\n\nMy colleague, Les Zaits, wrote in November about a similar state program to enroll prisoners in Medicaid.
