New Yorkers who sign up for the city’s new municipal identification card will get access to one-year free membership packages at 33 of New York City’s most prominent cultural institutions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday.

The mayor and other officials said they hope the wide range of benefits – including free admission to major museums, complimentary rehearsal passes at performance halls, discounted theater tickets – will draw more people to sign up for the ID card, which is scheduled to launch in January. The free membership packages will not be available to existing members of a participating institution, or to those people whose membership lapsed since January 2012.

“The municipal ID is a powerful tool to bring more New Yorkers out of the shadows and into the mainstream,” Mr. de Blasio said. “It is now also a key that opens the door for hundreds of thousands of more New Yorkers to our city’s premiere assets in culture, science and entertainment.”

By connecting perks to the ID card, officials hope to counteract any potential stigma that might come with it.

Participating institutions include the New York Botanical Garden, Staten Island Zoo, New York City Ballet and the Brooklyn Museum.
