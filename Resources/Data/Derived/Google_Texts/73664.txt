Firetruck sirens and Sparky the fire dog greeted runners as they were dispatched from the South Oldham Fire Station to begin the inaugural South Oldham Fire Run 5K Run/Walk Saturday afternoon. The event, designed to raise money for the South Oldham Auxiliary, Supporting Heroes and WHAS Crusade for Children, took runners down a tiki-torch-lit Old La

Grange Road and through the beautiful Yew Dell Botanical Gardens.

Heather Caudill of the Highlands thought the race was wonderful. "It was very scenic and beautiful," said Caudill. "Everyone was very friendly and very encouraging, cheering everyone along."

"I think it was absolutely awesome," said South Oldham Fire Auxiliary President Pamela Dumm. With 120 runners in attendance, the event surpassed its goal, and Dumm felt that the race helped bring the community together, teaching people about what first responders and firefighters really do.

South Oldham firefighter Mike Miller ran the race in 65 pounds of firefighter gear alongside his wife, daughter and two sons. Miller hoped that he could help instill an appreciation for exercise, health and wellness in his children. "I hope that they can see that they can do things like that later in life, or even now," Miller stated.
