President Obama invited three YouTube stars to the White House Thursday to give an unconventional interview and undoubtedly attract the young audiences of the three online personalities.

GloZell Green, Bethany Mota and Hank Green were each allotted time to question the president on select topics like college cost, North Korea, Cuba, cyberbullying, marijuana legalization and criminal justice system reform.

GloZell — the self-professed “Queen of YouTube” — delivered perhaps the most animated series of inquiries to Obama, in particular questioning the president’s recent reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.

Alleging that Cuban President Raul Castro “puts the ‘d–k’ in dictatorship,” GloZell wondered why Obama chose to normalize the U.S. relationship with the country.

“When you do something over and over again for 50 years, it’s time to try something new,” the president responded, later assuring her, “By normalizing relations, we’re going to still be able to put pressure on the Cuban government.”

GloZell also brought up the Sony hacking incident, wondering why the government didn’t make Sony Pictures feel more protected in order to maintain the release of “The Interview.” She said that such a threat on free speech affects her and her audience of 5 million.

“The challenge we’ve got is that most of the Internet and the infrastructure that allows you to be posting on YouTube … most of that stuff is in private hands … not public hands,” Obama explained, adding that the government must work with these private companies to protect against hacks.

“The hacking against Sony,” the president continued, “it wasn’t even that sophisticated, but it just goes to show how vulnerable we are.”

However, he insisted that GloZell’s YouTube channel will not be compromised by such hacks.

“You’re going to be alright,” said Obama. “People are still going to be able to watch your show, I promise.”

At the end of the interview, GloZell gifted Obama three of her signature green lipsticks, one for his “first wife” — which she immediately corrected to first lady — and the other two for his daughters, Sasha and Malia.

Bethany Mota, the 19-year-old YouTube sensation who posts videos containing advice on makeup and home decoration, began her interview by asking the president about the “best longterm plan” for making college tuition more affordable for today’s young Americans.

“College remains the best investment you can make,” Obama insisted.

He went on to spotlight how his administration has expanded access to Pell Grants and pushed for student loans with lower interest rates in order to help students pay for college. Unsurprisingly, he also touted his recent “free” community college proposal, labeling it a “good option for a lot of young people.”

When asked about his favorite television show, Obama admitted that he is “mostly watching SportsCenter,” a point that he already made known during an ESPN Radio interview last December.

The third Internet personality, Hank Green of the vlogbrothers YouTube channel, questioned Obama more seriously on North Korea, the legalization of marijuana and the criminal justice system.

At the end of the interview, he told the president that Obamacare has enabled him to afford necessary medication that he otherwise couldn’t, expressing his thanks to Obama for the health care law.

The live YouTube interviews concluded with a “group selfie,” which found the three video bloggers huddling around the president. GloZell offered up a priceless facial expression.
