The two wounded students were in stable condition as of Monday night.\n\nRELATED: 12 WEAPONS THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING\n\nThe shooting was just the latest in a rash of such incidents \u2013 including one last December 14 in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 elementary school children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. A mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in September by a mentally ill 34-year-old man named Aaron Alexis, who had complained of hearing voices, also left 12 people dead.\n\nAn outraged and sorrowful President Obama asked the nation last December after the Newtown school shooting, \u201cAre we really prepared to say we\u2019re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?\u201d He enlisted Vice President Joe Biden to run the biggest gun control push in generations \u2013 urging Congress to approve an assault weapons ban and background checks for all buyers.\n\nLobbyists for the National Rifle Association and lawmakers from anti-gun control districts prevented much of anything from moving forward.\n\nThe total economic impact of the U.S. firearms industry in 2012 was estimated to be nearly $32 billion, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, up from $27.8 billion in 2009.\n\nFormer Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), herself a victim of gun violence, and her astronaut husband, Mark Kelly, have been leading a national movement to promote checks on gun buyers. The couple owns their own guns. During his attendance at a gun show recently, Kelly said, \u201cAt the federal level we still have no requirement for background checks at gun shows, but states like New York are fixing the loophole. [New York\u2019s] model helps keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them, like criminals and the dangerously mentally ill, without infringing on our Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nThe Empire State has created a new code of conduct, spearheaded by State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, in which gun show organizations agree to conduct background checks at their events.\n\nGiffords and Schneiderman explained it this way in a Washington Post opinion piece: \u201cGuns are tagged at the entrance to the show. Show operators provide access to federally licensed gun dealers to do background checks before completing a sale. All guns are checked on the way out to ensure that background checks were performed.\u201d\n\nAfter the Newtown tragedy, meanwhile, many schools this year ramped up security measures, including new ID requirements and scanners at building access points, more security cameras and even armed guards.\n\nHere are some of the deadliest shootings in the country to date \u2013 though they\u2019re hardly the only ones:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Sparks, Nevada, school shooting has once again ignited a long and bitter debate ab", "title": "Shoot-to-Kill School Violence Still a National Threat", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/22/Shoot-Kill-School-Violence-Still-National-Threat", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01262013_Gun_Control_March_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/22/Shoot-Kill-School-Violence-Still-National-Threat", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01262013_Gun_Control_March_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Sparks, Nevada, school shooting has once again ignited a long and bitter debate ab", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde01e\"", "article_summary": "The Sparks, Nevada, school shooting has once again ignited a long and bitter debate about comprehensive gun control.\nThe total economic impact of the U.S. firearms industry in 2012 was estimated to be nearly $32 billion, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, up from $27.8 billion in 2009.\nShow operators provide access to federally licensed gun dealers to do background checks before completing a sale.\nFormer Rep.
