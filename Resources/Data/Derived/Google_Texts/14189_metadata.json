Opponents say that the language in the Affordable Care Act makes the subsidies illegal in states using the federal marketplace. That includes Florida.\n\nBurwell, who has made a sweep of Florida and several other states since the federal marketplace opened Saturday, said the agency invested a lot of time in trying to avoid a repeat of last year's bumpy start for enrollment.\n\nIn the first two days, Burwell says, more than 1 million Americans visited the HealthCare.gov website, and more than 100,000 submitted an application. Another 200,000 reached out to the call center, including 20,000 to Spanish-speaking representatives, she said.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of users are having a good experience,\" Burwell said. When problems crop up, she said, \"we are tracking them down quickly.\"\n\nShe predicted that \"There will be problems. It is a large and complicated website,\" but said the resources to fix them are in place.\n\nEnrollment on HealthCare.gov lasts through February 15.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
