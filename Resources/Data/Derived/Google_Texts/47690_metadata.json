I want to reverse it ASAP, because I hear it leads to more problems than just tooth decay. What\u2019s my next step? \u2014 Kathy L., Eugene, Oregon\n\nA: You\u2019re smart to want to get control of your oral health.\n\nYour timing is great, too; there\u2019s breakthrough research that\u2019s discovered a pretty simple way for you to reduce gum problems and cut your risk for several major diseases in the process.\n\nPeriodontal disease is an inflammatory gum disease that causes pockets to form between the gum and teeth, where food is trapped and provides fuel for infection; this can lead to jawbone erosion. The inflammation affects your whole body. It\u2019s associated with everything from bad breath and tooth loss to Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, memory loss, pneumonia and even cancer.\n\nSome research shows that men with gum disease are 54 percent more likely to develop pancreatic cancer and 49 percent more likely to have kidney cancer. And women are probably at a similar risk.\n\nUp to now, most PD treatments focused on improving oral hygiene (flossing at least once and brushing at least twice a day) and often your dental professional would prescribe antibiotics. But the latest research makes it clear that the smart move is to attack the inflammation.\n\nStart by taking 2,000 mg of DHA omega- 3 every day for three months along with low-dose aspirin (81 mg to 162 mg \u2014 ask your doc if it\u2019s OK for you). That shrinks gum pockets and reduces measurable levels of two inflammation markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin-1 beta) in gum tissue.\n\nAspirin, taken along with DHA, makes omega-3s more useable by the body. (We think all men 35 and older and women 45 and up should talk to their doc about taking 162 mg of aspirin daily with 1/2 glass warm water before and after.) Also, improve your oral hygiene; eliminate inflammatory foods \u2014 added sugars and syrups, refined grains, red meat \u2014 and get at least 30 minutes of added physical activity a day. Soon you\u2019ll be smiling more, and so will your dentist.\n\nQ: I think working in my office five days a week is unproductive and unhealthy. I\u2019m sitting all day \u2014 stressed and eating badly \u2014 and I\u2019m constantly interrupted. If I worked from home a few days a week I could be more productive and healthier. How can I convince my boss it\u2019s a good idea not just for me, but for the company? \u2014 Paula M., Butte, Montana\n\nA: There are a lot of studies that show how healthier employees make better allaround employees. Dr. Mike\u2019s Cleveland Clinic Wellness Center does a great job of helping employers set up programs that promote healthy lifestyles.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve proved that these programs benefit both employees and the business (by reducing health-care costs and increasing productivity).\n\nYou could suggest to your boss that in exchange for working from home, you\u2019ll set health goals \u2014 to lower cholesterol or lose weight and increase your physical activity.\n\nYou also can discuss other ways to increase your productivity and quality of work when you reduce interruptions by working from home.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting new study that reveals how quantity and quality of work suffer measurably when employees are constantly interrupted \u2014 a typical office employee is interrupted around six times an hour!\n\nJust think about how much trouble you have trying to carry on a coherent conversation as you write an effective email!\n\nWe suggest you explain to your boss that you\u2019re glad to multitask. Switching from one task to another in an orderly way is something the brain is made to do. But that\u2019s very different from being derailed by interruptions.\n\nExplain that your goal is to get more work done at a higher quality.\n\nOffer to check your email once an hour when you work from home and, at the office, ask if urgent issues (they\u2019re pretty rare) could come to your attention via IM. That should focus your boss\u2019s attention!\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
