The game will be televised on TBS, which along with CBS signed a 14-year, $10.8 billion contract with the NCAA for the rights to the tournament in 2010. The Atlantic Coast Conference, to which both schools belong, will earn a record $40 million from the tournament. Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim and North Carolina coach Roy Williams each reportedly earn about $2 million annually. Aside from scholarships, none of the players on either team will receive financial compensation.\n\nBoth Syracuse and North Carolina are emerging from NCAA compliance scandals. A 2015 NCAA investigation of the Syracuse men\u2019s basketball program revealed \u201cacademic misconduct, extra benefits, the failure to follow its drug testing policy and impermissible booster activity.\u201d The university voluntarily sat out last year\u2019s tournament in an effort to avoid harsher NCAA sanctions; Boeheim was suspended for nine games earlier this season. North Carolina is awaiting the announcement of NCAA sanctions \u2014 which, conveniently, has been delayed until after the lucrative tournament \u2014 stemming from a decades-long pattern of academic fraud involving a \u201cshadow curriculum\u201d of fake classes taken by student-athletes.\n\nThe injustice, corruption and exploitation at the heart of college athletics are dissected in the new book \u201cIndentured: The Inside Story of the Rebellion Against the NCAA,\u201d by New York Times columnist Joe Nocera and New York Times contributing writer Ben Strauss. \u201cIndentured\u201d explores the history of big money in college athletics and the ongoing fight to reform the NCAA, an organization that Nocera and Strauss believe acts against the interests of the very student-athletes it sanctimoniously claims to protect.\n\nJoe Nocera joined Salon for a conversation about \u201cIndentured\u201d and the state of college sports:\n\nDo you see Saturday\u2019s Final Four game between Syracuse and the University of North Carolina as an embodiment of some of the larger problems in college sports?\n\nWhat it embodies is the extent to which the bargain between the university and the student is a corrupt bargain for the student. Because in both cases, but especially the UNC case, at the heart of it was what they call academic fraud. Basically, the athletes at UNC were not getting a legitimate education. They were taking these fake classes to stay eligible \u2014 they were majoring in eligibility. At Syracuse, for all the time they spent investigating, ultimately the main bad thing that happened was that an academic counselor took a test for Fab Melo, which is also a form of academic fraud. They embody the way the system deprives athletes \u2014 especially football and men\u2019s basketball players \u2014 of the education that they\u2019re promised.\n\nHas the NCAA\u2019s handling of the punishments relating to these cases exposed its underlying profit motive?\n\nWell, of course. Take the example down in Louisville, where they self-imposed a penalty to try and lighten the load. Or at Ohio State, where they basically said players got impermissible benefits, but they weren\u2019t going to get penalized until the following season because they had to play in the Sugar Bowl where there was a lot of money at stake. UNC is sort of the same thing. It\u2019s hard to believe that the NCAA doesn\u2019t already know what it\u2019s going to do, what the problem is, but here we are in the Final Four, and everybody\u2019s going to try to ignore it until they get through it and all they money is made. The ACC is getting somewhere around $40 million because of their success in this tournament.\n\nWhy do you think indentured servitude is an apt metaphor for the current state of college sports?\n\nIndentured servants were people who basically worked for someone else for years, for no money, with restrictions on their movement and a limited ability to leave until a prearranged point. They were indentured to these other people, and college athletes are in many ways indentured. They have limited movement, they are deprived of many rights that every other American and every other student on campus has, and basically, they\u2019re in a system where everyone is getting rich off their labors and they get nothing of monetary value whatsoever. In fact, the NCAA is setting limits on their compensation, which you would think would be against the law.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also restricting athletes\u2019 ability to profit from the use of their own image, which is maybe even more egregious.\n\nThey don\u2019t have the right to use their name, image and likeness; they don\u2019t have the right to endorse; they don\u2019t have the right to get money from their autograph. In high school, if their mother takes money to go on a recruiting trip with them, that\u2019s a violation \u2014 they don\u2019t have the right to do that. The NCAA\u2019s definition of amateurism is really quite all-encompassing and incredibly onerous.\n\nThe NCAA holds up amateurism as the be-all and end-all in college athletics. Does that idea hold up under scrutiny?\n\nThey say a couple of things. First, they say, \u201cThey can\u2019t be paid because they\u2019re students.\u201d And then they say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re students, so they can\u2019t be paid.\u201d The truth is that any other student on campus can be paid. And, in fact, they can be paid by the university and they\u2019re still students. So that\u2019s really a pretty bogus rationale.\n\nThe other rationale they have is that amateurism is kind of the special sauce of college sports. If you took amateurism away and you started to pay the players, you would wreck what was special about college sports. The fans would be turned off, the alumni would be turned off, the student body would be turned off, and they would lose what makes it special. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. I think what\u2019s true is that they want to have some knowledge that the players are actually students at the university. Although in cases like the University of Kentucky men\u2019s basketball team, you sort of have to wonder if even that is something people care about, given that most of those players just spend one semester in school and then basically don\u2019t go to class for the second semester and then go pro.\n\nA classic defense that you hear from supporters of the NCAA is that the scholarship athletes are getting a free education and thus don\u2019t deserve additional compensation. How do you respond to that line of thinking?\n\nI think it\u2019s off-base for two reasons. The first is that athletes should have rights. Part of those rights are economic rights. They should get what their value is. Most of them won\u2019t go pro. They have this tiny window to make some money on their athletic ability and they\u2019re deprived of that.\n\nSo you could say, \u201cOK, they\u2019re getting a scholarship that\u2019s going to be worth a couple hundred thousand dollars, and more importantly, they\u2019re going to get an education.\u201d But the truth is that when you\u2019re a college athlete \u2014 especially if you\u2019re a football or men\u2019s basketball player \u2014 you are on the campus to generate revenue for the university. That\u2019s your job, and that comes before academics every time. You don\u2019t get to pick the majors that you want, you don\u2019t get to pick the classes that you want, you miss tons of classes because you\u2019re traveling. That\u2019s what you\u2019re there for. So the idea that they\u2019re supposed to be satisfied with an education, which is basically substandard at best, is kind of a fraudulent argument.\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019m arguing, aside from all the pay stuff, is that there should be lifetime scholarships. Athletes should not have to take a full course load. They should be able to get by with one or two classes a semester and then finish their education when their eligibility is done. I think it would be harder for people like me to argue that they were getting a substandard education if they had lifetime scholarships and if they had the ability to go back to school and get that education after their playing days were over.\n\nWhy has this conversation only become mainstream in the last five years or so? I suspect the explanation goes beyond simply the attention the issue has received because of the O\u2019Bannon case and coverage like your 2011 piece in the New York Times Magazine and the 2011 cover story in The Atlantic.\n\nJay Bilas, who is a huge advocate for paying the players, told me that when he was a college athlete he thought a lot about things players were deprived of, like health care and so on. But he didn\u2019t really think about money, because his coach, Mike Krzyzewski, only made $100,000. Today, Mike Krzyzewski makes $10 million.\n\nCollege sports has gone from a business that was hundreds of millions of dollars to being a business that\u2019s literally billions of dollars. It\u2019s a giant entertainment industry. I think one of the reasons people have latched onto this, why more sports writers and columnists are writing about it, why the average fan is thinking about it, is just because college sports is so saturated in money.\n\nIt\u2019s also because everything else about college sports is so blatantly commercialized. You have the NCAA sponsors, the bowl games all have corporate names, the players wear logos for Nike and other corporations. So to have all of that and to say, \u201cWell, the players shouldn\u2019t get any of this,\u201d is so blatantly hypocritical that more and more people are looking up from the game itself and saying, \u201cGee, there\u2019s something really screwy with this system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Indentured\" co-author Joe Nocera discusses exploitation in college sports and efforts to reform the NCAA", "title": "\u201cThe system deprives athletes of the education that they\u2019re promised\u201d: Joe Nocera on the injustice of college sports", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Indentured\" co-author Joe Nocera discusses exploitation in college sports and efforts to reform the NCAA", "title": "\u201cThe system deprives athletes of the education that they\u2019re promised\u201d: Joe Nocera on the injustice of college sports", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/02/the_system_deprives_athletes_of_the_education_that_theyre_promised_joe_nocera_on_the_injustice_of_college_sports/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/syracuse_basketball.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Indentured\" co-author Joe Nocera discusses exploitation in college sports and efforts to reform the NCAA", "title": "\u201cThe system deprives athletes of the education that they\u2019re promised\u201d: Joe Nocera on the injustice of college sports", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/syracuse_basketball.jpg", "creator": "@@mi_garofalo", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Garofalo", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Strauss, College Sports, Editor's Picks, Indentured, Joe Nocera, NCAA, NCAA Tournament, O'Bannon case, Sports", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They embody the way the system deprives athletes \u2014 especially football and men\u2019s basketball players \u2014 of the education that they\u2019re promised.\nIf you took amateurism away and you started to pay the players, you would wreck what was special about college sports.\nAnd, in fact, they can be paid by the university and they\u2019re still students.\nBut he didn\u2019t really think about money, because his coach, Mike Krzyzewski, only made $100,000.\nSo the idea that they\u2019re supposed to be satisfied with an education, which is basically substandard at best, is kind of a fraudulent argument."}
