Julian Casablancas + the Voidz took the stage 10 minutes late to a loud roar at Governors Ball on Friday (June 6). The former Strokes frontman's band was decked out in throwback '80s grunge garb, with Julian rocking a black leather vest and jersey. His stage left guitarist earned a best dressed nod in a vintage NASCAR shirt, pink hat and leopard jacket, paired perfectly with a moustache and mullet cut. '80s distorted rock paired with Americana videography was the name of the game, as the group launched into songs from their forthcoming album. VHS quality video and cartoon footage looped on the screens with electric green, red, and blue lights protecting an '80s technicolor over the audience.

The crowd had obvious respect for the rockers, with a roar following each song. A Steve Buschemi head cutout, a pirate flag and bubbles rose above our heads, as Casablancas slurred his casual vocals into both a mic and vocoder, masking the famous voice from the Strokes, to distinguish this as a solo project. "Hey Governors balls, we're here we made it." Casablancas joked to the crowd. "Let the feast begin, let's do this sh--." A bizarre cartoon of bull dozers destroying a leaf was just one of the many videos that set the tone for the set that could have been played in any Lower East Side basement club. It was difficult to make out the vocals and lyrics -- due to the blaring guitar parts, part of the chosen vibe. Casablancas then joked, "I forgot my WWF routine," drinking from a red solo cup. "We challenged Phoenix to soccer in South America. Phoenix were looking for you!!!!" He yelled into the crowd to loud cheers. "We took 'em on in the Southern Hephasphere. Hephasphere? I don't do words so good." Saying goodbye to the packed crowd, Casablancas left the stage abruptly followed by his band, as loud blaring guitar feedback echoed over the crowd -- rock'n'roll indeed.
