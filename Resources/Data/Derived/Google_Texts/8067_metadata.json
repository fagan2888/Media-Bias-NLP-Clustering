Also, a Platts survey showed that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised its monthly oil production to nearly 31 million barrels a day\u2014the highest since November 2012.\n\nJune crude US:CLM5 rose 45 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $59.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Tracking the most-active contracts, prices gained 0.4% on the week and have posted eight straight weeks of gains.\n\nBrent crude for June delivery UK:LCOM5 on London\u2019s ICE Futures exchange lost 15 cents, or 0.2%, to $65.39 a barrel, about 1.6% lower for the week.\n\n\u201cThis week has been a lesson in volatility, as Libya reminded us that their production was still uncertain, and U.S. crude inventories dropped, but because of lower imports,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. government data showed a weekly decline of 3.9 million barrels in crude inventories and protesters blocked an oil port in Libya.\n\n\u2018Crude\u2026has gone a little too far too fast and looking deeper into the numbers, imports were down last week.\u2019 Tariq Zahir, Tyche Capital Advisors\n\n\u201cCrude\u2026has gone a little too far too fast and looking deeper into the numbers, imports were down last week,\u201d said Tariq Zahir, a managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. \u201cBottom line is we are still seeing production here in the U.S. not come down in any significant way.\u201d\n\nOil rig counts as reported by Baker Hughes BHI, +0.04% have now shown declines for 22 weeks straight. The number of U.S. rigs actively drilling for oil fell 11 rigs to 668.\n\nNymex oil dropped 3.3% Thursday on concerns about how much oil Iran may add to the global market if sanctions are lifted.\n\n\u201cOn the charts, the 7-week-old countertrend rally was broken yesterday, leaving the technical outlook on oil neutral at best,\u201d said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00\u2019s Report, adding there\u2019s a \u201cband of initial support\u201d between $57.50 and $58.00.\n\nData released Friday showed that the U.S. saw 223,000 new jobs in April. \u201cThe economic outlook remains positive, which should augur well for summer gasoline demand, but there is always the risk that markets will get ahead of the news,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nRead: Memorial Day set to see the most travelers in a decade, says AAA\n\nOn Nymex, June gasoline US:RBM5 ended nearly flat at $1.9918 a gallon, losing 2.6% for the week, and June heating oil US:HOM5 fell less than a penny to $1.9537 a gallon, down 1.4% on the week.\n\nJune natural gas US:NGM15 was the biggest gainer, up 14.6 cents, or 5.3%, at $2.88 per million British thermal units to climb 3.75% for the week. Natural gas \u201cwheeled higher in what looks like a renewed cycle of short covering,\u201d said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"parsely-author": "Biman Mukherji", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Oil futures settled higher, with the U.S. benchmark logging its 8th week of gains in a row, based on the most-active contracts.", "creator": "@MktwSaefong", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crude-oil-prices-slip-ahead-of-us-payrolls-data-2015-05-08-21035042", "author": "Myra P.
