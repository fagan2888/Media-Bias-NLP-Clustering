A burst for a split second of radio waves has been discovered by scientists by making use of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico which provides important evidence of mysterious pulses that seem to come from deeper space.

The finding marks the first time that a "fast radio burst" has been detected by an international team of astronomers using an instrument other than the Parkes radio telescope in Australia.

Victoria Kaspi who is an astrophysics professor at McGill University in Montreal said that the result was important since it eliminated any doubt that these radio bursts were of cosmic origin and the radio waves showed every sign which showed that they were from far outside their galaxy which was really an exciting prospect.

The international team of scientists confirmed previous estimates that these strange cosmic bursts occurred almost 10,000 times a day over the whole sky.

The bursts seemed to be coming from beyond the Milky Way galaxy based on the measurement of an effect called plasma dispersion.

Exactly what may be causing these radio bursts is a major mystery for astrophysicists. They are still puzzled by it.

Possibilities include a number of exotic astrophysical objects like mergers of neutron star, evaporating black holes or flares from magnetars which are a kind of neutron star with very powerful magnetic fields.

"Another possibility is that they are bursts much brighter than the giant pulses seen from some pulsars", said James Cordes, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University in the US.

The discovery was made as a part of the Pulsar Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (PALFA) survey which basically aims to find a large sample of pulsars and also to discover rare objects which are useful for better understanding the physics of neutron star and testing theories of gravitational physics.
