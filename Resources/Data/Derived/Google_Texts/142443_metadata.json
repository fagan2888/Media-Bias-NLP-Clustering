One method gaining steam (and backing) involves taking advantage of a resource many Americans already have in spades: sophisticated tech at home.\n\nAs Popular Mechanics reported, a recent study by IMS Research estimated that the telehealth (or telemedicine) industry could be worth $6 billion by 2020. In the past year alone, three of the nation\u2019s top web-based healthcare companies \u2014 Teladoc, MDLive, and American Well \u2014 processed over 400,000 medical interactions online, more than doubling the amount processed in 2011. In the past year, numerous telehealth trials, such as in Howard County, MD elementary schools, have begun testing the method\u2019s efficiency, as well as the ability of existing frameworks to integrate it. Harry Wang, Director of Health & Mobile Product Research for Parks Associates, a market intelligence group, takes predicting the telehealth industry\u2019s success one step further:\n\nThe number of doctor-patient video consultations will nearly triple from this year to the next, from 5.7 million in 2014 to over 16 million in 2015, and will exceed 130 million in 2018.\n\nFounded in 2002, Teladoc is a current industry leader: after growing its revenues by 100% in 2013, it just received $50 million in its latest fundraising round, bringing its approximate total funding to $100 million, according to CEO Jason Gorevic. With nine or more venture capital firms behind it, the company\u2019s remote services are becoming more popular, comprehensive, and far-reaching. Companies such as T-Mobile and Home Depot have already included Teladoc coverage in their employee plans, and, because the service is a cheaper alternative to an emergency room visit, plans supported through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 such as Aetna Blue Shield in California and Oscar in New York \u2014 are starting to incorporate Teladoc, too. As Fortune reports, the Affordable Care Act \u201cis certainly an accelerator for us,\u201d Gorevic said. According to recent survey by Towers Watson and the National Business Group on Health, more than half of large employers plan to offer telehealth services in their 2015 coverage plans, a 28% increase from this year.\n\nIn the past year, Teladoc acquired AmeriDoc and Consult A Doctor, its two main competitors, to make it the largest telehealth provider \u2014 with, Fortune reports, a total of 8 million individual patients from 4,000 clients. In their spare time, over 550 doctors make themselves available for providing care through the company\u2019s online network. This system closely resembles other models in the widely heralded new \u2018sharing economy,\u2019 which allows individuals with a marketable skill or asset \u2014 say, the ability to pick up groceries, a personal vehicle, or a medical degree \u2014 to earn primary income or income on the side. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like Uber,\u201d says Gorevic, would-be Teladoctors must queue up on a waiting list in most states. \u201cWe were first, though,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn general, telehealth doctors can \u2014 and frequently do \u2014 treat flu symptoms, rashes, allergies, urinary tract infections, and bronchitis without ever physically seeing the patient, and can even send prescriptions to a local pharmacy. As Gorevic explains, company nurses serve to review the charts and effectively audit the diagnoses and treatment. As for more serious conditions, Teladoc reportedly refers about 1% of its patients to the E.R. after online consultation, and 5% to 6% to a primary care physician or urgent care center.\n\nOverall, both investors and healthcare providers seem eager to propel telehealth services into prominence and popularity. According to a U.S. News and World Report health survey, telehealth stand to provide convenience for the individual, in terms of time saved receiving treatment, as well as significant economic benefit to employers, in terms of price per consultation and additional employee hours logged.\n\nAs recently reported, the University of California, Los Angeles represents another institution to join the telehealth movement, its physicians having joined a telehealth pool to better serve students and faculty when their own doctors are not available. Samuel Skootsky, M.D., chief medical officer of the UCLA Faculty Practice and Medical Groups, recently praised the change in structure and direction:\n\nWhat we need in healthcare is multiple avenues of access. Showing up in a doctor\u2019s office is one way. You can show up in an ER, but that\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s unnecessary for many simple problems. You can also show up in an urgent care facility. [UCLA\u2019s program] LiveHealth Online is another, more convenient way for people to access healthcare. We think this has value and that patients find this convenient, and I suspect that this kind of connection with the healthcare system will only grow over time.\n\nFortune\n\n\n\nGetty Images, Baltimore Sun, Teladoc", "article_metadata": {"description": "As companies providing remote treatment begin comprising a boom industry, investors hurry to stake claim", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "sailthru.link": "http://www.psfk.com/2014/09/obamacare-telehealth-multimillions-forecast.html", "og": {"site_name": "PSFK", "description": "As companies providing remote treatment begin comprising a boom industry, investors hurry to stake claim", "title": "Telehealth's Multimillions Today Forecast Prominence Tomorrow - PSFK", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/teledoc3.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-24T22:51:37+00:00", "url": "http://www.psfk.com/2014/09/obamacare-telehealth-multimillions-forecast.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As companies providing remote treatment begin comprising a boom industry, investors hurry to stake claim", "creator": "@psfk", "image": "http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/teledoc3.jpg", "title": "Telehealth's Multimillions Today Forecast Prominence Tomorrow - PSFK", "site": "@psfk", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-25", "sailthru.thumb": "http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/teledoc1-700x426.jpg", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "dc.date.issued": "2014-09-25", "dc.date": "2014-09-25", "sailthru.tags": "#technology,Automotive,cities,financial services,Health & Wellness,Healthcare,home,Home Depot,Market Research,Medicine,mobile,obama,technology,telecommunications,USA,work,", "fb": {"app_id": 111837968827935}, "sailthru.title": "Telehealth\u2019s Multimillions Today Forecast Prominence Tomorrow", "date": "2014-09-25", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PSFK.PSFK", "section": "Cities", "tag": "work", "published_time": "2014-09-25T10:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-24T22:51:37+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "As companies providing remote treatment begin comprising a boom industry, investors hurry to stake claim", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In general, telehealth doctors can \u2014 and frequently do \u2014 treat flu symptoms, rashes, allergies, urinary tract infections, and bronchitis without ever physically seeing the patient, and can even send prescriptions to a local pharmacy.\nOverall, both investors and healthcare providers seem eager to propel telehealth services into prominence and popularity.\nIn their spare time, over 550 doctors make themselves available for providing care through the company\u2019s online network.\nWith nine or more venture capital firms behind it, the company\u2019s remote services are becoming more popular, comprehensive, and far-reaching.\nafter online consultation, and 5% to 6% to a primary care physician or urgent care center."}
