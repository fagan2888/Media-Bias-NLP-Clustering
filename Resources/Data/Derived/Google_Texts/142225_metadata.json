The other six with lockers were offensive lineman Takoby Cofield, running back Trey Williams, tight end Je\u2019Ron Hamm, cornerback Quinton Dunbar, linebacker Terrance Plummer and defensive end Corey Crawford.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle also reported on Sunday that full back Ray Agnew III signed with the Redskins, who was cut from the Cowboys Saturday and likely headed to the practice squad.\n\nThe Redskins cut fullback Jordan Campbell Saturday, who was designated as injured.\n\nThe decision to keep only two tight ends in Jordan Reed and Derek Carrier was curious considering Reed\u2019s injury history, however coach Jay Gruden said Sunday they would address the need for a third tight end through the practice squad, which they have done so with Hamm.\n\nHamm, who spent time on the team\u2019s practice squad in 2014, had three catches for 46 yards in the preseason.\n\n\u201cThat would be a revolving door adding a third tight end,\u201d Gruden said.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019d have to make a roster spot somewhere else. So this roster is a 53-man roster and it\u2019s set right now, but obviously throughout the season you\u2019ll be adding maybe a tight end or taking out someone somewhere else. So right now we\u2019re set, but we could definitely use another tight end or two on the practice squad.\u201d\n\nNFL teams are allowed to keep 10 players on the practice squad, with rookies and first-year players eligible for the squad. Teams can also designate a player for the practice squad if they have been on an active roster fewer than six games.\n\nTeams can also sign and cut practice squad players at anytime, however, teams cannot sign another team\u2019s practice squad player to their respective squad. Practice squad players earn a minimum of $6,300 per week, however, a player is awarded a new contract if he is promoted to the 53-man roster.\n\nWhile the practice squad is getting settled, Gruden said he doesn\u2019t envision much turnover on the 53-man roster over the next two days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard when you\u2019re talking about cutting a guy and adding a guy that doesn\u2019t know your system and putting him up right away,\u201d Gruden said.\n\n\u201cIt would have to be a special, very big need for us or a special circumstance with a special player that we all know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Redskins need to sign 10 players to the practice squad.
