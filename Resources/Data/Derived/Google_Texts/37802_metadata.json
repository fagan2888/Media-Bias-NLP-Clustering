Noting that he has been to all 99 counties in the state, he said \u201cIowa is under attack by the administration. With the Renewable Fuel Standard,\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama is ignoring the law and changing it to suit him. And as a result he is hurting Iowa agriculture and affecting our national security as well. Santorum said he voted for the RFS back in 2005 and \u201cI support the RFS for one principle reason: We need to have as much a domestic supply of transportation fuel as possible and we need to have it grown here in the state of Iowa.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the candidates often echoed the same themes: reducing taxes/eliminating the IRS, term limits for Congress, a stronger military, spiritual leadership, blocking the Iran nuclear deal, saving Social Security and Medicare, reducing regulations from Washington, and restoring friendships with our allies and making our enemies fear us.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul focused his remarks on the national debt and noted \u201cpeople in Washington lack the courage to stop spending. We have the means to stop it. All funding expires each year. I would let Planned Parenthood funding expire\u201d and dare the liberals to restore it. He said the GOP should be the party of the Bill of Rights if it wants to win the White House.\n\nTed Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, received a standing ovation for his comments on the recent GOP debate. \u201cStop letting left-wing liberals moderate Republican debates. How about if you have never voted in a Republican primary you don't get to moderate a Republican debate?\u201d\n\nCruz pointed out key issues that were never mentioned in the debate such as Obamacare, the Waters of the U.S. rule, which he said is harming farmers and ranchers, the Clean Power Rule and other EPA regulations, ISIS, Iran and Common Core.\n\nDeparting from the format, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took questions from the audience and in response to a question on energy noted that he supports the Renewable Fuel Standard and would implement even more energy options.\n\nChristie also said his \u201cnumber-one idea for uniting the country\u201d would be to stand up for the men and women in law enforcement.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told the crowd, \u201cThe idea of America is slipping away. Our allies don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. I want to fight to save the idea of America. Our best days are ahead.\u201d\n\nThe youngest of the candidates, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said \u201cwe must turn the page as a party and a nation and elect new leaders.\u201d He said he is running for president so future generations can do what his parents, who emigrated from Cuba, were able to achieve in the American dream. \u201cIf we keep doing what we are doing now we will be the first generation that leaves the country worse off for future generations. \u201c\n\nMike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, promised: \u201cWithin a decade we will find a cure for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's. If the country can send a man to the moon, cure polio, we can find a cure for these diseases.\u201d Huckabee also declared, \u201cThe next president must be a spiritual leader for this country.\u201d\n\nPledging to destroy Islam and rebuild the military, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said he has never been more worried about the threats to our country. He said he would \u201chit our enemies before they hit us,\u201d and \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to beat ISIS.\n\nGraham also criticized Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton saying \u201cshe is unfit to be commander in chief,\u201d and claiming she lied to families of those killed in the 2012 Benghazi attack.\n\nJeb Bush spent most of his time touting his successes in the private sector and as governor of Florida. But he also said as president he would \u201cpush the power away from D.C and back to the states.\u201d He advocated a balanced budget amendment and line item veto power for the president.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike what you see on the Agri-Pulse website?

We have to cut the government down to size and make it accountable.\u201d\n\nThe two front-runners in the Iowa race --Donald Trump and Ben Carson -- did not attend.\n\n#30\n\nFor more news, go to: Agri-Pulse.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "agri-pulse.com,agriculture,farming,farmpolicy, Iowa, Des Moines, Republican, caucus-goers, Growth and Opportunity Party, Ted Crus, Rick Santorum, Rand Paul", "google-site-verification": "B3B-XLA-wsSPpTBjSFlO17UaogaI_3Kz3jFi0wvRW_8", "description": "Almost exactly three months before the Iowa caucuses on Feb.", "pubdate": 20151101}, "article_summary": "GOP candidates focus on Iowa caucus-goersBy Frank Holdmeyer\u00a9 Copyright Agri-Pulse Communications, Inc.DES MOINES, Iowa, Nov. 1, 2015 -- Almost exactly three months before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1 and just three days after the GOP debate on Oct. 28, 10 Republican candidates for president of the United States took to the stage Saturday in Des Moines to present their case to Iowa caucus-goers.\nTed Cruz, the junior senator from Texas, received a standing ovation for his comments on the recent GOP debate.\nNoting that he has been to all 99 counties in the state, he said \u201cIowa is under attack by the administration.\nHe said the GOP should be the party of the Bill of Rights if it wants to win the White House.\nAnd as a result he is hurting Iowa agriculture and affecting our national security as well."}
