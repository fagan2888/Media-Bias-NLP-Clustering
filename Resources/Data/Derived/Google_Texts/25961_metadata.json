I would give away a billion here or there, found a foundation to help save people, and underwrite cultural institutions, especially those that support young artists and writers. But if I were to indulge myself, I would buy fabulous works of art\u2014for me to see every day, for art is surely my weakness. In time, my art collection would probably need to be shared, if only to protect me from my greed, and from burning in the hell in which I don\u2019t believe. Great art belongs to the public. Maybe I would build a museum. I wonder how arty my art museum would be?\n\nOn May 1, 2015, the Whitney Museum of American Art opened a new, $422 million building, a Renzo Piano-designed structure on Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District in New York. The building tells the usual tale of power and old New York wealth, thanks to an initial $125 million gift in 2007 from Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s American Art Foundation. Upon the opening, with a visit from the first lady and her challenge to the Whitney\u2019s directors to make the museum\u2019s great collection available to underserved populations, now seems the time to think about what\u2019s boxed in Renzo Piano\u2019s new box, and to consider what the ideal art museum might be.\n\nThe new Whitney\u2019s beautiful galleries afford extraordinary flexibility, with 50,000 square feet of exhibition space sans columns, a black-box theater, and various smartly designed elements that should foster innovative curating. Piano\u2019s building has a brutal charm, industrial and pretty, at the end of the High Line on the West Side. Down the stairs at 14th Street, and make a right: the lobby\u2019s airy space frames a view of the Hudson River that neatly obscures the Department of Sanitation plant next door. Largess abounds: light, steel and the promise of fine art, much of it great.\n\nThe new Whitney shows art well, the museum\u2019s primary function performed with aplomb. The galleries are on the top four floors: to begin, one takes \u201cthe most beautiful freight elevator I have ever ridden on,\u201d according to Michelle Obama, up to the 8th floor, and then works down, with visits to the outdoor terraces encouraged, the eastward view excellent. Terraces are a major feature of Piano\u2019s museum designs\u2014whether utilized as semi-covered access tubes, as they are at the Centre Pompidou, or appended like fancy fire escapes, as they are here at the Whitney. From the street or from the High Line, assuming good weather, visitors arriving at the new Whitney see the folks on the terraces and can imagine themselves up there, delighting in the prospect. It\u2019s no accident that once inside the museum, the elevator to the eighth floor opens near the terrace, and that most museum-goers tend to check out the view before stepping into the gallery proper. Seeing is a kind of owning, as Cortez knew.\n\nThen the gallery viewing begins, from the eighth floor down to the fifth, for now, through the permanent collection that has its origins in the patronage of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in the early 20th century, with her prophetic investments in the paintings of what became the Ashcan School. Today, to show its stuff, the Whitney curators offer 23 \u201cchapters\u201d\u2014groupings according to 23 of the curators\u2019s ideas\u2014organizing the artworks, to help viewers parse what\u2019s hidden within the timelines. It\u2019s a curatorial fad, or maybe a development; over the past 20 years, we\u2019ve seen curators begin to reposition artworks ahistorically in great museums, sometimes salon-style, sometimes by room or floor. We\u2019re learning more about moments in time, these groupings say, and synchronicity: the job of a good museum is to teach, too.\n\nBut the job description of the good museum, like that of the good college, has also expanded over the same 20 years. A museum today has to do more than just show its stuff: a museum today, while still a church and a library, now also must be a mall and a playground and a store and a theater and a tax haven and an architectural wonder. Can you picture a museum with a dating app, its own version of Tinder? I can. Swipe to meet by the Kara Walker.\n\nCulture is made by a museum, perhaps most conspicuously when a museum collects a specifically national collection, such as the Whitney\u2019s. Claims are made by the museum\u2019s curators when they decide how to show work\u2014those 23 chapters in the new Whitney constitute arguments about who Americans were, are and will be. Not to mention who weren\u2019t Americans yet: A museum also contributes to the rewriting of history, with those who were on the margins eased back into the national discourse. Thus a museum is a textbook, too, as visitors study for a variety of exams never to be administered.\n\nA contemporary art museum has an additional challenge, ideologically, both to be the power and fight the power. For example, when the new Whitney displays an Abstract Expressionist painting, which in 1950 was a threat to the Cold War status quo, that painting on the wall today becomes the status quo, institutionalized as cultural capital, with meanings in 2015 that subsequent generations need to resist, and in resisting, make new. So there is the old Jackson Pollock painting on the new Whitney\u2019s wall, and the museum has to figure out how not to overdetermine the artwork\u2019s achievements and thereby erase history. (In this case, the new Whitney fails: Pollock\u2019s \u201cNumber 27, 1950\u201d has been hung vertically, despite convincing evidence that the painting is a horizontal.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "A close reading of the new Whitney Museum reveals missed opportunities to connect more people with art", "title": "Beyond \u201cStorage Wars\u201d of the 1 percent: A not-so-radical proposal for the art museum of the future", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A close reading of the new Whitney Museum reveals missed opportunities to connect more people with art", "title": "Beyond \u201cStorage Wars\u201d of the 1 percent: A not-so-radical proposal for the art museum of the future", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/14/beyond_storage_wars_of_the_1_percent_a_not_so_radical_proposal_for_the_art_museum_of_the_future/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/new_whitney.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A close reading of the new Whitney Museum reveals missed opportunities to connect more people with art", "title": "Beyond \u201cStorage Wars\u201d of the 1 percent: A not-so-radical proposal for the art museum of the future", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/new_whitney.jpg", "creator": "@AMPoProse", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alan Michael Parker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Art, Museums, Whitney Museum of American Art", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1053\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Art, Museums, Whitney Museum of American Art, Entertainment NewsIf I had a few billion dollars, I wouldn\u2019t have a few billion dollars.\nA contemporary art museum has an additional challenge, ideologically, both to be the power and fight the power.\nI wonder how arty my art museum would be?\nBut the job description of the good museum, like that of the good college, has also expanded over the same 20 years.\nWe\u2019re learning more about moments in time, these groupings say, and synchronicity: the job of a good museum is to teach, too."}
