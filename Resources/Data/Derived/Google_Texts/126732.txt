LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California Highway Patrol faulted a truck driver for a fiery head-on collision with a bus carrying high school students to a college visit.

The underlying cause of the crash is the FedEx truck driver, Tim Evans, 32, “allowing his vehicle to travel across the median in an unsafe turning movement,” Sgt. Nate Parsons said. “He could have fell asleep, he could have had an undiagnosed medical condition. We’re unable to prove either.”

The April 14, 2014, collision occurred in Orland, about 100 miles north of Sacramento. The dead were five high school students from the Los Angeles area, three chaperones, and the drivers of the FedEx tractor-trailer and the bus. The bus was full of prospective Humboldt State University students heading for a campus visit, and two of the chaperones were engaged to be married.

The California Highway Patrol released the results of its investigation at a news conference after the agency met with family members of those killed in the collision.

Evans “had sufficient time off,” Parsons said. “That day he had been working approximately eight hours at the time of the collision. But he had between eight and 10 hours of sleep the night before.”

Carla Haywood, whose daughter Mattison died while chaperoning students on the bus, says the investigation didn’t still address their central question of why the truck driver left the road. “We’re constantly wondering what happened, questioning what could have been prevented,” said Haywood, 63 of Chino.
