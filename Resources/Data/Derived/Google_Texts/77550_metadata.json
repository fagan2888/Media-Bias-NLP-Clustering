Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, said, \u201cThe unprecedented scale and strength of Yolanda, a typhoon that occurred at a very late time of the year, is a clear demonstration of the changing weather pattern. Whether the world faces up to it or not, this is a manifestation of climate change.\u201d\n\nTrue? No.\n\nA peer-reviewed study published by the American Meteorological Society last year found that there weren\u2019t more tropical cyclones, just more people and buildings in their paths: \u201cThe evidence in this study provides strong support for the conclusion that increasing damage around the world during the past several decades can be explained entirely by increasing wealth in locations prone to (tropical cyclone) landfalls.\u201d\n\nThe latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also found no increase in the number of tropical cyclones and said it is \u201clikely\u201d their intensity has increased \u2014 but said the reason was unclear.\n\nNASA climate scientist Bill Patzert did a YouTube video on the topic this month (watch it below). In it, he says:\n\n\u201cIs global warming happening? No doubt about it. We\u2019re living in a warmer world, we\u2019re living in a melting world, sea levels are rising. Now, direct evidence of the footprint or the fingerprint of global warming (is) we\u2019re seeing more frequent, more intense and longer lasting heat waves. As far as hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, floods and drought, the evidence is definitely not in. The consensus among almost all scientists is that it\u2019s a small fingerprint, not a large footprint. \u2026 Global warming definitely is accelerating and it will have an impact on extreme weather, but at this point, not much.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reno Nevada News - rgj.com is the home page of Reno Nevada with in depth and updated Reno local news.
