Now comes word that the law\u2019s small-business exchanges are also vastly underperforming for reasons ranging from computer glitches and delays to the very nature of the exchanges.\n\nThe Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) was supposed to enroll two million Americans this year, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast. The Obama administration has been typically tight-lipped about enrollment numbers for the federal SHOP exchange, but it\u2019s known that as of June, just 76,000 people were enrolled in the 18 state-run exchanges. It seems highly unlikely, therefore, that nationwide enrollment even came within shouting distance of the CBO\u2019s projection.\n\nThings are hardly looking up for 2015. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the SHOP section of Healthcare.gov had just 200,000 visitors in its first week of open enrollment for 2015, while the individual-exchange section got over 1.5 million visitors. John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of the pro-ObamaCare Small Business Majority, told the Washington Post, \u201cWe are not expecting a massive [enrollment] surge.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind SHOP was to allow small businesses to band together to obtain health insurance, providing a larger pool of insured individuals and thus reducing premiums and offering more plans. The program was also designed to give employees a choice of plans, something rarely offered by small-business owners.\n\nSHOP was \u201csupposed to be the one thing in Obamacare that was maybe, kind of, good for small business, the sector undeniably most impacted by the insurance premium increases that were inevitable with the new law,\u201d Jean Card blogged at U.S. News & World Report.\n\nSo what happened to this seemingly beneficent (albeit unconstitutional) program? Why is it having such a difficult time attracting customers?\n\nFirst, as with the federal individual exchange, SHOP has been beset with technical difficulties. When it launched last year, it couldn\u2019t even enroll people; that process still had to be performed manually. At the time, the administration said the website would be fully functional by November 2014, and while it can now enroll people, it still has its problems. For example, the website asks employers how long their new employees must wait before becoming eligible for insurance. The ACA allows for a waiting period of up to 90 days, but the website\u2019s maximum is 60 days. This, of course, has left employers confused and frustrated. (They were previously confused and frustrated by the website\u2019s requirement that they provide an employee number for each employee they wanted to offer coverage \u2014 an obstacle for small businesses that have no need to number their few employees to identify them.)\n\nStill other problems plague insurance brokers and their clients. The Post cited the case of Cleveland-area broker Sam Fiorentino, a man well enough versed in the ACA to train other brokers in how to navigate it:\n\nFirst, the Web site did not recognize his password. Then, a fishing buddy who runs a small machine-tool cutting company told Fiorentino that he wanted to designate him as his broker from a drop-down list on the site, but Fiorentino\u2019s name did not appear. After many calls to federal phone numbers, Fiorentino discovered the problem: The computer system was not accepting his \u201cnational producer number\u201d \u2014 a kind of ID number the Web site requires \u2014 because an insurance agent in Michigan had already entered his number by mistake. A week after finding the root of his problem, Fiorentino still has not been able to get it fixed.\n\n\u201cNow my clients can\u2019t find me. Therefore, they can\u2019t buy from me right now. I might as well not be in business,\u201d he said. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\n\nSecond, the Obama administration\u2019s ongoing SHOP delays, as with its postponement of so many other ACA provisions, haven\u2019t helped. Besides putting off creating a fully functioning website for a year, the administration also delayed SHOP\u2019s feature allowing employees to select from a list of plans their employers were offering \u2014 first for one year and then for still another. In other words, until January 2016 at the earliest, employees getting coverage via SHOP are stuck with the single plan their employers were permitted to offer.\n\nThird, SHOP was created primarily to serve the political objective of passing the ACA, not to meet a real need, and therefore was not well-thought-out. Hence, it requires, in Card\u2019s words, \u201ca ridiculous 70 percent minimum employee participation rate\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a critical mass of insurer participation.\u201d\n\nSHOP exchange plans, moreover, are no great shakes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently reported that SHOP premiums \u201cwere generally comparable to premiums for other small group plans offered within a state but outside of the SHOP,\u201d while the Post found instances in which SHOP plans had either significantly higher premiums or smaller physician networks than comparable non-exchange plans. And with SHOP only offering employees a single plan to begin with, it\u2019s hardly worth their \u2014 or their employers\u2019 \u2014 while to use the exchange.\n\nThen there are the tax credits for employers offering exchange coverage, one of the biggest selling points of SHOP. But a closer examination of the matter reveals that the credits (1) only go to a select few employers, (2) \u201cmay be too small and administratively complex to motivate many employers\u201d (GAO report), and (3) expire after two years.\n\nPut it all together, and \u201cyou really run out of reasons to go into the SHOP,\u201d Delaware insurance broker Nicholas Moriello told the Post.\n\nThe point of SHOP, however, was never really to help small businesses, observed Politico:\n\n\u201cSmall businesses weren\u2019t screaming for this,\u201d said Gary Claxton with the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cI don\u2019t think the demand was there.\u201d\n\nYet in the debate over the healthcare law, Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) popularized the SHOP concept and used it to persuade moderate Democrats to endorse the bill, recalled John McDonough, then a health advisor to Senator Ted Kennedy. The idea just never drew particularly strong support in Congress or from the policy community. It was funded with a tiny fraction of the resources dedicated to helping people buy insurance in the individual exchange.\n\n\u201cThe small business piece was always more hat than cow \u2014 politically attractive and convenient, and not really cognizant of the realities of health insurance markets,\u201d McDonough said.\n\nThat pretty well sums up the rest of ObamaCare, too.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, SHOP,  exchanges, small business, insurance", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/19640-obamacare-s-shop-not-attracting-customers", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a1a3057226ab96b0cdea231a1ed223c0_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Because of technical glitches, delays, and bad design, ObamaCare's SHOP exchange isn't attracting small-business owners or their employees. by Michael Tennant", "title": "ObamaCare\u2019s SHOP Not Attracting Customers"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a1a3057226ab96b0cdea231a1ed223c0_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) was supposed to enroll two million Americans this year, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast.\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently reported that SHOP premiums \u201cwere generally comparable to premiums for other small group plans offered within a state but outside of the SHOP,\u201d while the Post found instances in which SHOP plans had either significantly higher premiums or smaller physician networks than comparable non-exchange plans.\nPut it all together, and \u201cyou really run out of reasons to go into the SHOP,\u201d Delaware insurance broker Nicholas Moriello told the Post.\nThen there are the tax credits for employers offering exchange coverage, one of the biggest selling points of SHOP.\n\u201cUnbelievable.\u201dSecond, the Obama administration\u2019s ongoing SHOP delays, as with its postponement of so many other ACA provisions, haven\u2019t helped."}
