Massachusetts is marking the tenth anniversary of a landmark health care law that later served as a model for the federal Affordable Care Act.

Then-Republican Gov. Mitt Romney was joined by Democratic leaders including the late Sen. Edward Kennedy when he signed the law at Faneuil Hall on April 12, 2006.

State officials say the law, which included subsidies for low-income residents to purchase insurance, led to near-universal coverage. But the state continues to struggle with rising health care costs.

Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement Tuesday Massachusetts led the country by creating the law, while adding that more work is needed “to increase accessibility and transparency for consumers.”

Democratic Senate President Stan Rosenberg said the law has made high quality health care more accessible to residents.
