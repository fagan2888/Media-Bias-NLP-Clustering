A hospital and nursing home in Hollywood may be on the auction block soon as its owner and former CEO is in federal prison for Medicare fraud, the South Florida Business Journal reports.

Former Hollywood Pavilion CEO Karen Kallen-Zury is serving a 25-year sentence for running a Medicare fraud scheme and companies related to the facility -- High Ridge Management Corp., Hollywood Pavilion LLC, and Hollywood Hills Rehabilitation Center -- filed for bankruptcy reorganization this month to avoid foreclosure, the Business Journal reports.

However, High Ridge Management last week asked a judge the property can be sold through a bankruptcy auction, according to the Business Journal.
