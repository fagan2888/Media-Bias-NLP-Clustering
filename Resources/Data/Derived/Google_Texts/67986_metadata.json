(The Washington Post)\n\nThe Fix\u2019s Chris Cillizza breaks down how close the battle for the Senate really is. (The Washington Post)\n\nProminent Democratic strategists are growing increasingly nervous that the national political environment is not only bad for their side but moving in the wrong direction in the final days before the election, a trend that not only could cost their party control of the Senate but also result in double-digit House losses.\n\n\u201cThe environment has settled, and it\u2019s bad,\u201d said one senior Democratic Party operative closely monitoring the party\u2019s prospects. The source added that Democratic candidates\u2019 numbers among independents and seniors \u2014 critical voting blocs \u2014 have begun to erode. \u201cThey are just not as friendly to us as they once were,\u201d the operative said.\n\nThose trends are borne out in several key Senate races \u2014 most notably the contest for the open seat in Iowa. State Sen. Joni Ernst (R) is leading Rep. Bruce Braley (D) by 12 points among independents in a Des Moines Register poll released Saturday night. She holds a seven-point edge among all voters.\n\nIn conversations last week with more than a dozen Democratic strategists deeply involved in this campaign \u2014 a few who were willing to speak on the record \u2014 there was widespread pessimism about the party\u2019s chances Tuesday.\n\n\u201cChallenging,\u201d acknowledged Ali Lapp, executive director of the House Majority PAC, a super PAC spending millions of dollars on ads to promote House Democrats, referring to the national dynamic.\n\nAtlanta campaign volunteer Debra Dixon-Wade calls voters on Oct. 16 about the Senate race between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue. Democratic strategists called the midterm environment \u201cchallenging.\u201d (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging environment,\u201d agreed Penny Lee, a Democratic lobbyist and longtime political aide to former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell.\n\n\u201cUnsettled,\u201d offered Democratic pollster Fred Yang.\n\n\u201cThe trends are not good,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a veteran Democratic and labor strategist.\n\nThere were lots (and lots) of reasons given for the difficulties Democrats are facing: The Senate map. The historic trends of second-term, midterm elections \u2014 a.k.a. the \u201csix-year itch.\u201d Voter apathy. But the one factor that virtually every person I talked to cited as the biggest reason for the party\u2019s predicament was President Obama.\n\n\u201cThis off-year election has become almost entirely a referendum on the president,\u201d said one Democratic consultant involved in many closely fought congressional races. \u201cIt\u2019s not just anger at [the Affordable Care Act]. He has become, rightly or wrongly, the symbol of dysfunction in Washington. That has led to a demoralized Democratic base, energized Republicans. And those in the middle have an easy way of venting their frustration, and that is to punish the president\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nSaid another Democratic strategist knee-deep in the 2014 midterms: \u201cIt is not all Obama, but a lot of it is.\u201d People are \u201cvery upset with government,\u201d said the strategist, who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. \u201cAnd people think Democrats are in charge, so they are taking it out on Democrats more than Republicans.\u201d\n\nAsked for a single word to describe why this election was looking increasingly bleak for Democrats, another party consultant offered this: \u201cObama.\u201d\n\nPolling bears out Obama\u2019s negative effect on his party\u2019s chances. In a trio of NBC-Marist University polls released Sunday on the three key Senate races, the president\u2019s approval rating was at 32 percent in Kentucky, 39 percent in Louisiana and 41 percent in Georgia. His numbers were anemic even in states he won in 2012. Obama struggles to break out of the low 40s in Colorado. In Iowa, he barely crests 40 percent in the Real Clear Politics polling average.\n\nErik Smith, a veteran Democratic operative, pushed back on the \u201cit\u2019s all Obama\u2019s fault\u201d narrative.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama isn\u2019t the cause of this bad environment, but how candidates have chosen to handle his lower approval ratings has often compounded their problems,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhile candidates may want to distance themselves from the incumbent president in their advertising and public statements, the president\u2019s base is still strong and committed to him, and as a result that mixed message dampens their enthusiasm for the candidate. In the end, these Democratic candidates fail to win new support and lose traditional support at the same time by trying to play it too politically.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that although there was significant pessimism among the people we talked to, about half of them held out hope that Democrats could still snatch victory from the jaws of defeat \u2014 noting, rightly, that races all over the country remain close despite the eroding environment.\n\n\u201cGiven the hand that 2014 dealt us, it\u2019s pretty impressive that so many races are still close enough to win on turnout,\u201d said Greg Speed, president of America Votes, a Democratic-aligned group.\n\nBill Burton, a veteran of the Obama White House, added: \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re still even talking about states like Georgia and Kansas in an environment that is this bad.\u201d\n\nTrue enough. And the unsettled nature of the electorate could well mean that we are in for more twists and turns before Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop trying to read the tea leaves,\u201d Rosenthal said, summing up the chaos.\n\nOf course, with the last ads shipped and the last polls conducted, there\u2019s not much to do but try to read the tea leaves. And from what Democrats are seeing, it doesn\u2019t look good.
