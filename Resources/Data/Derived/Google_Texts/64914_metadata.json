The thinking went like this: President Obama was far more liberal than the majority of the country. But given his extraordinary political talents, the fatigue of the George W. Bush years, the economic crisis and the excitement of electing the first African-American president, the country picked him not because of his ideology but in spite of it.\n\nOnce this unique political figure was no longer on the ballot, America would revert to the less liberal, more center-right direction that was the norm after World War II. Under this scenario, President Obama wasn\u2019t some profound historical shift but more of an eccentric diversion.\n\nNow it\u2019s February 2016 and an obscure socialist \u2014 O.K., a Democratic Socialist \u2014 from a tiny state just beat one of the most powerful forces in the Democratic Party in the New Hampshire primary. On the Republican side, a man whom National Review, the conservative movement\u2019s flagship publication, has vigorously denounced, also won New Hampshire in a rout.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nWhen he entered the presidential race in 2007, Mr. Obama had amassed a voting record that was ranked by National Journal as the most liberal in the United States Senate. In the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign warned that the young senator\u2019s record would lead to defeat in November. In that general election, Senator John McCain prosecuted the same ideological case, with little success. Big hunks of America had fallen in love with Mr. Obama.\n\nThough only 16 years separated the election of Bill Clinton and that of President Obama, the two politicians seemed to represent the same party in name only. The 1992 campaign was dedicated to defining \u201ca different kind of Democrat.\u201d That was basically a nicely packaged phrase to stress that Bill Clinton and Al Gore were not crazy \u2014 or weak \u2014 liberals like the party\u2019s recent lineup of losers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese new Democrats were for the death penalty and couldn\u2019t wait to get into office to \u201cend welfare as we know it.\u201d They even broke the Republican hold on the South, winning not only their home states of Arkansas and Tennessee but also Louisiana and Georgia. The 1992 Democratic campaign was a calculated defense against charges of liberalism. Mr. Clinton defined his candidacy by asserting that Democrats could handle center-right issues like crime and welfare.\n\nBy 2008 a different set of issues emerged, addressed with a new vocabulary. Mr. Obama made the case that he and the Democratic Party were best able to deal with the crushing pain of disappearing jobs and escalating inequality. The urgent need to prevent any more terrorist attacks had morphed to an urgent longing to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Liberals now called themselves progressives and embraced the label.\n\nThe Barack Obama legacy debate is just beginning. One point up for discussion: whether the president pushed the country left, or whether he was just in step with how people felt. He passed the Affordable Care Act, announced support for same-sex marriage, and has argued passionately (if unsuccessfully) for more gun control.\n\nFor Republicans, this mostly proves that the president is out of sync with the majority of the country, though on same-sex marriage, the country has clearly changed. As the political scientist Lynn Vavreck of the University of California, Los Angeles, has shown, in the 2012 election more voters saw Mr. Obama as being to the left of their beliefs than saw Mitt Romney as being to their right.\n\nBut so far into the 2016 election, conservatives are on the run. Democrats are battling over who can really move the country left. And the leading Republican candidate is a man who has previously praised Canada\u2019s single-payer health care system and described himself as \u201cvery pro-choice.\u201d\n\nThis starts to paint a very different picture of the direction of the country. Instead of President Obama representing a quirky left shift engendered by his charisma, Iraq and the Great Recession, what if he turned out to have been a transitional figure to a considerably more leftward tilt? What if in 10 or 20 years we look back on the Obama years and they seem as conservative as the 1992 \u201cDifferent Kind of Democrat\u201d years do now?\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nIt\u2019s happening elsewhere. Canada has turned left, and a socialist, a long way from the days of Tony Blair, leads Britain\u2019s Labour Party. In this global economy that everyone talks about but no one seems able to define, maybe larger forces are nudging the United States left. Unemployment is low and yet only 23 percent of the country believes we are headed in the right direction. Something clearly is wrong.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that this election is rewriting old rules. Mostly that refers to the success of nontraditional candidates like Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders. But there\u2019s always the chance that something more fundamental is afoot. Perhaps the reality of the new American economy is becoming too exhausting.\n\n\u201cKeep your government hands off my Medicare,\u201d opponents of the president\u2019s health care bill once demanded. Like that confused, plaintive cry, will this be the election cycle when voters in both parties accept that they want a growing benevolent government, as long as they don\u2019t have to admit they need it?", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160212032103, "twitter": {"description": "We could be looking at a presidential contest with no real conservative choice.", "title": "How Far Left Has America Moved?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/opinion/campaign-stops/how-far-left-has-america-moved.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004201482"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/12/opinion/12stevensWeb/12stevensWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/opinion/campaign-stops/how-far-left-has-america-moved.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004201482", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/opinion/campaign-stops/how-far-left-has-america-moved.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/campaignstops", "hdl_p": "How Far Left Has America Moved?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 12, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Democratic Party", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,Obama  Barack,United States Politics and Government,Liberalism (US Politics),Democratic Party,Conservatism (US Politics)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Stuart Stevens", "SCG": "campaign-stops", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By STUART STEVENS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "We could be looking at a presidential contest with no real conservative choice.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/12/opinion/12stevensWeb/12stevensWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/12/opinion/12stevensWeb/12stevensWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "We could be looking at a presidential contest with no real conservative choice.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 12, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-02-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Conservatism (US Politics)", "published": "2016-02-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "12stevens", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160212154716, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/opinion/campaign-stops/how-far-left-has-america-moved.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/12/opinion/12stevensWeb/12stevensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "We could be looking at a presidential contest with no real conservative choice.", "title": "How Far Left Has America Moved?"}, "pdate": 20160212, "des": "Conservatism (US Politics)", "articleid": 100000004201482, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "How Far Left Has America Moved?", "col": "Op-Ed Contributor", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb5f\"", "article_summary": "Big hunks of America had fallen in love with Mr. Obama.\nThe thinking went like this: President Obama was far more liberal than the majority of the country.\nDemocrats are battling over who can really move the country left.\nUnder this scenario, President Obama wasn\u2019t some profound historical shift but more of an eccentric diversion.\nOne point up for discussion: whether the president pushed the country left, or whether he was just in step with how people felt."}
