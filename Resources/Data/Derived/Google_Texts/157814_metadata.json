The law goes into effect Jan. 1.\n\nRights advocates and foreign governments, including Washington, have expressed concerns about the law\u2019s likely impact on tech businesses and freedom of speech.\n\nThey say it is troublesome that telecommunications companies and Internet service providers are required to share encryption keys and back-door access with the police and state security agents seeking to prevent terrorist activities or investigating terror acts.\n\nChinese officials said Sunday that the requirements for the tech firms are necessary because terrorists are increasingly turning to cyberspace.\n\nThey said lawmakers balanced the needs to fight terrorism and to protect business interests and public rights.\n\n\u201cRelevant regulations in the anti-terrorism law will not affect the normal business operation of companies, and we do not use the law to set up \u2018back doors\u2019 to violate the intellectual property rights of companies,\u201d said Li Shouwei of the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee\u2019s legislative affairs commission.\n\n\u201cThe law will not damage people\u2019s freedom of speech or religion,\u201d Li said.\n\nBeijing has asserted that China is a victim of global terrorism following violent ethnic clashes involving members of the Muslim minority Uighur community in the far northwest region of Xinjiang. Foreign experts, however, have argued that there is no proof of foreign ties and that the violence in Xinjiang might be homegrown.\n\nChina has criticized the West for adopting double standards. Beijing recently refused to renew the press credentials of a French journalist, effectively expelling her, for questioning Beijing\u2019s equating of ethnic conflicts with global terrorism.\n\nLi said at a news conference that China\u2019s anti-terrorism law targets no specific region, ethnicity or religion.\n\nAlso on Sunday, the legislature officially sanctioned an earlier decision by the ruling Communist Party to end China\u2019s one-child policy, allowing all Chinese couples to have two children.", "article_metadata": {"description": "China's rubber-stamp national legislature on Sunday approved the country's first anti-terrorism law, amid concerns that its requirements that tech companies share information with the government could hurt business interests and further infringe upon human rights.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "China\u2019s rubber-stamp national legislature on Sunday approved the country\u2019s first anti-terrorism law, amid concerns that its requirements that tech companies share information with the government could hurt business interests and further infringe upon human rights.", "title": "China\u2019s legislature OKs controversial anti-terrorism law", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/27/chinas-legislature-oks-controversial-anti-terroris/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/27/china_anti_terrorism_law.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/27/china_anti_terrorism_law.jpeg", "description": "China's rubber-stamp national legislature on Sunday approved the country's first anti-terrorism law, amid concerns that its requirements that tech companies share information with the government could", "card": "summary", "title": "China\u2019s legislature OKs controversial anti-terrorism law"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, China"}, "article_summary": "Li said at a news conference that China\u2019s anti-terrorism law targets no specific region, ethnicity or religion.\nThe National People\u2019s Congress said its standing committee adopted the law with a unanimous vote.\nBEIJING (AP) - China\u2019s rubber-stamp national legislature on Sunday approved the country\u2019s first anti-terrorism law, amid concerns that its requirements that tech companies share information with the government could hurt business interests and further infringe upon human rights.\nAlso on Sunday, the legislature officially sanctioned an earlier decision by the ruling Communist Party to end China\u2019s one-child policy, allowing all Chinese couples to have two children.\n\u201cThe law will not damage people\u2019s freedom of speech or religion,\u201d Li said."}
