That might seem like a good thing since opioid addiction has become a national epidemic. But in fact, as a result of reforms put in place under the Affordable Care Act, he may have put his hospital at financial risk.\n\nAs part of an Obama\u00adcare initiative meant to reward quality care, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is allocating some $1.5 billion in Medicare payments to hospitals based on criteria that include patient-\u00adsatisfaction surveys. Among the questions: \u201cDuring this hospital stay, how often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your pain?\u201d And: \u201cHow often was your pain well controlled?\u201d\n\nRead More: Watch How the Drug Overdose Epidemic Spread in America\n\nTo many physicians and lawmakers struggling to contain the nation\u2019s opioid crisis, tying a patient\u2019s feelings about pain management to a hospital\u2019s bottom line is deeply \u00admisguided\u2013\u2013if not downright dangerous. \u201cThe government is telling us we need to make sure a patient\u2019s pain is under control,\u201d says Dr. Nick Sawyer, a health-\u00adpolicy fellow at the UC Davis department of emergency medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make them happy without a narcotic. This policy is leading to ongoing opioid abuse.\u201d\n\nThat abuse has led to a full-blown crisis. Since 1999, fatal prescription-\u00adopioid overdoses in the U.S. have quadrupled. According to the CDC, more than 47,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2014, a record high, and more than 60% of those deaths involved an opioid. U.S. emergency rooms now treat more than 1,000 people every day for misusing prescription opioids.\n\nPatient-satisfaction surveys are not the cause of this crisis, of course. But there is research to support some doctors\u2019 contention that they\u2019re making the problem worse. A 2012 study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that the most satisfied patients are more likely to spend more on prescription drugs and have higher mortality rates. In a 2014 survey published in Patient Preference and Adherence, over 48% of doctors reported prescribing inappropriate narcotic pain medication because of patient-\u00adsatisfaction questions. One doctor wrote that drug seekers \u201care well aware of the patient satisfaction scores and how they can use these threats and complaints to obtain narcotics.\u201d\n\nRead More: Why America Can\u2019t Kick Its Painkiller Problem\n\nCMS, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), disputes any link between its surveys, a hospital\u2019s reimbursement money and opioid abuse. In March, agency doctors wrote in JAMA that the patient-\u00adsatisfaction survey accounted for 30% of a hospital\u2019s total performance score in fiscal year 2015, with pain management one of eight equally weighted dimensions, along with factors like nurse communication and cleanliness and quietness. (CMS did not respond to interview requests.)\n\nStill, lawmakers are concerned. Republican Senator Susan Collins, whose home state of Maine saw a 27.3% rise in its drug-\u00adoverdose death rate from 2013 to 2014, has called for HHS to investigate the connection between the surveys and inappropriate prescriptions. \u201cHealth providers are telling me that these questions are written in a way that make them fear a lower reimbursement if patients did not answer them in the affirmative,\u201d says Collins. \u201cFor a small rural hospital in Maine to lose a certain percentage of their Medicare reimbursements is a big deal.\u201d\n\nIn April, four Senators\u2014two from each party\u2014\u00adsponsored a bill that would untie reimbursements from pain-\u00admanagement questions. An earlier measure attracted bipartisan support in the House. Says West Virginia Representative Alex Mooney, who introduced the bill: \u201cIt\u2019s a simple fix that can have significant results.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some doctors say a quirk in the Affordable Care Act is a dangerous incentive to prescribe potentially dangerous painkillers", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Some doctors say patient surveys have led them to prescribe more painkillers", "title": "How Obamacare Is Fueling America's Opioid Epidemic", "url": "http://time.com/4292290/how-obamacare-is-fueling-americas-opioid-epidemic/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/obamacare-opioid-addiction.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/obamacare-opioid-addiction.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Some doctors say patient surveys have led them to prescribe more painkillers", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Obamacare Is Fueling America's Opioid Epidemic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "drugs, obamacare, public health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, drugs, health, emergency rooms, healthcare, pain, pain management, opioid, drug overdose, opioid epidemic, susan collins, obama, narcotics, painkillers"}, "article_summary": "Patient-satisfaction surveys are not the cause of this crisis, of course.\n\u201cThe government is telling us we need to make sure a patient\u2019s pain is under control,\u201d says Dr. Nick Sawyer, a health-\u00adpolicy fellow at the UC Davis department of emergency medicine.\nIn a 2014 survey published in Patient Preference and Adherence, over 48% of doctors reported prescribing inappropriate narcotic pain medication because of patient-\u00adsatisfaction questions.\nAs part of an Obama\u00adcare initiative meant to reward quality care, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is allocating some $1.5 billion in Medicare payments to hospitals based on criteria that include patient-\u00adsatisfaction surveys.\nThat might seem like a good thing since opioid addiction has become a national epidemic."}
