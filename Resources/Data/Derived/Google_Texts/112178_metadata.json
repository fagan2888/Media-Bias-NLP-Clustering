For people who for some reason can\u2019t handle or respond to these drugs, vitamins and minerals, which often come as supplements, may be just as effective, according to a new study.\n\n\u201cAlthough some practitioners have been using micronutrients to treat mental illness for many decades, the research has been scant or non-existent,\u201d said lead author of the study, Julia Rucklidge, of the University of Canterbury, in New Zealand, according to 3News. Because of a lack of evidence \u2014 most of it is anecdotal \u2014 doctors often go with what has been proven to work: medication like Ritalin or Adderall.\n\nVitamin and mineral (micronutrient) supplements, however, have been proven to have some positive effects on the human mind. One study found that folic acid, a form of vitamin B9, could slow the rate at which the brain\u2019s gray matter deteriorates, therefore, helping to delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Another two studies from last month showed how vitamin E helped fight against memory disorders. And considering that paying attention is a key factor in working memory \u2014 after all, you need to remember/pay attention to what someone said in a conversation to respond \u2014 it\u2019s possible that vitamins may help people with ADHD focus.\n\nFor the study, Rucklidge and her team studied 80 adults who took either a micronutrient supplement or a placebo for eight weeks. The micronutrient capsule, called EMPowerplus, contained a total of 14 vitamins, 16 minerals, three amino acids, and three antioxidants. Both groups were told to take 15 capsules per day in three doses of five capsules with food and water, Medscape reported.\n\nAfter the trial ended, those who took the micronutrient capsules said they were more attentive and that their impulses and hyperactivity had reduced. The researchers also looked for a backup opinion, finding that parents, friends, and family members saw these improvements as well. \u201cOur study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness for micronutrients in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adults,\u201d Rucklidge said, according to the BBC.\n\nThe study is important, because it shows the benefits of taking micronutrient supplements. Furthermore, the supplement\u2019s manufacturer didn\u2019t fund the study. \u201cOne could not make this statement about most medication trials,\u201d Dr. Bonnie Kaplan told Medscape. \u201cAnother important novelty is that they studied a broad-spectrum vitamin plus mineral formula, which is likely the way in which humans evolved to need nutrients. Single-nutrient research does not respect the fact that we need all these vitamins and minerals every day, and in balance.\u201d\n\nFurther research is still necessary, however, to determine that micronutrient supplements are indeed capable of treating ADHD. If they are, then they \u201cwill offer people with ADHD another treatment option,\u201d Rucklidge said in a press release.\n\nSource: Rucklidge J, Frampton C, Forman B, et al.
