By hosting the Freedom Summit in Des Moines this past weekend, King has built a platform for himself and for a dozen or so pretenders to the throne in 2016.\n\nCo-hosted by Newt Gingrich\u2019s American Legacy PAC and by Citizens United, famous for winning the Supreme Court case that created this brave new world of campaign finance, the Freedom Summit was billed as the place where conservatives could focus on \u201chow we can get America back on track.\u201d\n\nKing is no shrinking violet when it comes to controversy. He regularly produces carefully crafted cringe-worthy sound bites, meant to get himself in the news. He called one of President Obama\u2019s guests at the State of Union \u201ca deportable.\u201d He claimed \u201cthat for every child of illegal immigrants who\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds, and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much King\u2019s reputation will rub off on the candidates who came to his confab. Some of the potential candidates for president, like Sarah Palin and Donald Trump Donald TrumpTeam Sanders pressures Trump for debate AP: Trump clinches GOP nomination Secretary Clinton, voters need something good to feel about MORE, agree with King and his sentiments. But others, like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, surely don\u2019t subscribe to the notion that writing off the fastest growing segment of the electorate is good politics.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note the contrast between former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the folks who showed up at the King version of \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d\n\nBush addressed a convention of auto dealers, 4,000 strong. He offered a positive vision of the future, free of dire predictions of gloom and doom. He offered real solutions to problems. He didn\u2019t peddle in Twitter-ready sound bites, and he engaged in what was billed as an \u201cadult conversation.\u201d\n\nCan the conservative movement handle an adult conversation?\n\nKing, on the other hand, challenged those running for president to sign a pledge to repeal ObamaCare, abolish the IRS and pass a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.\n\nNone of those things will happen in two years, and I doubt they will happen in my lifetime.\n\nThese are talking points meant to fire up a crowd, not realistic policy ideas that will be implemented to make America a better place to live.\n\nTexas Sen.

Political leaders who cynically make promises that they can\u2019t keep should face the wrath of the voters.\n\nBut that lesson was largely lost at the Freedom Summit.\n\nThere, all kinds of people were making all kinds of claims, knowing damn well that they didn\u2019t have the power or ability or the constitutional authority to make it happen.\n\nIt is one thing to serve up red meat to a red-meat crowd. It\u2019s another thing to promise a juicy steak without ever intending to deliver it to the table.\n\nBush has been a little light on serving the red meat. In many ways, he is telling conservative voters things that they don\u2019t want to hear, like, \u201cEat your vegetables.\u201d He thinks we should be realistic on immigration policy. He thinks we should have higher education standards. He thinks we should be respectful of all points of view when it comes to the issue of gay marriage.\n\nHe is attempting to have an adult conversation, focusing on practical solutions to intractable problems.\n\nThere is a long way to go before Republicans actually select their nominee for the White House. But we already see the contours of the race. It\u2019s the wise adult vs. the angry children. And in a party that usually falls in line but doesn\u2019t fall in love, it\u2019s better to be the wise adult.\n\nFeehery is president of QGA Public Affairs and blogs at www.thefeeherytheory.com.
