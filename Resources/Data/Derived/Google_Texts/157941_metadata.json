And we're not going to be able to pass it over here\u201d in the Senate.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow Republican leaders already were struggling to advance a bill to help Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, deal with its crippling $70 billion debt. Their efforts have been complicated by opposition from some conservative lawmakers, even as they have been negotiating with the Obama administration over details.\n\nSome conservative House Republicans, who want to protect creditors\u2019 rights, have balked at an element of the bill that could allow Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, a so-called cram-down debt restructuring.\n\nHatch, too, wants to protect creditors, but said the bill must include cram-down authority to ensure that more senior bondholders, like those holding Puerto Rico\u2019s constitutionally backed public debt, are better protected.\n\n\"Let\u2019s face it, you've got to protect the preferred creditors. If you don't do that, I mean, you're violating the rule of law to begin with,\u201d Hatch said, adding that he is working on a different approach to the legislation.\n\nThe internal division showcases the complexity of the task facing lawmakers - to keep Puerto Rico\u2019s economy intact, while also protecting the competing interests of 18 classes of bondholders owed money by the island.\n\nIn a brief interview with Reuters on Tuesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop expressed confidence that once rank-and-file House Republicans familiarize themselves with his bill, it will gain momentum. He added that \"bondholders and other players\" were beginning to contact lawmakers to talk up the legislation.\n\nLOOMING DEFAULT\n\nTime is of the essence. Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank owes creditors $422 million on May 1, a payment the island\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said it cannot afford. A default at GDB, the primary liquidity source for most of Puerto Rico\u2019s public agencies, would be the island\u2019s most significant default to date.\n\nThe bill would also create a federal board to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances, but legislators are debating how much power it should have.\n\nHatch on Tuesday said an oversight board would need \"the power to resolve the problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t give them the power to do that, it\u2019s just another bailout,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back here two years from now.\u201d\n\nHector Negroni, a prominent municipal finance investor, objects to the draft bill, saying it changes the rules under which debt was sold to investors and puts creditors at the bottom of the pile while ignoring the priority of payments.\n\nThat pivot will have a more adverse affect on the municipal bond market than any potential default in Puerto Rico, Negroni said on Saturday, in a panel discussion held by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Washington.\n\n\"So we have a framework here which doesn't help Puerto Rico, harms the state and local marketplaces by risking an expectation and change in the rules and raising borrowing costs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if it is not for Puerto Rico, and it is not for state and local governments, I'm not sure who this bill is for.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday that the bill is falling victim to intra-party divisions among Republicans. Hoyer said Republicans should collaborate with Democrats to advance a bill by next week that would need the support of only 40-50 of the House's 246 Republicans.\n\nThat would be a dangerous political step for Speaker Ryan, however, because he would be turning his back on a majority of members of his own political party on a major piece of legislation during an election year.\n\nFor now, Republicans \u201cseem to be at risk of not doing it at all,\u201d Hoyer said, referring to a Puerto Rico debt relief bill.\n\n(The story is refiled to clarify that Negroni spoke on Saturday, not Friday, paragraph 15)\n\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan, Susan Cornwell, David Morgan and Daniel Bases in Washington; Writing by Nick Brown in San Juan; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A high-ranking Republican senator on Tuesday dismissed as \"not", "title": "Senator Hatch raps House's Puerto Rico debt bill", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Senator-Hatch-raps-Houses-Puerto-Rico-debt-bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/baby-opioid_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Senator-Hatch-raps-Houses-Puerto-Rico-debt-bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/baby-opioid_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A high-ranking Republican senator on Tuesday dismissed as \"not", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "For now, Republicans \u201cseem to be at risk of not doing it at all,\u201d Hoyer said, referring to a Puerto Rico debt relief bill.\nThe bill would also create a federal board to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances, but legislators are debating how much power it should have.\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow Republican leaders already were struggling to advance a bill to help Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, deal with its crippling $70 billion debt.\nHatch, too, wants to protect creditors, but said the bill must include cram-down authority to ensure that more senior bondholders, like those holding Puerto Rico\u2019s constitutionally backed public debt, are better protected.\n\"So we have a framework here which doesn't help Puerto Rico, harms the state and local marketplaces by risking an expectation and change in the rules and raising borrowing costs,\u201d he said."}
