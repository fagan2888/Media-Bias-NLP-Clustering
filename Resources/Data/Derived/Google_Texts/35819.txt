Tucson Police say a vehicle struck a woman walking near North Campbell Avenue and East Speedway on Sunday night.

Roads in that area were closed as investigators worked to clear the scene. Eastbound Speedway was shut down from Campbell to Olsen.

Restrictions have since been lifted and Speedway is back open again.

The woman was taken to the hospital and is listed in critical condition.
