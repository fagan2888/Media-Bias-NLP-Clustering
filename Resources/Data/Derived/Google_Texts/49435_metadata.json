It\u2019s worth a read:\n\nPerhaps sensing an opportunity, social conservatives have used these libertarian fears to make the case for strengthening local communities. They argue that the disappearance of strong neighborhoods and towns created a void into which the overbearing hand of the state has entered. In this way, a roughly overlapping vocabulary of concerns has developed between the two groups\u2026 Social conservatives are right to point out that traditional forms of social trust and community have eroded. There is a real sense of loss and tragedy to all this. But one shouldn\u2019t let a desire to construct a bigger tent for Americans concerned about the growing power of the state lead one to the unwise conflation of two different views of human flourishing.\n\nI am not convinced by Blair\u2019s argument, which strikes me as premature. The overlap of civil libertarianism and the modern libertarian and federalist perspective on limited government is not merely due to shared vocabulary, but to an increasingly shared perspective on the encroachments of life under the ever-expanding scope of a nationalized and unrepresentative government. People with a shared understanding of government\u2019s outsized power can absolutely be at odds over what a good American life looks like. City mice and country mice can both love liberty and understand the appeal of local government over the rule of distant administrators.\n\nToday, progressives want everything locally grown except government. Why is this? In part, it\u2019s because self-government proves the failure of the Administrative State. As a rule, responsible self-governing neighborhoods and communities thrive and foster virtues which lead to close-knit communities and strong civil institutions. Ideally, they turn into little Lake Woebegons, where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average. The urban elites may mock the little pink houses with their picket fences, the soccer moms making grocery runs in the SUVs, the Vacation Bible Schools\u2026 but these are the communities where people actually live good wholesome American lives. The stronger these communities are, the more they form a hedge against the encroachments of government.\n\nConsider the death of the suburbs, which has been predicted eagerly (and inaccurately) by the left for decades. Today just one out of ten Americans live in a square mile of more than 10,000 people. And while just a third of Millennials are the heads of their own households and only 1 in 4 are married, they overwhelmingly say that they want to get married and have a family \u2013 70% for men and 78% for women. The desire of Millennials to own their own home is actually stronger than prior generations. And having a kid accelerates that desire even more, with the cohort with young children the likeliest to move to the suburbs or to small towns. Why is this? Because of the incentives of economy and community \u2013 the obvious benefit of neighborhood and homeownership and good schools and churches and community. Many Millennials won\u2019t choose this life, but many more will. The presence of Yelp does not eliminate the lure of this approach.\n\nThe progressive left and the technocratic right want the whole world to look like the political machines they know and love. They cannot tolerate the idea that self-governing communities outside their approach to dealmaking and spoils-centered politics could give people an attractive alternative. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so essential to them that the major decisions about our economy, policing, health care, education, transportation funding, and more be made in Washington, where the order they seek to impose on people\u2019s lives can be dictated by administrators beholden to no one except the stakeholders, the political and business interests who have a seat at the table.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 09:26:10 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Progressives want everything locally grown except government, in part because self-government proves the failure of the Administrative State.", "title": "Progressives Want Everything Locally Grown Except Government", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5263929842_789a4a18c1_b.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/08/22/progressives-want-everything-locally-grown-except-government/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Progressives want everything locally grown except government, in part because self-government proves the failure of the Administrative State.", "title": "Progressives Want Everything Locally Grown Except Government", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5263929842_789a4a18c1_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@bdomenech", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Government", "tag": "Administrative State,civil libertarians,libertarianism,locally grown government,Millennials,Peter Blair,suburbs", "published_time": "2014-08-22T09:26:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Progressives want everything locally grown except government, in part because self-government proves the failure of the Administrative State."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbddc\"", "article_summary": "Today, progressives want everything locally grown except government.\nAs a rule, responsible self-governing neighborhoods and communities thrive and foster virtues which lead to close-knit communities and strong civil institutions.\nPeople with a shared understanding of government\u2019s outsized power can absolutely be at odds over what a good American life looks like.\nThey argue that the disappearance of strong neighborhoods and towns created a void into which the overbearing hand of the state has entered.\nIt\u2019s worth a read:Perhaps sensing an opportunity, social conservatives have used these libertarian fears to make the case for strengthening local communities."}
