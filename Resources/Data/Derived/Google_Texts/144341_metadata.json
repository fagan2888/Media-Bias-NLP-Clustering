While Sakic and Roy wouldn\u2019t get specific, the team likely doesn\u2019t want to pay any more than it gives Matt Duchene \u2014 $6 million per season. Other teams with holes to fill at center might not flinch at exceeding that figure, however.\n\nO\u2019Reilly, also in Las Vegas as a nominee for the Lady Byng Trophy, doesn\u2019t seem to know where he is headed in negotiations. The Avs elected for salary arbitration with him earlier this month. If something can\u2019t be worked out before July 15, an arbitrator would offer him a one- or two-year contract, and after two more seasons O\u2019Reilly can become an unrestricted free agent.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s obviously an unfortunate piece for both sides. It\u2019s not something I wanted to go through, but all in all I\u2019m here at the awards trying to have a good time,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to leave the business for the business (people). It\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens. All I can do, myself, is focus on myself and training for next year and let my agent take care of that. When it comes time to make decisions, we\u2019ll make them. I\u2019m just trying to stay even keel. All my trust is in my agent (Pat Morris). He\u2019s done amazing things for me and will continue to do that. Obviously, I want to be in Colorado. I love it there. With both those things, something can get worked out.\u201d\n\nRoy said he is not too concerned about a potential impasse with O\u2019Reilly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why: Joe and I were players, and we also had to be businessmen. At this time of the year, it\u2019s no different for other teams. It\u2019s an unpleasant time. It\u2019s a negotiation, and Ryan has to do what he thinks is the best,\u201d Roy said. \u201cObviously, as a team, you always wish players are buying in to your structure, buying into your plan, and Joe is doing a super job. He\u2019s the one dealing with the contracts. From a coaching perspective, I don\u2019t see it as a problem.\u201d\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patrick Roy says Avs hoping for long deals with Paul Stastny, Ryan O\u2019Reilly", "title": "Patrick Roy says Avs hoping for long deals with Paul Stastny, Ryan O\u2019Reilly", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/23/patrick-roy-says-avs-hoping-for-long-deals-with-paul-stastny-ryan-oreilly/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912__patrick-roy-avs-091213p1.jpg", "height": 413}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912__patrick-roy-avs-091213p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-23T15:26:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:49:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Avalanche coach Patrick Roy expressed optimism Monday that long-term deals still can be worked out for potential unrestricted free-agent center Paul Stastny and restricted free agent Ryan O\u2019Reilly of the Avalanche.\nStastny, 28, could become the most attractive free agent available if he can\u2019t work something out with the Avs.\nAvs executive vice president of hockey operations Joe Sakic is in Las Vegas and likely to talk with Stastny\u2019s agent, Matt Keator.\nThe Avs paid him $6.6 million per season over the past five seasons, but don\u2019t want to go that high again.\nWith both those things, something can get worked out.\u201dRoy said he is not too concerned about a potential impasse with O\u2019Reilly."}
