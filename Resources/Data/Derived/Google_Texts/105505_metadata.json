None of them can claim to be the most efficient killer on the planet. Those creatures don\u2019t attack as well and as mercilessly as a sea horse, according to the Discovery channel\u2019s DNews.\n\nRELATED Video: Sea Monster Caught on Oil Rig Camera Identified\n\nThe cute and cuddly looking sea horse catches and devours 90 percent of its prey; for comparison, the great white only swallows 55 percent of its prey.\n\nWhy are they so deadly? Researchers at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas, Texas, used laser-infused, high speed cameras to figure it out. Apparently, sea horses sneak up on their prey (Copepods); invisible to them until it\u2019s too late. The sea horse\u2019s head has a unique shape which scientists say helps quietly suction their prey. Normally, other creatures inject certain vibrations into the water to alert their prey that they are coming. Prey, like the Copepods, feel those vibrations and are able to flee before they are attacked, but sea horse\u2019s long nostrils prevent giving off any vibrations after suction. Once they \u201csneak up\u201d on the Copepods, the killing happens in an instant and the prey have no time to escape.\n\nDNews reveals the sea creatures\u2019 idiosyncrasies further in the video below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Earth\u2019s Superkillers!
