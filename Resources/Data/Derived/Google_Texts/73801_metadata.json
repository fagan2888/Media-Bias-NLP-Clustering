But she said the group is treading \u201ca fine line\u201d: it wants to broaden the audience for Gowanus\u2019s artists, but it doesn\u2019t want to promote big development. \u201cThe concern is that, by collaborating, we are perceived as endorsing development,\u201d Subak said. \u201cWe are not endorsing big-box development or luxury development.\u201d She has good reason to be sensitive. As in a lot of communities Whole Foods is eying, development is already transforming Gowanus. In addition to the new grocery store, a seven-hundred-unit condominium building is breaking ground. \u201cPeople are freaked out,\u201d Subak said. Residents have protested against both of these projects, part of a broader debate over how to develop Gowanus sustainably and inclusively.\n\nIs the value of building a grocery store on an desolate street dotted with storage facilities, gas stations, and gated warehouses\u2014on a lot that\u2019s been vacant for 132 years\u2014really something worth debating?
