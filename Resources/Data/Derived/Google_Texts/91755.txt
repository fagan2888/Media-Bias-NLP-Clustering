James Woods is a big fan of a video of President Obama.

The actor recently tweeted a link to the clip and commented: "This is the best video. So delicious watching #Obama lie directly into the camera again and again and again...#liar"

In the video, the president is seen in 2009 assuring voters over and over again, "If you like your doctor, or health care plan, you can keep it."

Leading up to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, the president promised voters that changes in the law would not mean they had to change doctors or health care plans.

In 2013 the fact-checking website Politifact named President Obama's promise the Lie of the Year: "So this fall, as cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized that Obama's breezy assurances were wrong."
