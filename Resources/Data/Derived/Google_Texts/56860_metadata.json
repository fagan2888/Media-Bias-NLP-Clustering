Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and his policy proposals on Friday: \u201cWe won\u2019t get fooled again,\u201d he told CBS This Morning.\n\nWeinstein was referring to Sanders\u2019 promises to make health care and college free for all. Instead, Weinstein argued, the government should focus on those in need. \u201cI can afford to send my kids to school. Let\u2019s concentrate on the kids that can\u2019t afford to go to school. \u2026 Let\u2019s get the ones who can\u2019t afford health care. Easier solution than saying, \u2018Let\u2019s give it away,\u2019 and bankrupt the country \u2026 I know a lot of guys saying that doesn\u2019t add up, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when Weinstein himself was \u201cfooled\u201d the first time: he supported Clinton over Barack Obama in 2008. He did, however, defend Obamacare \u2014 a policy that changed health insurance for nearly everyone in the country, rather than focusing on the small minority who lacked insurance or were unhappy with their insurance policies.\n\nIn November 2015, Weinstein defended Obama\u2019s struggling Obamacare system, telling Piers Morgan in an interview on CNN: \u201c\u2026 this is the only the country in the world where we don\u2019t have health care. Countries embarrass us around the world. And this is the only country in the world, we don\u2019t have a gun law. I watched you, you know, talk about that. You know, quite frankly it\u2019s embarrassing. Obama is not embarrassing. The country is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear whether Weinstein regrets that statement, but he has clearly revised his view on universal health care.\n\nHe is not alone: a new survey conducted by Vox.com found that two-thirds of Bernie Sanders supporters do not want to pay the additional amount in taxes required to provide free health care or free college tuition for all Americans.\n\nWeinstein also told CBS that Clinton is a \u201cstrong, proven leader \u2026 the world is crazy and we need that smart hand.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, the National Review called The Who\u2019s \u201cWont Get Fooled Again\u201d the #1 conservative rock song of all time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberal Hollywood mogul and Hillary Clinton supporter Harvey Weinstein mocked Bernie Sanders on Friday: \"We won't get fooled again,\" he said.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Liberal Hollywood mogul and Hillary Clinton supporter Harvey Weinstein mocked Bernie Sanders on Friday: \"We won't get fooled again,\" he said.", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Mocks Sanders: 'We Won't Get Fooled Again'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/harvey-weinstein.jpg", "height": 500}, "updated_time": "2016-04-15T15:17:16-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/04/15/harvey-weinstein-mocks-bernie-sanders-wont-get-fooled/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liberal Hollywood mogul and Hillary Clinton supporter Harvey Weinstein mocked Bernie Sanders on Friday: \"We won't get fooled again,\" he said.", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/harvey-weinstein.jpg", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Mocks Sanders: 'We Won't Get Fooled Again'", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, CBS, Harvey Weinstein, Hillary Clinton, obamacare, rock n roll, The Who, won't get fooled again,Big Government, Big Hollywood, Breitbart TV,Harvey Weinstein", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-04-15T08:58:22-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T15:17:16-07:00", "tag": "won't get fooled again", "categories": "Big Government,Big Hollywood,Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Weinstein was referring to Sanders\u2019 promises to make health care and college free for all.\nThe country is embarrassing.\u201dIt is not clear whether Weinstein regrets that statement, but he has clearly revised his view on universal health care.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLiberal Hollywood mogul and Hillary Clinton supporter Harvey Weinstein cited The Who in slamming Sen.
