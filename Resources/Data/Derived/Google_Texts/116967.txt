In case we don't come back, @BackroadCRAIG and I are going right through Winter Storm Goliath to kill ducks in Oklahoma. ðŸ˜… #IntoTheStorm â€” Chase Morland (@ChaseMorland) December 27, 2015

, the singer in Northwest Arkansas country-rock band Backroad Anthem, remains missing after an ill-fated duck hunting trip on an Oklahoma lake that ended in the death of another Arkansas man,, 22, of Van Buren.Stricklin, 29, is from Springdale. On Monday, authorities found Morland's body near Kaw Lake in northern Oklahoma. The two friends went hunting early Sunday as a massive storm system rolled across the state. Oklahoma state police and local law enforcement found their capsized boat shortly after midnight on Monday, according to the Tulsa World. Backroad Anthem was scheduled to perform a New Year's Eve show at the Rev Room in Little Rock.The same system that dumped near-record rainfall in Arkansas over the weekend resulted in snow, sleet and ice in northern Oklahoma. Morland sent a tweet late Saturday night that indicates the men were aware of the dangerous conditions.
