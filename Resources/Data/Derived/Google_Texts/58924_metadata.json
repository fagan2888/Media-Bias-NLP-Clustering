It\u2019s not by accident that Paris barely looks different from the 19th century, when Emperor Napoleon III came up with a grand plan for grand boulevards and low, white stone buildings.\n\nBut the two leading candidates in elections starting Sunday \u2014 Socialist Anne Hidalgo and conservative longshot Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, known as NKM among the initial-loving French \u2014 see room for improvement. Here are their visions:\n\n___\n\nTHE METRO\n\nThe first subway trains leave around 5:30 a.m. and the last around 12:30 a.m \u2014 a frustrating schedule for people who come to Paris for the nightlife. Both candidates have proposed expanding the hours. The conservative\u2019s plans would match London\u2019s, where plans are to have the Tube run around the clock on weekends beginning in 2015.\n\n___\n\nTHE METRO YOU DON\u2019T SEE\n\nParis also has 10 abandoned subway stations \u2014 mostly unseen, as the trains hurtle through their darkened tunnels. NKM has a futuristic plan to transform these stations into public spaces like a swimming pool, performance hall or restaurant.\n\n___\n\nMORE SHOPPING, EIFFEL TOWER REDO\n\nParis turns quiet on Sundays \u2014 most stores are closed, and those that are open tend to shut down shortly after lunch. NKM wants to expand the city\u2019s relatively small tourist zones where Sunday openings are permitted and allow department stores, grocers and public swimming pools to stay open later. She\u2019s also in favor of expanded hours for luxury shopping districts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paris mayor\u2019s race offers chance to reimagine city", "title": "Paris mayor\u2019s race offers chance to reimagine city", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Paris mayor\u2019s race offers chance to reimagine city", "title": "Paris mayor\u2019s race offers chance to reimagine city", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/paris_mayors_race_offers_chance_to_reimagine_city/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/france-paris-mayors-race.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paris mayor\u2019s race offers chance to reimagine city", "title": "Paris mayor\u2019s race offers chance to reimagine city", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/france-paris-mayors-race.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lori Hinnant", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce28a\"", "article_summary": "___THE METRO YOU DON\u2019T SEEParis also has 10 abandoned subway stations \u2014 mostly unseen, as the trains hurtle through their darkened tunnels.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsPARIS (AP) \u2014 The Paris mayor\u2019s race will give the city a new leader for the first time in 13 years and is offering a chance to reimagine one of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations.\nHere are their visions:___THE METROThe first subway trains leave around 5:30 a.m. and the last around 12:30 a.m \u2014 a frustrating schedule for people who come to Paris for the nightlife.\nNKM has a futuristic plan to transform these stations into public spaces like a swimming pool, performance hall or restaurant.\nNKM wants to expand the city\u2019s relatively small tourist zones where Sunday openings are permitted and allow department stores, grocers and public swimming pools to stay open later."}
