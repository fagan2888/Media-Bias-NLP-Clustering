Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) was confronted on Tuesday by a local woman who criticized him for his stances on womens’ reproductive health and the Affordable Care Act, WFTS-TV reported.

“You cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare,” said the woman, who identified herself as 39-year-old Cara Jennings. “You’re an a*shole. You don’t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here.”

The face-off, captured on video by a witness, took place after Scott entered a Starbucks in Gainesville. Jennings is seen shushing another woman as she assails Scott, who responds that his administration has created one million jobs.

“A million jobs? Great, who here has a great job?” Jennings asks. “Or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?”

Jennings later told WFTS she was motivated by Scott’s decision to sign a bill cutting funding toward Planned Parenthood clinics in the state.

“I didn’t think about whether I should do it or not,” she said. “I thought, ‘Here’s my chance to tell the governor how I feel about the horrible bill.”

The footage also shows Scott leaving the coffee shop after telling Jennings to “tell the truth,” without ordering anything. Jennings said that several customers thanked her for her actions.
