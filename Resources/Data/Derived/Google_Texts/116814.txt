Each year, residents of Washington, D.C., enjoy an abundance of Christmas celebrations unique to the nation’s capital.

From “The Nutcracker” ballet at the Kennedy Center to the enormous wreaths hung outside Union Station, Washington offers plenty of opportunities to enjoy the Christmas season.

Actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson recently served as hosts for this year’s National Christmas Tree lighting, which featured the Obamas and a variety of musical artists. Our video gives you an inside look.
