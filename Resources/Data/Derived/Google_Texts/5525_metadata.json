House Minority Leader Pelosi, D-California, shared Bendery's article in a blog post on her website. The article was first shared with me in the form of a press release from a public relations firm, and the same argument can be found in several liberal websites (here and here, for instance).\n\nThe complaint that the bill increases taxes is a red herring to begin with. The bill is designed to force companies receiving the credit to remove their abortion coverage. If the legislation were to become law, those companies would not get a tax increase, they would change their coverage so they could continue to get the credit. If those companies wanted to continue to pay for their employees abortions, they could continue to do so, they would just have to set up a separate account that is not paid for with the government funds.\n\nObamacare was never supposed to fund abortions. President Barack Obama struck a deal with pro-life Democrats in order to get enough votes to pass the legislation. In exchange for their votes, he signed an executive order saying that none of the law's funding would pay for abortions.\n\nMuch of the criticism over Obamacare's abortion funding has been related to the state-level exchanges where individual's can purchase insurance, rather than the credit for small businesses. The Charlotte Lozier Institute and Family Research Council set up a website, ObamacareAbortion.com, to provide information about which health plans on the exchanges cover abortion. Not only are government subsidies paying for some of these health insurance plans, but due to the lack of transparency, pro-life customers are having difficulty finding which plans do not cover abortion.\n\nBy highlighting the small business tax credit, however, Pelosi, Bendery and other liberals have (perhaps unwittingly) exposed yet another way that Obamacare funds abortions.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Even though pro-lifers were criticized for saying that \"Obamacare\" funds abortion, some liberals, including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, are now complaining about Obamacare abortion funding that the U.S. House voted to remove Thursday.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Nancy Pelosi, Liberals Admit 'Obamacare' Funds Abortion, Now That Republicans Voted to Strip Funding", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "Even though pro-lifers were criticized for saying that \"Obamacare\" funds abortion, some liberals, including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, are now complaining about Obamacare abortion funding that the U.S. House voted to remove Thursday.", "author": "Napp Nazworth", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/nancy-pelosi-liberals-admit-obamacare-funds-abortion-now-that-republicans-voted-to-strip-funding-133040/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/80338/nancy-pelosi-john-boehner.jpg", "title": "Nancy Pelosi, Liberals Admit 'Obamacare' Funds Abortion, Now That Republicans Voted to Strip Funding", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/80338/nancy-pelosi-john-boehner.jpg", "title": "Nancy Pelosi, Liberals Admit 'Obamacare' Funds Abortion, Now That Republicans Voted to Strip Funding", "description": "Even though pro-lifers were criticized for saying that \"Obamacare\" funds abortion, some liberals, including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, are now complaining about Obamacare abortion funding that the U.S. House voted to remove Thursday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianPost"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/nancy-pelosi-liberals-admit-obamacare-funds-abortion-now-that-republicans-voted-to-strip-funding-133040/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Obamacare,Abortion,Nancy&20Pelosi,No&20Taxpayer&20Funding&20for&20Abortion&20Act,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2015-01-24T09:46:59-05:00", "modDate": "2015-01-24T09:46:59-05:00"}, "Keywords": "Obamacare, Abortion, Nancy Pelosi, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Even though pro-lifers were criticized for saying that \"Obamacare\" funds abortion, some liberals, including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, are now complaining about Obamacare abortion funding that the U.S. House voted to remove Thursday.\nBy highlighting the small business tax credit, however, Pelosi, Bendery and other liberals have (perhaps unwittingly) exposed yet another way that Obamacare funds abortions.\n\"Republicans Include Tax Hike In Latest Abortion Bill,\" announced the headline of a Huffington Post article by Jennifer Bendery.\nThe No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which passed 242-179, would require that insurance plans that receive government funding no longer cover elective abortions.\nMuch of the criticism over Obamacare's abortion funding has been related to the state-level exchanges where individual's can purchase insurance, rather than the credit for small businesses."}
