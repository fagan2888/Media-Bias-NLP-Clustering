The second is that the IRS is developing plans that would allow third parties like paid return preparers and software companies to do more to help taxpayers in cases where the online accounts are insufficient, which could increase costs for taxpayers.\n\n\u201cReading between the lines of the IRS future state vision, the IRS appears to replace traditional IRS employee-to-taxpayer interaction with online and third-party interactions,\u201d Olson said in the preface to the report. \u201cThat is, the vision essentially eliminates IRS-taxpayer personal interaction except in the context of enforcement actions.\u201d\n\nOlson said she understood why the IRS would want to adopt a system that deals with taxpayers en masse given its budget and workload constraints. However, she argued that \u201cthis approach transforms our tax system into a pay-to-play system\u201d where only those with the expertise to navigate the self-help options or the resources to pay a third party to help them will be able to protect their rights.\n\nOlson supports online taxpayer accounts but said that they won\u2019t dramatically reduce demand for telephone and face-to-face interactions with the IRS.\n\nTaxpayers have made more than 100 million telephone calls to the IRS and more than 5 million visits to walk-in sites annually in recent years. A large number of these contacts take place after tax returns are filed, which require IRS personnel to examine the details of a taxpayer\u2019s account to respond, according to the report.\n\nOlson also said that a focus on online accounts would put pressure on the IRS to allow unregulated return preparers access to them.\n\n\u201cThe IRS should not even consider giving tax return preparers access to taxpayer account information until it is able to establish minimum standards for competence, to suspend preparers who engage in improper conduct, and to conduct background checks to weed out preparers with criminal records,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo grant all preparers access to taxpayer accounts is to put taxpayers\u2019 confidential tax information at risk.\u201d\n\nOlson recommended that the IRS publish the future state plan and seek public comment. She also suggested that Congress hold hearings in the next few months on the future state of IRS operations.\n\nIn addition to discussing problems with the future state plan, the report also discusses problems that undermine taxpayers\u2019 rights, problems that waste IRS resources and problems that contribute to noncompliance with earned income tax credits.\n\nTwo of the problems concern ObamaCare.\n\nOlson expressed concerns that the IRS\u2019 implementation of employer provisions of the healthcare law could burden both employers and employees if certain issues are aren\u2019t addressed. She also said that the IRS is compromising taxpayer rights as it implements provisions relating to ObamaCare\u2019s premium tax credit and individual shared responsibility payment.\n\nThe report also stated that hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who file legitimate tax returns experience delays in receiving their refunds because of an increasing rate of false positives within anti-fraud filters.\n\nThe IRS said that Olson's report \"does not paint a full picture of these evolving future state efforts,\" and the agency defended its interest in expanding online services.\n\n\n\n\"The IRS remains fully committed to personal service to taxpayers, and the IRS believes increasing the availability of self-service interaction frees up in-person resources for taxpayers who truly need them, including those who are not comfortable online or don\u2019t have personal access to a computer,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\n\u2014Updated at 11:14 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Report identifies 24 of the most of the most serious problems taxpayers encounter.", "description": "Report identifies 24 of the most of the most serious problems taxpayers encounter.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Naomi Jagoda", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Report identifies 24 of the most of the most serious problems taxpayers encounter.", "title": "Watchdog warns taxpayers to have service problems at IRS", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/264873-watchdog-warns-taxpayers-to-have-service-problems-at-irs", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/irs_080515getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/264873-watchdog-warns-taxpayers-to-have-service-problems-at-irs", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-06T10:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,IRS", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-06T10:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/264873-watchdog-warns-taxpayers-to-have-service-problems-at-irs", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Report identifies 24 of the most of the most serious problems taxpayers encounter.", "card": "summary", "title": "Watchdog warns taxpayers to have service problems at IRS"}, "dcterms.title": "Watchdog warns taxpayers to have service problems at IRS"}, "article_summary": "In addition to discussing problems with the future state plan, the report also discusses problems that undermine taxpayers\u2019 rights, problems that waste IRS resources and problems that contribute to noncompliance with earned income tax credits.\nADVERTISEMENTThe report identified and made recommendations about 24 of the most of the most serious problems taxpayers encounter.\nThe Internal Revenue Service may be heading toward a dramatic reduction in personal interactions between the agency and taxpayers, the IRS\u2019 in-house watchdog warned.\nShe also suggested that Congress hold hearings in the next few months on the future state of IRS operations.\n\u201cReading between the lines of the IRS future state vision, the IRS appears to replace traditional IRS employee-to-taxpayer interaction with online and third-party interactions,\u201d Olson said in the preface to the report."}
