In total, those raises add up to nearly $100,000 over the course of a year. The boost in salaries comes even as the state continues to recover financially.\n\nThe biggest pay hike went for the position of director of Department of Licensing. That\u2019s the agency that handles driver licenses and license plates among other duties. The new director \u2013 Pat Kohler \u2013 earns $141,000 per year. That\u2019s a 17 percent increase over her predecessor.\n\nDavid Postman, a spokesman for Governor Inslee, says it was a matter of parity with other cabinet officials. \u201cIn the case of the Licensing it just seemed to be off compared to other agencies of its size and responsibility and so when the change was made there it seemed like a time to readjust that salary.\u201d\n\nThe second biggest salary adjustment went to the new head of Washington\u2019s Health Care Authority, Dorothy Frost Teeter. That position got a 15 percent raise to the top of the allowed salary range: nearly $152,000.\n\nPostman says that\u2019s because the agency has a major role to play in implementing the federal Affordable Care Act here in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a priority of the Governor\u2019s to do it and do it well,\" he says. \"It\u2019s important for the economy, it\u2019s important for the health of the people of Washington state. It\u2019s a bigger job than it was prior to this year.\u201d\n\nInslee has a 25 member executive cabinet \u2013 from the Department of Agriculture to Veterans Affairs. As of this month, 12 of those positions have received no adjustment. 12 got salary increases \u2013 mostly in the two to eight percent range. And the salary for one position \u2013 Puget Sound Partnership \u2013 actually went down.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like they went through a fair, deliberative process,\u201d says Greg Devereux, who heads the Washington Federation of State Employees.\n\nHe says Governor Inslee should take the same approach when the time comes to negotiate new contracts with state workers. \u201cWe would hope that just as cabinet member\u2019s salaries have been adjusted to meet market demands that the same thing would apply to state worker salary survey issues.\u201d\n\nDuring the Great Recession, cost of living increases were frozen for state employees. That was followed by mandatory furloughs. Then came a 3 percent pay cut that hit everyone \u2013 including cabinet officers.\n\nThat\u2019s since been restored. In the current state employee contracts, the union says most of its members will get a raise in the one to three percent range.\n\nOn the Web:\n\nGovernor Jay Inslee's Cabinet - Office of the Governor", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government and Politics", "description": "Since taking office in January, Washington Governor Jay Inslee has raised the salaries for several cabinet level positions.
