But even if we could sign up \u2014 and three weeks into its operation, the exchange is still not accepting applications \u2014 Cover Oregon\u2019s confusion over how to determine income and eligibility for tax credits makes one wonder if they can ever get ObamaCare working.\n\nConsider, for example, that under the Affordable Care Act, income for self-employed people like myself is supposed to be determined by one\u2019s estimated 2014 MAGI, or modified adjusted gross income. Under the law, this means your net business income (gross income less ordinary business expenses, or Line 12 on IRS form 1040) minus any IRA contributions, the deductible portion of self-employment taxes, and the premiums you paid for health insurance.\n\nBut Question No. 26 of the Cover Oregon health exchange application asks you to state not your net income but your \u201cgross income (before costs and deductions).\u201d There is no place to enter ordinary business expenses \u2014 30-45 percent of gross income for most small businesses \u2014 to get to your net business income, which is the starting point for determining MAGI.\n\nAm I supposed to ignore the reference \u201cgross income\u201d and simply enter my net business income instead in Question No. 26? Nobody at Cover Oregon knows.\n\nOr am I supposed to enter the 30-45 percent of gross income that goes to ordinary business expenses on Question No. 29 instead? That question asks you if you have any extra deductions for \u201cIRA contributions,\u201d \u201cother taxable adjustments\u201d (whatever that means), or \u201cself-employment deductions,\u201d a category that sole proprietors, small businesses, and CPAs generally take to refer to the deductible portion of self-employment taxes.\n\nSpecifically, should I include ordinary business expenses as an extra deduction under \u201cself-employment deductions\u201d on Question 29 along with the deductible portion of my self-employment taxes? Nobody at Cover Oregon knows.\n\nThen there\u2019s the not-incidental problem that one\u2019s eligibility for tax credits \u2014 one\u2019s estimated 2014 MAGI \u2014 is partly determined by one\u2019s estimated health insurance costs in 2014. Which, of course, can only be determined by trying to come up with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 your estimated 2014 MAGI.\n\nIt\u2019s all rather circular, and impossible to be accurate about.\n\nWhen my highly experienced insurance agent called Cover Oregon to ask these questions, a representative put him on hold for 10 minutes while she, quote, \u201cresearched the questions.\u201d She finally came back on the line and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t know the answers to those questions.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even if Cover Oregon used an industry-standard method of determining applicant incomes, they have no reliable way to verify those incomes. Their plan, according to Cover Oregon spokespeople, is to compare your estimated 2014 MAGI against actual 2012 adjusted gross income \u2014 line 37 on IRS Form 1040 \u2014 which is a) not always the same thing as MAGI and b) in any event two years out of date and based on estimates, not demonstrable facts.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps Cover Oregon\u2019s oddest misstep is that nowhere on the application is the term \u201cMAGI\u201d (or \u201cmodified adjusted gross income\u201d) even mentioned \u2014 despite the fact that that it\u2019s the law of the land in determining self-employed income eligibility under ObamaCare.\n\nAgain, I\u2019d love to sign up my family for ObamaCare \u2014 it\u2019ll save us literally hundreds of dollars a month in premiums compared to the individual coverage we now have to purchase from Regence Blue Cross. And it will give us much better coverage.\n\n\n\nBut Cover Oregon\u2019s application doesn\u2019t employ industry-standard accounting terms used by every small business and CPA to determine income for self-employed people. They have no effective means of verifying income. And to top it all off, the enrollment site is still not functioning three weeks past its supposed start date.\n\nWhat a mess.\n\nDavid Kline is a journalist and author living in northeast Portland.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "cover oregon, opinion", "title": "Cover Oregon's tax credit confusion: Guest opinion", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cover Oregon\\u0027s tax credit confusion: Guest opinion\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/10/a_case_study_in_cover_oregon_d.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/13628576-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11484105\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-22T23:08:13Z\", \"author\": \"Guest Columnist\", \"tags\": [\"cover oregon\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/13628576-standard.jpg", "creator": "@oregonian", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "By David Kline I can&#8217;t wait to sign my family up for one of the new Cover Oregon health insurance exchange plans.
