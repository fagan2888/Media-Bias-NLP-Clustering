As of 2012, Pennsylvania was one of just four states with the carve-out.\n\nThat will change if House Bill 874, which eliminates the loophole, becomes law. The Keystone Chapter of the Associated Building Contractors is eager to see it happen after unions subjected some members to \u201ccreepy, creepy stuff\u201d during labor disputes, said Brent Sailhamer, director of government affairs for ABC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a no-brainer from a policy standpoint,\u201d he said.\n\nUnions don\u2019t see the issue the same way. The exemption, some labor officials say, protects workers conducting legal organizing activities and ensures their free speech rights. They say laws already on the books come into play when people act inappropriately.\n\nRick Bloomingdale, president of the AFL-CIO of Pennsylvania, said the bill is a solution in search of a problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to gauge if folks will use it or not\u201d if it becomes law, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re going to see a lot of employers trying to use it to harass people on the picket line or folks that are organizing or doing any kind of activity.\u201d\n\nThe House probably will vote on the bill this week, said Steve Miskin, a spokesman for House Republicans. Some lawmakers believe that it was jump-started earlier this year after a federal jury convicted a once prominent Philadelphia union official of arson, racketeering conspiracy, and extortion.\n\nBloomingdale noted the same example, though, when saying \u201cthings have worked pretty well for a lot of years.\u201d\n\nABC has lobbied for the bill in two separate legislative sessions; its members are fed up with behavior they believe has crossed the line.\n\nIn that time, one member testified before lawmakers about union workers peppering his neighborhood with critical fliers over and over again.\n\nIn another instance, Post Brothers Apartments was renovating an old factory in Philadelphia into apartments, but the project turned tumultuous after union contractors walked off the job when they discovered that open-shop contractors were involved.\n\nWhile Post Brothers anticipated using 60 percent union labor, union contractors wanted them to commit to 100 percent. When Post Brothers wouldn\u2019t meet that demand and hired mostly non-union contractors, the work zone turned into a \u201cwar zone,\u201d as union protestors accosted contractors and threatened others, a company official told lawmakers at a public hearing in 2013.\n\nSarina Rose, vice president of development for Post Brothers Apartments, said union-affiliated contractors also photographed her children at the bus stop and taped the pictures up at their sporting events. The legal loophole gave them a pass, she said.\n\n\u201cIf there was a pedophile photographing my children or if I had an ex-husband who threatened to shoot me with a gun, I could certainly implore law enforcement to do something about it,\u201d Rose told the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cBut because there are certain trades in this self-proclaimed active labor dispute with my company, the DA\u2019s Office self-admittedly treats these cases differently.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Ron Marsico, the Dauphin County Republican who introduced the bill, didn\u2019t respond to a message seeking comment about the legislation. It recently passed in the state Senate, and Sailhamer expects that it will cruise in the House, which has been receptive to it before.\n\nJeffrey Sheridan, Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s press secretary, said \u201cthe governor will review the bill once it reaches his desk.\u201d\n\nWolf has previously vetoed public pension reform and legislation privatizing state-owned wine and liquor stores\u2014two bills that organized labor has vehemently opposed. Sailhamer thinks the governor will have a more difficult time striking down legislation closing the stalking loophole.\n\n\u201cAll it does is allow for a clarification in state law that says you just can\u2019t follow people around and videotape their kids at soccer games just because they don\u2019t use union labor,\u201d he said.\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The stalking loophole has existed since the state officially defined the offense in its criminal code in 2002.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The stalking loophole has existed since the state officially defined the offense in its criminal code in 2002.", "title": "In Pennsylvania, Stalking Can Be Legal for Union Members.
