Top headlines for Friday, Aug. 15, 2014:

1. About 100 people gathered at Monument Circle on Thursday night to silently demonstrate their solidarity with those in Ferguson, Mo., protesting the fatal shooting of teen Michael Brown and police brutality. Other cities, including Bloomington, across Indiana and the U.S. also planned rallies.

-- Meanwhile, Ferguson enjoyed its first peaceful night of the week as protesters marched alongside Missouri state troopers, who replaced heavily armored local police on the scene Thursday -- some even stopping to hug and chat with Capt. Ron Johnson, the officer in charge, who was born and grew up nearby. Ferguson police today are identifying the officer who shot Brown, which has been a key demand.

-- Nearly two times a week in the United States, a white police officer killed a black person during a seven-year period ending in 2012, according to the most recent accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the FBI. Read more at USATODAY.com.

2. Congratulations to the Indiana Fever on making the WNBA playoffs! The Fever defeated New York Liberty 76-63 on Thursday to clinch their 10th consecutive appearance, tying them with the Seattle Storm for the league record. "We always talk about just get in the playoffs; don't worry about where, just get in," said star Tamika Catchings. "I think the pieces are starting to click for us, so we just have to continue building."

3. Tired of never getting rich in your office lottery pool? You may be interested in a new national game, Monopoly Millionaire's Club, that will debut in Indiana on Oct. 19. It's designed to create hundreds of millionaires instead of one, Hoosier Lottery officials said. Unlike traditional draw games like Mega Millions and PowerBall, the new game's jackpot will not swell each time it rolls over, just the number of possible winners.

4. The former Snooty Fox restaurant, on East 86th Street near Westfield Boulevard, is finally getting a new use. Local father-and-son restaurateurs Ed and Eddie Sahm have decided to open Big Lug Canteen and Brewery to tap into the craft-beer boom. Ed Sahm also plans to open a Rockstone Pizza eatery, a brand he owns with other business partners, in a separate suite in the building. While the Indianapolis craft-beer market is increasingly saturated, the Sahms believe they have a can't-miss location for both the brewery and the pizza joint at the location beside the Monon Trail in Nora.

6. U.S. District Judge William T. Lawrence included a foreboding footnote in the ruling issued this week allowing Indiana's challenge to the Affordable Care Act to proceed. Lawrence noted the challengers' argument assumes that everyone who works for an Indiana employer also lives in Indiana, but it's likely that some live in Kentucky, which has a state exchange. If just one employee living in a state with its own exchange were to use a subsidy to buy an exchange plan, penalties for the company would kick in â€” $2,000 for just about all the full-time workers, not just the one. Maureen Groppe details the fine print in her Behind Closed Doors item at IndyStar.com.

7. By the time of his suicide Monday, Robin Williams was battling the early stages of Parkinson's disease, it has been revealed by his widow, Susan Schneider. In a statement sent to the news media on Thursday, Schneider explains that the star's sobriety was "intact" at the time of his death, calling him "brave" as he battled depression, anxiety and early stages of the disease. Actor Michael J. Fox, diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991, tweeted Thursday evening that he was "stunned" by the news. "Pretty sure his support for our (foundation) predated his diagnosis. A true friend; I wish him peace."

8. How terrible: A Virginia sheriff's deputy shot his own 16-year-old daughter after he mistook her for an intruder as she sneaked back into their home, authorities say. After alerting 911, the deputy then crashed his car while racing her to the hospital, and emergency responders finished transporting her for treatment at Winchester Medical Center, where she was listed in stable condition Thursday.

9. THIS is how chilly our summer has been: Starbucks is bringing back early one of its most popular and warming seasonal drinks, the Pumpkin Spice Latte. The traditionally fall favorite will be available starting Aug. 25, according to posts on its official Twitter account, @TheRealPSL. (And the drink has more followers than most of us combined, notes Cincinnati.com's Tasha Stewart.)

10. Best wishes to Bob Kravitz, who said Thursday he is leaving IndyStar after 14 years to go work for WTHR (Channel 13). Bob has chronicled all of the major local sports events of the past decade, including the Colts' two Super Bowl runs and Peyton Manning's decision to leave town. The Star now has begun a national search for a major sports columnist, said Ronnie Ramos, the Star's managing director of digital and sports. If you have a favorite to suggest, please let us know!
