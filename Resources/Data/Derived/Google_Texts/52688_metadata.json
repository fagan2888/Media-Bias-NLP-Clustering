Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Administrator Slavitt spoke about a number of subjects, but the big news was his announcement of the end of the EHR Meaningful Use program, which has long frustrated Medicare and Medicaid providers.\n\nAdministrator Slavitt began his remarks by stressing his commitment, as \u201ca private sector guy,\u201d to be transparent and cooperative with the private sector. He explained that, when he was in the private sector, \u201cCMS often felt opaque to me, and I probably said more than once how helpful it would be to know CMS\u2019s agenda rather than divining them by poring through an often intricate set of regulations like they were Fed minutes.\u201d Administrator Slavitt also indicated a desire to improve implementation of CMS initiatives, explaining that he is \u201ca believer in the maxim that it\u2019s always 90 percent about implementation.\u201d\n\nAdministrator Slavitt discussed the EHR Meaningful Use program in the context of the recently enacted Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). He explained that MACRA \u201cbrings pay for value into the mainstream through something called the Merit-based incentive program, which compels [CMS] to measure physicians on four categories: quality, cost, the use of technology, and practice improvement.\u201d\n\nTurning to the role of the Meaningful Use program, Administrator Slavitt stated:\n\nNow that we effectively have technology in[] virtually every place care is provided, we are now in the process of ending Meaningful Use and moving to a new regime culminating with the MACRA implementation.\n\nThe Meaningful Use program as it has existed, will now be effectively over and replaced with something better. Since late last year we have been working side by side with physician organizations across many communities \u2014 including with great advocacy from the AMA \u2014 and have listened to the needs and concerns of many. We will be putting out the details on this next stage over the next few months, but I will give you a themes guiding our implementation.\n\nAlthough the program details will be released \u201cover the next few months,\u201d Administrator Slavitt identified several features the new program would include:\n\nIncreased focus on patient outcomes, instead of rewarding providers for the use of technology; \u201cproviders will be able to customize their goals so tech companies can build around the individual practice needs, not the needs of the government\u201d; requiring \u201copen\u201d application program interfaces in EHR to \u201callow apps, analytic tools, and connected technologies to get data in and out of an EHR securely\u201d; and increased focus on interoperability.\n\nAs for the last feature, Administrator Slavitt stressed that CMS is \u201cdeadly serious about interoperability.\u201d \u201cAnd technology companies that look for ways to practice \u2018data blocking\u2019 in opposition to new regulations will find that it won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Andy Slavitt\u00a0announced\u00a0that the Electronic Health Records Meaningful Use program will effectively end and be replaced with something better.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Last week, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Andy Slavitt&amp;nbsp;announced&amp;nbsp;that the Electronic Health Records (EHR) Meaningful Use program will &amp;ldquo;effectively&amp;rdq", "title": "CMS Administrator Announces End of EHR Meaningful Use Program", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/cms-administrator-announces-end-ehr-meaningful-use-program", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/doctor%20computer%20e-health_10.jpg?itok=GRM0PZiL", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Centers for Medicare, Medicaid Services, CMS, Andy Slavitt, Electronic Health Records, EHR, Meaningful Use", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, government, Centers for Medicare, Medicaid Services, CMS, Andy Slavitt, Electronic Health Records, EHR, Meaningful Use"}, "article_summary": "Administrator Slavitt began his remarks by stressing his commitment, as \u201ca private sector guy,\u201d to be transparent and cooperative with the private sector.\nAdministrator Slavitt spoke about a number of subjects, but the big news was his announcement of the end of the EHR Meaningful Use program, which has long frustrated Medicare and Medicaid providers.\nMonday, January 18, 2016Last week, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Andy Slavitt announced that the Electronic Health Records (EHR) Meaningful Use program will \u201ceffectively\u201d end and be \u201creplaced with something better.\u201dOn January 12, 2016, Administrator Slavitt addressed the J.P.
