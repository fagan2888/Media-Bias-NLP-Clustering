No two seniors will face exactly the same challenges in aging, but by looking at approximations of the main expenses after 65, we can estimate how much it truly costs to grow old in America.\n\nOut-of-Pocket Medical Expenses\n\nWhile every American who turns 65 qualifies for the government health insurance program Medicare, seniors can still accumulate significant healthcare costs during their retirement. Copays, prescriptions, hearing aids and other out of expense pockets can add up dramatically. In May, Fidelity Benefits Consulting estimated the average medical expenses for a 65 year-old couple to be $220,000 for the remainder of their retirement. This figure has actually gone down 8% since last year due to changes to Medicare instituted as part of the Affordable Care Act. Brad Kimler of Fidelity noted, \u201cIt is extremely important that health care costs are factored into retirement savings strategies today so that retirees can be prepared to pay their medical bills throughout retirement.\u201d\n\nAverage lifetime costs after 65: $110,000 per individual / $220,000 per couple\n\nLong-term Care Costs\n\nA study published in the journal Inquiry found that the average American senior will require about three years of long-term care during his or her retirement. According to Genworth, the median annual cost for the base rent at an assisted living community is about $41,000 per year. The average annual cost for skilled nursing is about $71,000 per year. Because much long-term care is provided by unpaid family caregivers or is covered by Medicaid, the average senior\u2019s lifetime out-of-pocket long-term care expenses are about $50,000 . But we do not advise that you based your assumptions on this amount. Chronic illnesses and age related diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease can easily require a senior (or the senior\u2019s loved ones) to spend significantly more than this during their lifetime on care.\n\nIf you are trying to analyze potential care costs that your family may be facing, try A Place for Mom\u2019s Cost of Care Calculator. It allows you to compare the cost of assisted living in your city to the costs of maintaining a home and also to the costs of employing a full-time home care aide.\n\nAverage lifetime costs after 65: $50,000 per individual / $100,000 per couple (based on figures from Inquiry study adjusted for inflation)\n\nLiving Expenses\n\nWhile in retirement our income may drop dramatically, our expenses do not. According the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost of living for an American is $20,194 per year (or $50,485 for the average household). This includes costs such as food, housing and transportation. The average lifespan in the United States is 79 years. This means a 65 year-old couple would require about $565,000 to cover their basic living expenses during retirement.\n\nUnlike health-costs and long-term care costs, living expenses have an element of predictability to them. Rather than relying on nationwide average, retirees can estimate their own expenses based on their circumstances to get a closer picture of the amount of money required to cover their cost of living.\n\nAverage lifetime costs after 65: $282,000 per individual / $565,000 per couple\n\nOverall Average Retirement Expenses\n\nThe sum of these three broad categories of retirement expenses allows us to gauge the overall cost of life after 65, which is $412,000 for an individual, or $824,000 for a couple. But don\u2019t take this number as gospel. The real costs of aging are wildly unpredictable and depend on a number of \u201cX-factors.\u201d\n\nX-Factors: Inflation and Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nIn a market economy, prices never stay stagnant for long. Retirement experts advise that seniors assume inflation will be at least 3% annually. At this rate of inflation, costs double every 24 years.\n\nInflation represents the average increase in all costs over time, but health care costs are rising at a rate more rapid that inflation. While average healthcare costs for retirees decreased in 2012, the trend is for increasing healthcare costs overall. According to Insurance Journal, average out-of-pocket healthcare costs increased about 6% in 2012 and 12% in 2013.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, these figures are based on the largely unpredictable factor of lifespan. A longer lifespan means more costs. It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect life-expectancy to increase with advances in medicine and technology, and as American society becomes more focused on healthy lifestyles. While the average life-expectancy of 79, most people hope to (and should plan to) live beyond 79.\n\nNo Retiree is Exactly Average\n\nWhile these figures give us a good picture of what retirement may have in store for us, and the costs that a typical retiree faces, it\u2019s important not to allow the word \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cmedian\u201d to lull you into complacency. If the average 65 year-old couple\u2019s health expenses are $220,000 during retirement, there is naturally a very good chance that such a couple would have more than $220,000 in expenses. Don\u2019t assume that your expenses will be merely average. Plan for the unexpected and use averages and medians to reckon the minimum amount of preparation and saving that\u2019s required to retire prudently.\n\nIf you are undertaking a project to estimate how much you or a loved one may need for retirement, you can base your estimates on your particular circumstances for a forecast that\u2019s more accurate. Basing estimates of retirement costs on your own cost of living rather than the national average will obviously allow for more accurate estimates. You should also consider taking into account regional cost differences. For instance, a retirement in New England is obviously going to cost more than a retirement in the Desert Southwest.\n\nAn excellent tool to help with a personalized estimate of retirement costs is the AARP Retirement Calculator, but you don\u2019t have to do it yourself: If you are unsure about your retirement plans, consider speaking with a financial advisor who has an expertise in retirement planning.\n\nMore Articles", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's said that it costs about one million dollars to raise a child, but how much is the real cost of aging in America?", "og": {"description": "It's said that it costs about one million dollars to raise a child, but how much is the real cost of aging in America?", "title": "The Real Cost of Aging", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 385, "identifier": "http://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/aging-cost.jpg", "height": 245}, "updated_time": "2013-11-19T10:59:47-07:00", "url": "http://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/11-13-13-real-cost-of-aging/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's said that it costs about one million dollars to raise a child, but how much is the real cost of aging in America?", "creator": "@aplaceformom", "image": "http://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/aging-cost.jpg", "title": "The Real Cost of Aging", "site": "@aplaceformom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003829061896}, "article": {"section": "Retirement Finance Legal", "published_time": "2013-11-13T13:02:16-07:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-19T10:59:47-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "lifestyle, retirement, financial"}, "article_summary": "If you are trying to analyze potential care costs that your family may be facing, try A Place for Mom\u2019s Cost of Care Calculator.\nAccording the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost of living for an American is $20,194 per year (or $50,485 for the average household).\nUnlike health-costs and long-term care costs, living expenses have an element of predictability to them.\nBasing estimates of retirement costs on your own cost of living rather than the national average will obviously allow for more accurate estimates.\nFor instance, a retirement in New England is obviously going to cost more than a retirement in the Desert Southwest."}
