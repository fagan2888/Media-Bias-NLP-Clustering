Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder, famously told George Packer as he pulled an iPhone from his pocket: \u201cI don\u2019t consider this a technological breakthrough.\u201d\n\nMaybe, maybe not; but the techies are trying. On Wednesday, a Google subsidiary called Calico (short for California Life Company) announced plans to invest up to $750 million in drug research devoted to curing \u201cage-related diseases.\u201d The investment is enormous and comes as the first overt action of a year-old organization devoted not so much to curing cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 though that\u2019s part of it. Their goal, they have no shame in saying, is \u201ctackling aging, one of life\u2019s greatest mysteries.\u201d They want to cure death.\n\nCalico\u2019s CEO is Dr. Arthur Levinson, a board member at Apple. Meanwhile, Thiel, also a founder of Facebook, has given millions to anti-aging research. Ray Kurzweil, the futurist who believes he might be able to resurrect his dead father, is an executive at Google. Google founder Larry Page has reportedly \u201clong been a fan\u201d of Kurzweil\u2019s.\n\nThese like-minded tech bigwigs are making vast investments \u2014 on the order of Carnegie\u2019s or Rockefeller\u2019s cultural ones \u2014 in the science of what kills us. Not the cause of death that stops our hearts, but rather the underlying business of genetic malfunctions and bacterial incursions, the general entropy of our biological systems. \u201cFor me, it was always unsatisfying if you look at companies that get very big, and they\u2019re just doing one thing,\u201d Page told Time in a 2013 interview, after launching Calico. \u201cIdeally, if you have more people and more resources, you can do more things, get more things solved. We\u2019ve kind of always had that philosophy.\u201d\n\nCalico has an all-star cast of executives, including the Princeton geneticist Dr. David Botstein and its vice president for aging research, Dr. Cynthia Kenyon. In 1993, according to her biography, she discovered that a change to just one gene in a species of roundworms could double its lifespan, a \u201cpioneering\u201d find in the infancy of genetics research. It was the first time scientists realized aging could be manipulated, like a light switch.\n\nWith its new investment, Calico is betting on a pharmaceutical company called AbbVie, which takes on \u201cthe world's most complex and serious diseases.\u201d The company has pledged to match Google\u2019s investment, a total of as much as $1.5 billion in for-profit scientific research funding. AbbVie CEO Richard A. Gonzalez said in a statement it \u201cdemonstrates our commitment to exploring new areas of medicine. \u2026 The potential to help improve patients\u2019 lives with new therapies is enormous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cure, aging, google, plunks, massive, investment, solving, death", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tech giants are investing millions in research to prevent, or reverse, aging.
