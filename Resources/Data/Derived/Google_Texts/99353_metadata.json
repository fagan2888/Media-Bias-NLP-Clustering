To describe the clientele that the 179-bed facility once served as overwhelmingly Republican is to dabble in understatement.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s obituary is sure to reignite the debate over whether the state should find a way to come to terms with Obamacare and extend Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of Georgians who lack health insurance.\n\nBut this time, the critical arguments will be made not by Democrats, but by Republicans who will contend that, like it or not, the Affordable Care Act is a fact on the ground that is not going away. Human life isn\u2019t the only thing at stake, they will argue. So is the economic life of the state. Jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\n\u201cSome Georgians think the federal health care law is great. Just as many think it\u2019s terrible. But we all agree that health care is important to our economy and to families,\u201d said Brian Robinson, who until a few months ago was the chief spokesman for Gov. Nathan Deal.\n\nYes, this is the the same Brian Robinson who tapped out press release after press release justifying his boss\u2019s opposition to the \u201chuge financial burden\u201d that a fully implemented Obamacare would place on his state. Now Robinson speaks of chasing \u201cour\u201d tax money that is going elsewhere.\n\nIf Republican politicians ever make good on their promises to repeal and replace Obamacare, Georgia will no doubt participate, Robinson said. But until then, there is the reality that many of this state\u2019s hospitals are dying. And where they die, so does economic development. Take, for instance, the loss of Hutcheson Medical Center.\n\n\u201cThis greatly hinders the state\u2019s hopes of ever bringing another industrial or IT firm or any other major employer into that area. It really hurts those efforts,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cAll those jobs move to Chattanooga, at the closest.\u201d\n\nThe problem is not health insurance per se. It is the disappearance of health care providers whose funding mechanisms are drying up. If you have a stroke and are two hours from the nearest treatment center, it matters not whether you have insurance. You have been pierced by a spirally grooved, inclined plane. Metaphorically, speaking.\n\nWe were in a booth at a Buckhead diner, eating breakfast, when Robinson made this last point. With us was Blake Fulenwider, who was Deal\u2019s health policy adviser when he was in Congress. Then health policy adviser for Deal when he was governor. When Fulenwider exited the administration, he was deputy commissioner for the Department of Community Health, which oversees Medicaid in Georgia.\n\nEven before the ACA passed Congress, when Deal needed Obamacare numbers crunched, he called Fulenwider.\n\nBoth Robinson and Fulenwider are now part of a Georgia Chamber effort to find a \u201cGeorgia-specific solution that fits within the federal framework.\u201d In other words, a relationship with Obamacare that is both financially sustainable and politically digestible by a state GOP that has vilified the program for the last five years.\n\nOver eggs, both men emphasized that they are acting independently of their old boss. No winks or nods are involved, they said. But it is no coincidence that both Robinson and Fulenwider have served as trusted aides to the governor who would cut any deal with Washington \u2014 if there is a deal to cut.\n\nOther red states are also coming to the realization that the best opportunity to repeal Obamacare died with Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. Control of both the White House and 60 votes in the Senate would be required \u2014 a bar that inches higher every day that Donald Trump dominates the 2016 Republican presidential contest.\n\nLast week, a task force created by Gov. Robert Bentley, a longtime foe of Obamacare, recommended that Alabama expand its Medicaid rolls. Bentley is considering it. \u201cI am concerned about the plight of the working poor,\u201d he said.\n\nA state possessing a well-insured workforce, and sitting side-by-side with another state that doesn\u2019t, is likely to have an advantage when it comes to industrial recruitment. But there is more to Bentley\u2019s assessment than that, or the financial situation faced by poorly paid working stiffs.\n\nThis was the Alabama governor\u2019s back-handed recognition of the problem that continued opposition to Obamacare has created for Republicans. Those deprived of insurance coverage are often white, blue-collar workers. The Republican base.\n\nIn Kentucky, Gov.-elect Matt Bevin is pondering how he\u2019ll keep his promise to repeal the Medicaid expansion enacted by his Democratic predecessor. A Kentucky political scientist has underlined the Republican\u2019s dilemma: Bevin\u2019s biggest margins came in counties with the highest levels of new Medicaid enrollees.\n\nIn Georgia, Robinson, Fulenwider and the rest of the Georgia Chamber intend to draw up two or three alternatives to have ready when \u2014 and if \u2014 the state\u2019s Republican leadership alters course. Mark your calendar for January 2017.\n\nGeorgia is under two deadlines. \u201cThere\u2019s a big hammer that\u2019s hanging over every state,\u201d Fulenwider told me. With the expectation that states would participate in Medicaid expansion programs, the ACA \u2014 as written \u2014 calls for the gradual elimination of extra federal funds targeted for hospitals that serve large numbers of indigent, non-paying patients.\n\nHospitals in most red states \u2014 without expanded Medicaid rolls that, elsewhere, now shoulder much of the cost of indigent care \u2014 are sweating the day those cuts come home. As of now, they would begin taking effect in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the third [congressional] delay of implementation of those cuts, with a cliff that is getting deeper and deeper every year,\u201d Fulenwider said. Any state without a plan in place when that cliff is reached is in for tough times.\n\nIn Georgia, the disappearance of hundreds of millions of federal dollars could send hospital after hospital into the red. Rural areas would be hit hard, but so would major trauma centers such as Grady Memorial in Atlanta and Memorial Hospital in Savannah.\n\nNext year is an election year with a hot GOP presidential contest. Definitely not the right climate for negotiating a truce with Obamacare. No, Georgia\u2019s political deadline is also 2018. And the next contest for governor.\n\nA large Republican field would greatly appreciate it if this matter were settled before their many campaigns go into overdrive. That leaves 2017, when a governor in the final two years of his tenure might be asked to preside over the bipartisan coalition that would be required for the effort.\n\nJust as happened during the last session of the Legislature, when an alliance of Republican and Democrats, pushed by a desperate business community, tackled the problem of funding for Georgia\u2019s roads and bridges.\n\nThe difference is that, with Obamacare, there may be so much more to unsay.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/11/21/red-state-reality-and-obamacare-the-first-signs-of-truce-negotiations/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/011114-deal-interview-ba01.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "On Dec. 4, up in the northwest corner of Georgia, Hutcheson Medical Center will close its doors for the last time.\r\n\r\nThe Fort Oglethorpe institution, which once employed 900 and had an annual payroll of $29 million, will be the fifth hospital in Georgia to fail in the last two years.
