And, exercise one of your most valued rights!\n\nThe gubernatorial race is going to be close, so by voting you\u2019ll ensure the candidate of your choice gets elected, not someone else\u2019s.\n\nOur current Democratic administration, headed by Malloy and Wyman, have made a great deal of progress undoing the problems created by prior GOP administrations, to give us a better Connecticut.\n\nWe can\u2019t allow those moves forward to be reversed by electing those who desire to do just that.\n\nWe will be back in a deficit position, robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\nWe will no longer have the strongest gun law to protect our children.\n\nWe will not have a new, higher minimum wage \u2014 first in the U.S.\n\nWe will not have a GMO law.\n\nWe will not have a gay marriage law.\n\nWe will not be supporting early childhood education.\n\nWe will not have the U.S. model for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe will not have the ability to fund our pension program.\n\nWe will no longer have a rainy day fund.\n\nWe will no longer be building our own \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d for the biotech industry.\n\nWe will no longer be creating jobs.\n\nThese are only a few laws you would no longer have \u2026\n\nGov. Malloy never promised that he would not raise taxes, as his opponent continues to insist upon.\n\nAs President Clinton did when facing the largest deficit the U.S. had ever had, he asked us to all tighten our belts; he cut some \u201cpork\u201d and he raised taxes. But afterwards, we had no deficit; in fact, we had a surplus.\n\nThis is exactly the same position in which Gov. Malloy found himself. But, like Clinton, he needs four more years to give Connecticut the considerable economic growth and expansion it deserves.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Weston Forum", "description": "Both the Weston Democratic Town Committee and Weston Republican Town Committee were invited to submit a commentary of up to 500 words for the Oct. 30\u00a0editi", "title": "FROM THE WESTON DTC: Vote to keep moving forward | The Weston Forum", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thewestonforum.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2014/09/weston-democrat-donkey.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewestonforum.com/22715/from-the-weston-dtc-vote-to-keep-moving-forward/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WestonForum", "section": "Columns", "tag": "weston democratic town committee", "published_time": "2014-11-03T07:00:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Weston Forum", "description": "Both the Weston Democratic Town Committee and Weston Republican Town Committee were invited to submit a commentary of up to 500 words for the Oct. 30\u00a0editi", "creator": "@westonforum", "image": {"src": "http://thewestonforum.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2014/09/weston-democrat-donkey.jpg"}, "title": "FROM THE WESTON DTC: Vote to keep moving forward | The Weston Forum", "site": "@westonforum", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Both the Weston Democratic Town Committee and Weston Republican Town Committee were invited to submit a commentary of up to 500 words for the Oct. 30\u00a0editi"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4aab\"", "article_summary": "Both the Weston Democratic Town Committee and Weston Republican Town Committee were invited to submit acommentary of up to 500 words for the Oct. 30 edition of The Weston Forum discussing their party\u2019s slate and its advantages.\nWe will be back in a deficit position, robbing Peter to pay Paul.\nWe can\u2019t allow those moves forward to be reversed by electing those who desire to do just that.\nBut, like Clinton, he needs four more years to give Connecticut the considerable economic growth and expansion it deserves.\nThe gubernatorial race is going to be close, so by voting you\u2019ll ensure the candidate of your choice gets elected, not someone else\u2019s."}
