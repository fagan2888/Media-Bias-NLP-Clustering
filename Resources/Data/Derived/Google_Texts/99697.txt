QUESTION: So if the president could go back he would use the same words again?



JAY CARNEY: Well, the president -- as awesomely powerful as the office is, we can't go back in time. We know what the president is focused on which is getting this right for the American people and getting it right for everyone so that the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, the improvements in the coverage that everyone will enjoy and the broader benefits for our economy, because of the slower rate of health care costs, come about and come into being. There is no question that this rollout has not gone as smoothly as we had hoped and there is no question that the website has caused a lot of problems for Americans trying to get information about the options available to them because of these marketplaces.
