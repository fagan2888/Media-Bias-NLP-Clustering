Ted Cruz, the firebrand Texas conservative, is on board to end the impasse over funding the Department of Homeland Security, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and his unruly Republican conference may have no choice but to reluctantly go along.\n\nWith help from the Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Wednesday put the Senate on course to pass the $40 billion spending measure without controversial House language blocking President Obama\u2019s immigration executive orders.\n\nMcConnell Comes Up with a New Anti-Shutdown Tactic\n\nMcConnell also scheduled action for later this week on a separate bill. It voices opposition to Obama\u2019s executive orders designed to protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation but does not affect the DHS\u2019s spending authority.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican tried and failed four times before to get the House-passed language through the Senate. McConnell then switched gears and pressed for passage of his own two-step approach, enlisting crucial last minute backing from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (R-NV).\n\nOn a key procedural vote Wednesday, 98 Republicans and Democrats backed McConnell\u2019s plan, while only two conservative Republicans \u2013 Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma \u2013 voted nay.\n\nCruz, who may seek the GOP presidential nomination, has often clashed with McConnell and the Senate GOP leadership over budget and policy issues. On several occasions, he met privately with conservative House members in a move to undercut Boehner\u2019s positions on controversial matters \u2013 including what led to the 16-day partial government shutdown in 2013.\n\nRelated: Cruz Says GOP Plays a Losing Hand on DHS Spending\n\nAfter last November\u2019s election, Cruz openly criticized the GOP leadership\u2019s decision to postpone action on permanent legislation to fund DHS through September, in order to buy time to strategize on blocking Obama\u2019s immigration executive action. The House last month passed a bill prohibiting DHS from using funds to implement those executive orders.\n\nCruz has advocated holding DHS funding hostage as a strategy for blocking implementation of Obama\u2019s executive orders. He argued recently that McConnell, Boehner and other GOP leaders were misplaying it and that the administration and Democrats would ultimately force them to capitulate to avoid being blamed for a partial shutdown.\n\nYesterday Cruz told reporters he wouldn\u2019t try to delay a final vote on a \u201cclean\u201d DHS spending bill \u2013 and had nothing more to say on it, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAmid mounting concern and anger over beheadings and slaughter by ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria, the homegrown terrorist attacks in France, Denmark, Canada and Australia, and recent threats against U.S. shopping malls, congressional Republicans appear to be finally backing down from a fight with the administration over keeping DHS fully operational.\n\nRelated: Terror Group\u2019s Threat to Mall of America Sharpens DHS Funding Debate\n\nDespite dire warnings by officials about the risk of failing to pass the spending bill by midnight on Friday, about 85 percent of the 240,000 DHS employees are deemed \u201cessential\u201d and must report for work at the Secret Service, immigration services, border patrol, Coast Guard, and other vital enforcement agencies.\n\nYet a partial shutdown would be a PR fiasco for Republicans, with stories galore about roughly 220,000 essential employees having to work without paychecks, while another 30,000 non-essential workers are furloughed and sent home. Polls also indicate the public would blame Republicans more than Democrats for a shutdown, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nJeff Sessions, the most vocal opponent of Obama\u2019s immigration policies in the Senate, hasn\u2019t said yet whether he\u2019ll block a unanimous consent request to vote before Friday\u2019s deadline. Otherwise, the chamber will have to spend 30 hours debating the legislation before taking a final vote. If that happens, the whole process could be pushed into next weekend.\n\nBoehner wouldn\u2019t speculate on how members would vote when the issue is sent back to the House. Many conservatives are still fuming about how Obama\u2019s immigration orders seem like reckless executive overreach; but after the House last month approved its version of the DHS bill, Boehner\u2019s attitude was that his work was done and it now was up to McConnell and the Senate Democrats to take it or leave it.\n\nRelated: Should Boehner Cancel the Netanyahu Show in Congress?\n\nOddly, with the crisis over immigration and DHS spending crashing down around their party\u2019s head, Boehner confirmed yesterday he didn\u2019t talk to McConnell at all these past two weeks, while Congress was in recess.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the Senate to do their job,\u201d Boehner said Wednesday. \u201cTheir Democrats have stood in the way now for three weeks over a [House-passed] bill that should have been debated and passed.\u201d\n\nAs for why he didn\u2019t pick up the phone at least once to confer with McConnell the past 14 days, Boehner said the two leaders\u2019 staffs stayed in touch. \u201cListen, Senator McConnell has a big job to do, and so do I,\u201d Boehner snapped.\n\nRelated: Arrest of Alleged Islamic State Backers Highlight Need for Homeland Security Funding: NYPD\n\nMeanwhile, a number of House GOP leadership aides and lawmakers told Politico they were heartened by the response Wednesday morning to Boehner\u2019s tone. Many conservative Republicans are angry the Senate is preparing to pass a \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill. Yet the mood in the GOP conference wasn\u2019t as negative as many expected, Politico reported. No House Republican members stood up and urged the party to shut down the agency, for example.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no guarantee Boehner will take up the Senate\u2019s plan if it passes the chamber. Republican aides are also discussing the possibility of a short-term funding bill to keep the agency open for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.\n\n\u201cYes, this funding issue all falls into Boehner\u2019s lap, but he\u2019s been in this position before and has figured out how to handle it,\u201d noted Ron Bonjean, a Washington political strategist. \u201cOne way has been to allow a shutdown to occur in order for his members to understand the political consequences of what can happen when that occurs.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis may have to be another learning experience, or they may see the light and decide to change course at the last minute. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If even Sen.", "title": "Will the House Follow Ted Cruz and Vote to Fund DHS?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/26/Will-House-Follow-Ted-Cruz-and-Vote-Fund-DHS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Cruz-9-20-13-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/26/Will-House-Follow-Ted-Cruz-and-Vote-Fund-DHS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Cruz-9-20-13-.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If even Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Cruz has advocated holding DHS funding hostage as a strategy for blocking implementation of Obama\u2019s executive orders.\nCruz, who may seek the GOP presidential nomination, has often clashed with McConnell and the Senate GOP leadership over budget and policy issues.\nMany conservative Republicans are angry the Senate is preparing to pass a \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill.\nThe House last month passed a bill prohibiting DHS from using funds to implement those executive orders.\nRepublican aides are also discussing the possibility of a short-term funding bill to keep the agency open for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months."}
