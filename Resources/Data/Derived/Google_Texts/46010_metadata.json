The second existential challenge to the Affordable Care Act began here.\n\nIn the first, decided in June 2012, the Supreme Court saved the ACA by reading it imaginatively. The court held that although Congress could not, in the name of regulating commerce, penalize people for not engaging in commerce (buying insurance), the penalty linked to the individual mandate actually could be considered \u2014 although Congress did not so consider it \u2014 an exercise of Congress\u2019s enumerated power to tax.\n\nThat same year, Pruitt lit another fuse, this one involving statutory rather than constitutional construction. He filed a suit that in June may contribute to the most seismic domestic development of 2015.\n\nThe suit asks the court to read the ACA unimaginatively, as meaning what it plainly says: Subsidies, in the form of tax credits, are available only to people who purchase insurance through exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Thirty-seven states have refused or failed to establish their own exchanges. The justices may be disinclined to use the ACA\u2019s legislative history, or the candor of loquacious MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, to inform their deliberations. If, however, the justices do, they will see that Gruber, an ACA architect, says it was written to \u201csqueeze the states\u201d into establishing exchanges: \u201cIf you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits.\u201d\n\nIf the court holds that the ACA means what it plainly and purposively says, then billions of dollars have been disbursed through federal exchanges contrary to the law. The ACA will be crippled until Barack Obama negotiates help from a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nThe Founders\u2019 bargain, Pruitt says, was that the states would surrender some sovereignty in exchange for representation in the federal government. But the growth of federal power has tended to reduce states to administrative extensions of the federal government, leaving them with \u201cpreemption without representation.\u201d So Pruitt has established within his office a \u201cfederalism unit\u201d aimed at revitalizing federalism as a system of \u201cvertical checks and balances.\u201d\n\nOklahoma is among 24 states in a suit initiated by Texas Attorney General (and Gov.-elect) Greg Abbott charging that Obama\u2019s unilateral changes in immigration policies are unconstitutional. The complaint is that Obama has injured these states by usurping the legislative power of Congress, in which the states\u2019 interests are represented, and by creating, through executive fiat, policies that will impose substantial costs on the states.\n\nAnother target in Pruitt\u2019s sights is the Environmental Protection Agency, which claims to have discovered in the Clean Air Act of 1970 a hitherto unnoticed authority perhaps sufficient to eliminate existing coal-fired power plants. Joined by 16 other state attorneys general, Pruitt argues that the federal government has the power to institute a national energy policy, which implicates the entire economy. But it cannot do so, preempting various of the states\u2019 powers, simply by locating authority in the creative reading of a 44-year-old statute.\n\nAnd then there is the matter of puddles. Pruitt and other attorneys general are resisting the EPA\u2019s and the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 contention that the 42-year-old Clean Water Act has a hitherto unsuspected capaciousness. The act, which allows regulation of \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d was passed under Congress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce, so \u201cnavigable waters\u201d have been understood to be those suitable for transporting people and products between the states.\n\nBut M. Reed Hopper and Todd F. Gaziano of the Pacific Legal Foundation, writing in the Wall Street Journal, say the EPA now wants to control not just wetlands and other non-navigable waters but any water or normally dry land with a \u201chydrological connection\u201d to actual navigable waters. These include, Hopper and Gaziano say, \u201carroyos in the desert as well as ditches and culverts hundreds of miles from\u201d actual navigable waters. Pruitt and other attorneys general are contesting this bureaucratic imperialism whereby the EPA, by aggregating almost all of the nation\u2019s water and much of its land into EPA-designated \u201cecoregions,\u201d could regulate \u2014 and stifle \u2014 much of the nation\u2019s economic activity.\n\nThe good news about the ACA, immigration and the EPA is that federalism remains a fact. Come next month, federalism\u2019s vitality will be an increasingly inconvenient truth for Obama. Twenty-seven states will have Republican attorneys general who can try to restrain the federal Leviathan much as the Lilliputians restrained Gulliver.\n\nRead more from George F.
