But Republican ads in Senate races say otherwise.\n\nAccording to Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG), Republicans ran nearly 12,000 anti-Obamacare ads in Senate races during the week of October 13-19. That\u2019s almost twice as many ads as they ran on jobs/unemployment, more than twice as many as they ran on international affairs, and more than three times as many as they ran on taxes. In fact, it\u2019s more than they ran on jobs/unemployment, taxes, and social issues combined. It\u2019s also more than they ran on jobs/unemployment and immigration combined.\n\nThe top-5 issues for the GOP in Senate races for the week of October 13-19 were as follows:\n\n1. Obamacare (nearly 12,000 ads)\n\n2. Budget/Government Spending (nearly 9,000 ads)\n\n3. Energy/Environment (nearly 7,000 ads)\n\n4. Jobs/Unemployment (more than 6,000 ads)\n\n5. Immigration (nearly 5,000 ads)\n\nA week earlier, the pattern was basically the same\u2014as Republicans ran over 11,000 anti-Obamacare ads. These were the GOP\u2019s top-5 issues in Senate races for the week of October 6-12:\n\n1. Obamacare (more than 11,000 ads)\n\n2. Jobs/Unemployment (more than 9,000 ads)\n\n3. Budget/Government Spending (more than 8,000 ads)\n\n4. Energy/Environment (more than 6,000 ads)\n\n5. Medicare (nearly 6,000 ads)\n\nOf course, Obamacare also directly affects jobs/unemployment, the budget/government spending, and Medicare, even when ads on those topics don\u2019t mention it by name.\n\nGiven that Obamacare is the signature legislation of this class of Senate Democrats, what about pro-Obamacare ads? Summarizing CMAG\u2019s findings for October 6-12, Elizabeth Wilner writes, \u201cCMAG also classifies ads as \u2018pro-ACA,\u2019 and we have seen more such ads popping up lately, but their collective spot count for the week didn\u2019t come close to the number required to make the top 15.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2014 Elections,Barack Obama,Democrats,Health Care,insurance,Jeffrey H.
