Doctors became concerned after being unable to locate the bleeding, and further tests revealed a large tumor in her cervix.\n\n\u201cThe doctors told me I should have never got pregnant because the tumour [sic] was completely covering my cervix,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had gone into labour [sic] naturally both me and my baby would have died. It was a really crazy moment when we realised [sic] that our son was a miracle. When I was told my first reaction was 'What's going to happen with my baby?' I couldn't focus on the cancer, I was thinking about my son's wellbeing. He had been lying next to a tumour for eight months and I was worried it could harm him.\"\n\nMarston soon began chemotherapy and, in April of this year, began radiation treatment. The treatment initially seemed to be working, but in July it was discovered that the cancer had spread to her liver. She was told she has only weeks to live.\n\nNow, Marston is focused on marrying Wyatt\u2019s father, Scott Benton, next month in front of friends and family. The pair has been together for eight years.\n\n\u201cAfter the diagnosis I said to Scott: 'I want to be a family, I want to be a Benton, I want us all to have the same name,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also a real comfort to my family and gives them something other than the cancer to focus on. I want to be well enough for my wedding to have my first dance with Scott, and to eat my meal and enjoy it.\"\n\nMarston is also determined to spend as much time with her family as possible while she still can.\n\n\u201cI want to spend time doing normal things with my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to take Wyatt swimming, which I haven\u2019t been able to do, and to take him to feed the ducks. I also want to take him to the zoo, even though he\u2019s only seven months old.\u201d\n\nMarston and Benton launched a GoFundMe page, where supporters can donate to help make the wedding possible.\n\nSources: Daily Mirror, Metro, GoFundMe / Photo credit: Daily Mirror", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "A mother in England was told just days before giving birth to her son that she was dying of cancer.\r\n\r\nAnnie M...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Mother-To-Be Told She's Dying Of Cancer Just Days Before Son's Birth", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/mother-be-told-shes-dying-cancer-just-days-sons-birth", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "A mother in England was told just days before giving birth to her son that she was dying of cancer.\r\n\r\nAnnie M...", "title": "Mother-To-Be Told She's Dying Of Cancer Just Days Before Son's Birth"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-11T13:01:29+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2015-07-11T13:01:29+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 859167}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcad5\"", "article_summary": "A mother in England was told just days before giving birth to her son that she was dying of cancer.\nAnnie Marston gave birth to her son, Wyatt, on Dec. 20 of last year \u2014 just days after finding out that she was suffering from cervical cancer.\nNow, Marston is focused on marrying Wyatt\u2019s father, Scott Benton, next month in front of friends and family.\n\u201cThe doctors told me I should have never got pregnant because the tumour [sic] was completely covering my cervix,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is also a real comfort to my family and gives them something other than the cancer to focus on."}
