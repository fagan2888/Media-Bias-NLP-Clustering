In small towns and farming communities across our state and nation, the options for primary health care are dwindling.\n\nPatients are driving farther than ever for the care they need. Like much of the country, Oklahoma is facing a shortage of primary health care providers that will only worsen as the population ages.\n\nA bill introduced in the state Legislature this year would have taken a step toward addressing this problem. House Bill 2841, by state Rep. Jonathan Echols, would have granted nurse practitioners full practice authority in Oklahoma. Simply put, that would allow nurse practitioners to practice in Oklahoma without a collaborative agreement with a doctor.\n\nThat bill appears unlikely to pass from committee, but I hope it begins a conversation.\n\nOur state ranks 49th in physician-patient ratio, with only 80.2 physicians for every 100,000 Oklahomans. When many new doctors are drawn to larger cities and choose to be specialists rather than enter family practice, the health care shortage in rural Oklahoma only becomes worse.\n\nAccording to figures from the Oklahoma State Department of Health, 64 of Oklahoma\u2019s 77 counties, including my own Washita County, are designated as primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas.\n\nAs the executive officer of Cordell Memorial Hospital, I have been trying unsuccessfully to recruit a second doctor for 18 months. Even offering compensation and benefits that exceed that of hospitals in larger cities, I\u2019ve had no takers.\n\nNurse practitioners are an obvious solution to fill this gap. They are highly trained and educated, each having a master\u2019s degree or doctorate and clinical training. They are qualified to treat and manage a range of chronic and acute conditions, order and interpret tests, and more. They are a lifeline for rural health and a resource this state should utilize.\n\nNurse practitioners are granted full practice authority in 21 other states, including neighboring New Mexico and Colorado. Numerous studies have found that the primary care provided by nurse practitioners produces outcomes similar to care from physicians.\n\nGranting nurse practitioners the authority to practice to the full scope of their education would breathe life into Cordell Memorial Hospital and other small hospitals across the state. More importantly, it would improve the quality of life for thousands in rural Oklahoma.\n\nEven though it looks like HB 2841 won\u2019t make it through this legislative session, I urge lawmakers to keep it in mind when they convene in 2017.\n\nLandon Hise is the chief executive officer of Cordell Memorial Hospital and a member of the Oklahoma Hospital Association\u2019s Council on Rural Health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Granting nurse practitioners the authority to practice to the full scope of their education would breathe life into small hospitals across the state.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Landon Hise", "og": {"site_name": "The Journal Record", "description": "Granting nurse practitioners the authority to practice to the full scope of their education would breathe life into small hospitals across the state.", "title": "Hise: Bill would address state\u2019s rural health crisis", "url": "http://journalrecord.com/2016/02/23/hise-bill-would-address-states-rural-health-crisis-opinion/", "image": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2016/02/landon-hise-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hise: Bill would address state\u2019s rural health crisisThe Journal Record", "keywords": "cordell memorial hospital,landon hise,oklahoma hospital association,oklahoma legislature", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "google-site-verification": "vAy42WJoFK0to-yBz3axT36JMlFa0BIJdchVGi9IPXw", "y_key": "b211670718d8bd21", "thumbnail": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2016/02/landon-hise-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rural health care is in crisis.\nLandon Hise is the chief executive officer of Cordell Memorial Hospital and a member of the Oklahoma Hospital Association\u2019s Council on Rural Health.\nIn small towns and farming communities across our state and nation, the options for primary health care are dwindling.\nLike much of the country, Oklahoma is facing a shortage of primary health care providers that will only worsen as the population ages.\nMore importantly, it would improve the quality of life for thousands in rural Oklahoma."}
