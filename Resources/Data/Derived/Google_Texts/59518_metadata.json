The plant currently serves more than 600 homes, 225 of which are occupied by Cherokee Nation citizens.\n\n\u201cThe town\u2019s sanitation system was in desperate need of an upgrade, and we\u2019re pleased beyond measure that the Cherokee Nation could help,\u201d said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker. \u201cBuilding and maintaining partnerships with our local communities is so important. When we build roads, bridges and water lines, or invest in projects like this one in Locust Grove, it helps Cherokees in the area, but it helps everyone else, too. We\u2019re so happy to provide a more safe and sanitary system for the entire community.\u201d\n\nThe town has long been plagued with problems caused by the aging water treatment plant.\n\nDepartment of Environmental Quality ordered the plant to make several changes, citing violations including the discharge of raw sewage on site due to overflow.\n\nThe treatment plant will receive brand-new equipment and a substantial expansion. After upgrades are complete, the plant should be able to serve the current household population, as well as additional households that may be added to the system. The improvements will help the plant remain in compliance for at least another 30 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how any town around here can make it without the help of the Cherokee Nation,\u201d said Locust Grove Mayor Heath Holman. \u201cWe are extremely grateful for this and everything the tribe does to help our community.\u201d\n\nCherokee Nation Community Services used tribal funds to complete 10 water and sewer projects, totaling more than $250,000 in fiscal year 2013.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cherokee Nation and the city of Locust Grove have entered into an agreement for the tribe to contribute $877,800 to help improve the town\u2019s water treatment plant.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/11/cherokee-nation-donates-nearly-900k-improve-water-treatment-plant-155794", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/locust_grove_water_plant_signing.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Cherokee Nation Donates Nearly $900K to Improve Water Treatment Plant"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/11/cherokee-nation-donates-nearly-900k-improve-water-treatment-plant-155794", "dc": {"title": "Cherokee Nation Donates Nearly $900K to Improve Water Treatment Plant"}, "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-11T16:12-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Cherokee Nation Donates Nearly $900K to Improve Water Treatment Plant"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce379\"", "article_summary": "Cherokee Nation and the city of Locust Grove have entered into an agreement for the tribe to contribute $877,800 to help improve the town\u2019s water treatment plant.\n\u201cThe town\u2019s sanitation system was in desperate need of an upgrade, and we\u2019re pleased beyond measure that the Cherokee Nation could help,\u201d said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker.\nThe plant currently serves more than 600 homes, 225 of which are occupied by Cherokee Nation citizens.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how any town around here can make it without the help of the Cherokee Nation,\u201d said Locust Grove Mayor Heath Holman.\nThe treatment plant will receive brand-new equipment and a substantial expansion."}
