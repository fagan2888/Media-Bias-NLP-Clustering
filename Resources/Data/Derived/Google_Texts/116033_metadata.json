The countries, whose current trade is worth about $8 billion, have held exploratory discussions of the deal since May 2013.\n\n\"Cooperation between Israel and China can produce massive results, and we believe that Israel can be the perfect partner,\" Netanyahu said, according to a statement from his office.\n\nIt quoted Liu as saying Israel was \"world-renowned for its innovation\" and that China would embark on \"great joint projects\" with it.\n\nNetanyahu wants to diversify Israel's commercial ties abroad, in partly due to what he has said is a need to reduce the country's dependence on its biggest trading partner, Europe.\n\nDisputes with the European Union over policy toward the Palestinians, and EU labeling of products by Israeli settlements in occupied territory, discomfit the Netanyahu government. Israel also worries about anti-Jewish incidents in Europe, such as last year's Islamist attack on a Paris kosher deli.\n\nNetanyahu's office said the free-trade agreement could double bilateral commerce and investment. At Tuesday's meeting, China and Israel also signed 13 cooperation agreements, including in energy and water development, officials said.\n\nA senior Israeli official told Reuters he was optimistic the deal with China could be concluded in about a year.\n\n(Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Alison Williams)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the talks after he met visiting Ch", "title": "China, Israel open talks on free-trade deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/29/China-Israel-open-talks-free-trade-deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-israel-trade_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/29/China-Israel-open-talks-free-trade-deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-israel-trade_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the talks after he met visiting Ch", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0df\"", "article_summary": "\"Cooperation between Israel and China can produce massive results, and we believe that Israel can be the perfect partner,\" Netanyahu said, according to a statement from his office.\nA senior Israeli official told Reuters he was optimistic the deal with China could be concluded in about a year.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the talks after he met visiting Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong.\nAt Tuesday's meeting, China and Israel also signed 13 cooperation agreements, including in energy and water development, officials said.\nIt quoted Liu as saying Israel was \"world-renowned for its innovation\" and that China would embark on \"great joint projects\" with it."}
