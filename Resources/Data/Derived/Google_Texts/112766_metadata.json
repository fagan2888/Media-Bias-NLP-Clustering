One of the things was kind of transitioning at some point in your life to being more significant than being more successful.\u201d\n\nSome people in their 60s are typically thinking about retirement and that it can\u2019t happen quick enough, but William Breland is looking to reinvent himself with a career change.\n\nThe longtime physical therapist in Wichita Falls said his private practice business model has been about being successful. Now, the 63-year-old said, his focus is about doing something significant to help people.\n\nIt was the book \u201cHalftime: Moving from Success to Significance\u201d by Bob Buford that Breland said he read when he was about 35 years old that planted a seed and has led to this life-changing decision.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re halfway through with your life, what do you need to be thinking about?\u201d he said of the book\u2019s intended meaning. \u201cOne of the things was kind of transitioning at some point in your life to being more significant than being more successful.\u201d\n\nAlthough he\u2019s not completely stepping away from the physical therapy and training career he has had for 41 years \u2014 39 of which in Wichita Falls \u2014 he said he wants to use his experiences to become a patient advocate during a time even finding a doctor can be difficult; and he wants to help clinics survive by consolidating to lower costs at a time when reimbursements continue to fall.\n\nHe made the decision a while ago to close Breland Health and Fitness on Plaza Parkway in Century City Shopping Center, and also align his locations in Burkburnett and Lawton, Oklahoma, under the direction of friend and colleague John Reneau at Reneau Rehab in Wichita Falls.\n\n\u201cBecause of changes with Obamacare and Medicare, it is very, very hard for small operations, small clinical groups \u2014 particularly single clinics like his (Reneau\u2019s) \u2014 to stay open, quite frankly,\u201d Breland said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a need, and in the country, there\u2019s big move of consolidation so that you can lower your expenses.\u201d\n\nThe reimbursement rate for private practice physical therapists taking care of Medicare patients is about 15 percent less than what it was a few years ago, he said, and the profit margin for those clinics is about 15-20 percent. He said that means physical therapy clinics are in essence working for no profit at all.\n\n\u201cWe can still stay good and do the good job that hopefully we\u2019ve done all these years,\u201d he said, \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it ... with a bigger organization so that we can lower our expenses a little bit.\u201d\n\nHe also shared the story of a family member in South Texas with myriad health problems who was having difficulty finding a physician. He said he helped the family member get in touch with a physician, but the doctor declined to take them on because the doctor didn\u2019t have time to take care of the multiple medical problems.\n\nIt took a few more days, he said, before he could find a doctor who could manage his family member\u2019s care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019re people out there who have that same kind of challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to become that patient advocate with no skin in the game. I\u2019m not going to be treating folks, but I\u2019m going to be able to advise them.\u201d\n\nBreland said another area where he hopes to make a significant positive impact is with a Christian-based group called Coreluv. He said he is planning a trip to Haiti through his son\u2019s church in Frisco to work with orphans in disabilities.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I\u2019m going to (use) my expertise in an area of the world that\u2019s unbelievably poor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just kids, it\u2019s adults. But this ministry that I\u2019m going to be working with primarily works with orphaned kids, and they\u2019re building some hospitals there.\u201d\n\nBreland said he will also continue to travel to country to educate physical therapists on how to evaluate golfers, as well as provide physical training for golfers through GoLo GolfPerformance.\n\nFollow John Ingle on Twitter at @inglejohn1973.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Breland moving on from success to significance", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesrecordnews.com/business/breland-moving-on-from-success-to-significance-ep-1022550608-331296411.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/breland_1428182755112_16170567_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "William Breland making a career change to help patients, clinics", "title": "Breland moving on from success to significance"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/breland_1428182755112_16170567_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "William Breland making a career change to help patients, clinics", "site": "@timesrecordnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Breland moving on from success to significance"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-trn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d21\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOnce again, I\u2019m going to (use) my expertise in an area of the world that\u2019s unbelievably poor,\u201d he said.\nIt was the book \u201cHalftime: Moving from Success to Significance\u201d by Bob Buford that Breland said he read when he was about 35 years old that planted a seed and has led to this life-changing decision.\nThe longtime physical therapist in Wichita Falls said his private practice business model has been about being successful.\n<p>Torin Halsey/Times Record News</p><p>William Breland uses a taping technique to control the movement of a patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patella, or kneecap, during rehab in this August 2013 photo.\nHe said that means physical therapy clinics are in essence working for no profit at all."}
