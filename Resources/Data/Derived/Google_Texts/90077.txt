The mayor of Coal City in northern Illinois says a suspected tornado swept into town, first striking the high school before moving to the southeast over homes and damaging a fire station.

Mayor Terry Halliday said Tuesday morning that crews are surveying damage after the storm that hit at 10 p.m. Monday.

Halliday says shelters are available for anyone who needs them. The American Red Cross says about 30 people spent the night in its Coal City shelter and a handful of people stayed at a shelter in nearby Sublette.

Todd Friddle of the Wilmington Fire Department said officials believe everyone is accounted for, but that a secondary search will be conducted.

He says first responders started searching damaged and collapsed buildings as soon as the storm passed. He says some people were pulled from basements, and that five people suffered minor injuries.
