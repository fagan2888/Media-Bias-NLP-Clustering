Chris Christie may have played catcher in high school, but he manned third base at a charity softball match Monday at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a team player, wherever the captain wants me to go, I go,\u201d he said before the game, which pitted Mr. Christie, athletes and radio-show personalities against Yankees alumni and members of the Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team.\n\nThe game was part of the Bombers Boomer Broadway Softball Classic, which benefited the Boomer Esiason Foundation and the Actors Fund.\n\nMr. Christie, a Mets fan, said he would rather be playing at Citi Field, \u201cbut this is where they\u2019re playing the game.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, high-fives teammate radio personality Eddie Scozzare. Andrew Lamberson for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMorning radio co-host Boomer Esiason said he chose to put Mr. Christie on third. \u201cI know from his days when he was younger he was a hell of a baseball player,\u201d Mr. Esiason said, \u201cso that\u2019s why I put him at the hot corner.\u201d\n\nCraig Carton, Mr. Esiason\u2019s co-host, said Mr. Christie made a couple of errors early in the game and \u201cwe were eating him up about it in the dugout.\u201d\n\nBut he did note a play the governor made when he fielded a ball with players on first and second. \u201cHe bobbled [the ball] a little bit, but he made the play and got the out,\u201d Mr. Carton said.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plays third base. Andrew Lamberson for The Wall Street Journal\n\nJosh Wege, a member of the Wounded Warriors team, said he tried unsuccessfully during the game to hit the ball to Mr. Christie so he could \u201csee some of his moves.\u201d He added that he was overall impressed with the governor\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cHe made some pretty good plays out there,\u201d Mr. Wege said.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Christie\u2019s team won, 7-6, in nine innings.\n\nBefore the game, Mr. Christie was asked about the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of New Jersey\u2019s bid for sports betting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a long shot to get certiorari from the U.S. Supreme Court. That\u2019s the way it goes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said no, so we have to move on.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, right, after the charity softball game played at Yankee Stadium on Monday.
