Since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, insurers offer more health plans with lower premiums, but higher deductibles.\n\nIn today\u2019s 3 On Your Side report, we take a look at ways to save money and even find some popular medications for free.\n\nPhillip Lambert needs insulin. But when his monthly cost hit $1,800 dollars he considered skipping it.\n\n\u201cI thought it was ridiculous,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cThe program is $275 the Cellcept is $600 for a 90 day supply\u201d\n\nBill Young\u2019s co-pay for anti-rejection drugs was nearly 900 dollars with with private insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is medication I need to live,\u201d said Young.\n\nBoth men went looking for help. Lambert found a federal program called 340b. Instead of $1,800 he now pays $34. Young found a discount card on the drug manufacturers website and his cost dropped from $875 to $15.\n\n\u201cI was ecstatic,\u201d said Young.\n\nEven the pharmacy where you pick up your prescriptions can save you money. You can save an extra 10 to 30 dollars using Walgreens\u2019 Prescription Savings Club. Other stores, have similar programs. Many also offer common generic medications for under five dollars.\n\n\u201cIn particular we have 10 prescriptions medications that our members can get for three dollars a month,\u201d said Phil Keough with Kmart pharmacy.\n\nThe discounts are needed because according to a Kaiser report co-pays are skyrocketing forcing 41% of people to skip filling some prescriptions. Apps like GoodRX can point you to discounts.\n\nJanet Irvine got this a card from her doctor which took her 60 dollar co-pay down to 25.\n\n\u201cGet your physician to see if they can help you out with making the cost of getting better a little less,\u201d said Irvine.\n\nSome pharmacy savings programs may require you pay a small membership fees, the flip side, some even cover medications for your pet.\n\nAlso, be aware that some federal programs and manufacturer discounts are often income based. The amount varies from program to program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, insurers offer more health plans with lower premiums, but higher deductibles.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/05/09/3-on-your-side-the-key-to-saving-money-on-popular-medications/", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/medications.jpg?w=1280", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/medications.jpg?w=1280", "height": 720}, "type": "article", "description": "Since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, insurers offer more health plans with lower premiums, but higher deductibles.", "title": "3 On Your Side: The Key To Saving Money On Popular Medications"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/medications.jpg?w=1280", "description": "Since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, insurers offer more health plans with lower premiums, but higher deductibles.", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "3 On Your Side: The Key To Saving Money On Popular Medications"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "consumer news, heard on, watch + listen, 3 on your side, consumer news, jim donovan", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "3 on your side, consumer news, jim donovan"}, "article_summary": "Some pharmacy savings programs may require you pay a small membership fees, the flip side, some even cover medications for your pet.\nIn today\u2019s 3 On Your Side report, we take a look at ways to save money and even find some popular medications for free.\n\u201cIn particular we have 10 prescriptions medications that our members can get for three dollars a month,\u201d said Phil Keough with Kmart pharmacy.\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 Almost half of Americans won\u2019t buy their prescriptions because of the rising costs of co-pays.\nEven the pharmacy where you pick up your prescriptions can save you money."}
