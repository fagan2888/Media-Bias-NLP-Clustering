Rapid City, SD

A western South Dakota city will be hosting a free tire disposal program for residential customers of the local landfill.



Rapid City officials say there is no limit to the number of tires that customers of the Rapid City Landfill can dispose of during the event, but they say customers are expected to help in the unloading and proper placement of the tires at the landfill.



City officials say no commercial tire businesses are eligible to participate in the program that will take place on April 4 and 5. They say large tractor tires will not be accepted.
