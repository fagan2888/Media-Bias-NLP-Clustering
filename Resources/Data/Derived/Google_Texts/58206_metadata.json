Of the 12% who have had to change doctors, 5% said it was a big problem, and 5% said it was not a big problem. Photo: Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation. He is on Twitter: @drewaltman.\n\nListening to the political debate about health care, and in conversations with patients and health professionals across the country, I get the sense that some people that feel their choice of doctors\u2013and hospitals\u2013is threatened and that people are losing their regular doctors as insurers narrow provider networks to lower costs. Critics have blamed the Affordable Care Act; in a recent campaign rally in Iowa, Sen. Ted Cruz charged that Obamacare is \u201ctaking our doctors.\u201d Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s January health-tracking poll, however, indicate that this problem is smaller than conventional wisdom and critics have suggested.\n\nJust 4% of the non-elderly with health coverage say that they are \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d with the choice of doctors in their plan\u2019s network; almost nine in 10 say they are satisfied. As the chart above shows, the share who say they had to change doctors because their doctor was no longer covered by their plan\u2019s network is 12%, and just 5% of those said that doing so was a \u201cbig problem.\u201d\n\nIt can, of course, be a problem if people are losing their doctor through the narrowing of networks, even if the overall number of such instances is relatively small. If, for example, cancer patients feel forced to leave their longtime oncologist because they are no longer in the plan\u2019s network, that can be a source of serious concern and stress, and it doesn\u2019t take a lot of such cases to warrant government attention. Yet it\u2019s not always the case that people want unlimited choice of providers; some are more willing to trade broad choice of providers for lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs when they do not have established medical relationships or when their finances are strained.\n\nErosion of provider choice and narrow networks may be more pronounced in certain sectors of the health-care system. Some plans in the ACA marketplaces have sought to keep premiums down by narrowing provider networks, as have some Medicaid managed-care plans.\n\nKaiser polling has found that people value no feature of their health insurance plans more than their ability to see the doctors they want without paying more. The fact that doctor choice has not been widely compromised to date does not mean that the public would stand for broad restrictions on choice in the future. Choice of doctor and especially the ability to keep your doctor if you have one remain a third rail in U.S. health care for anyone proposing reforms.\n\nRELATED IN THINK TANK:\n\nCandidate Policy Plans Resonate More With Democrats.
