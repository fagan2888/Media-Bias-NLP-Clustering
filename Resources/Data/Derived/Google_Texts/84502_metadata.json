Yeldon and Amari Cooper, Alabama outgained the Aggies 602-172.\n\nTexas A&M (5-3, 2-3) has lost its past three games, all to teams now ranked in the top 10.\n\nAlabama set a school record for most points in a quarter and matched the second-most scored in a half while racing to a 45-0 halftime lead.\n\nIt was Alabama\u2019s largest margin of victory since a 62-0 defeat of Tulane in 1991, and the biggest under coach Nick Saban. It was also the Tide\u2019s most lopsided SEC win since beating Vanderbilt 66-3 in 1979.\n\nAlabama fell only four points shy of the largest margin of victory over a Top 25 team, trailing No. 8 Florida State\u2019s 63-0 win over No. 25 Maryland in 2013 and UCLA\u2019s 66-3 win over No. 11 Texas in 1997.\n\nYeldon had 114 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries, all in the first half. Cooper gained 140 yards on eight catches with a pair of touchdowns.\n\nSims completed 16 of 27 passes before exiting midway through the third quarter.\n\nBy halftime, it seemed Alabama could name its score.\n\nThe Tide had 30 first downs to Texas A&M\u2019s eight after facing doubters following a 14-13 win over Arkansas and a loss to No. 3 Mississippi. Saban even grew frustrated that some Tide fans were disappointed by such a close win.\n\nThat\u2019s hardly an issue this time.\n\nJohnny Manziel and Texas A&M had set a record for an Alabama opponent with 628 total yards last season in a 49-42 loss. The Aggies came in averaging 565 yards a game.\n\nKenny Hill could never get them going. He was 17 of 26 passing for just 138 yards \u2014 220 below his average \u2014 and was intercepted for the sixth time in three games long after the outcome was determined.\n\nFreshman Kyle Allen replaced him in the fourth quarter and had to chase down a high snap in the end zone on his first play.\n\nThe Aggies couldn\u2019t even get a spark from the return of star receiver Malcome Kennedy from a separated shoulder that sidelined him for two games. Kennedy gained 4 yards on four catches.\n\nThe Tide scored on its first eight possessions, all touchdowns after the opening drive.\n\nAlabama hit the locker room with a 449-51 advantage in yards and no doubt about the outcome.\n\nThe Tide did have some standout plays in a game full of \u2018Bama highlights.\n\nSims flashed his running ability with a nifty touchdown run when he faked to Yeldon, made two defenders miss and won a footrace to the end zone.\n\nYeldon set up his second touchdown run with a 31-yarder after appearing bottled up at the line of scrimmage. He scored on fourth and goal from the 1.\n\nTexas A&M missed an early opportunity. Deshazor Everett dropped a near-certain pick-6 on the Tide\u2019s opening drive.
