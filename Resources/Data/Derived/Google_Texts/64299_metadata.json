I think it's a great idea.\"\n\nOthers are excited for the location, because many have to travel to Sherman or the metroplex for care.\n\n\"It's really important because we have a lot of rural farmers so that they can get to a place quickly to just get some care, I think that's important,\" Hamilton said.\n\nJust days from opening, leaders and residents are both excited for what lies ahead.\n\n\"I hope we can keep up with those that need the services and that we can grow as the need grows,\" Clemons said.\n\n\"I'm so proud of our community for having this come to Ector Texas--one of my favorite places,\" Hamilton concluded.\n\nThe Fannin Health clinic is located at the corner of North Main Street and North Red Bud in Ector.\n\nThe clinic will welcome its first patients this Thursday, April 14, and they will be open from 6 to 9 every Thursday evening afterwards.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "ECTOR, Texas -- If you blink while driving along State Highway 56, you just might miss Ector.", "language": "english", "author": "Marissa Budzynski", "og": {"description": "ECTOR, Texas -- If you blink while driving along State Highway 56, you just might miss Ector.", "title": "Volunteers offer free healthcare to Fannin Co.", "url": "http://www.kxii.com/morningshow/headlines/Volunteers-offer-free-healthcare-to-Fannin-Co-375275211.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A20/171/A20171CD70E5420BBB3ED5E61D9D9FB4", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/156/2BD/1562BD7E1A0D4091BB865A27850BA503.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kxii.com", "description": "ECTOR, Texas -- If you blink while driving along State Highway 56, you just might miss Ector.", "title": "Volunteers offer free healthcare to Fannin Co.", "url": "http://www.kxii.com/morningshow/headlines/Volunteers-offer-free-healthcare-to-Fannin-Co-375275211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/A5439B7135A04C86BF515E17E48FCB13.jpg", "creator": "@KXIITV", "site": "@KXIITV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Volunteers offer free healthcare to Fannin Co.", "google-site-verification": "vZvaz68V3vA9j3lYIlGasdDiEXM4dMWy5xZtTHBnAaA", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Volunteers offer free healthcare to"}, "article_summary": "\"I think Fannin County still is an underserved county,\" said Deloris Clemons, the clinic's board president.\nNow the little town is hoping to do a lot of good for all of Fannin County with a free medical clinic.\n\"There's good things, oh yes there's bad here too, but there's a lot of good.\"\n\"There's a lot of people in Fannin County who can't afford the proper healthcare they need,\" said Dan Henke. \"\nClemons is a Fannin County native, who worked at Bonham's VA hospital for years."}
