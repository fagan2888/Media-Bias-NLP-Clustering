She said the administration constantly dismissed her complaints of racist student behavior.\n\nShe feels the picture that surfaced yesterday vindicates her feelings but wishes it could have been avoided in the first place.\n\n\u201cMany of the students who were so happy to see me gone now are the ones saying \u2018Dr. Cobb talked about this on a daily basis, the racial issues on this campus, and we never paid attention to her. She was right,\u201d\u2019 said Dr. Cobb, citing social media posts she\u2019s read in the 24 hours since the racially charged picture surfaced.\n\nIn this instance, Desert Vista and the Tempe Union School District have come out strong against the behavior of the six students in the picture.\n\n\u201cOutrage, absolute outrage,\u201d said Jill Hanks, Tempe Union spokesperson, responding to a question on the district\u2019s official reaction. \u201cWe will be addressing the obvious need for sensitivity training... there will be discipline, this will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nFrom Dr. Cobb\u2019s perspective, it will take a lot to fix the larger problem.\n\n\u201cThis is something, from my perception, that comes from home. This is a word that these children, from my viewpoint, feel comfortable using amongst their peers and probably in the residence,\u201d said Dr. Cobb.\n\nWe have extended interview invitations to several of the girls and/or their parents. So far one parent declined and others have not responded.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A former Valley teacher said outrage over a racial slur spelled out on the lettered shirts of six white students at Desert Vista High School is nothing new.", "og": {"url": "http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/31041472/former-teacher-responds-to-racial-outrage-at-valley-school", "image": "http://MEREDITHAZ.images.worldnow.com/images/9718815_G.png", "type": "article", "description": "A former Valley teacher said outrage over a racial slur spelled out on the lettered shirts of six white students at Desert Vista High School is nothing new.", "title": "Former teacher responds to racial outrage at Valley school"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17641427, "creator": "@TucsonNewsNow", "image": "http://MEREDITHAZ.images.worldnow.com/images/9718815_G.png", "title": "Former teacher responds to racial outrage at Valley school", "site": "@TucsonNewsNow", "card": "summary", "description": "A former Valley teacher said outrage over a racial slur spelled out on the lettered shirts of six white students at Desert Vista High School is nothing new."}, "wnreadableurl": "former-teacher-responds-to-racial-outrage-at-valley-school", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2016/01/24", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 215936215202939}, "google-site-verification": "wum6pK5VyCXxNIhQSMSz7se_UVLjlDGJFKTm4EWnWUY", "owner": "MEREDITHAZ", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/TucsonNewsNow"}, "KEYWORDS": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS06", "news_keywords": "Tucson News Now,KOLD News 13,FOX 11,KOLD,KMSB,Tucson,Southern Arizona,Arizona"}, "article_summary": "A former Valley teacher said outrage over a racial slur spelled out on the lettered shirts of six white students at Desert Vista High School is nothing new.\nDr. Cobb left Desert Vista and filed a federal racial discrimination lawsuit that's still pending.\nThis is a word that these children, from my viewpoint, feel comfortable using amongst their peers and probably in the residence,\u201d said Dr. Cobb.\n\u201cI told Desert Vista High School pretty much from the onset of my employment there were issues with race there,\u201d said Dr. Cicely Cobb, who left her job as an English teacher at Desert Vista in 2014.\nShe was right,\u201d\u2019 said Dr. Cobb, citing social media posts she\u2019s read in the 24 hours since the racially charged picture surfaced."}
