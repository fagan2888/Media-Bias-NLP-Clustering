EDITORS PLEASE NOTE: EDIT CONTAINS MATERIAL THAT WAS ORIGINALLY 4:3 Malawi's government says floods have killed almost 200 people. Thousands managed to seek shelter at camps like this one, set up by aid agencies. Melisa Daniel is one of them. (SOUNDBITE) (Chichewa) FLOOD VICTIM, MELISA DANIEL, SAYING: "The floodwaters entered and washed away my house. It was the people in the village that came to rescue me and my children. We nearly lost our lives. But all my livestock, food and property have all been washed away. We are homeless." Thousands more are still stranded, waiting for the army to rescue them. And it's going to get worse, as more rain is expected for the next few weeks.
