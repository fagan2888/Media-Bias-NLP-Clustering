Or so the clich\u00e9 goes. Broncos safety Mike Adams has a bigger dream, a dream so real it hurts.\n\nWin the Super Bowl and Adams is going for a long walk, straight to the dead-end street where he was raised, a place folks warned he would never escape.\n\n\u201cIf we win the Super Bowl, I\u2019m going to keep my helmet and pads on and I\u2019m walking home,\u201d Adams insists.\n\nHome is Paterson, N.J.\n\n\u201cIt can be almost like a cancer,\u201d said Adams, describing his hometown. \u201cAnd I say that because the negativity in that place can be like a snowball rolling downhill.\u201d\n\nPaterson is 12 miles up the Garden State Parkway from this year\u2019s Super Bowl and a world away. I asked Adams: Think motorists will notice a grown man in a Broncos helmet as he strolls down the highway?\n\n\u201cAfter I get to the IHOP on Route 3, I\u2019ll start hitchhiking,\u201d said Adams, laughing. \u201cBut they\u2019d probably think I\u2019m just some crazy person.\u201d\n\nThere are 101 sweet success stories at the Super Bowl. Maybe we can lend an ear to the story of Adams.\n\nAdams is among the Jersey Boys returning home to wear orange at Super Bowl XLVIII. Defensive end Robert Ayers was born in Jersey City, not far from the team\u2019s championship-game headquarters. Oddsmakers have made it 4-to-1 that Knowshon Moreno will cry as \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d is played at Metlife Stadium, less than an hour from the field where he carried the rock for Middletown High School.\n\nThe city of Paterson, according to native son and New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz, is a place where too many friends got a casket instead of a high school diploma. Adams never knew his father. His mother died of ovarian cancer during Adams\u2019 rookie year with the San Francisco 49ers. So who gets the credit for Adams making it to the Super Bowl?\n\n\u201cSelfishly,\u201d Adams said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to give someone else credit for what you\u2019ve gone through and how you\u2019ve shaped your life.\u201d\n\nAdams made the NFL as an undrafted free agent out of Delaware. Ten seasons later, he endured a demotion from the starting lineup in Denver, only to be one of the next men up for the Broncos when Rahim Moore got hurt. Adams\u2019 interception turned a close game against Houston into a rout.\n\nWinning the Super Bowl would be the happy ending to the movie of Adams\u2019 football life. In fact, he\u2019s already got a working title for the flick.\n\n\u201cI Earned My Spot,\u201d Adams said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Broncos\u2019 Mike Adams has dream of walking home after Super Bowl", "title": "Kiszla: Broncos\u2019 Mike Adams has dream of walking home after Super Bowl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/25/kiszla-broncos-mike-adams-has-dream-of-walking-home-after-super-bowl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222__mike-adams-broncos-houston-122213p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131222__mike-adams-broncos-houston-122213p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-25T20:03:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:39:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we win the Super Bowl, I\u2019m going to keep my helmet and pads on and I\u2019m walking home,\u201d Adams insists.\n\u201cBut they\u2019d probably think I\u2019m just some crazy person.\u201dThere are 101 sweet success stories at the Super Bowl.\nWinning the Super Bowl would be the happy ending to the movie of Adams\u2019 football life.\nI asked Adams: Think motorists will notice a grown man in a Broncos helmet as he strolls down the highway?\nAdams is among the Jersey Boys returning home to wear orange at Super Bowl XLVIII."}
