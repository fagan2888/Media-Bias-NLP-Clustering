The people GOP policies are intended to hurt deserve our contempt. Those who don't share that contempt are themselves, therefore, contemptible hypocrites. It's one thing to nurse grievances and to revel, at times, in a sense of righteous superiority. We humans are susceptible to such impulses. But it's another thing entirely for a major political party to have reached a point where virtually its sole purpose is to use its legislative agenda as an opportunity to express its bile and hatred (and please spare me attempts at false equivalency -- raising by four percentage points the tax rates on those earning more than $400,000 a year is not an expression of bile or hatred. It's barely an expression of anything at all). Because GOP officeholders are generally far more concerned about the extremist base in their own ranks than they are with the larger political terrain, the authoritarian takeover of that base has become a central political development. The authoritarian worldview bristles at change, diversity and complexity and needs, above all, for the world of political choices to be expressible in the most simple, black and white terms. In that worldview, facts will always play a secondary role to moral outrage. Again, folks across the political spectrum are capable of privileging their own moral predilections over evidence that contradicts their preferences. But authoritarian-minded folks are especially susceptible to such habits of mind. The result, in a party whose base they have come to dominate, is a particularly bracing fact-free zone, in which one is admired or not based almost solely on how much scorn one can heap on disfavored and marginal groups.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House majority", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-24 15:12:16 -0400", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/the-republican-war-on-rea_b_3976762.html", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The House majority", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "description": "The House majority", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "jonweiler"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-23 15:12:16 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3976762", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Debt Ceiling,gop,authoritarianism,food stamps,Voter suppression,obamacare", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Debt Ceiling,gop,authoritarianism,food stamps,Voter suppression,obamacare", "published_time": "2013-09-23 15:12:16 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-11-23 05:12:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82b7\"", "article_summary": "Again, folks across the political spectrum are capable of privileging their own moral predilections over evidence that contradicts their preferences.\nIt's one thing to nurse grievances and to revel, at times, in a sense of righteous superiority.\nBut authoritarian-minded folks are especially susceptible to such habits of mind.\nThe people GOP policies are intended to hurt deserve our contempt.\nIn that worldview, facts will always play a secondary role to moral outrage."}
