SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – There are 4 vaccines parents should consider for their children before they go back to school: Tdap, meningitis HPV, and the flu.

Massachusetts requires all students to have the Tdap, a combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine. College students and those at boarding schools are required to have at least one dose of a meningitis vaccine. The HPV and flu vaccines are not required, but highly recommended.

Dr. Michael Klatte, pediatric infectious disease specialist at Baystate Medical Center, told 22News the HPV vaccination rate among teens is lower than the rate for other vaccinations.

Doctors also recommend teens get the flu shot every year. Emmanuel College student Jason St. Jacques told 22News, “I think it’s very important. I make a point to get it every year just to be safe. I’ve seen the kind of destruction it can do, especially to people who don’t take it seriously. I mean, it’s a contagious disease.”

The Affordable Care Act makes these 4 vaccinations free to everyone. Among the HPV and flu vaccines, Dr. Klatte also recommends children be vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella.

“Certainly the MMR vaccine, of which 2 are required,” said Dr. Klatte. “I know there has been a lot of controversy in the past surrounding the MMR vaccine and research has shown there are no links between autism and the MMR vaccine.”

All of these vaccinations can be administered in one doctor’s visit.
