Well get ready for a little d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2026\n\nThe Nation\u2019s Lee Fang reports this week that many of the \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d movement\u2019s biggest voices also happen to be pretty big fans of things like community health centers. In a brief post, with just four photos, Fang pretty much de-fangs the GOP position and exposes it as just so much political posturing (albeit at the expense of actual human lives.)\n\nThe vast majority of healthcare reform is funded through what is known as mandatory spending that is not necessarily affected by the continuing budget resolution now at issue in Congress. If the government shuts down, the only aspect of Obamacare that will be defunded is the portion that is covered through discretionary spending. Affordable Care Act discretionary spending includes funding for community health centers, preventative health programs, school-based health clinics for children, rural and Indian health centers, doctor and nurse training grants, among other programs\u2014spending that overwhelmingly benefit rural Republican districts in many states.\n\nThat\u2019s right. The programs most praised by GOP lawmakers and most beneficial to their districts are the very programs which would be wrecked were they to actually accomplish their goal of defunding the Affordable Care Act. Take a gander at the hypocrisy:\n\nSenator Jerry Moran (R-KS) helped sponsor Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s (R-TX) bill to defund healthcare reform. While Moran has attacked the law and called it a failure, he proudly appeared at a publicity event to promote the groundbreaking of a $4.7 million expansion of the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas last August. At the event, where Moran held a ceremonial shovel, the senator heaped praise the community center for helping provide comprehensive care, noting \u201ceven the most conservative politician\u2026ought to be in favor of community health centers.\u201d Though he did not acknowledge the source of the construction money, the $4.7 million came completely from Affordable Care Act discretionary spending.\n\n\n\nIt would seem that, just like the Stimulus, Obamacare spending is a terrible slide into government tyranny and national insolvency; unless of course, it\u2019s in your district.
