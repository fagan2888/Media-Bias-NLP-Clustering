But leaders from the Minnesota-based retail chain and Kaiser Permanente say the new clinics will go beyond the scope of most walk-in clinics and represent the \u201cnext generation of healthcare service models.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a Walmart clinic open 15 hours a day, that\u2019s the standard you may have to meet\n\nThe clinics -- in Vista, San Diego, and Fontana and West Fullerton -- will offer primary care, pediatric and adolescent care, well-woman care, family planning, and chronic condition management.\n\n\u201cWe believe our stores are uniquely equipped to offer guests a comprehensive approach to supporting their wellness needs, including Target Clinic, Target Pharmacy, healthy foods and wellness products,\u201d said Kevin Ronneberg, MD, medical director at Target Corporation.\n\nKaiser Permanente will staff the new clinics with licensed nurse practitioners and licensed vocational nurses, while physicians will be available by telemedicine consultations, and the clinics will serve Kaiser Permanente health plan members and all others, taking payment from a range of health plans and self-payment.\n\n[See also: Harnessing the power of retail clinics.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re collaborating with Target because its clinics have a legacy of combining quality and convenience in a way that we think will resonate with both our members and the overall Target guest population,\u201d said Paul Minardi, MD, medical director and business manager at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. \u201cThis is the evolution of expanding Kaiser Permanente\u2019s high-quality and holistic care delivery into a setting that will provide patients with wellness support.\u201d\n\nTarget is in the process of contracting with Medicare, MediCal (California\u2019s Medicaid program), Blue Shield of California and other commercial insurers to cover the walk-in service. Many private insurers have been happy to reimburse for walk-in primary care, given the lower cost structure, and often promote them to their members in an effort to raise awareness about avoiding unnecessary emergency department visits and spurring informed healthcare shopping, since many walk-in clinics post their prices in the stores or online \u2014 something not many hospital-based outpatient or primary care providers do.\n\nKaiser Permanente\u2019s partnership with Target is one of the highest profile collaborations between a health system and a retailer. Some health systems have embraced walk-in clinics, operating their own or in collaboration with local stores. For some others, though, the retail health wave \u2014 with new patient expectations of convenient access and low costs for basic services \u2014 has taken them by surprise.\n\nNonetheless, health systems can offer convenience and quality as well as retailers, and perhaps can meet affordable prices, if they start now \u2014 before waves of retail health really wash in.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a Walmart clinic open 15 hours a day, that\u2019s the standard you may have to meet,\u201d said Lisa Bielamowicz, MD, the chief medical officer at the Advisory Board Company. Online and same day appointments and walk-in on-site lab tests \u201care eventually going to rise to be the standard,\u201d Bielamowicz argues.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/kaiser-target-nurture-next-generation-primary-care", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/target-clinic.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The third largest U.S. retail company is partnering with a well-known integrated delivery system to evolve the primary care walk-in clinic, in a confident bet on retail health.", "title": "Kaiser, Target nurture 'next generation' primary care"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/target-clinic.jpg"}, "title": "Kaiser, Target nurture 'next generation' primary care", "description": "The third largest U.S. retail company is partnering with a well-known integrated delivery system to evolve the primary care walk-in clinic, in a confident bet on retail health.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "In the latest iteration of retail health, the third largest U.S. retail company is partnering with a well-known integrated delivery system to offer convenience and a more comprehensive array of services than the typical walk-in clinic.&#13; Just in time for the holidays and the flu season, Target and Kaiser Permanente are launching four clinics at Target stores in Southern California this November and December.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Just in time for the holidays and the flu season, Target and Kaiser Permanente are launching four clinics at Target stores in Southern California.\nJust in time for the holidays and the flu season, Target and Kaiser Permanente are launching four clinics at Target stores in Southern California this November and December.\nTarget already hosts 79 walk-in clinics at stores in California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.\nKaiser Permanente\u2019s partnership with Target is one of the highest profile collaborations between a health system and a retailer.\nFor some others, though, the retail health wave \u2014 with new patient expectations of convenient access and low costs for basic services \u2014 has taken them by surprise."}
