We\u2019ll find out soon enough, but here\u2019s what happened in case you chose the big game over the Crawleys.\n\nLord Grantham\u2019s birthday is coming up, and Rose\u2013always up for a good party\u2013decides to hire a jazz band as a surprise (and the return of Jack Ross). To help orchestrate the logistics, she lets Mrs. Hughes in on the secret, with Baxter catching only that there is a secret between the two of them\u2013without the context of the birthday.\n\nWhen Thomas presses Baxter for an update on news upstairs, she reveals what scant information she knows. Thomas thinks something big is under way, when all Rose wants to do is hide the band downstairs. He questions Mrs. Hughes after seeing Rose leave her office, but she will only say they could all be affected. Thomas takes this as a bad sign and pressures Baxter to find out more information. \u201cYou\u2019ll think of something,\u201d he says to her when she asks how she\u2019s supposed to get Mrs. Hughes to reveal anything.\n\nUpstairs, Lady Grantham reveals to Mary that she believes something has gone wrong between Bates and Anna. \u201cAnna\u2019s been hurt somehow and Bates feels he should\u2019ve protected her,\u201d says Cora. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of that to leave this room, Baxter.\u201d\n\nBaxter reveals to Thomas that she\u2019s not comfortable in this eavesdropping role. \u201cYou knew the conditions when you came here,\u201d he warns. Baxter airs her reservations about harming someone who is polite and considerate. \u201cWhat you have to decide is where your first loyalties are,\u201d says Thomas.\n\nOn Lord Grantham\u2019s birthday, Lady Rose comes downstairs to inform the servants of the band\u2019s arrival. Everyone is game until Jack Ross steps inside, and shock waves ripple through the room at the sight of a black man at Downton!\n\nLet the awkwardness begin. Carson asks Ross if he\u2019s ever thought of visiting Africa. \u201cI\u2019m no more African than you are,\u201d replies Ross. While the older folk are uncomfortable (save for Mrs. Hughes), we see that times are changing, with giggling maids waving shyly at Ross downstairs, and Rose\u2019s continued interest in him.\n\nWhen dinner is over, Rose unveils her surprise, with the jazz band playing in the next room. As the initial shock upon seeing Ross washes over Lord Grantham, Edith asks, \u201cWho is this singer and how did he get here?\u201d But Lord Grantham accepts it and happily starts dancing. It\u2019s surprising that Edith is the one having such a hard time with Ross\u2019s presence, as she has been the symbol of many of the changing times: learning how to drive, writing for a newspaper and falling in love with a married editor. Even the Dowager Countess lectures her on being provincial: \u201cTry and let your time in London rub off on you a little more.\u201d\n\nThe jazz party is a success, and Mary and Lord Grantham decide to pay the bill for the band. When Mary goes downstairs late in the night to find Ross, she discovers he\u2019s not alone. Rose and Ross are kissing, and Mary announces her presence to give them time to recover. \u201cI\u2019ve been so well looked after here,\u201d Ross says, while glancing at Rose. The family was fine enough to let a black band leader into the house and enjoy some jazz, but how will they react to an interracial romance?\n\nIntroducing Charles Blake\n\nEvelyn Napier, Lady Mary and Charles Blake Courtesy of Nick Briggs/Carnival Film and Television Limited 2013 for MASTERPIECE\n\nMoving on with estate matters, the family discuss Tamworth pigs as part of Downton\u2019s move to take on intensive farming. When Mary asks Branson about his intentions to move to America, he reveals that he won\u2019t go until the pig business is up and running.\n\nMeanwhile, Evelyn Napier makes good on his promise to stay at Downton, bringing his boss Charles Blake. But Blake doesn\u2019t make a great first impression on Mary, who is disappointed to learn that the men aren\u2019t here to help the landowners, but instead are looking at more practical matters like food production.\n\nThe mounting tragedies at Downton are brought together in a poignant moment with the widows and widowers of the family: Isobel, Mary and Tom. They reminisce about their partners, and the \u201cmadness\u201d that came with love. Isobel recalls being almost sick with love at her engagement to Reginald. For Tom, it was like being hypnotized\u2013all he could think about was Sybil for weeks. Mary remembers standing outside in the snow without a coat, but not thinking of anything except Matthew\u2019s proposal. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t we the lucky ones?\u201d says Isobel with a smile.\n\nDuring dinner, the verbal sparring continues between Mary and Blake. When she laments the plight of pigs, Blake asks Mary if she eats bacon and sausage. She says yes, to which he replies: \u201cThen you\u2019re a sentimentalist who cannot face the truth.\u201d Blake is having a promising start as a potential suitor for Mary, who hasn\u2019t taken to fawning gentlemen (Gillingham). Her past attractions have either had an element of mystique (Pamuk) or challenge (Matthew).\n\nNapier seems to recognize this, as he gazes with concern at the pair from across the table. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Charles is challenged by anyone with a sense of entitlement,\u201d he says to Lady Crawley. And then comments, \u201cShe\u2019s welcome to take charge of me.\u201d Although that seems unlikely if he keeps introducing Mary to interesting men.\n\nLater, when Mary wants to know what estates Blake is investigating, he smiles and steps away. \u201cYou seem to have brought a traitor into our midst,\u201d Mary tells Napier. Blake isn\u2019t enthralled with Mary either. \u201cShe\u2019s the type who demands all this as a right, but she wants it on a plate,\u201d he says. \u201cShe won\u2019t work for it and she won\u2019t fight for it, and that type doesn\u2019t deserve to survive.\u201d Napier reveals that Mary feels the same way about Blake.\n\nTom remarks with surprise at having jazz at Downton. And, in an effort to persuade him to stay, Mrs. Crawley says: \u201cThings can happen at Downton that no one imagined even a few years ago.\u201d The Dowager Countess has thoughts about jazz, too: \u201cDo you think any of them know what the others are playing?\u201d\n\nMore Trouble for Edith\n\nLady Edith Courtesy of Nick Briggs/Carnival Film and Television Limited 2013 for MASTERPIECE\n\nEdith has gotten precious few minutes in these last episodes, while still undergoing one of the show\u2019s biggest character transformations, and enduring some of its more shocking developments. While still waiting for letters that don\u2019t arrive and placing calls that go unanswered, Edith finally breaks down in front of her mother, saying that Michael has \u201cvanished into thin air.\u201d\n\nA letter arrives in the evening post, confirming suspicions surrounding her visit to Dr. Goldman in London: Her symptoms are consistent with those associated with the first trimester of pregnancy. Aunt Rosamund\u2019s prediction is starting to bear fruit, so to speak.\n\nLord Grantham later finds his daughter weeping by the fire, and asks her what\u2019s the matter, calling her \u201cmy most darling girl.\u201d Edith, who can never let go of that cynicism that has been the hallmark of her upbringing, says, \u201cBut I\u2019m not your most darling girl, am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love all my children equally,\u201d he replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know why people say that when it\u2019s almost never true,\u201d she says sadly. Edith reveals that there\u2019s a detective in Munich working with the German police to find out what happened to Michael.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Bates\n\nAnna and Bates go to dinner at the fancy Netherby. Courtesy of Nick Briggs/Carnival Film and Television Limited 2013 for MASTERPIECE\n\nAnna is in better spirits after reconciling with Bates, but now her husband appears tormented by what happened. They carry on, treating each other as angelically as ever, but it\u2019s not enough.\n\nIn a scene that reflects their situation\u2013Bates lights a lantern in a dark room, illuminating the pair but casting shadows all around them\u2013Anna expresses her fears. \u201cI want to make some new memories\u2013good memories,\u201d says Anna, \u201cSo it\u2019s not as if all our happiness was before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy whenever I look at you,\u201d insists Bates. \u201cBut you\u2019re not, are you,\u201d says Anna. \u201cEverything is shadowed.\u201d The couple decide to have dinner at the Netherby Hotel in the evening as a way to momentarily forget about their worries.\n\nBut when they arrive at the restaurant, we get a sense of what it\u2019s like to be in the lower class. A snooty waiter claims to not have their reservation. The waiter says the restaurant is full with Lady Grantham\u2019s large party dining there. When Anna and Bates say they know her, the waiter doesn\u2019t believe it. That is, until Lady Grantham comes over and greets them. The transformation of the waiter\u2019s demeanor is remarkable, as his tone changes and he promises to fix the situation. \u201cPlease excuse the little hiccup earlier,\u201d he whispers to them. \u201cIt will be the last.\u201d\n\nKitchen Shuffling\n\nDaisy is relieved that Alfred isn\u2019t leaving just yet for cooking school, and can hardly contain herself. But wait! A letter arrives from the Ritz arrives in the mail, and he has gotten a spot after all. One of the other candidates dropped out after getting a job. \u201cI was fifth\u2013see Jimmy?\u201d says Alfred, who has to go to London as soon as possible. Everyone\u2019s delighted except for Daisy. Jimmy, being spiteful, asks why Daisy hasn\u2019t congratulated him (now it is clear why Thomas was attracted to him).\n\nAlfred is nervous, but Jimmy dismissively wonders why he should be nervous. Carson sticks it to him: \u201cYou\u2019re nervous because you\u2019re intelligent, Alfred. Only stupid people are foolhardy.\u201d\n\nIvy finds an upset Daisy in the kitchen and says she\u2019s sorry. But Daisy lashes out and blames Ivy for driving Alfred away because she picked Jimmy.\n\nUpstairs, Alfred has a chance to express his gratitude to the Crawleys. He also says that Carson has been \u201ca kind\u2013and wonderful teacher,\u201d much to everyone\u2019s (including Carson, whose expression softens) surprise. But a character transformation can\u2019t be expected overnight. When Mrs. Hughes asks Carson to contact Molesley to replace Alfred, he objects. That would involve some backpedaling on his part considering their last exchange. Carson goes on about expecting gratitude from his workers, even as the women around him\u2013Mrs. Patmore and Baxter included\u2013all think it most prudent to bring Molesley back.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to leave, Alfred says goodbye to Daisy privately. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve hurt you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person and you\u2019re going to make some man very happy one day, but I\u2019m afraid it was never going to be me.\u201d\n\nWe later see Molesley making his way back to Downton to confirm his \u201cwillingness to return\u201d to the life of a footman. Carson has the perfect opportunity now\u2013without having to ask awkwardly\u2013to fill the position. But he just can\u2019t seem to let anything go, and instead says he is looking for more enthusiasm in a new employee. \u201cI don\u2019t want to humiliate you,\u201d says Carson. \u201cYou feel you\u2019re meant for better things and I won\u2019t contradict you.\u201d Even though Molesley says he\u2019s willing to do it, Carson says, \u201cYou have your pride, and I respect you for it.\u201d Unfortunately Carson cannot recognize his own pride and obstinance in this matter.\n\nJimmy appears to still be interested in Ivy, and takes her to the movies. On a bench outside after their date, they start to kiss until Jimmy gets a little too pushy and Ivy stops him. He reminds her how nice he\u2019s been to her, taking her to the theater and cinema, and how he\u2019s not getting anything in return. Ivy says she\u2019s not playing his game, and storms off. \u201cAlfred would never have done such a thing,\u201d she later tells the ladies in the kitchen. \u201cHe had too much respect.\u201d Well, that ship has sailed.\n\nOn Lord Grantham\u2019s birthday, Mrs. Hughes decides to ask Molesley to the house to help serve tea to the servants, without first telling Carson. This irritates Carson, but it also gives him a chance to save face and hire Molesley as a footman after wall, without looking like he was softening his stance.\n\nWhen Molesley is back serving dinner upstairs, the Dowager Countess remarks at how difficult it will be to have to call him by his first name, Joseph, instead. (The more senior servant staff is always referred to by their last names only\u2013think Carson, O\u2019Brien and Bates\u2013while the junior staff uses their first names\u2013Daisy and Alfred. Historically, some staff were even given generic names.) Lord Grantham asks if it\u2019s fine for the household continue to use Molesley\u2019s last name, Carson stiffly agrees. It looks like the tension between Molesley and Carson shall continue.\n\nAn Honest Gardener\n\nThe Dowager Countess, playing Nancy Drew after the disappearance of a paper knife in the last episode, tries to figure out what happened to a netsuke carving she had on her desk. She questions her butler Spratt about who was in the room, and once again makes it clear she suspects Pegg.\n\nLater on, we learn Pegg has indeed been fired\u2013without any hard evidence\u2013much to Mrs. Crawley\u2019s outrage. \u201cAll I know is this: I find Pegg in this room, and my paper knife is gone,\u201d says Violet, defending her actions to Isobel. \u201cHe comes into the room again and a very valuable piece of Japanese netsuke is missing.\u201d\n\nIsobel starts on a tirade about focusing too much on material objects instead of justice. \u201cI wonder you don\u2019t just set fire to the Abbey and dance \u2018round it, painted with woad and howling,\u201d says Violet. As the tension grows, Spratt walks in with the missing netsuke, mistakenly lost during a cleaning. Ah, if only real life worked this way with such impeccable timing! \u201cI\u2019m very relieved,\u201d says Violet, unconvincingly. Spratt gives one of his priceless Sprattly looks and departs.\n\nDespite this, Violet says she won\u2019t apologize to Pegg, saying he might have sneaked it into the maid\u2019s bucket when nobody was looking. \u201cHow you hate to be wrong,\u201d says Isobel. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d says Violet, \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with the sensation.\u201d She digs in her heels and says, without any doubt, that he took the knife.\n\nBut Isobel is nothing if not determined. She sets up a scheme to enter Violet\u2019s house while the Dowager Countess is away. This gives Isobel a chance to search the room thoroughly, and she finds the paper knife wedged along the side of a chair. She gives it to Spratt to share her discovery with Violet.\n\nLater on, Isobel and Dr. Clarkson show up at Violet\u2019s, with Isobel eager to lecture Violet about injustice again. But after some bluster, Violet reveals that she\u2019s already hired back young Pegg. \u201cIf you wish to understand things you must come out from behind your prejudice and listen,\u201d says Violet. For once Isobel is speechless. \u201cI\u2019d say that was game, set and match for Lady Grantham,\u201d says Dr. Clarkson.\n\nFamily Problems in America\n\nCora\u2019s brother Harold writes to Lord Grantham about a bind he\u2019s in regarding oil leases. \u201cWhy is he bothering you with it?\u201d asks Edith. It sounds like more money problems ahead.\n\nReaders, what did you think of this episode? Leave your thoughts in the comments.\n\nWrite to Robin Kawakami at Robin.Kawakami@wsj.com.
