According to a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, activity in regions of the brain associated with reward, motivation, emotion, and social functioning are highest when we are in love.\n\nThe most powerful human emotion that can be experienced is actually seldom understood. The unnerving urge to grasp it led the term \u201cWhat is love\u201d to be the most searched phrase on Google in 2012. Psychologists have defined it as a state that is different from familial or friendship love with the desire to enter or maintain a close relationship with a specific other person, but what happens biologically?\n\nLove is known to have a variety of effects on the body that lead to feelings of euphoria, craving, obsession, and even personality changes. During instant attraction, the brain\u2019s ventromedial prefrontal cortex \u2014 the area that judges attractiveness in milliseconds \u2014 is immediately activated, setting off a chain of reactions in the brain. However, how exactly does the brain activity of those in love compare to others?\n\nProfessor Xiaochu Zhang, leader of the study at the University of Science and Technology of China, and researchers from Southwest University, the University of Science and Technology of China, and from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, N.Y., sought to see how exactly romantic love affects the functional architecture of the brain. A total of 100 men and women, divided into three groups \u2014 those who were intensely in love, recently ended a romantic relationship, or single and never had a romance \u2014 underwent a brain scan. There were no significant differences found in age, education, or income.\n\nThe brain activity of all the participants was investigated using resting state fMRI while they weren\u2019t thinking about anything. This was done to help scientists get the overall picture of their functional architecture. The brain map found a variety of results among the three groups.\n\nThe findings revealed, compared to other groups, those within the in-love group had more increased activity across several brain regions involved in reward, motivation, emotion, an social functioning. Moreover, the researchers found the longer they had been in love, the greater the brain activity seen. Those in the ended-love group were more likely to show a lower amount of activity detected in these areas of the brain.\n\nBrain areas with altered regional homogeneity (ReHo) the in-love group (LG) and ended-love group (ELG). Front. Hum. Neurosci.\n\nAltered functional connectivity (FC) pattern in comparison across the three groups. Front. Hum. Neurosci.\n\n\u201cThis study provides first empirical evidence of love-related alterations in brain functional architecture. Furthermore, the results shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms of romantic love, and demonstrate the possibility of applying a resting-state fMRI approach for investigating romantic love,\u201d wrote the researchers. This suggests love may influence dispersive brain networks during general state as well as the social cognition brain networks.\n\nFalling in love is such an easy thing to do, but such a hard thing to understand \u2014 even for neurologists.\n\nSource: d\u2019Oleire Uquillas F, Liu Y, Kou J.
