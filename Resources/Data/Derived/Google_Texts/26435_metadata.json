Under federal law, immigrant children have two options to seek legal status, including requesting asylum for fear of returning home to face gang violence.\n\nWithout legal help, the maze of documentation and legal requirements is far more difficult for a child to maneuver.\n\nRepublicans opposed to people who are in the United States illegally have greater priorities in the $51 billion measure, which also funds the Commerce Department and science-related agencies such as NASA.\n\nThe measure is one of 12 annual appropriations bills covering the day-to-day operations of government agencies. Such discretionary spending gets reviewed and funded annually unlike mandatory programs such as Medicare, Social Security and food stamps.\n\nThe 12 spending bills are at the center of a fight between Obama and Republicans, who have given the Pentagon almost $40 billion in relief from automatic spending curbs but are resisting Obama's demands for equal treatment for domestic agencies facing a funding freeze.\n\nThe battle is particularly bitter in the tea party-driven House. Republicans pressed ahead Wednesday with bills seeking to force further cuts to the agencies they particularly dislike, the IRS and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe House measures are full of provisions aimed at blocking various Obama policies, including implementation of the Affordable Care Act by the IRS and environmental regulations, including protections for the endangered sage grouse that are opposed by Western energy interests.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "immigration, richard shelby, news", "title": "Led by Shelby, Senate blocks legal fund for immigrant children", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "A GOP-controlled Senate panel on Wednesday blocked President Barack Obama's request for $50 million to pay for legal help for unaccompanied&nbsp;immigrant&nbsp;children&nbsp;coming to the United States after fleeing violence in Central America.
