Eighteen percent answered \u201cnothing.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have criticized the Obama administration\u2019s reaction to Benghazi -- at first erroneously saying it was a spontaneous assault rather than a planned terrorist attack -- in a series of congressional hearings.\n\nThey\u2019ve also found fault with Clinton\u2019s response at one of those hearings: \u201cWhat difference at this point does it make?\u201d she asked about whether the attack was planned or spontaneous.\n\nThe poll found that fewer people view Clinton\u2019s gender as a negative than in 2008, when she lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama. In January 2008, 35 percent of those polled said being a woman hurt her, while 20 percent now say it would harm her presidential aspirations.\n\nMore than half of respondents said they\u2019d like her to run for president in 2016, including 76 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans. Among independents, 45 percent said they\u2019d like her to run and 48 percent said they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nClinton, who retired last year as secretary of state, has said she will make her decision on 2016 later this year.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike view her as \u201ctough,\u201d according to the poll. In all, 67 percent of Americans approve of the job she did in that position.\n\nThe poll of 1,002 adults ages 18 and older and living in the U.S. was conducted Feb. 27-March 2 in telephone interviews. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "clinton,pew,benghazi,negatives", "pubdate": "2014-03-05T06:35:11", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Americans cited \"Benghazi\" as the most glaring negative on former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's political resume, while more than two-thirds approved of her performance as America's top diplomat, a poll shows.Fifteen percent of those surveyed identified the...", "title": "Pew Poll: Hillary Clinton's Top Career Negative Seen as Benghazi", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/clinton-pew-benghazi-negatives/2014/03/05/id/556108/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=e0ce00ff-d51b-41cb-bdf2-709c4251afdf&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/clinton-pew-benghazi-negatives/2014/03/05/id/556108/", "title": "Pew Poll: Hillary Clinton's Top Career Negative Seen as Benghazi", "description": "Americans cited \"Benghazi\" as the most glaring negative on former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's political resume, while more than two-thirds approved of her performance as America's top diplomat, a poll shows.Fifteen percent of those surveyed identified the...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1394001311, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "clinton,pew,benghazi,negatives", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-03-05T06:35:11"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/clinton-pew-benghazi-negatives/2014/03/05/id/556108/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Clinton\u2019s Top Career Negative Seen as Benghazi, Pew Poll Shows"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe122e\"", "article_summary": "The poll found that fewer people view Clinton\u2019s gender as a negative than in 2008, when she lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama.\nAmericans cited \u201cBenghazi\u201d as the most glaring negative on former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s political resume, while more than two-thirds approved of her performance as America\u2019s top diplomat, a poll shows.\nThe poll of 1,002 adults ages 18 and older and living in the U.S. was conducted Feb. 27-March 2 in telephone interviews.\nClinton, who retired last year as secretary of state, has said she will make her decision on 2016 later this year.\nDemocrats and Republicans alike view her as \u201ctough,\u201d according to the poll."}
