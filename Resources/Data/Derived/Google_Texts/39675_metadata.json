Republican alternatives to Obamacare drawn up by Sens. Orrin Hatch and Richard Burr and Reps. Fred Upton, John Kline and Paul Ryan include the provision. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus has endorsed it. Sen. Marco Rubio, another 2016 hopeful, has said nice things about it in the past, as have Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Roy Blunt.\n\nHow did this provision become so popular among Republicans? One reason may be that it\u2019s one of the few parts of the law that can stand on its own. Unlike the ban on pre-existing conditions, the federal subsidies for health insurance or the online marketplaces, the under-26 provision can function with or without other parts of the Affordable Care Act, so Republicans who want to dismantle the law root-and-branch can still support it.\n\nIt\u2019s also effective. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 2 million Americans aged 19-25 gained new coverage because of the under-26 provision.\n\nAnd it\u2019s popular. A 2013 report by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund found, among other things, that the under-26 provision is more popular among Republicans in the 19-to-25 age group than Democrats. The provision tends to benefits the adult children of Americans with employer-based group health care, a group that tends to be middle and high-income as well.\n\nPlus, there appears to be little downside. Sara Collins, a co-author of the Commonwealth report who has studied the effects of the under-26 provision, says the rule had little effect on overall premiums. \u201cYoung adults are very inexpensive to insure,\u201d says Collins.\n\nStill, the provision has its share of conservative critics. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney argued it was unnecessary in his 2012 run, saying insurers already offered plans that allow it. Former Sen. Jim DeMint, now president of the Heritage Foundation, argued that it discourages work, while the conservative group FreedomWorks once termed it \u201cthe slacker mandate.\u201d\n\nWith reporting from Zeke Miller/New Hampshire", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush is the latest Republican to back keeping a part of the Affordable Care Act that lets you stay on you parent's insurance to age 26.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Jeb Bush is the latest to back a provision aimed at twentysomethings.", "title": "How Republicans Learned to Like One Part of Obamacare", "url": "http://time.com/3746567/obamacare-under-26-republicans/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jeb-bush-nh.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jeb-bush-nh.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Jeb Bush is the latest to back a provision aimed at twentysomethings.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Republicans Learned to Like One Part of Obamacare"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "under 26 provision, obamacare, affordable care act, health care, jeb bush, marco rubio, 2016 election", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "under 26 provision, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, health care, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, 2016 election"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9165\"", "article_summary": "The provision tends to benefits the adult children of Americans with employer-based group health care, a group that tends to be middle and high-income as well.\nSara Collins, a co-author of the Commonwealth report who has studied the effects of the under-26 provision, says the rule had little effect on overall premiums.\nA 2013 report by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund found, among other things, that the under-26 provision is more popular among Republicans in the 19-to-25 age group than Democrats.\nHow did this provision become so popular among Republicans?\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 2 million Americans aged 19-25 gained new coverage because of the under-26 provision."}
