The deadline is Feb. 15. Credit: Calvin Mattheis\n\nBy of the\n\nRoughly two weeks remain to sign up for health insurance on the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act, and this year the penalty for not having coverage will have a bit more bite.\n\nThe minimum penalty will be $325, up from $95 for last year, and most people will face higher penalties.\n\nThe deadline to sign up for coverage is Feb. 15, and a slew of events are planned statewide to help people pick a health plan.\n\nThey include events on what is being billed as \"Super Saturday\" this week.\n\n\"This is the last big push to get as many people enrolled in coverage as possible,\" said Heather Dummer Combs, project manager for the Milwaukee Enrollment Network, a coalition of organizations.\n\nMore than 177,000 people in the state, including an estimated 27,000 people in Milwaukee County, had bought health plans sold on the marketplace or been automatically re-enrolled in a plan as of mid-January.\n\nAbout 130,000 people in Wisconsin signed up for coverage last year.\n\nNationally, an estimated 9.6 million people had picked a plan or been automatically re-enrolled as of Jan. 21.\n\nIn all, 22 events are planned between now and Feb. 15 in Milwaukee County, Combs said.\n\nPeople can get information on the events and organizations that are helping people sign up for coverage by calling 211, Combs said.\n\nThey also can contact an insurance agent or broker who is certified to help people shop for health plans. Thirty-seven agents and brokers in the Milwaukee area, for instance, are accepting referrals from the Milwaukee Enrollment Network.\n\nCombs expects a burst of sign-ups \u2014 similar to last year \u2014 near the deadline.\n\n\"It is part of people's nature to wait to the last minute,\" she said. \"There will be a flurry of activity. People are going to have to be patient.\"\n\nThis year's open-enrollment period has seen none of the chaos of the first year, but there have been glitches, such as incorrect information being given to insurance companies.\n\nTodd Catlin, owner of Transition Health Benefits in Brookfield, said the open enrollment period needs to be lengthened.\n\n\"There is not enough time to ensure that everyone gets accurate information,\" Catlin said.\n\nMost people who buy health insurance for themselves and their families \u2014 as opposed to getting coverage through an employer \u2014 can sign up for coverage only during the annual open-enrollment period.\n\nPeople who don't have health insurance this year will face a penalty of $325 or 2% of income above the tax filing threshold of $10,150 for an individual and $20,300 for a married couple filing jointly.\n\nThe penalty for last year was $95 or 1% of income.\n\nPeople don't get hit with the penalty until they file their taxes. That will the first time some people learn of the penalty.\n\nThat eventually will change.\n\n\"As with anything, it takes time to set in,\" said Danielle Coterel of Covering Kids & Families, one of the organizations involved in helping people sign up for coverage.\n\nAnd more health plans are available in the Milwaukee area.\n\n\"Chances are pretty good that you can find a plan that's affordable \u2014 which is great news,\" Combs said.\n\nIndividuals and families with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty threshold \u2014 $46,680 for an individual and $95,400 for a family of four this year \u2014 who are not offered affordable health insurance from an employer are eligible for tax credits to subsidize the cost of the health plans.\n\nAbout 90% of the people in Wisconsin who have signed up for coverage have been eligible for subsidies. And those who don't sign up for coverage will pay a penalty.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Final push underway for Obamacare sign-up", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/final-push-under-way-for-obamacare-sign-up-b99435576z1-290268911.html", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99435576z.1_20150129205355_000_g989o7ea.1-0.jpg", "height": 1082}, "type": "article", "description": "Roughly two weeks remain to sign up for a health insurance on the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act, and the penalty for not having coverage this year will have a bit more of a bite.", "title": "Final push underway for health insurance sign-up"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99435576z.1_20150129205355_000_g989o7ea.1-0.jpg", "description": "Roughly two weeks remain to sign up for a health insurance on the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act, and the penalty for not having coverage this year will have a bit more of a bite.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Final push underway for Obamacare sign-up"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3492\"", "article_summary": "Dan Monahan (right) helps Ivan Hernandez of Milwaukee sign up for Affordable Care Act insurance coverage last month at Centro Hispano High School in Milwaukee.\nThey also can contact an insurance agent or broker who is certified to help people shop for health plans.\nAnd more health plans are available in the Milwaukee area.\nPeople can get information on the events and organizations that are helping people sign up for coverage by calling 211, Combs said.\nIn all, 22 events are planned between now and Feb. 15 in Milwaukee County, Combs said."}
