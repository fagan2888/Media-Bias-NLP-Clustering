Or, preferably, better.\n\nThe fight is history, you realize. Done. Finito. Yesterday\u2019s news.\n\nEugene Robinson writes a twice-a-week column on politics and culture, contributes to the PostPartisan blog, and hosts a weekly online chat with readers. In a three-decade career at The Post, Robinson has been city hall reporter, city editor, foreign correspondent in Buenos Aires and London, foreign editor, and assistant managing editor in charge of the paper\u2019s Style section.

That was when an estimated 6 million uninsured Americans received coverage through expanded Medicaid eligibility or the federal and state health insurance exchanges. Obamacare is now a fait accompli; nobody is going to take this coverage away.\n\nThere may be more huffing, puffing and symbolic attempts at repeal by Republicans in Congress. There may be continued resistance and sabotage by Republican governors and GOP-controlled state legislatures. But the whole context has changed.\n\nNow, officials in states that refused to participate in Medicaid expansion will have to explain why so many of their constituents \u2014 about 5 million nationwide \u2014 remain uninsured when they could have qualified for coverage. More than 1 million of these needlessly uninsured Americans live in Texas, which is targeted by Democrats as ripe for inroads because of its rapidly changing demographics. Will Gov. Rick Perry (R) be forced to reconsider his Obamacare rejectionism? Or will he ultimately be remembered for speeding the state\u2019s transition from red to blue?\n\n1 of 9 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The next Democratic leaders?

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts The former Harvard professor\u2019s staunch populism on issues ranging from financial regulation to expanding Social Security has made her a darling of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Though she insists she is not running for president in 2016 , many liberals hope she will provide a more progressive alternative to Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, insurance costs and benefits in states that refused to set up their own exchanges will be compared with those in states that did. There will be questions about how the new law is performing \u2014 but no one will be able to pretend it does not exist.\n\nAnd we will surely hear more stories about individuals taking advantage of the law\u2019s consumer benefits, especially the fact that preexisting conditions can no longer be used to deny coverage. This is life-changing for insurance seekers who suffer from chronic illnesses such as diabetes or who have survived cancer.\n\nOpponents of the law can hardly advocate going back to a system in which those who really need insurance can\u2019t get it. What they can do, and surely will, is make lots of noise by pretending that any problem with anyone\u2019s health insurance is due to the Affordable Care Act. Before Obamacare, millions of Americans had their policies canceled by the insurance companies every year. Millions more had their premiums raised, their coverage reduced or both. Now when these things happen, critics will try to blame the new law.\n\nIncreasingly, though, the GOP will sound foolish and irrelevant if it continues to put all of its eggs in the \u201crepeal and replace\u201d basket. The problem is that the Affordable Care Act is a set of free-market reforms based on ideas developed in conservative think tanks. Republicans who want to repeal Obamacare would have to replace it with something suspiciously similar.\n\nIf Republicans in Congress would work with the administration to make technical corrections to the Affordable Care Act, they could claim a victory of sorts: Obama gave you this mess and we cleaned it up. But after demonizing the program \u2014 and the president \u2014 for so long, the party has painted itself into a corner.\n\nNote to the GOP: \u201cWe refuse, under any circumstances, to make the law work better for the citizens we represent\u201d is perhaps not the ideal campaign slogan for the midterm election.\n\nThe real problem with the ACA, and let\u2019s be honest, is that it doesn\u2019t go far enough. The decision to work within the existing framework of private, for-profit insurance companies meant building a tremendously complicated new system that still doesn\u2019t quite get the job done: Even if all the states were fully participating, only about 30 million of the 48 million uninsured would be covered.\n\n1 of 11 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 10 myths about Obama (that people actually believe) View Photos We\u2019ve all heard them: Misinformation about President Obama has a penchant for spreading like wildfire.

Win McNamee/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nBut Obamacare does establish the principle that health care is a right, not a privilege \u2014 and that this is true not just for children, the elderly and the poor but for all Americans.\n\nThroughout the nation\u2019s history, it has taken long, hard work to win universal recognition of what we consider our basic rights. Perhaps future legislation will expand and streamline the ACA reforms until everyone is covered. Or perhaps we\u2019ll move toward a single-payer system, possibly by expanding Medicare and Medicaid until they meet in the middle.\n\nI don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll get there, but we\u2019re now on the road to universal health care. There\u2019s no turning back.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
