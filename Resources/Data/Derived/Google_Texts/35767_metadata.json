Too bad the hard evidence to suggest doctors near retirement age are calling it quits by Sept. 30 to avoid the switch to ICD-10 on Oct. 1 is hard to find.\n\nOne recruiter anecdotally said he knows of three physicians in a practice in Louisiana who are retiring early rather than face what they perceive as the cost of implementation and payment disruption from ICD-10.\n\nBut the American Medical Association said it has no such information, even as it points to the cost and additional staffing needed to implement what it calls \u201ca massive administrative and financial undertaking\u201d to prepare for the coding change.\n\nICD-10 will result in a five-fold increase in the number of diagnosis codes, from the current 13,000 to 68,000, the AMA said.\n\nCheris Craig, chief administrative officer for the Urology of Greater Atlanta, said that despite trying to make the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 as easy as possible for physicians, she knows of at least one doctor who has decided not to deal with it.\n\n\u201cOne physician is planning on it so much he\u2019s retiring the day before,\u201d Craig said.\n\nNot all doctors are against it.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard, it wasn\u2019t expensive, and it wasn\u2019t time-consuming,\u201d Dr. Edward Burke of Beyer Medical Group told a Subcommittee on Health in February.\n\nDuring that same hearing, heart surgeon and subcommittee member Rep. Larry Buschon, R-IN, said physicians have reason to worry about being reimbursed for procedures under the new codes.\n\n\u201cIn the operating room \u2026 you\u2019re not going to be looking through a code book,\u201d Buschon said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to deny the payment.\u201d\n\nThe physician shortage is expected to grow, with the demand exceeding supply by 46,000 to 90,000 doctors by 2024, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nJason Farr, vice president of recruiting for The Medicus Group, said he\u2019s already dealing with the shortage.\n\n[Also: ICD-10 passes end-to-end testing]\n\nHe recently spoke to a hospital administrator in Louisiana who, when Farr asked him about what to expect for 2015, was told, \u201c\u2018We may be looking at additional things on top of (the shortage),\u2019\u201d Farr said based on info he\u2019s heard second hand.\n\nThe administrator told him three physicians were retiring early because they were concerned with the cost and payment disruption caused by ICD-10, Farr said.\n\n\u201c\u2019We\u2019re already thinking of retiring in a few years,\u2019\u201d Farr said the administrator heard from the doctors. \u201c\u2019Instead, we\u2019re going to close up shop early.\u2019\u201d\n\n[Also: 6 tips for preparing for ICD-10]\n\nThe physicians were about five to eight years from retirement, all senior partners who had a great practice, Farr said.\n\nThose physicians figured the cost of additional staffing to convert to ICD-10 would be $14,000 to $68,000. Add in training, software upgrades and payment disruption over unpaid reimbursements, and the cost would increase to about $100,000, Farr said the doctors estimated.\n\nFarr is now searching for three replacements. About half of his searches are due to retirements, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already a physician market that is transitioning from private practice to hospital-employed,\u201d Farr said. \u201cPrivate practices have to absorb this (ICD-10 cost) directly. They feel that. Hospital-employed physicians have not near the same headaches because they\u2019re employed by the hospital.\u201d\n\nFarr said that in his job, he always asks the reason for the recruitment. He\u2019s expecting to hear about more searches due to ICD-10.\n\n\u201cSome physicians are on the fence about it, this just pushes them over,\u201d Farr said. \u201cThis is the last drop in an already full cup.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/icd-10-doctor-exodus-fact-or-fiction", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/busy-doctors-feature_4.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Anecdotal evidence suggests the coding shift might chase physicians into retirement.", "title": "The ICD-10 doctor exodus: Fact or fiction?"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/busy-doctors-feature_4.gif"}, "description": "Anecdotal evidence suggests the coding shift might chase physicians into retirement.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The ICD-10 doctor exodus: Fact or fiction?"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If the rumors are true, ICD-10 is not going to solve the physician shortage.
