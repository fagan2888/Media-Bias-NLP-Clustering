He got out of the wrecked vehicle and ran from the scene, but officers found him within 15 minutes in the 4900 block of Scranton Street, where witnesses identified him as the suspect, police said.\n\nAn officer wrote in the report that Gilbert mumbled and stammered, and had poor balance and bloodshot eyes while having his blood drawn at Denver Health Medical Center. He told police he suffered a back injury in the crash.\n\nA judge on Thursday held Gilbert, of Park Hill, in the Downtown Denver Detention Center on $50,000 bond.\n\nThe crash was Gilbert\u2019s latest interaction with police, court records show. He has a criminal history that spans nearly a decade, including a 1996 arrest by Aurora police for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, first-degree assault and criminal conspiracy.\n\nCourt records show he was sentenced to 10 years in state prison stemming from those charges.\n\nIn 2004, he was cited in Denver for driving under restraint and a series of other traffic offenses that were later dismissed.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Driver in Montbello hit-and-run smelled of alcohol and pot, police say", "title": "Driver in Montbello hit-and-run smelled of alcohol and pot, police say", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/26/driver-in-montbello-hit-and-run-smelled-of-alcohol-and-pot-police-say/", "image": {"width": 315, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225__2013-12-25-14_30_48-GILBERT-JOHNNY-CEPHUS-Image-Zoomp1-1.jpg", "height": 366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225__2013-12-25-14_30_48-GILBERT-JOHNNY-CEPHUS-Image-Zoomp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-26T13:16:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T07:45:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02ee\"", "article_summary": "A man jailed in connection to a deadly Christmas-morning crash in Montbello slurred his words and reeked of alcohol and marijuana when Denver officers arrested him, according to a police report released Thursday.\nIn 2004, he was cited in Denver for driving under restraint and a series of other traffic offenses that were later dismissed.\nA judge on Thursday held Gilbert, of Park Hill, in the Downtown Denver Detention Center on $50,000 bond.\nAmong them was a 6-year-old girl, Daniela Medina-Gaytan, who police said suffered skull fractures and other serious injuries.\nAn officer wrote in the report that Gilbert mumbled and stammered, and had poor balance and bloodshot eyes while having his blood drawn at Denver Health Medical Center."}
