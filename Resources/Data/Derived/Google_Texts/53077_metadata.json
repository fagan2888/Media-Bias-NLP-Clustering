Following news reports of certain remarks made by Dr. Gruber, the administration renegotiated the contract with Dr. Gruber in November 2014. Subsequent public records requests yielded invoices and other documents that raised questions about Dr. Gruber\u2019s billing practices and the State\u2019s monitoring and enforcement of particular contract provisions.\u201d\n\nTranslation, there\u2019s so little back-up the Auditor can\u2019t decide who did what, if any, work.\n\nAll told, Gruber has billed the State of Vermont $290,000 for work performed on his contract. $150,000 of this billing is for work he says was performed by research assistants, $140,000 is for work he performed himself.\n\nTo date, the State of Vermont has paid Gruber $160,000\u2013$80,000 for work he performed, and $80,000 for work he says research assistants performed.\n\nBut in his memo released today, Vermont State Auditor Hoffer says Gruber had only a single research assistant, not several. In addition, that research assistant was an employee of Gruber\u2019s who was paid $32,000 for work perfomed in 2014, according to a W-2 Gruber provided to Hoffer.\n\nGruber also admitted to Hoffer that his research assistant was paid for work conducted other projects in addition to the Vermont project, reports Leahy.\n\n[W]hen asked for documentation, Dr. Gruber provided a W-2 for his sole RA for the Vermont contract, which means he was an employee. Dr. Gruber stated that he relies upon a payroll service to handle these issues because they are \u201coutside [his] area of expertise,\u201d said Vermont State Auditor Hoffer.\n\nIf all the payments made by Gruber to his research assistant were totally dedicated to work on the Vermont contract, Gruber himself apparently pocketed at least $48,000 of the $80,000 the state of Vermont has already paid him for work he says was performed by his research assistants.\n\nTo make matters worse for Gruber, reports Michael Patrick Leahy, he has submitted outstanding bills requesting an additional $50,000 of payment for work performed by his sole research assistant on the Vermont contract. Adding that to the $20,000 previously billed but not yet paid, Gruber is asking to be paid an additional $70,000 for work he says was performed by his research assistants.\n\nThe findings reported in Hoffer\u2019s memo appear to support comments made in January by Darcie Johnston, head of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, who noted that Gruber\u2019s failure to \u201cprovide any evidence that the $80,000 he\u2019s been paid by the State of Vermont for 800 hours of work performed by unidentified research assistants\u201d may have been \u201cphantom billing.\u201d\n\nNow it looks like State Auditor Doug Hoffer\u2019s report has confirmed Darcie Johnston\u2019s suspicions.\n\nOn his website Hoffer said this about the job of the State Auditor, \u201cSometimes this type of work angers powerful interests. After all, bureaucrats and special interests don\u2019t like to read that their programs may be ineffective and a waste of taxpayer money. Yet asking difficult questions and speaking uncomfortable truths are exactly the tasks of the state Auditor.\u201d\n\nVermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer is a model for elected public officials in this dangerous time when truth, especially in Washington, has become such a malleable thing and government is often of the insiders, by the insiders, and for the insiders. Now let\u2019s hope that Vermont Attorney General William H. Sorrell has that same kind of integrity and will pursue the ultimate insider, Jonathan Gruber, to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nClick this link to read Michael Patrick Leahy\u2019s latest on the Jonathan Gruber billing scandal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Is Jonathan Gruber Heading For Jail?"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda15\"", "article_summary": "Following news reports of certain remarks made by Dr. Gruber, the administration renegotiated the contract with Dr. Gruber in November 2014.\nBut in his memo released today, Vermont State Auditor Hoffer says Gruber had only a single research assistant, not several.\n[W]hen asked for documentation, Dr. Gruber provided a W-2 for his sole RA for the Vermont contract, which means he was an employee.\nDr. Gruber stated that he relies upon a payroll service to handle these issues because they are \u201coutside [his] area of expertise,\u201d said Vermont State Auditor Hoffer.\nTo date, the State of Vermont has paid Gruber $160,000\u2013$80,000 for work he performed, and $80,000 for work he says research assistants performed."}
