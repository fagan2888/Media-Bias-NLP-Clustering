But some in the policy community wondered if there might be a little more to it \u2014 and suggested that, whatever Walmart\u2019s motives may be, the company\u2019s move could sway the national debate.\n\nRelated: The Real Reason Walmart Is Raising Worker Pay\n\nDaniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who has argued against increases in the minimum wage in the past, said that in general, a company\u2019s decisions about what to pay its workers ought to be made without government interference. In this case, he said, the company\u2019s decision may be based on more than just business factors: \u201cNormally I would say that what private companies are paying their workers should be totally irrelevant to the public policy process, but I suppose in this case it may be there is some PR-type benefit that Walmart expects to get.\u201d\n\nAnother possibility, Mitchell added, is that the company believes it is in a better position than its competitors to absorb a wage increase, and will become a public advocate for a federally mandated increase. \u201cOne would hope they wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut private companies have in the past used government coercion to screw over their competitors.\u201d\n\nRelated: Walmart Pay Raise \u2013 A Fix for Past Mistakes\n\nJared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted that the economic argument for the move isn\u2019t completely clear. \u201cI know people are viewing it as signal of tightening job market but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite right,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the motivator, why commit to wage increases years down the road as opposed to just bumping up current wage offers?\u201d Walmart executives said the hike, which will cost $1 billion a year, would boost worker morale and improve customers\u2019 shopping experience, translating to long-term gains for the company.\n\nAdvocates of raising the minimum wage, who might have been expected to cheer the announcement, were underwhelmed. \u201cWal-Mart\u2019s statement that it will be raising wages for many of its workers is obviously welcome on its face,\u201d said Economic Policy Institute Research Director Josh Bivens in a statement. \u201cYet the excitement generated by this announcement really just highlights how beaten down expectations about wage-growth in the U.S. economy have become.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about this: wages rising should be the norm in the American economy and should happen all the time without fanfare. The fact that an announcement that some workers in one company might get a raise is treated as a newsworthy blockbuster shows just how far we have to go before we have an economy that is genuinely working for most Americans.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Economic Forecast Relies on Rosy Assumptions\n\nBivens also said that until there is evidence that Walmart workers\u2019 wages will continue to at least keep pace with inflation, there is little reason to celebrate.\n\nOthers, like Bernstein, pointed out that the move will likely have important implications for the ongoing debate about the federal minimum wage.\n\n\u201cGiven Congressional gridlock, we\u2019ve already seen states take matters into their own hands,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have a large, low-wage employer raising their own minimum wage. While I still think the federal increase is important, especially in the South where fewer states have acted, it will be less so if other states and firms continue to take such actions on their own.\u201d\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Mitchell said the move could wind up blunting calls for the federally mandated increase, and pointed out that the vast majority of workers already earn more than the minimum and that employers will raise wages when business conditions merit such a move. \u201cI believe the market works,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: 5 Government Reforms that Could Save Billions\n\nOne way or another, workers across America hope Walmart\u2019s move signals the start of a trend that will see others get raises soon, too.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The retail giant Walmart announced Thursday that it would be raising the wage of its lowest-paid workers to $10.00 per hour by next year, throwing the debate over a federally mandated minimum wage increase on its head.", "title": "Walmart Changes the Debate on Minimum Wage", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Walmart-Changes-Debate-Minimum-Wage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04102012_Supermarket_Walmart_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Walmart-Changes-Debate-Minimum-Wage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/04102012_Supermarket_Walmart_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The retail giant Walmart announced Thursday that it would be raising the wage of its lowest-paid workers to $10.00 per hour by next year, throwing the debate over a federally mandated minimum wage increase on its head.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff94\"", "article_summary": "Others, like Bernstein, pointed out that the move will likely have important implications for the ongoing debate about the federal minimum wage.\nAdvocates of raising the minimum wage, who might have been expected to cheer the announcement, were underwhelmed.\n\u201cNow we have a large, low-wage employer raising their own minimum wage.\nThe retail behemoth said that it was raising wages in order to attract and retain good workers, despite the fact that it would take a short-term hit to its financial bottom line.\nRelated: The Real Reason Walmart Is Raising Worker PayDaniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who has argued against increases in the minimum wage in the past, said that in general, a company\u2019s decisions about what to pay its workers ought to be made without government interference."}
