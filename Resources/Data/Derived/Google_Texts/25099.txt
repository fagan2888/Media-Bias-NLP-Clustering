House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)

(CNSNews.com) – At a Capitol Hill press conference Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the GOP of obsessing about taking away “life-saving preventative care” from millions of women with their vote Wednesday to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider.



“Republicans should, a New Year’s resolution would be to quit their anti-women health obsession for the New Year,” Pelosi said.





The House voted 240-181Wednesday to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal key provisions of Obamacare, sending the bill to the president’s desk.

“For their first act of 2015, Republicans decided to renew their attack on women’s health. With yesterday’s reconciliation bill, Republicans once again tried to take family planning life-saving preventive care away from millions of American women. It is the House GOP’s 11th vote to attack women’s health in 114th Congress,” Pelosi said.



She called the Republican bill to defund Planned Parenthood “an insult to the intelligence and judgment of women” as well as “a waste of time and taxpayer dollars.”



“The president will veto the bill. Democrats will sustain the president’s veto,” Pelosi noted.



“Hard-working Americans would have hoped” that the first legislation of the Republican Congress would be aimed at “job creation,” Pelosi said. “Republicans should, a New Year’s resolution would be to quit their anti-women health obsession for the New Year.”
