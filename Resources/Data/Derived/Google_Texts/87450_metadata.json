In Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, Rebecca Friedrichs, a public school teacher in Orange County, along with nine other teachers and the Christian Educators Association, filed a suit objecting to the agency, or \u201cfair share,\u201d fees they\u2019re required to pay to the CTA.\n\nAs it currently stands, California teachers cannot be forced to join the CTA, which the Supreme Court has ruled would violate the freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment. But even those teachers who decline union membership must still pay a fee to cover the cost of \u201ccollective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment purposes,\u201d a compromise established in 1977 by a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the similar-looking Abood v. Detroit Board of Education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe idea is that because all public employees benefit from their union\u2019s negotiations for, say, higher wages and better working conditions, they should all pay for it, regardless of how they feel about the union philosophically or politically. The non-union teachers still pay \u201cforced dues\u201d of about $850, or two-thirds the cost of a full union membership. The other third goes to the lobbying arm of the union, which tends to favor Democratic candidates overwhelmingly.\n\nOver the past few years, Justice Samuel Alito has strongly signaled that he\u2019d like to see Abood overturned, and the right-wing Center for Individual Rights seems to have hand-crafted this latest case to his specifications. The problem with forced dues, the CIR argues, is that you can\u2019t so cleanly separate the overt political lobbying from the union\u2019s other functions:\n\nRequiring teachers to pay these \u201cagency fees\u201d assumes that collective bargaining is non-political. But bargaining with local governments is inherently political. Whether the union is negotiating for specific class sizes or pressing a local government to spend tax dollars on teacher pensions rather than on building parks, the union\u2019s negotiating positions embody political choices that are often controversial.\n\nFriedrichs and her co-plaintiffs\u2014represented by the same lawyer who brought the most recent challenge to Obamacare\u2014are arguing that the fair-share requirement is a violation of their First Amendment rights, since they\u2019re being forced to fund causes they may not support, everything from tenure protections to gun control. (A side issue is that the small minority of nonmembers\u2014in California, less than 10 percent of the state\u2019s roughly 300,000 teachers\u2014miss out on some major frills, like life and disability insurance and a vote in union elections.)\n\nSo what\u2019s at stake here for education? If the court finds that teachers no longer have to pay the fair-share fees, as many worried unions fear that it will, the union (and other public-sector unions like it all over the country) will lose a great deal of its negotiating leverage and potentially wither into insignificance, especially since many current union members may decide to stop paying dues. After all, the cost difference between a full membership and a fair-share fee is relatively minor, and the difference between a full membership and zero is not.\n\nIf the court sides with the plaintiffs, California will become a right-to-work state for teachers. That usually translates to diminished job security, fewer benefits, and lower wages. Forty-three kids in your second-grade classroom? Too bad. Out of school supplies and it\u2019s only October?
