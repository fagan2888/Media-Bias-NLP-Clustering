That\u2019s what matters,\u201d crew chief Cole Pearn said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done on Saturday you go back and judge where you are, you look at where you are in compared to everybody else. It\u2019s more judging. We had the best last run of anybody. That\u2019s a good sign.\u201d\n\nAfter a short pause, Pearn added: \u201cThat makes you feel like you can go kick some tail tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe fifth of 10 Chase races begins at 12:15 p.m. MDT. A win guarantees advancement to the Elite Eight for the three-race stint beginning Nov. 1 at Martinsville, Va.\n\nThe 12-car playoff field will remain intact through next weekend\u2019s race at Talladega, Ala.\n\nTruex qualified seventh on Friday \u2014 despite learning afterward that a major setting on the car was incorrect \u2014 and was sixth quickest Saturday morning and 10th in the ensuing practice. Truex ran a session-most 27 laps in the last practice and became the dominant car.\n\n\u201cWe had a good practice today, and really, it\u2019s been a good weekend,\u201d Truex said. \u201d We felt we should have qualified a little better (Friday) but we feel really good about where we\u2019re at with the car right now.\n\n\u201cTypically, you want to end practice the best you\u2019ve been all weekend, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. That\u2019s always a great feeling going into the race. The guys have done a good job and we\u2019ll see what tomorrow brings.\u201d\n\nPearn, who is from London, Ontario, attended Friday night\u2019s Game 1 of the American League Championship Series between his beloved Blue Jays against the Kansas City Royals. Pearn came back to his downtown hotel disappointed, along with crew member Ryan Kelly, who is also from London, and Pearn\u2019s father.\n\nThe Royals won 5-0. Pearn and company were not able to get to Saturday afternoon\u2019s Game 2 at Kauffman Stadium. They had team meetings and sponsorship obligations \u2014 and Pearn undoubtedly needed to have a long phone conversation with Barney Visser, the Cherry Hills resident who will fly in for Sunday\u2019s race.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Furniture Row Racing of Denver is looking good at Kansas Speedway", "title": "Furniture Row Racing of Denver is looking good at Kansas Speedway", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/17/furniture-row-racing-of-denver-is-looking-good-at-kansas-speedway/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__SP17FURNITUREROWRACING_AC18766xp1.jpg", "height": 494}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__SP17FURNITUREROWRACING_AC18766xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T15:46:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T07:47:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe had a good practice today, and really, it\u2019s been a good weekend,\u201d Truex said.\nKANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 Denver\u2019s Furniture Row Racing is right where it wants to be heading into Sunday\u2019s Chase for the Championship race at Kansas Speedway.\n\u201cTypically, you want to end practice the best you\u2019ve been all weekend, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\nThey had team meetings and sponsorship obligations \u2014 and Pearn undoubtedly needed to have a long phone conversation with Barney Visser, the Cherry Hills resident who will fly in for Sunday\u2019s race.\n\u201d We felt we should have qualified a little better (Friday) but we feel really good about where we\u2019re at with the car right now."}
