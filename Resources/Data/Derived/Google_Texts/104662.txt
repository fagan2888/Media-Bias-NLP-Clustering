More professional athletes were wearing “I Can’t Breathe” messages Sunday in protest of a grand jury ruling not to indict an officer in the death of a New York man.

Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose wore the message on his T-shirt during warmups before Saturday night’s home game.

Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush and Cleveland Browns cornerback Johnson Bademosi warmed up in shirts with the message before NFL games Sunday. St. Louis Rams offensive lineman Davin Joseph wore the message on his cleats.

The slogan refers to Eric Garner, who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold while he was being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury decided Wednesday it would not indict the officer. A video of the arrest showed Garner gasping, “I can’t breathe.”
