Most of the patients who rely on these health centers are low-income and uninsured and would struggle to get that care elsewhere. Others may have private insurance, but prefer the confidentiality of the family planning network.\n\nClare Coleman, the president and CEO of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, which represents Title X providers, is worried about being able to reach the Americans who need those services the most.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now in the fifth year where the network hasn\u2019t seen any increase in service dollars \u2014 there\u2019s no new money to provide health services,\u201d Coleman told ThinkProgress. \u201cSo now you\u2019ve got a system that\u2019s dropped a significant number of patients.\u201d\n\nAccording to the federal government\u2019s latest report on the Title X network, which was released this week, the program\u2019s clinics served about 206,000 fewer patients in 2013 compared to the year before. There were 21 fewer service sites available to visit. Since 2010, more than 670,000 patients have dropped out of the system.\n\nWe don\u2019t have clear data about where exactly those people are going. It\u2019s possible that some of them gained new coverage under the health reform law and have since been absorbed into the private insurance market. It\u2019s also possible that recent shifts in the field of reproductive health \u2014 more women are opting for long-acting forms of birth control, and women have also been instructed to get Pap smears less frequently \u2014 have resulted in fewer regular appointments at Title X clinics.\n\nBut it\u2019s also likely that many of those patients are simply unable to get the health services they need because the Title X network isn\u2019t able to accommodate them.\n\nAccording to research from the Guttmacher Institute, about 20 million women in the United States need access to publicly funded contraception. Coleman says that Title X clinics have historically only been able to meet about a third of that need. Because it\u2019s a discretionary program, it often gets trimmed when lawmakers are trying to figure out how to reduce spending. As more Americans slipped into poverty after the recent economic recession, Title X\u2019s patient load increased, but its budget didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe Title X program is woefully underfunded,\u201d Kinsey Hasstedt, a public policy associate at Guttmacher, told ThinkProgress. \u201cOn the whole it certainly has not grown as it should to keep up with the demands for services.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Title X has also been caught up in politics. As part of a crusade against abortion providers, Congress attempted to wholly defund the program in 2011. Although that effort was unsuccessful, abortion opponents simply took the fight to the states, where it\u2019s gained more traction. Over the past three years, states like New Jersey, Montana, Texas, and Maine have all slashed family planning funding.\n\nThose funding cuts have forced some publicly funded clinics to close, or significantly cut back on their hours and services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly felt the impact of flat funding, and we\u2019ve actually experienced some cuts at the state level as well. There have been some tough decisions we\u2019ve had to make,\u201d Jennifer Thibodeau, the director of communications and marketing for Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics across the state, told ThinkProgress.\n\nThibodeau\u2019s clinics have reduced the number of hours that nurse practitioners are available to meet with patients, as well as lowered the number of different birth control pill options that patients can choose from. They\u2019ve tried to ease the direct impact on the population they serve by increasing options for electronic communication, and offering some consultations over the phone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to be really creative and innovative so it\u2019s not affecting patients as much as it could be,\u201d Thibodeau said. In the absence of sufficient Title X funding, her group has also been seeking grant money and private donations.\n\nAlthough Title X\u2019s budget has recently been on the chopping block, Guttmacher\u2019s research has actually shown that the program is one of the best investments that lawmakers can make. U.S. taxpayers save $7 for every dollar the government spends on family planning, largely because the care provided at publicly funded family planning clinics can help prevent millions of unplanned pregnancies.\n\nEven some GOP leaders recognize the financial benefits of Title X. Earlier this year, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI)\u2019s audit of federal anti-poverty programs conceded that the program is \u201cmoderately effective,\u201d concluding that the low-income women who rely on those clinics \u201chave significantly greater odds of receiving contraceptive services and/or care for sexually transmitted diseases\u201d than the women who rely on private physicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really staggering that instead of investing money into this program, Congress has of late been cutting it,\u201d Hasstedt said.\n\nTexas provides a particularly dramatic example of what can happen when states stop investing in family planning. There, anti-abortion lawmakers\u2019 battle against Planned Parenthood has upended the entire family planning landscape over the past two years, leaving low-income and rural women struggling to get the basic care they need. The National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health has recently been compiling data on the health care crisis, collecting stories from women who have been waiting for years to afford mammograms after finding lumps in their breasts, or have been forced to stop using their birth control because they can\u2019t spare the extra money for it.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that could help us turn this situation around is to stop attacking the provider networks \u2014 leave them alone and let them rebuild their systems,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cWe need to attack this fallacy that everyone is going to have insurance and the safety net doesn\u2019t need to survive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The safety net is in crisis.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The safety net is in crisis.", "title": "The Devastating Consequences Of Chipping Away At Family Planning Programs", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/18/3605170/family-planning-funding-cuts/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_212400655.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The safety net is in crisis.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_212400655-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Devastating Consequences Of Chipping Away At Family Planning Programs", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_212400655.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_212400655.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-18T12:02:18+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37a0\"", "article_summary": "Health The Devastating Consequences Of Chipping Away At Family Planning Programs CREDIT: ShutterstockThe federally funded family planning clinics that are supposed to offer a safety net for low-income Americans are in crisis.\nU.S. taxpayers save $7 for every dollar the government spends on family planning, largely because the care provided at publicly funded family planning clinics can help prevent millions of unplanned pregnancies.\nOver the past three years, states like New Jersey, Montana, Texas, and Maine have all slashed family planning funding.\nOthers may have private insurance, but prefer the confidentiality of the family planning network.\nTexas provides a particularly dramatic example of what can happen when states stop investing in family planning."}
