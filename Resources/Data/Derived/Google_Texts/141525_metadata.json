At least nine Democratic senators are lining up with Republicans looking for big spending and tax cuts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible negotiating position,\u201d said Warren Gunnels, senior policy advisor to Sen. Bernard Sanders, I-VT, who has been appointed to the 2013 federal budget conference committee, where the debate is taking shape.\n\n\u201cYou hear these people saying, \u2018We have to be the adults at the table and the Republicans don\u2019t negotiate. Aren\u2019t we reasonable?\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cA more reasonable position is a majority of Americans don\u2019t want Social Security, Medicare and Medicare cut at all. Why don\u2019t we have one political party represent what a majority of people want?\u201d\n\nOctober\u2019s government shutdown and threatened debt default was disruptive and hurt the economy. But what is emerging is an entirely different drama, one that could shape the quality of tens of millions of people\u2019s final decades. Most Americans do not have much in retirement savings and will live on Social Security now averaging $1,200 a month, and receive their healthcare under Medicare. Similarly, nearly two-thirds of Medicaid recipients are children from poor homes or adults with disabilities.\n\nThe National Journal, a leading conservative publication, did a nationwide poll in the first week of the shutdown and tilted its questions to try to show public support for the GOP\u2019s intransigence and for cutting entitlements. What it didn\u2019t put on its website but was buried in its results (see page 4) was that 76 percent said Social Security should be cut \u201cnot at all,\u201d as opposed to cut \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome.\u201d Eighty-one percent said Medicare should be cut \u201cnot at all.\u201d And 60 percent replied \u201cnot at all\u201d to cutting Medicaid. These results tracked two otherNational Journal polls done in 2012 and other national surveys.\n\nBut, as Sen. Sanders\u2019 policy aide noted, the mindset in too many Washington circles is taking a completely opposite view. You would expect corporate defenders among the GOP to do what they have been doing since the government reopened\u2014clamoring for cuts to social programs, as their rich benefactors don\u2019t need them, and cutting tax rates, which makes wealthy people and businesses even wealthier. That\u2019s what GOP leaders said; they\u2019ll end the across-the-board federal cuts known as the sequester if Democrats agree to future cuts in Social Security and Medicare.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid firmly said no to that. But a day after the government reopened, the nation\u2019s top Democrat, President Obama, spoke about the need to address \u201clong-term obligations that we have around things like Medicare and Social Security.\u201d The Senate Budget Committee chairwoman, Washington\u2019s Patty Murray, said \u201call issues are on the [negotiating] table.\u201d\n\nThe Senate\u2019s number-two top Democrat, Illinois\u2019 Dick Durban, later in the week told Fox News Sunday that \u201cSocial Security is going to run out of money in 20 years\u2026Medicare may run out of money in 10 years. Let\u2019s fix it now.\u201d Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told the same program, \u201cWe all know at the end of the day, Republicans are going to have to give on revenues, Democrats are going to have to give on entitlement reform.\u201d\n\nThe list of Democrats who are entering these negotiations enbracing the GOP\u2019s terms continues. There are at least nine in the Senate. California\u2019s Dianne Feinstein, Montana\u2019s Max Baucus, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, Delaware\u2019s Chris Coons and Tom Carper, and Colorado\u2019s Michael Bennett have all said they support cuts to entitlements in letters to constituents, proposed bills or statements made after the President\u2019s fiscal reform commission led by Eskine Bowles and Alan Simpson issued its 2010 report proposing capping or cutting entitlements while lowering or eliminating corporate taxes.\n\nNo wonder George Will, arguably the nation\u2019s leading right-wing commentator, also boasted on Fox News Sunday about the upcoming budget negotiation, saying, \u201cWe are now talking entirely in Republican terms, in Republican vocabulary after this so-called defeat\u2026 No taxes, how much is spending goung to be cut? The federal workforce is being cut, discretionary domestic spending is being cut\u2026\u201d And theWall Street Journal quickly capitalized on the division among Democrats with its own report, titled, \u201cBudget Discord Simmers Among Democrats.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why aren\u2019t these key lawmakers defending our retirement programs?", "title": "9 Democrats who are selling out on Social Security cuts", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Why aren\u2019t these key lawmakers defending our retirement programs?", "title": "9 Democrats who are selling out on Social Security cuts", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/26/sell_out_alert_9_democrats_already_caving_to_gop_on_social_security_cuts_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/social_security_cards.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why aren\u2019t these key lawmakers defending our retirement programs?", "title": "9 Democrats who are selling out on Social Security cuts", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/social_security_cards.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Congress, Democrats, healthcare, Republicans, Social Security", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09b8\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s what GOP leaders said; they\u2019ll end the across-the-board federal cuts known as the sequester if Democrats agree to future cuts in Social Security and Medicare.\n\u201cA more reasonable position is a majority of Americans don\u2019t want Social Security, Medicare and Medicare cut at all.\n\u201cYou hear these people saying, \u2018We have to be the adults at the table and the Republicans don\u2019t negotiate.\nMost Americans do not have much in retirement savings and will live on Social Security now averaging $1,200 a month, and receive their healthcare under Medicare.\nTopics: AlterNet, Congress, Democrats, healthcare, Republicans, Social Security, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThe next drama shaping up in Washington is one almost all Americans don\u2019t want\u2014cutting retirement benefits earned over a lifetime."}
