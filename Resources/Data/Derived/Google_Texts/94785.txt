Committee assignments for Senate Republicans were released Monday with only one change in committees for the two Texas senators.

Sen. Ted Cruz will serve on the Joint Economic Committee come January, leaving the Special Committee on Aging. He retained his positions on the Armed Services, Commerce, Judiciary, and Rules and Administration committees.

The Joint Economic Committee consists of 10 members from the House and Senate, with chairmanship swapping to the Senate for the upcoming Congress. The economy was the issue on which Cruz made a name for himself last year when he led a government shutdown in the name of defunding the Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare.” His tactics have put him at odds with some establishment members of his own party.

Sen. John Cornyn kept both of his current committee assignments on the Judiciary and Finance committees.

Committee members will elect chairs after all members are ratified.
