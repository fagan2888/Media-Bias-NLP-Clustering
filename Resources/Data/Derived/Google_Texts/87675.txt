Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) spoke at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, telling Republicans the secret to success.

"What I wanna talk to you all about this morning is how we win," Cruz said.

Cruz, who delivered the keynote address at last year's CPAC, said there's a choice for the GOP to make: Republicans can keep their heads down or "stand for principle."

"The Washington way is don't stand against Obamacare, don't stand against the debt ceiling, don't stand against nothin'," Cruz said.

Cruz said in recent years, Republicans have put their heads down and were "walloped."

"Of course, all of us remember President [Bob] Dole, President [John] McCain, President [Mitt] Romney," Cruz said.

Cruz noted all of those GOP presidential hopefuls were "good men" who just didn't stand up for Republican beliefs.

Cruz listed a number of goals the GOP should have, including stopping the "lawlessness" of President Barack Obama, expanding school choice, and, of course, repealing Obamacare.

"We need to repeal every single word of Obamacare," Cruz said. "When millions of Americans stood up last fall and said stop this train wreck... the Democrats said, the mainstream media said -- although I repeat myself -- they said, 'This is hopeless, don't you understand? Just move on, just accept it. You can't do anything to stop this.' Yes we can."
