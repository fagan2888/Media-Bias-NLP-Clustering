They may refuse to provide cake or flowers for gay weddings, or even to attend. They may pretend that teens won\u2019t do it if we just don\u2019t tell them how. They may adopt the Church Lady posture if anyone mentions sex that doesn\u2019t involve one man, one woman, the missionary position and a pulsing desire for more offspring.\n\nBut online search traffic from behind closed doors in Jesusland suggests that the bad, nasty, sexual impulses righteous believers are trying so hard to shut down may be their own. And if Google search patterns mean anything, they\u2019re not succeeding too well: studies consistently demonstrate that people in conservative religious states search for adult materials online far more often than people in blue states.\n\nEver since Freud first started publishing his theories, psychologists have had a fascination with what he called \u201cdefense mechanisms\u201c:\n\nDenial means simply refusing to acknowledge that some event or pattern is real.\n\nRepression involves pushing uncomfortable thoughts and feelings to the far recesses of the subconscious mind.\n\nReaction formation is saying or doing the opposite of what you really want but won\u2019t allow yourself to express.\n\nProjection means assuming that others share the impulses, feelings, and vices that you find unacceptable in yourself.\n\nFreud had a lot of ideas that haven\u2019t withstood the test of time or the scientific method, but defense mechanisms have stuck, in part because they are so useful for explaining some of humanities\u2019 more bizarre behaviors. Like, perhaps, the conservative obsession with controlling everyone else\u2019s sexual behavior.\n\nFor almost two centuries, what happened in the Bible Belt, sexually at least, stayed in the Bible Belt. Oh sure, there was the odd scandal involving a small-town preacher and the pretty young wife of a deacon or youth minister, or a big-name televangelist who, for example, asked male followers to get vasectomies and then examined their swollen willies. And there were the shocking-shocking-I-tell-you revelations of evangelical leaders feeling up young female interns or paying male call boys or even behaving like Catholic priests. But most people, for some reason, have had a hard time considering the possibility that conservative religion might actually augment sexual obsessions rather than icing them, that there might be a pattern of correlation between authoritarian religion, sexual repression, and sneaky sex.\n\nEnter the Internet, where everything is secret\u2014or not.\n\nWhatever You Have Said in the Dark Will Be Heard in the Light (Luke 12:3)\n\nIn October, two Toronto researchers, Cara MacInnis and Gordon Hodson, published a study in which they used Google Trends to analyze porn searches. Individual search records are protected by privacy laws, but it is possible to compare the popularity of search terms across various regions or states, which is what they did.\n\nSpecifically, MacInnis and Hodson linked state level information from Gallup polls asking about religious and political attitudes together with a variety of sex and porn-related search terms. Their study design involves a number of different comparisons and it considered the effects of other variables like poverty and population. Based on related research, they hypothesized that states with higher levels of religiosity and conservatism would have higher rates of search for sexual content.\n\nThey made this prediction, and the data bore it out. More religiosity and conservatism meant more searches on words like sex, gay sex, gay porn, or sex images.\n\nMacInnis and Hodson caution that aggregate data can\u2019t be used to draw conclusions about individuals. Also, their research is open to alternative interpretations: Maybe lonely liberals in red states are the ones searching for erotica online. But their findings are in keeping with information from other sources: Business professor Benjamin Edelman at Harvard found that states with more traditional views of sex and gender have higher rates of paid porn subscriptions\u2014meaning people who are willing to put porn on a credit card.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Studies indicate people in religious states are more likely to search for adult materials online.
