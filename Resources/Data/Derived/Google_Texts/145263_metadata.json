Hippocrates said, \u201cLet food be thy medicine and medicine thy food.\u201d It would appear that the healthcare industry may have finally caught on.\n\n\u201c[Preventative care] isn\u2019t a new idea \u2013 it\u2019s just that it\u2019s been very hard to do over the years,\u201d said Nancy Steiger, president of hospital services for the PeaceHealth Columbia Network. \u201cIn fact, I wrote a nursing textbook on this in 1985, but nobody could figure out how to make this work. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s coming into its own now in healthcare and part of it is the business model is changing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Steiger, a new initiative between Vancouver-headquartered PeaceHealth and Renton-based Providence Health & Services is evidence of the changing industry model.\n\nLast October, the two health systems announced plans to collaborate on the construction of a new health and wellness center near the Costco on Padden Parkway in Vancouver. The planned facility is being developed with preventative care in mind.\n\n\u201cWe also want to be good partners,\u201d Steiger added, noting that PeaceHealth\u2019s mission to improve health extends beyond the walls of its facilities. \u201cWe want to partner with other organizations in the community so that we can do more like what the Padden Parkway [initiative] is trying to do. So we can get upstream from hospitals and empower people with knowledge and skills to more effectively participate in their health and healthcare.\u201d\n\nAccording to Carol Aaron, PeaceHealth\u2019s chief administrative officer, grappling with a rapidly changing healthcare system, an aging population and the changing needs and desires of patients, made the partnership with Providence a natural progression.\n\n\u201cStrategic alliance for building a clinic in the Vancouver market with Providence makes so much sense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re both Catholic healthcare organizations, we have very common values, missions, the way we think about serving our communities and care for our neighbors\u2026 So we\u2019re also looking at not only having a primary care clinic, but really something that\u2019s very exciting \u2026 [because] the earlier health intervention we can do, the healthier our communities will be. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for with this collaboration.\n\n\u201cA lot of what you\u2019re seeing is how we\u2019re transforming PeaceHealth,\u201d added Aaron, \u201cbecause of some mandates from the Affordable Care Act \u2013 but also we are moving away from solely [an] acute care focus when people aren\u2019t healthy, to earlier intervention and health improvement. We\u2019re really redefining ourselves around the spirit of health.\u201d\n\nExecutive changes\n\nDespite a seeming exodus of senior executives, PeaceHealth is confident it\u2019s exactly where it should be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some recent changes in our senior leadership,\u201d Aaron acknowledged, attributing some of the exits to an aging workforce population. \u201cWe had and have people who have worked here 20, 30 and 40 years. We\u2019re also seeing the last attrition that is expected because of baby boomers \u2013 and overall in this country now. With that, it\u2019s also creating an opportunity to recruit and bring in some really great top talent.\u201d\n\nSteiger questioned what she considered abundant coverage of PeaceHealth\u2019s staffing transitions \u2013 referencing the lack of coverage on the exit of Mark Adams from CHI Franciscan Health system in Seattle and Liz Dunne from Providence, both of whom have recently joined on at PeaceHealth.\n\nAfter referencing PeaceHealth\u2019s recent hires and the creation of two new positions: chief nursing officer, held by Victoria King, and chief medical officer, held by Mark Adams, Steiger insisted that the executive shuffling between various hospitals and groups is nothing new.\n\n\u201cPrior leaders have gotten us here, but we need new skills for the future,\u201d she said. \u201cPeaceHealth has been retooling for the future needs. Turnovers are a natural evolution in an organization and in an industry where change is rapid.\u201d\n\nBeyond senior staffing changes, PeaceHealth has also experienced an increase in staff unionization, most notably in Eugene and Springfield. Aaron underscored that as a Catholic organization, PeaceHealth would respect the caregiver\u2019s choice, and would remain committed to working with unions in all three states of PeaceHealth\u2019s operation.\n\n\u201cWe always respect our caregivers and our caregiver\u2019s choice. Obviously our preference is that we always remain in an open direct two-way dialogue. Where we do have existing relationships with unions, we work respectfully\u2026 Our goal is that we have a fair and just work environment for all caregivers regardless of whether they\u2019re represented or not.\u201d\n\nDespite staff exits, recent hires and unionization, PeaceHealth remains focused on weathering the sea change within the healthcare industry at large. The new Paddon Parkway initiative will serve as a sort of pilot project for what PeaceHealth hopes to implement in its other facilities, and for what may prove to be the future of healthcare \u2013 one where the emphasis is on overall health maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about a healthcare system that really has been an illness care system,\u201d said Steiger. \u201cThis clinic is going to be different than other offerings in the Portland metro area in that it really will be focused on not only sick care and wellness, but putting the health and wellness of the people we\u2019re serving first and foremost.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Preventative care is old as the hills.
