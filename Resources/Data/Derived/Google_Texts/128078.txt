Why is this a problem?

During Open Enrollment especially if a client calls during times when call volumes were high the agent would have to wait up to an hour or more to get a representative on the phone, unless the client was willing to do the three-way call very early in the morning or very late at night. If the call is made during business hours and the client is at work there are times when they cannot answer when the agent call to make the connection and the process has to be repeated. This is a waste of time. This is very frustrating for the client and for the agent.

When an agent who uses a direct enrollment pathway works with a client who has an application in the system from a previous year, they can look up the clientâ€™s application in the system. But in order to start the new application for the current year the agent has to initiate a three-way call so a call center representative can manually begin the application to unlock it. Then the agent can log back in to complete the application with their client. More time wasted.
