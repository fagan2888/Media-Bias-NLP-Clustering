They want Metal Gap to help pay their deductibles and co-pays in case of catastrophic illness or accidents.\n\nMetal Gap, an innovative, supplemental insurance product from The IHC Group, fills the gap in coverage for many with high deductible health plans. In the event of accidents, illnesses or hospital stays, Metal Gap* helps consumers manage financial responsibilities such as the high deductibles, coinsurance and co-payments associated with the more affordably priced Obamacare plans.\n\nA recent article in The New York Times reports that 85%** of individuals buying on a public exchange receive subsidies, making the monthly premiums for these plans now affordable for many. However, the high out-of-pocket expenses mean that the buyer may still not be able to afford the out-of-pocket costs associated with medical emergencies such as treatment for a broken limb or comprehensive blood tests for diagnosing an illness.\n\nFor the popular Bronze Plans, the consumer must pay for all of their medical services up to their deductible of $5,181, and is then still responsible to pay 40% until they reach their out-of-pocket maximum of $6,600.\n\n\u201cWe expect the bulk of our Obamacare sales to be Bronze and Silver plans this year. Most of those plans on our website, healthedeals.com, come with deductibles of $3,500 to $6,600, which can be a real burden for many people,\u201d said Brian Dow, Chief Operating Officer of Health eDeals.\n\nMetal Gap will pay up to the out-of-pocket maximum related to accidents and also bundles coverage for critical illnesses such as cancer and heart attacks. Metal Gap provides up to $6,350 in accident medical expense coverage and $7,500 in critical illness coverage with premiums as low as $24.95 per month.\n\nJeff Keller, a broker in Manhattan, Kansas, offers Metal Gap to his clients who choose not to purchase a Gold or Platinum plan due to cost. Mr. Keller noted, \u201cThe difference in cost between a Bronze and Silver plan can be as much as $75 per month; if the client can\u2019t afford to buy the next higher level plan, I suggest that they go with the lower cost plan and use the gap plan to help in case they have a high dollar claim. It adds peace-of-mind for my clients, particularly those with children.\u201d\n\n\u201cMetal Gap is very attractive right now, as my clients are seeing new ACA plans with high deductibles and significant increases in out-of-pocket costs,\u201d said Dave Blunier, owner of Insurance Solutions, Inc. in Phoenix, AZ. \u201cMost average people can\u2019t afford the $6,350 per person out-of-pocket. They want Metal Gap to help pay their deductibles and co-pays in case of catastrophic illness or accidents. And if a young invincible client or self-employed dad has a car accident costing $20,000 in out-of-pockets and deductibles, they would face difficulties in covering these costs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Dow, \u201cFor those looking to cover more than accidents and critical illnesses, Metal Gap offers an optional hospital benefit that would pay $1,000 for the first day of a covered hospital stay and $500 per day for up to nine additional days.\u201d\n\nMetal Gap is available through licensed insurance producers, online at http://www.healthedeals.com or by calling Dave Keller at 952-746-6614.
