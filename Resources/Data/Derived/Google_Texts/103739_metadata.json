Some hospital systems have even launched loan programs to help patients pay for their share of the cost for care provided and to stem the rising tide of uncollectible patient debt.\n\nPatient Bad Debt Trend Should Be Watched by Clinical Lab Managers\n\nIt is important for clinical laboratory managers and pathologists to understand that these actions by hospitals to address bad debt is a reminder that medical laboratories will have a similar problem of collecting monies due to them from patients who have high deductibles and will need to pay 100% of the cost of their lab testing.\n\nThe trend of hospitals establishing loan programs to help their patients pay their healthcare bills was the topic of a story published in Modern Healthcare.\n\nIt is not just high-deductible health plans contributing to greater levels of patient bad debt at the nation\u2019s hospitals. It is predicted that the rollout of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in January will increase the number of patients with low-cost, high deductible insurance plans. This comes on top of existing trends where increasing number of employers are shifting employees to high-deductible plans.\n\nSome Exchange Plans Only Cover 60% of Health Costs\n\nThe newly established federal insurance exchange, for instance, includes bronze- and silver-tier plans that cover just 60% or 70% of costs, respectively. These plans could leave patients with thousands of dollars of debt. Additionally, a recent report from the Kaiser Foundation found that one-third of people insured through an employer currently have a deductible of $1,000 or more.\n\nThe ACA caps maximum out-of-pocket payments for insured patients at roughly $5,300 per year for individuals and $12,700 per year for families. Experts point out that these amounts will put a strain on lower- and middle-income family budgets.\n\nWith patient debt climbing, hospital collection efforts have become more aggressive and sophisticated, noted the Modern Healthcare article. One strategy to cope with patient bad debt is to offer new financing options, such as hospital loans, and attempts to settle bills before or during patient visits. However, these tactics have renewed scrutiny of hospital billing practices by public officials, as well as patient and consumer advocacy groups.\n\nHospitals Working with Banks to Provide Patient Loans\n\nDignity Health operates more than 40 hospitals across Arizona, California and Nevada. In tandem with a bank, it is considering launching a loan program, noted another Modern Healthcare report.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want economics to be a barrier to appropriate care,\u201d declared Michael Blaszyk, Dignity\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He acknowledged the need to help patients pay their bills.\n\nHealth systems that recently launched loan programs report that banks have agreed to adhere to new ACA billing and collection policies. The banks will return delinquent patient accounts to the healthcare provider, noted the Modern Healthcare report.\n\nMelissa Jacoby, a consumer law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, pointed out in the Modern HealthCare report that, although ACA sets new rules for billing and collection, nonprofit hospitals are discouraged from \u201cacting like creditors.\u201d\n\nHospitals Developing Payment Plans to Meet Patient Financial Means\n\nPatient payment plans are nothing new for hospitals. What is new is more attention to the design of payment plans to make them more affordable for patients. For example, Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, California, launched a two-year financing plan prior to the 2009 recession that burdened many patients with payments of $200 per month. The hospital has since changed its loan-term policy to six years of interest-free financing. It will reset the clock at any point to extend the payback period for the patient.\n\nSimilarly, Hanover Hospital in Pennsylvania established a patient loan program in 2010 that charged 10% interest on the unpaid balance. Public backlash, noted the Modern HealthCare article, caused the hospital to reduce that interest rate to 3.9%.\n\nHealth System to Back Its Patient Loan Program\n\nBlaszyk said Dignity Health is considering a way to offer patients credit at low-interest rates, regardless of their credit score. Dignity will back the loans. The organization currently uses its own cash to finance long-term, zero-interest payment plans, but a deluge of newly insured patients needing credit would tie up an inordinate amount of cash, he noted.\n\nFurthermore, under new ACA financial rules, nonprofit hospitals\u2014which represent 60% of the nation\u2019s hospitals\u2014cannot engage in \u201cextraordinary\u201d collection actions before making a reasonable effort to identify patients eligible for financial aid, noted the Modern Healthcare report. Nonprofit hospital governance boards are required to approve written financial aid and emergency medical policies that set new limits on charges for poor patients. Violators could lose their tax-exempt status.\n\nBusiness Insights for Labs and Pathologists\n\nClinical laboratories and pathology groups are serving the same patients with high-deductible health insurance plans. To avoid an increase in uncollectible debt, medical laboratories and pathology groups may also want to consider different payment options for patients with high-deductible plans, when appropriate. At a minimum it is smart to begin asking patients to pay their deductibles at the time when their lab specimens are collected.\n\n\u2014Patricia Kirk\n\nRelated Information:\n\nPaying the bill\n\n2013 Employer Health Benefits Survey", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory,  affordable care act, aca, nonprofit hospital, collection practices, financial aid, charity care, patient debt, patient loan, high-deductible plan, uncollectible debt, bad debt, federal health plan exchange, dignity health, kaiser foundation, michael blaszyk, melissa jacoby, university of north carolina school of law, palomar medical center, hanover hospital, patient financial aid,aca,affordable care act,bad debt,charity care,clinical laboratory,collection practices,dignity health,federal health plan exchange,financial aid,hanover hospital,high-deductible plan,kaiser foundation,medical laboratory,melissa jacoby,michael blaszyk,nonprofit hospital,palomar medical center,patient debt,patient financial aid,patient loan,uncollectible debt,university of north carolina school of law,coding, billing, and collections,laboratory management and operations,laboratory news,laboratory pathology,management & operations", "description": "Hospital executives are anticipating a deluge of new patient debt associated with a dramatic increase in high-deductible health plans.
