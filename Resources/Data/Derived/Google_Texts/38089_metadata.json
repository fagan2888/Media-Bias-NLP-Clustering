They also require the listing of contacts and relatives, potentially exposing any foreign relatives of U.S. intelligence employees to coercion. Both the applicant\u2019s Social Security number and that of his or her cohabitant is required.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the security clearance material is classified.\n\nThe security-clearance records provide \u201ca very complete overview of a person,\u201d said Evan Lesser, managing director of ClearanceJobs.com, a website that matches security-clearance holders to available slots. \u201cYou don\u2019t need these records to blackmail or exploit someone, but it would sure make the job easier.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which was the target of the hack, has not officially notified military or intelligence personnel whose security clearance data was breached, but news of the second hack was starting to circulate in both the Pentagon and the CIA.\n\nThe officials said they believe the hack into the security clearance database was separate from the breach of federal personnel data announced last week \u2014 a breach that is itself appearing far worse than first believed. It could not be learned whether the security database breach happened when an OPM contractor was hacked in 2013, an attack that was discovered last year. Members of Congress received classified briefings about that breach in September, but there was no mention of security clearance information being exposed.\n\nThe OPM had no immediate comment Friday.\n\nNearly all of the millions of security clearance holders, including CIA, National Security Agency and military special operations personnel, are potentially exposed in the security clearance breach, the officials said. More than 2.9 million people had been investigated for a security clearance as of October 2014, according to government records.\n\nIn the hack of standard personnel records announced last week, two people briefed on the investigation disclosed Friday that as many as 14 million current and former civilian U.S. government employees have had their information exposed to hackers, a far higher figure than the 4 million the Obama administration initially disclosed.\n\nAmerican officials have said that cybertheft originated in China and that they suspect espionage by the Chinese government, which has denied any involvement.\n\nThe newer estimate puts the number of compromised records between 9 million and 14 million going back to the 1980s, said one congressional official and one former U.S. official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because information disclosed in the confidential briefings includes classified details of the investigation.\n\nThere are about 2.6 million executive branch civilians, so the majority of the records exposed relate to former employees. Contractor information also has been stolen, officials said. The data in the hack revealed last week include the records of most federal civilian employees, though not members of Congress and their staffs, members of the military or staff of the intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Thursday, a major union said it believes the hackers stole Social Security numbers, military records and veterans\u2019 status information, addresses, birth dates, job and pay histories; health insurance, life insurance and pension information; and age, gender and race data.\n\nThe personnel records would provide a foreign government an extraordinary roadmap to blackmail, impersonate or otherwise exploit federal employees in an effort to gain access to U.S. secrets \u2014or entry into government computer networks.\n\nOutside experts were pointing to the breaches as a blistering indictment of the U.S. government\u2019s ability to secure its own data two years after a National Security Agency contractor, Edward Snowden, was able to steal tens of thousands of the agency\u2019s most sensitive documents.\n\nAfter the Snowden revelations about government surveillance, it became more difficult for the federal government to hire talented younger people into sensitive jobs, particularly at intelligence agencies, Lesser said.\n\n\u201cNow, if you get a job with the government, your own personal information may not be secure,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to multiply the government\u2019s hiring problems many times.\u201d\n\nThe Social Security numbers were not encrypted, the American Federation of Government Employees said, calling that \u201can abysmal failure on the part of the agency to guard data that has been entrusted to it by the federal workforce.\u201d\n\nSamuel Schumach, an OPM spokesman, would not address how the data was protected or specifics of the information that might have been compromised, but said, \u201cToday\u2019s adversaries are sophisticated enough that encryption alone does not guarantee protection.\u201d OPM is nonetheless increasing its use of encryption, he said.\n\nThe Obama administration had acknowledged that up to 4.2 million current and former employees whose information resides in the Office of Personnel Management server are affected by the December cyberbreach, but it had been vague about exactly what was taken.\n\nJ. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a letter Thursday to OPM director Katherine Archuleta that based on incomplete information OPM provided to the union, \u201cthe hackers are now in possession of all personnel data for every federal employee, every federal retiree and up to 1 million former federal employees.\u201d\n\nAnother federal union, the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, said Friday that \u201cat this point, we believe AFGE\u2019s assessment of the breach is overstated.\u201d It called on the OPM to provide more information.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said last week that he believes China will use the recently stolen information for \u201cthe mother of all spear-phishing attacks.\u201d\n\nSpear-phishing is a technique under which hackers send emails designed to appear legitimate so that users open them and load spyware onto their networks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Several U.S. officials say hackers linked to China appear to have gained access to sensitive background information submitted by intelligence and military personnel seeking security clearances.
