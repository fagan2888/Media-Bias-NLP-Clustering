This month, as Halabi drove to Denver International Airport to pick up his wife and 2-year-old daughter, he realized he was doing the same thing.\n\nHalabi\u2019s daughter, Mia, has severe epilepsy. Treatment by some of the country\u2019s best neurologists and with the most powerful drugs has done little. This year, doctors told him to prepare for her death.\n\n\u201cNo matter what we did, nothing helped. She just got worse until she was almost a vegetable,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had no chance at life.\u201d\n\nThen in July, he and his wife, Miriam, saw an online video of a Colorado Springs girl\u2019s astounding recovery from epilepsy using an oil made from a special strain of marijuana. The Halabis live in New York City, where medical marijuana is illegal.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we saw it, we knew we had to go,\u201d he said.\n\nFamilies of children with severe medical problems are moving to Colorado from all over the country to get the oil that appears to be working. They call themselves marijuana refugees.\n\n\u201cThese families are really desperate,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Gedde, a Stanford-educated Colorado Springs pathologist who has recommended many of the arriving children for medical marijuana. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried all the drugs, and nothing has worked. This is the only option left.\u201d\n\nRepeated studies going back to 1970 have shown a strong potential for cannabidiol to help epilepsy, but federal laws made cannabis difficult to study in the United States. In addition, there is a stigma in the medical field.\n\nWhile pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol is available in other countries, clinical trials for FDA approval in the United States are just getting underway.\n\nIn to 2012, a 5-year-old girl named Charlotte Figi who has a genetic disorder called Dravet syndrome that causes catastrophic seizures, was given a new chance at life from marijuana . Doctors tried everything from barbiturates to extreme diets to control the disorder, but nothing helped. She was in the hospital constantly. Twice her heart stopped. Not wanting to prolong their child\u2019s suffering, her parents signed a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order.\n\nAs a last-ditch effort, they decided to try marijuana, and it worked.\n\nExperimenters developed a new strain of marijuana that was exceptionally low in THC\u2014the chemical that makes users stoned\u2014and exceptionally high in a chemical called cannabidiol that has no intoxicating effects, but that a handful of decades-old studies suggested might reduce seizures.\n\nThe original developers called it Hippie\u2019s Disappointment, because no one wanted to buy it. They have since renamed it Charlotte\u2019s Web after a girl who once had 300 seizures a week and now has on average fewer than one.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Gazette, http://www.gazette.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s new pot laws draw marijuana refugees", "title": "Colorado\u2019s new pot laws draw marijuana refugees", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/26/colorados-new-pot-laws-draw-marijuana-refugees/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-27T02:04:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-27T02:04:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Halabis live in New York City, where medical marijuana is illegal.\n\u201cThese families are really desperate,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Gedde, a Stanford-educated Colorado Springs pathologist who has recommended many of the arriving children for medical marijuana.\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.\u2014When Mohammad Halabi was a boy, his parents fled war in Lebanon to give their child a chance at life.\nThis month, as Halabi drove to Denver International Airport to pick up his wife and 2-year-old daughter, he realized he was doing the same thing.\nTreatment by some of the country\u2019s best neurologists and with the most powerful drugs has done little."}
