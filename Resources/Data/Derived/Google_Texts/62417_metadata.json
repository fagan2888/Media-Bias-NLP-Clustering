Last week, President Obama got an earful from his immigration allies. The head of a top Latino advocacy group called him the \"Deporter-in-Chief,\" while leading Democrats pressed him to take executive action on immigration. No wonder a headline in Politico read \"Barack Obama under siege over deportations.\"\n\n\n\nThe pressure on the president over immigration is unprecedented because it is coming from the left, and also because it is well-deserved. Obama's unfortunate immigration legacy is little more than broken promises and broken families. It is time for him to do the right thing and ease up on deportations.\n\nIf the president believes that immigration reform is achievable through Congress, he should stop deporting so many people who otherwise would be able to apply for a path to citizenship. If does not believe that reform is achievable through Congress, he should take matters into his own hands through executive action. Either way, President Obama should heed the advice of his supporters, decrease deportations, and show the Latino community that he is indeed our friend.\n\nFollow Raul A.
