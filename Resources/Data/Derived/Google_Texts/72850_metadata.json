Soon the political class will have settled all the important arguments over candidates\u2019 hairstyles, eyeglasses, family trees, foibles, fumbles, feuds with news networks, and ability to deliver a one-liner. Then everyone can turn our attention to what specific changes each would-be leader of the nation actually wants to accomplish.\n\nThere\u2019s no bigger domestic policy question than how to make higher education more accessible and effective for promising young people.\n\nIt\u2019s big on a substantive level, and big on a political level. First, the substance.\n\nA college education and degree can transform a life. Collectively, colleges and universities produce the nation\u2019s next generations of innovators and leaders. If qualified students can\u2019t take advantage of opportunities for higher education, they lose and America loses.\n\nThe trends are worrisome.\n\nThe United States, once No. 1 in the percentage of residents with college degrees, has slipped clear out of the top 10. Blame, in part, cost: Even if they succeed in graduating, students walk away with huge loan debts \u2014 reportedly, more than 40 million Americans are carrying a total of $1.2 trillion in college debt, an average of about $28,000. The figures skyrocketed, far beyond the general cost of living, as recession-ravaged states slashed spending on public colleges and universities and raised tuition and fees to make up for it.\n\nCalifornians know this all too well. Although the average student-loan debt here, $20,340, is the second-lowest among U.S. states, the 12.7 percent loan default rate here is actually higher than the rate of more heavily burdened states.\n\nIt was in the state with the highest average student debt, first-in-the-nation primary state New Hampshire, that Clinton unveiled her proposal to fix things. Her \u201cNew College Compact\u201d is a plan for the federal government to spend $350 billion over 10 years \u2014 using revenue raised from eliminating some tax deductions for high earners \u2014 to help states guarantee \u201cno-loan\u201d tuition at public universities and community colleges while also encouraging states to raise education spending and cost-cutting.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan comes after Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced legislation aimed at eliminating tuition at public universities through higher Wall Street taxes, and Martin O\u2019Malley proposed a loan-refinancing program and more federal financial aid.\n\nAlthough the Clinton plan draws on ideas pushed by Republican lawmakers, the GOP presidential candidates have criticized the proposed tax hike and \u201ctop-down\u201d federal influence. Marco Rubio called it \u201cObamacare for college.\u201d (The issue was barely mentioned in the Aug. 6 GOP debates.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, second, the politics. While any of the liberals\u2019 plans would be a long shot to pass a conservative Congress, it could be a political winner. The proposals are ways for the Democratic hopefuls to draw policy distinctions from each other, and a way for the party to separate itself from the GOP.\n\nAs both sides court the young voters who helped elect President Obama, any serious candidate must lay out a plan for helping young people fulfill their dreams. And young voters must press them on the issue.\n\nClinton\u2019s proposal puts it front and center. Let the college-affordability debate begin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton last week became the latest presidential candidate to offer a plan to trim college costs.
