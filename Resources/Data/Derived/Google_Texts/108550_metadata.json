This goes back to the old adage of Churchill \u2014 democracy is the worst form of government except for all the alternatives. (Laughter.) It\u2019s messy. And so could we have designed a far more elegant health-care law? Of course.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement comes amid an ongoing judicial battle over the law\u2019s wording that has seen one court rule that individuals who enrolled on the federal exchange are not eligible for Obamacare subsidies. The debate about the meaning of the law\u2019s exact text \u2014 that subsidies apply to \u201ca qualified health plan \u2026 that was enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State\u201d \u2014 has sparked criticism, humorously from the left this time, that the law was poorly (read: carelessly) written. That conservatives have leveled the same charge against the law, though for entirely different and more numerous reasons, underscores a longstanding critique that Obamacare was terribly crafted and rushed.\n\n\u201c[M]y belief is that if, in fact, we can see a reduction in some of the political temperature around Obamacare \u2026 then it\u2019s an iterative process. We can go back at it and further refine it, learn lessons from things that aren\u2019t working as well, make it simpler, make it better,\u201d Obama added in the interview. \u201cThat does require, though, an attitude on the part of Congress, as well as on the part of the business community, that says you don\u2019t just get 100 [percent] of what you want.\u201d\n\nObama has said before that the law \u201cis not perfect,\u201d though he hedged by blaming the implementation, in particular the rollout of Healthcare.gov.\n\nThe president also went after what he termed \u201cclimate-change denialists\u201d in the sit-down with The Economist, which took place on Air Force One and mostly covered foreign policy and economics.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Barack Obama told The Economist magazine in an interview that \"of course\" his signature healthcare law, Obamacare, could've been written better.", "title": "Obama admits that 'of course' Obamacare could've been written...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 549, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/Kathleen-Sebelius-President-Obama-549x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/04/obama-admits-course-obamacare-couldve-written-better/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "the-economist", "published_time": "2014-08-04T11:57:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-04T12:05:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25d4\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama told The Economist magazine in an interview that \u201cof course\u201d his signature healthcare law, Obamacare, could\u2019ve been written better.\nAnd so could we have designed a far more elegant health-care law?\nThe president\u2019s statement comes amid an ongoing judicial battle over the law\u2019s wording that has seen one court rule that individuals who enrolled on the federal exchange are not eligible for Obamacare subsidies.\nThis goes back to the old adage of Churchill \u2014 democracy is the worst form of government except for all the alternatives.\n\u201c[M]y belief is that if, in fact, we can see a reduction in some of the political temperature around Obamacare \u2026 then it\u2019s an iterative process."}
