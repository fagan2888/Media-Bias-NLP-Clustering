Naturally, they made this anti-politicizing argument by way of attacking the president.\n\n\u201cWe are here to honor our vets,\u201d Palin said. \u201cYou look around though and you see these barricades and you have to ask yourself is this any way that a commander-in-chief would show his respect, his gratitude to our military?\u201d and concluded, seemingly blind to irony, \u201cOur veterans should be above politics.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz chimed in to throw a zinger at Obama, insisting, \u201c\u201dHe said, \u2018If you open the memorial I will veto it.'\u201d\n\nOf course, this is false. What Obama did say is that he would veto a measure to only open the parts of government that are giving Republicans bad PR during the government shutdown (like the World War II monument) while keeping everything else closed. Which seems fair enough.\n\nBut the one thing the Tea Party conservatives are good at is having the sheer cojones do stuff like shut down the government and then hold a protest about Obama shutting down the government. When he totally did not do it. At all.\n\nPolls show that most of America rightly assesses blame on Republican House members for the shutdown. After all, they were the ones who refused to sign a continuing resolution to fund the government unless the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law three years ago and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2013. But still Tea Partiers find a way to make this Obama\u2019s shutdown.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible magical thinking that had thousands of people protesting in DC on Sunday. Tractors were on hand to rip down barricades that block access to the World War II memorial in lieu of usual park rangers, and that protesters dumped them on the White House lawn.\n\nMeanwhile, back in reality, Guardian reports thousands of veterans are scheduled to rally DC over concerns that the shutdown will result in a suspension of disability payments and benefits like mental health care for vets.\n\nSo Ted Cruz will shut down government, then show his face at a rally and blame the president for blocking these sad, sad veterans who just want to celebrate World War II at their monument, all while potentially blocking actual care for veterans who really need it.
