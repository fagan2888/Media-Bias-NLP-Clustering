But Hensarling, as chairman of the committee responsible for the bank, is influential in determining which bills come up for a vote.\n\nKirk said the bill would include reforms in legislation backed by 58 House Republicans but \"the coal problem has been holding us up.\"\n\nThe House Republican bill would suspend rules limiting Ex-Im financing for coal-fired power plants, while an alternative introduced by senior Democrats on Wednesday leaves limits in place.\n\nManchin, whose state of West Virginia is a major coal producer, said staff were working to get the language on coal right.\n\n\"There's going to be some people that don't want any coal language at all, we know that, that's not a proper approach to take, that's putting your head in the sand,\" Manchin said.\n\nA senior staffer working on the bill, which would give Ex-Im five more years and cut its lending cap by $5 billion to $135 billion, said a compromise could involve a partial rollback of the limits on coal.\n\nMore than 600 small to mid-sized exporters, manufacturers and business representatives from 41 states visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lobby lawmakers to keep Ex-Im open.\n\nHensarling wrote in a letter to fellow lawmakers that Ex-Im used taxpayer funds to help finance select U.S. exports at the expense of others.\n\nCritics charge that Ex-Im's support for overseas buyers of U.S. goods, such as Boeing Co planes, gives foreign firms an edge over U.S. competitors.\n\n(Reporting by Krista Hughes; editing by Andrew Hay)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Krista Hughes",
