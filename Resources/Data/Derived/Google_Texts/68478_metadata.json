(AP) - California\u2019s health insurance exchange is still sluggish when it comes to resolving customer service problems, leaving many people unable to access health care or finalize their tax returns, a consumer advocacy group said Thursday.\n\nCovered California has been slow to fix enrollment mistakes entered into its computer system, according to the Health Consumer Alliance, which is made up of legal aid groups throughout the state.\n\nExchange staff has a limited ability to update a state computer program for determining whether people are eligible to enroll in Covered California or in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s low-income health program, the group says.\n\nCovered California\u2019s executive director, Peter Lee, responded Thursday at the board meeting that \u201ca very small percentage\u201d of customers file appeals when they are rejected, and the exchange is committed to resolving problems quickly. Since March, the agency says it has added staff to try to resolve disputes informally without having to go through an administrative law proceeding.\n\n\u201cWe still have work to do,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThe agency will provide a detailed report on the number of appeals and their status at the next board meeting in October, he said.\n\nThe alliance also claims Covered California has failed to correct tax subsidy forms in a timely manner, preventing people from getting tax credits or amending their taxes. For example, advocates said a woman from the Inland Empire has not been able to correct her tax subsidy form since Jan. 28.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that public support for the (Affordable Care Act) will erode as more and more consumers encounter these types of tax problems and face exposure to IRS debts and penalties,\u201d the group wrote in a letter to exchange board members this week.\n\nCovered California said it is looking to troubleshoot information technology problems so staff can make changes directly rather than having to file help desk tickets that can take weeks to resolve. Accenture won a $359 million contract in 2012 to build and maintain the state\u2019s online platform for health insurance programs called the California Healthcare Eligibility, Enrollment, and Retention System, or CalHEERS.\n\n\u201cThe challenges with big IT, it does not necessarily mean nimble IT,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019re working to speed those up. But the issue of having effective and as prompt as possible resolution to appeals is something we take very seriously.\u201d\n\nJen Flory of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, a member of the alliance, said she was pleased to hear the exchange set a goal of mid-September to resolve tax forms but worried two years remains too long for some CalHEERS system fixes.\n\n\u201cWe do want to work with staff to get some timelines to make sure these people that are waiting to get into plans actually have access to care,\u201d Flory said.\n\nEarlier this year, Covered California apologized for sending out about 100,000 incorrect tax forms to people who received sliding-scale subsidies to help them purchase private health insurance.\n\nThe exchange acknowledged sending inaccurate coverage information on 1095-A forms when 800,000 forms went out for the first time this year. The federal health care law requires most people to have insurance or face a tax penalty that increases each year.\n\nThe penalty for a person who makes $40,000 a year will increase from $299 in 2014 to nearly $600 this year. And a family of four with that same income would see fines increase from $500 to nearly $1,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California's health insurance exchange is still sluggish when it comes to resolving customer service problems, leaving many people unable to access health care or finalize their tax returns, a consumer advocacy group said Thursday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/20/group-says-covered-california-slow-to-fix-customer/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "California\u2019s health insurance exchange is still sluggish when it comes to resolving customer service problems, leaving many people unable to access health care or finalize their tax returns, a consumer advocacy group said Thursday.", "title": "Group says Covered California slow to fix customer problems"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "California's health insurance exchange is still sluggish when it comes to resolving customer service problems, leaving many people unable to access health care or finalize their tax returns, a consume", "card": "summary", "title": "Group says Covered California slow to fix customer problems"}, "Author": "JUDY LIN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02c7\"", "article_summary": "The federal health care law requires most people to have insurance or face a tax penalty that increases each year.\nExchange staff has a limited ability to update a state computer program for determining whether people are eligible to enroll in Covered California or in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s low-income health program, the group says.\nEarlier this year, Covered California apologized for sending out about 100,000 incorrect tax forms to people who received sliding-scale subsidies to help them purchase private health insurance.\nCovered California has been slow to fix enrollment mistakes entered into its computer system, according to the Health Consumer Alliance, which is made up of legal aid groups throughout the state.\nThe alliance also claims Covered California has failed to correct tax subsidy forms in a timely manner, preventing people from getting tax credits or amending their taxes."}
