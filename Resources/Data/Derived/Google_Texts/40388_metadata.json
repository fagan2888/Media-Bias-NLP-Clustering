De La Campa was killed instantly, and the drivers of two other vehicles were injured in a collision with Tarasuk\u2019s truck. It was Tarasuk\u2019s second DUI arrest in 12 years, and an hour after the collision, a blood test revealed his blood alcohol level to be .23 percent.\n\nProsecution and defense presented different scenarios of exactly what happened during the collision and which vehicle killed De La Campa, and Tarasuk\u2019s conviction hinged on which one the jury found more plausible.\n\nDefense attorney Ken Giffard called private investigator Larry Fink, who testified that his forensic analysis of the involved vehicles indicated that a Ford Escape driven by Dana Verducci struck De La Campa first, launching him into the air and onto the hood of Tarasuk\u2019s truck, which then broadsided the Escape.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Doug Van Breemen called his own expert witness, retired investigator Michael Allison, to refute Fink\u2019s testimony. Allison said De La Campa would have been launched out of the truck\u2019s way if the Escape had hit him first, and in fact he\u2019d been hit first by the truck and had his legs pinned between it and the Escape for a moment before being thrown to the other side of the street by momentum.\n\n\u201c(Fink\u2019s theory) defies the laws of physics,\u201d Allison said of a body being launched straight up, instead of up and forward, by a car. \u201cThat cannot happen.\u201d\n\nBefore Van Breemen and Giffard made their closing arguments, Judge Jeffrey Penney briefed the jury on its options and duties. Penney said that in order to convict Tarasuk of second-degree murder, the jury needed to find two things: causation, or that death was a direct and probable consequence of Tarasuk\u2019s actions and would not have occurred without them; and malice aforethought, indicating not that he intended to kill but that he intentionally committed an act knowing that it was dangerous, and that he acted with willful disregard for that fact.\n\nIn his closing statements, Giffard reminded the jury that Tarasuk had been calm and cooperative with officers until they tried to tase him and rammed his vehicle trying to stop it, and that before the collision, none of the officers told Tarasuk he was under arrest or asked for his keys. He went on to say that Verducci told officers after the collision that she was afraid she might have hit a pedestrian, and he questioned the application of physics in Allison\u2019s testimony given so many variables.\n\n\u201cYou can make references to Isaac Newton\u2026 but you have to use a little bit of common sense in these (cases),\u201d Giffard told the jury. \u201c(De La Campa) was hit by two vehicles, and Verducci\u2019s hit him first.\u201d\n\nVan Breemen began his closing statements with a theme \u2013 \u201ca selfish act of a selfish man,\u201d characterizing Tarasuk\u2019s behavior as especially reckless since he was a licensed commercial truck driver who had been inundated with information about the dangers of drunk driving.\n\n\u201cIf you drive under the influence while you\u2019re evading police, and you drive onto a traffic island where pedestrians are standing, I submit to you, the natural and probable consequence is that one or both of those pedestrians will be killed,\u201d Van Breemen said. \u201cOf all the people who would know that driving under the influence of alcohol is dangerous to human life, it would be a (commercial) truck driver.\u201d\n\nHe went on to call Giffard\u2019s defense tactic of blaming Verducci \u201coutrageous,\u201d and he asked the jury to consider why De La Campa would have left his wife on the sidewalk and stepped into the street and oncoming traffic.\n\n\u201cDana Verducci is not on trial\u2026 because she did nothing wrong. Period,\u201d Van Breemen said. \u201cThere is no evidence or testimony to suggest her Escape hit Gregory in the crosswalk.\u201d\n\nIt was enough for the jury, which found Tarasuk guilty on all five counts.\n\nHaving spent more than two years on the case, Van Breemen said he was relieved for the family that Tarasuk\u2019s trial is over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that the family members can now have at least some measure of closure,\u201d he said.\n\nOn March 6, Penney ruled that two further allegations against Tarasuk were true, both pertaining to prior violent felony convictions in 2006.\n\nTarasuk awaits sentencing in May.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
