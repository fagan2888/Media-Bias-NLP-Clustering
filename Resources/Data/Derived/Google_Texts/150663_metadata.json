They envision a line with a small, visible segment in the center \u2014 where most of the observable action takes place \u2014 and two polar extremes which are largely invisible to all but those with the precision instruments required to expose them. The fringes, most suppose, are separated by such a vast distance that they could never meet. But Americans would be better served by substituting the linear spectrum they visualize with a loop. At the far end of that loop, the nation\u2019s far-right and far-left voices often meet and even agree.\n\nThis phenomenon was evident during the 16-day government shutdown of October, 2013. While conservative activists and liberal commentators rarely shared the same logic for attacking the centrist Republicans who opposed the shutdown, they often appealed to the same rhetorical excesses while attacking them.\n\nThis was a period in which you could scarcely ascertain the difference between the unrestrained rhetoric of conservative radio host Mark Levin and MSNBC personality Joy-Ann Reid. A \u201cmoron,\u201d and \u201ca preschool teacher\u201d were some of the insults that both personalities hurled at House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) during the shutdown, though for distinct reasons.\n\nDuring the shutdown, both progressive and conservative outlets regularly attacked Speaker Boehner as a \u201ccoward.\u201d A Democratic ad which ran against him during the shutdown linked him to a wailing baby throwing a tantrum after he failed to force the defunding of the Affordable Care Act. When the Speaker acquiesced to a deal that ended the shutdown, diehard conservatives attacked him on his Facebook page as a \u201cturncoat\u201d and a \u201cfascist.\u201d\n\nWhile the more cautious commentators on both sides were careful to note the distinction between the Republicans who favored the shutdown strategy and those that were reluctantly entertaining it, the commentators on the fringes of American political life often did not.\n\nThe reopening of the government forced both sides to their corners again for a time but the scandal surrounding the closure of two lanes of the George Washington Bridge by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s aides, allegedly to punish a political adversary, has closed the circle once again.\n\nToday, America\u2019s partisan progressives are jumping at the chance to kneecap Hillary Clinton\u2019s most formidable 2016 challenger. They are joined by unlikely allies on the far-right who view Christie, a moderate, as the greatest threat to the GOP\u2019s chances for retaking the White House.\n\n\u201cObama set the tone for his staff and the IRS,\u201d wrote RedState editor Erick Erickson. \u201cChristie did the same in New Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis may be the rare time conservatives cheer on MSNBC and other liberal media outlets as they down a (alleged) Republican,\u201d echoed conservative radio host Steve Deace.\n\nEven some usually measured and insightful conservative political commentators have pounced on Christie. Writing in the conservative online opinion journal Ricochet, GOP consultant Rick Wilson suggested that Christie is suffering a fate an \u201cAcela Republican\u201d deserves:\n\nThe Acela Republican is as comfortable in the green rooms of MSNBC as he is at a green energy conference. The Acela Republican isn\u2019t one of those horrible Tea Party yahoos who comes from somewhere other than a big, coastal metropolis. The Acela Republican is softer, smoother, and less confrontational\u2026unless he\u2019s taking on his own party.\n\nWilson continues: \u201cHe talks about bringing people together, working with the other party, getting things done for everyone, regardless of politics\u2026if only his own backward, hick, red-state, cousin-kissing bumpkin party will see the light.\u201d His attack on Christie is dripping with contempt \u2014 not for the man, but for the region of his birth and whose residents he represents. This is a bias he would surely recognize and recoil from if it was coming from a Democrat denouncing the unsophisticated residents of flyover country.\n\nIn fact, most of these conservative attacks on Christie would be right at home on MSNBC. Lawrence O\u2019Donnell declared that a nonagenarian woman whose death was initially, and erroneously, linked to the Fort Lee traffic jam would \u201cbecome the Willie Horton of Chris Christie\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201d Chris Matthews drew applause from the audience of The View when he offered some unsolicited advice to Christie\u2019s fired aides on how they could implicate their former boss in the scandal.\n\nThe network\u2019s prime time hosts have, in fact, gone all in (so to speak) in the effort to expose Christie as a vindictive and manipulative \u201cbully,\u201d going so far as to repeatedly broadcast arcane and unsubstantiated theories about Christie\u2019s motives. National Review editor Rich Lowry correctly noted that the various theories posited by MSNBC personalities designed to make Christie a toxic property \u201cfailed to meet the most basic evidentiary standard of, you know, marshaling some evidence.\u201d\n\nBut those theories satisfy a purpose, one with bipartisan appeal, apparently: The desperate need shared by both the far-right and the far-left to smother the Christie juggernaut in its crib.\n\nPundits on the cable news networks often lament the lack of bipartisanship that supposedly characterized an idealized version of American history, often while failing to recognize their own roles in an era of hyper-partisan politics. But these pundits could just as easily recognize it in the emerging fringe alliance. Both of America\u2019s political extremes apparently view centrism as an existential threat and are willing, if reluctantly, to ally in order to guarantee that theirs remain the loudest and most influential voices in the room.\n\n[Photo via AP/Roundtree]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both America\u2019s political extremes apparently view centrism as an existential threat and are willing, if reluctantly, to ally in order to guarantee that theirs", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Left-Right-Alliance.jpg", "title": "A Fringe Coalition: When the Left and Right Join Forces to Discredit the Center"}, "twitter": {"description": "Both America\u2019s political extremes apparently view centrism as an existential threat and are willing, if reluctantly, to ally in order to guarantee that theirs remain the loudest and most influential voices in the room.", "title": "A Fringe Coalition: When the Left and Right Join Forces to Discredit the Center", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Left-Right-Alliance.jpg", "creator": "@noahcrothman@twitter.com", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-01-16T11:41:44+00:00", "keywords": "columnists,online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Acela Republican isn\u2019t one of those horrible Tea Party yahoos who comes from somewhere other than a big, coastal metropolis.\nThe Acela Republican is softer, smoother, and less confrontational\u2026unless he\u2019s taking on his own party.\nEven some usually measured and insightful conservative political commentators have pounced on Christie.\nThey are joined by unlikely allies on the far-right who view Christie, a moderate, as the greatest threat to the GOP\u2019s chances for retaking the White House.\nIn fact, most of these conservative attacks on Christie would be right at home on MSNBC."}
