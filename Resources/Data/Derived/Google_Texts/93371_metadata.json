It\u2019s also known as smog, and it has been linked to various respiratory conditions.\n\n\u201cA standard set within this range would result in important improvements in public protection, compared to the current standard, and could reasonably be judged to provide an appropriate degree of public health protection,\u201d the staff wrote.\n\nThe Friday report, along with two risk and exposure assessments, are part of the normal EPA process for considering changing air quality standards. EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia emphasized that the publications do not represent a proposed rule.\n\n\u201cThey are provided to the EPA administrator, who will consider the information they contain, along with public comments and advice from the agency\u2019s independent science advisers, in determining whether to propose revisions to the standards,\u201d Purchia said.\n\nMcCarthy is planning to decide by December whether to propose changing the standard.\n\nThe Sierra Club and the American Lung Association both took the report as an opportunity to endorse the 60 parts per billion standard.\n\n\u201cThe EPA\u2019s smog pollution policy assessment confirms again that the current standard does not adequately protect the health of our communities and that we need a more restrictive standard,\u201d Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEPA\u2019s assessment confirms what the health and medical community long ago concluded: the current ozone standard fails to protect public health as the Clean Air Act requires,\u201d Paul Billings, the Lung Association\u2019s senior vice president, said in a statement. \u201cAmericans have been living with an outdated standard for far too long.\u201d\n\nThe National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) has been one of the leading groups opposed to lowering the ozone standard.\n\nNAM said in July that a 60 parts-per-billion standard could be the most expensive regulation in history. By 2040, the rule could cost $2.2 trillion in compliance costs, $3.4 trillion to the economy and 2.9 million lost jobs, a NAM-commissioned study found.\n\nLawmakers have started to attack the potential regulation as well.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) staff asked Administrator Gina McCarthy to lower the acceptable level for ozone pollution, saying it would improve public health.", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) staff asked Administrator Gina McCarthy to lower the acceptable level for ozone pollution, saying it would improve public health.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) staff asked Administrator Gina McCarthy to lower the acceptable level for ozone pollution, saying it would improve public health.", "title": "EPA staff backs new ozone restrictions", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/216269-epa-staff-backs-new-ozone-restrictions", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/216269-epa-staff-backs-new-ozone-restrictions", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-29T16:12-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T16:12:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "keywords": "Ozone, Environmental Protection Agency, Sierra Club,Gina McCarthy,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/216269-epa-staff-backs-new-ozone-restrictions", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) staff asked Administrator Gina McCarthy to lower the acceptable level for ozone pollution, saying it would improve public health.", "card": "summary", "title": "EPA staff backs new ozone restrictions"}, "dcterms.title": "EPA staff backs new ozone restrictions"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cc4\"", "article_summary": "Specifically, the EPA\u2019s staff asked that the ground-level ozone standard be lowered to between 60 and 70 parts per billion, down from the current 75 parts per billion.\n\u201cAmericans have been living with an outdated standard for far too long.\u201dThe National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) has been one of the leading groups opposed to lowering the ozone standard.\nThe staff\u2019s recommendation, part of a nearly 600-page report on potential changes to the ozone standard, largely matches what the EPA\u2019s advisory panel of outside scientists concluded in June.\nAreas with higher levels must submit plans to the EPA to lower their concentrations of ozone, a byproduct of pollutants from burning fossil fuels.\n\u201cA standard set within this range would result in important improvements in public protection, compared to the current standard, and could reasonably be judged to provide an appropriate degree of public health protection,\u201d the staff wrote."}
