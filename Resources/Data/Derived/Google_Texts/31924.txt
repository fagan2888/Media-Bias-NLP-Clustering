Praveen Halappanavar, the widower of Savita Halappanavar, the woman who died in an Irish hospital last year after she was refused a medically necessary abortion, is suing the Health Service Executive. Savita, 31, died from septic shock caused by a dying fetus being kept in her womb for several days. Doctors reportedly refused to terminate Savita’s pregnancy while she was miscarrying because they were afraid they were breaking Irish law against abortion. The suit fingers the HSE and Savita’s obstetrician for negligence and claims they failed to uphold Savita’s right to life. Hmmmm. [BBC]
