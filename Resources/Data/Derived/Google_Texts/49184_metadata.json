But for the Democrats, it\u2019s just another fundraising opportunity. They can\u2019t run a health insurance program, but they are great at raking in cash. This communication from the Democratic Party arrived in my inbox yesterday:\n\nFrom: DCCC Breaking News [mailto:[email protected] ]\n\nSent: Thursday, November 21, 2013 3:46 PM\n\nTo: Hinderaker, John H.\n\nSubject: New York Times: New York Times: G.O.P. Maps Out Waves of Attacks Over Health Law John \u2014 This is serious.\n\nWhat is serious? The failure of Obamacare? The fact that millions are losing their coverage, and many millions more are seeing price increases? The fact that millions of Americans are losing access to the doctors they know and like?\n\nJust kidding.\n\nThe New York Times got ahold of internal Republican marching orders that reveal what we\u2019ve known all along: they are in the midst of launching an aggressive plan to attack the Affordable Care Act. But the devil is in the details. We\u2019re about to face a coordinated attack like we\u2019ve never seen to scare voters about Obamacare.\n\nPresumably it is not a surprise to even the lowest-information voters that Republicans are attacking Obamacare. But in the Democrats\u2019 world, it is Republicans who are always \u201cscaring\u201d voters. Actually, this is much more a Democrat tactic; but at the moment, what is scaring voters is Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama is fighting back against the Republicans\u2019 attacks on health care reform, but he simply can\u2019t do it alone. And at this point, we can\u2019t compete with that kind of sustained attack.\n\nReally? Why not? You control the executive branch and the Senate. If there is something good to be said about Obamacare, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to get the word out.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the corporate cash that Republicans rely on to do their dirty work.\n\nDirty work? Note that so far, the Democrats haven\u2019t cited a single thing Republicans have done other than tell the truth about Obamacare. This is true in 100% of the Democratic Party\u2019s communications with its members.\n\nWe have grassroots supporters like you to help fill the $80,000 fundraising gap so we can respond to Republican attacks. Can we count on you?\n\nAnother consistent feature of the Democrats\u2019 appeals is that there is always a \u201cfundraising gap.\u201d Always. And then, by some miracle, when the parties finally report, the Democrats always have more money. It is their one field of expertise.\n\nNow let\u2019s go back to the Democrats\u2019 lament that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the corporate cash that Republicans rely on\u2026.\u201d Compare that with Politico\u2019s headline: 2013: Year of the liberal billionaire.\n\nIn the off-year campaigns of 2013, liberal and Democratic interests have enjoyed a decisive advantage in the billionaire spending bracket. Indeed, groups tied to just three billionaires \u2014 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, California investor Tom Steyer and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 have spent well more than $25 million this year pushing progressive candidates and causes.\n\nThese liberal billionaires have been everywhere this year:\n\nThe current election in Virginia is a case in point: Bloomberg\u2019s Independence USA PAC is on track to spend $3 million by Election Day, targeting the Republican candidates for governor and attorney general on the issue of gun control. Steyer, a hedge fund executive, has spent millions through the group NextGen Climate Action on digital and turnout programs, as well as countless negative ads against GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. Both Bloomberg and Steyer have been ubiquitous in other 2013 elections: Bloomberg spent some $2.2 million against a National Rifle Association-linked House candidate in Illinois earlier this year, and about a million dollars boosting now-Sen. Cory Booker in a New Jersey special election. He also cut a $350,000 check to a group defending two Colorado state legislators facing recall elections over their support for gun control. Steyer, meanwhile, put more than $1 million of his own money into the Massachusetts Senate special election that resulted in victory for Democrat Ed Markey, attacking both the Republican nominee in the race and Markey\u2019s primary opponent, Rep. Stephen Lynch, whom he viewed as insufficiently committed to fighting climate change. All the while, the group FWD.us \u2014 which receives a majority of its funding from Zuckerberg \u2014 has put about $15 million into advocating for comprehensive immigration reform, according to a source tracking the group\u2019s activities.\n\nSo there is plenty of rich people\u2019s money on the left. No surprise there; it has always been true. But Politico, a Democratic Party outlet, credits the absurd theory that it is reprehensible for rich people to be conservatives, but praiseworthy for them to be liberals:\n\nLehane argued that there\u2019s a categorical difference between big spenders like Bloomberg and Steyer, and the ultra-prolific donors on the GOP side in 2012: \u201cThe folks who are involved on the Democratic side are not necessarily folks who have a direct financial interest in the policies they are advocating for.\u201d\n\nThis is a ridiculous claim, but one that Politico has no interest in exposing. There is no more self-interested donor than Tom Steyer. I wrote about him here, in a post titled \u201cA Case Study In Liberal Hypocrisy.\u201d Steyer is a hedge fund tycoon who specializes in green (i.e., inefficient) energy. So he is very different from an honest oil man, who just wants to compete. Steyer desperately needs government favoritism for his investments to pay off. What I wrote in March 2011 is still true:\n\nAs an investor who has placed a big bet on non-fossil energy, [Steyer] has an obvious personal interest in the government imposing regulations that make his competitors\u2013producers of fossil fuel energy\u2013more expensive. In fact, without such government action, the \u201cgreen\u201d projects in which he has invested are likely worthless. But there\u2019s more: Thomas Steyer is a member of the Board of Directors of the Center for American Progress, a \u201cDemocratic insider think tank started by former Clinton administration official John Podesta\u201d that is often viewed as a mouthpiece for the Obama administration. The Center for American Progress owns the web site Think Progress, which has been the main source of attacks on Koch Industries. So, if you are looking for financial self-interest, let\u2019s connect the dots: Thomas Steyer is desperately trying to influence the federal government to impose irrational costs on industries that produce energy from fossil fuels, so that his own hedge fund investments in inefficient (\u201cgreen\u201d) energy will be worth more money. The insane attacks that Think Progress, controlled by Steyer and his friends, have launched against Koch Industries are part of this business strategy. Steyer knows which politicians will enrich him by imposing needless costs on fossil fuel-derived energy, and he contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars to them. This is on top of the undisclosed amounts that he contributes to his mouthpieces at Think Progress and other left-wing activists. There is nothing illegal about this; businessmen are allowed to lobby, contribute to politicians, and support astroturf campaigns to protect their investments. But it is the height of hypocrisy for Steyer and his minions at Think Progress to attack companies like Koch Industries, who represent the interests of consumers, while disguising the fact that they are the ones who actually have skin in the game, and are trying to enrich themselves at the expense of taxpayers and consumers.\n\nThat sums it up pretty well. The Democrats are always trying to have it both ways, raising money from their low-information rank and file by pleading poverty while raking in far more money from rich people, unions and other special interests than Republicans can hope to match.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Obamacare is getting hammered, and deservedly so.
