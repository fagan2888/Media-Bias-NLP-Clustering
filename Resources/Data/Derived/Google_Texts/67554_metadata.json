This failure to launch reflects a widespread cultural regression. By returning home after graduation, this generation\u2019s doing more than just perpetuating adolescence. We\u2019re losing at life.\n\nThere might be more room for activities at your parent\u2019s house but there\u2019s little room for personal growth. And if being determines consciousness, then you\u2019ll bring your future down with you when you move back into the basement. It\u2019s time to grow up. It\u2019s time to move out.\n\nWe Should Love Our Parents Enough Never To Move Back In With Them Sure, student loans suck. More than our parents, we\u2019ve had to grapple with unrealistic dreams built on unsteady mountains of student debt. But there\u2019s a place you can go when you\u2019re down on your luck and low on your dough. It\u2019s called the YMCA.\n\nIf that sounds harsh, imagine asking your old man if you can live in your old room. By moving home, you could save some cash but only at the cost of your character.\n\nOur parents might love us but they don\u2019t like us that much. And they shouldn\u2019t. In civil society, the family exists to foster maturity and prepare offspring for eventual adulthood not perpetual childhood. Taxing their generosity robs them of the investment of their lifetime. Every mother and father wants to provide their kid with a better and brighter future. After two decades of sacrifice\u2014whether they\u2019ll admit it or not\u2014they want a son with a career, not an overgrown boy with a neckbeard. We ought to actualize the potential they\u2019ve poured into us. We should become adults they\u2019re proud of.\n\nYea Bro, Living at Home Isn\u2019t Cool Whatever you do though, don\u2019t kid yourself. Living at home is anything but cool and everyone knows it. \u201cHey girl, want to come back to my parent\u2019s place?\u201d is a line that even Ryan Gosling couldn\u2019t pull off. Winston Churchill once observed that the spaces we occupy end up shaping us. At 22, our mother\u2019s house is turning us back into children. Like continence, literacy, and a job, a place of your own stands as a general benchmark of responsibility. Go find one.\n\nCutting a rent check is the first big step toward self-reliance. Millennials don\u2019t have to blaze trails, brave the wilderness, or build cabins to make it in the real world. We just need to scout Craigslist for a place, set up direct deposit, and maybe lower our expectations. That first apartment won\u2019t be ideal but it\u2019ll be necessary. More than a roof, it represents an investment in the future.\n\nTough finances are a burden but they don\u2019t have to be a permanent roadblock. If you\u2019re drowning in student debt and rent breaks the budget, find a roommate, sublease, or couch surf. Do whatever it takes, because to make it in America, you have to make it out of your mom\u2019s house first.\n\nGet Ahead By Betting On Yourself None of this should discount the difficulty of leaving home. Lord knows my living situation is hardly on fleek. The place exudes a kind of refugee camp chic with makeshift bookshelves made out of milk crates, scrounged furniture, and a few cheap Ikea pieces. Food and clothing present their own challenges. Since graduation a few months ago, I\u2019ve bleached colors and burnt minute-rice; I\u2019ve shrunk clothes and set grease fires. It\u2019s been rough, unpleasant, and always worth it.\n\nComing and going each day reminds me that I\u2019m on my own. It\u2019s not a great feat. An apartment\u2019s just the most approachable manifestation of day-in and day-out maturity. Stupid or smart decisions determine whether the rent gets paid or if the lease is lost. If disaster strikes, no one\u2019s coming to the rescue. The world won\u2019t pause for me to get back on. And those four walls remind me, that for better or worse, I\u2019m an adult and that each day my mundane adventure is trying to live like one.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. A cheap apartment produces perseverance; soggy ramen noodles, character; and an on time rent check, hope\u2014hope that I can build an adult life. The goal is simple. You want your dad to say, \u201cThat\u2019s my boy. He\u2019s got a place of his own.\u201d\n\nAs a generation, we can live at home and languish or we can move out and make our on way. It\u2019s time we take a risk. It\u2019s time we bet on ourselves. If we don\u2019t, no one else will.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 03 Aug 2015 07:38:04 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "By moving home with their parents, more millennials are missing out on moving on with their life.", "title": "Millennials Who Live At Home Are Losing Out on Life", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dont-Live-At-Home-.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-03T09:16:35+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/03/yo-millennials-move-in-with-your-parents-and-youll-lose-at-life/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "By moving home with their parents, more millennials are missing out on moving on with their life.", "title": "Millennials Who Live At Home Are Losing Out on Life", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dont-Live-At-Home-.jpg"}, "creator": "@PhilipWegmann", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Culture", "tag": "college graduates,Millennials,underemployment", "published_time": "2015-08-03T07:38:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T09:16:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "By moving home with their parents, more millennials are missing out on moving on with their life."}, "article_summary": "While it\u2019s not good for man to live alone, it\u2019s even worse for him to live at home with his parents.\n\u201cHey girl, want to come back to my parent\u2019s place?\u201d is a line that even Ryan Gosling couldn\u2019t pull off.\nThere might be more room for activities at your parent\u2019s house but there\u2019s little room for personal growth.\nA recent Pew Research poll reveals that though employment is up, the number of millennials living on their own is down.\nIf that sounds harsh, imagine asking your old man if you can live in your old room."}
