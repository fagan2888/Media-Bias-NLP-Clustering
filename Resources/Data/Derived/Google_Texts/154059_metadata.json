President Barack Obama was the original tech president, snapping up hot tech talent for his White House, hobnobbing with the likes of Eric Schmidt and Mark Zuckerberg, and pledging to create a Web 2.0 Washington.\n\nBut Silicon Valley fell out of love after Edward Snowden lifted the veil on Big Brother Obama, and after pledges to create a tech-savvy, modern government fell short (see Healthcare.gov, followed by OPM hack).\n\nNow, Bush is putting the Republican spin on how Washington and the West Coast can meet minds. More than any of his rivals \u2014 even more than Rand Paul \u2014 Bush is embracing the sharing-oriented economy as a symbol of free-market, anti-regulation ideology.\n\n\u201cFewer rules will create more prosperity, more innovation, more benefits than the command-and-control old approach of hierarchical regulations and large government trying to solve problems for us,\u201d Bush told the crowd of jeans-clad audience of employees, comparing the federal government today to \u201cGeneral Motors in 1975.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of the future needs to look more like Thumbtack, to be honest with you: lower cost, higher quality, focused on outcomes, really focused on citizens, or in your case, the customers,\u201d Bush said to the workers at Thumbtack, an online company that links local service providers such as house painters with customers.\n\nOn a political level, Bush\u2019s choice to emphasize his affinity for Uber and other innovation companies is an answer to the implicit critique of younger rivals portraying him as a relic of yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s an effort to draw out a sharper contrast with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner who has voiced concerns about the impact of these disruptive companies on wages and organized labor.\n\nAnd it\u2019s an obvious overture to millenials.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people really want to get in line anymore, I think they want to customize their own dreams,\u201d Bush said during an hour-long town hall with employees at Thumbtack. \u201cI think the economy we\u2019re moving towards has to be customized in that fashion.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s outreach to 20- and 30-somethings is still that of a 62-year-old: he referred to his Apple watch as an \u201ciWatch\u201d and informed a BuzzFeed reporter he\u2019s unfamiliar with the term \u201con fleek.\u201d\n\nBut as he told reporters before being whisked away in another Uber, he\u2019s having encounters that are shaping his views everyday, referring to a college student in Los Angeles who gave him a ride.\n\n\u201cBecause of Uber, he\u2019s going to go to medical school debt-free,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe have $1.2 billon of student loan debt; we have people who are stuck because we haven\u2019t reformed our higher education system. Uber\u2019s giving that person a chance to start out and fulfill his dream.\u201d\n\nBut Bush encountered some reality checks to his soaring rhetoric.\n\nAs Thumbtack\u2019s CEO himself pointed out, disturbing the old economic order \u201ccan also be disempowering\u201d to certain people and industries.\n\nBeyond lip service, Bush had no answers for the taxi cab drivers now struggling economically or other remnants of the old economic order now adrift. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a big tension between companies that are disrupting the old order, but it\u2019s a pretty vital service,\u201d Bush said of Uber. \u201cI learn a lot when I go on these share car services. You meet people that are customizing their lives; this should be time for celebration.\u201d\n\nAnd conservative values often clash with Silicon Valley sensibilities.\n\nDuring the town hall meeting, Bush spoke, as he often does, about his desire to repeal Obamacare. Uber\u2019s CEO, meanwhile, has praised the law for enabling drivers to purchase affordable coverage on the open market. When asked about that contention, Bush shrugged it off.\n\n\u201cThat may be true,\u201d he said to reporters afterward, but continued to argue that a \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d model would work better.\n\nBush didn\u2019t play to his audience at all when he dismissed the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new net neutrality rules, heralded by Silicon Valley, as unnecessary.\n\nWhile coming to San Francisco allows Bush to follow through on his oft-repeated promise to carry the Republican message to traditionally Democratic locales, the questions young workers threw his way highlighted how his views on a range of issues are out of step with millenials.\n\nStanding in front of 50 young people inside the company\u2019s hip, loft-like space in the SoMa district, Bush faced questions about his state\u2019s Stand Your Ground law, anti-discrimination statutes and women\u2019s pay.\n\n\u201cWhat qualities of Barack Obama would you like to emphasize?\u201d one young woman asked Bush, who said he admires the president\u2019s ability to communicate and inspire.\n\n\u201cIf I could speak like Barack Obama, if I could light up a room like he does. Charisma is not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nWhile Bush told a Florida native who criticized the Stand Your Ground law he signed that they\u2019d just have to agree to disagree on the matter, he found more common ground in response to a gay man who asked about another Florida law protecting businesses that refuse to hire people based on their sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be discriminated against for your sexual orientation. Period, over and out,\u201d said Bush, who went on to say that anti-discrimination measures don\u2019t have to diminish people\u2019s religious liberties and that balancing the two should be left to states.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He promises to re-craft Washington in the mold of Silicon Valley.", "title": "Jeb's Uber economy", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/jeb-bush-uber-120256.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/16/150715_jeb_bush_uber_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Uber,Economy,2016 Elections,Transportation,Jeb Bush,Jeb Bush 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He promises to re-craft Washington in the mold of Silicon Valley.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "2016 Jeb's Uber economy He promises to re-craft Washington in the mold of Silicon Valley.\nMore than any of his rivals \u2014 even more than Rand Paul \u2014 Bush is embracing the sharing-oriented economy as a symbol of free-market, anti-regulation ideology.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a big tension between companies that are disrupting the old order, but it\u2019s a pretty vital service,\u201d Bush said of Uber.\n\u201cBecause of Uber, he\u2019s going to go to medical school debt-free,\u201d Bush said.\nNow, Bush is putting the Republican spin on how Washington and the West Coast can meet minds."}
