His former vice president has also been jailed in the multimillion-dollar graft and fraud scheme.\n\nThough the protests have died down since Perez Molina\u2019s resignation, many Guatemalans remain fed up with corruption and politics as usual, and Morales will face pressure to deliver immediately on widespread demands for reform.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that the next government avoids corruption,\u201d said Alexander Pereira, an insurance salesman who was the first to vote at one polling place. \u201cI hope that the next government really makes a change. We had an achievement in kicking out the last government.\u201d\n\nJavier Zepeda, executive director of the Chamber of Industry, said his business group had observed the vote and estimated turnout at around 45 percent to 50 percent, which would be down 20 points from the first round.\n\n\u201cThe people already showed their rejection of corruption (in the previous vote) where they kicked politicians out,\u201d Zepeda said.\n\nMorales and Torres were the top two vote-getters in the first round Sept. 6, when presumed front-runner Manuel Baldizon finished a surprising third \u2013 a result considered to be a rejection of Guatemala\u2019s political establishment in the wake of the corruption scandal.\n\nThe protests began in April after the corruption scandal involving bribery at the customs agency was unveiled by Guatemalan prosecutors and a U.N. commission that is investigating criminal networks in the country.\n\nInvestigators first targeted former Vice President Roxana Baldetti, whose personal secretary was named as the alleged ringleader of the scheme, and then Perez Molina.\n\nMorales, like Torres, promised to keep Attorney General Thelma Aldana, a key figure in the investigation, and the U.N. commission in place. He also vowed to strengthen controls and transparency, saying in a debate this past week that the government has controls and auditing powers at its disposal.\n\n\u201cAll the elements for auditing available to the presidency and vice presidency are going to be put to work,\u201d Morales said.\n\nBut ahead of the runoff, many Guatemalans remained skeptical that either candidate would work to root out entrenched corruption and find honest public servants to form a government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the forums and debates and I\u2019m not convinced,\u201d said Oneida de Bertrand, a homemaker who took part in the protests. \u201cThey say what we all know about how the country is, but when it comes time to make proposals they don\u2019t say how.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "TV comic and self-styled outsider Jimmy Morales won election as Guatemala's next president Sunday, riding a wave of popular anger against the political class after huge anti-corruption protests helped oust the last government.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "TV comic and self-styled outsider Jimmy Morales won election as Guatemala\u2019s next president Sunday, riding a wave of popular anger against the political class after huge anti-corruption protests helped oust the last government.", "title": "Jimmy Morales, comedian, wins Guatemala presidential election", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/25/jimmy-morales-comedian-wins-guatemala-presidential/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/JimmyMorales.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/25/JimmyMorales.jpg", "description": "TV comic and self-styled outsider Jimmy Morales won election as Guatemala's next president Sunday, riding a wave of popular anger against the political class after huge anti-corruption protests helped", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Jimmy Morales, comedian, wins Guatemala presidential election"}, "Author": "Sonia Perez D.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Guatemala, Jimmy Morales"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc62\"", "article_summary": "His former vice president has also been jailed in the multimillion-dollar graft and fraud scheme.\n\u201cAll the elements for auditing available to the presidency and vice presidency are going to be put to work,\u201d Morales said.\nInvestigators first targeted former Vice President Roxana Baldetti, whose personal secretary was named as the alleged ringleader of the scheme, and then Perez Molina.\nMorales, like Torres, promised to keep Attorney General Thelma Aldana, a key figure in the investigation, and the U.N. commission in place.\n\u201cWe recognize Jimmy Morales\u2018 triumph and we wish him success,\u201d Torres said."}
