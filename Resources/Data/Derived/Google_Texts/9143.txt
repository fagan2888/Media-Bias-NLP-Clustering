A Butler County sheriff's deputy suffered minor injuries in a crash Friday evening in Andover.

The crash happened around 7:45 p.m. at the intersection of Butler Road and 120th Road in south Andover.

Troopers say Deputy Kevin Kichler was heading south on Butler Road and made a left turn in front of a Toyota Rav4. The Toyota collided with the deputy's cruiser.

Deputy Kichler was taken to Wesley Medical Center in Wichita. Butler County Sheriff Kelly Herzet tells KAKE News that Kichler has since been released from the hospital, having only suffered minor injuries.

The driver of the Toyota, 59-year-old Gale Albert of Rose Hill, was also taken to the hospital for treatment and has been released.
