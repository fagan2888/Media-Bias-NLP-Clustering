They had contract negotiations with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and tight end Julius Thomas before training camp in July, but those talks stalled in August.\n\nWhat kind of contract would it take for the Broncos to secure Harris for the long term? Based on how he\u2019s been graded by Pro Football Focus, Harris doesn\u2019t have to be shy about his asking price. Entering the Broncos\u2019 Week 10 game Sunday at Oakland, Harris has the third-best overall rating among NFL cornerbacks, behind the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 Vontae Davis and San Diego\u2019s Brandon Flowers.\n\nHarris, 25, also has the top coverage grade among cornerbacks. But the website\u2019s rankings don\u2019t differentiate between No. 1, No. 2 and nickel backs, as each NFL team does. During his four seasons with the Broncos, Harris has been a nickel back or a No. 2-outside cornerback, where he played opposite Champ Bailey, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie or Aqib Talib.\n\nArguably the league\u2019s best No. 2 corner, Harris, is making $2.187 million this year after he received a second-round tender as a restricted free agent.\n\nNow that he\u2019s proven to be fully recovered from a partially torn ACL injury suffered during a January playoff game against San Diego, Harris is in position to command a substantial raise.\n\nThis past offseason, Green Bay gave Sam Shields a four-year, $39 million contract extension ($9.75 million per season) and the Colts re-signed Davis to a four-year, $36 million deal ($9 million average). Free agents Brent Grimes signed with Miami for four years and $32 million ($8 million) and Rodgers-Cromartie left the Broncos for the New York Giants and a five-year, $35 million deal ($7 million average).\n\nAs with any NFL multiyear contract, guaranteed money and structure of years one, two and three accompany total dollars as the three key components.\n\nIn many ways, Harris is a model Bronco. A four-year starter at Kansas, Harris went undrafted in part because he was shifted from corner to safety as a senior, and he doesn\u2019t have a blazing 40 time.\n\nBut he was discovered by the Broncos\u2019 scouting system during the lockout of 2011 and John Fox\u2019s coaching staff realized in his first training camp that Harris is a fierce competitor who finds a way to stick with any receiver.\n\nA nickel back through his first 2\u00bd seasons, Harris moved to an outside corner position midway through the 2013 season. When he suffered his partially torn ACL on a noncontact play in the third quarter of the Broncos\u2019 second-round AFC playoff game Jan. 12, San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers rallied the Chargers back in the game by picking on Harris\u2019 replacement, Quintin Jammer.\n\nHarris underwent surgery, missed the rest of the 2013 season, including the Super Bowl, and the entire 2014 preseason, but he has been superb through the first half of the regular season.\n\nBesides his two interceptions, Harris ranks third in the league in pass deflections (11) and opponent quarterback rating (41.4).\n\nNegotiations for a new, more lucrative contract are coming along at a good time.
