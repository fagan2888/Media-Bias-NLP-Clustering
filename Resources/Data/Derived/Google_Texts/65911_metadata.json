Overall, nearly a quarter of a million more people in Michigan had health insurance last year than the year before.\n\nIt would be hard to exaggerate how positive this is.\n\nNaturally, people are better and happier citizens, better parents and partners when they are healthy, but they are also better workers and employees.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen any efforts to quantify this, but our more healthy population has to be reducing absenteeism and boosting the productivity of our businesses.\n\nMost of the increase comes from the expansion of Medicaid benefits through what is called the Healthy Michigan Plan, which the Legislature barely passed two years ago. They expanded Medicaid coverage to those making up to about one-third more than the official poverty rate.\n\nWe aren\u2019t talking free health care for the affluent. The most a family of four can earn and still be covered is $32,500 a year. And without this, those folks would have no health care.\n\nAnd right now the federal government is paying for everything.\n\nMichigan won\u2019t have to pay anything till 2017, and never more than 10% of the entire cost. But this coverage is seriously threatened. Conservatives forced two waivers into the Michigan bill. The first was approved by Washington, but the second hasn\u2019t yet been approved.\n\nUnless Washington accepts the waiver, or the Legislature modifies the bill by the end of this year, everybody in the Healthy Michigan plan will lose all benefits at the end of next April: 600,000 people.\n\nIt would require those getting benefits to pay higher co-pays, or to enroll in a federal Health Insurance Marketplace and lose some Medicaid-provided services, such as dental coverage. Regardless of what you think about that, here\u2019s the big problem.\n\nUnless Washington accepts the waiver, or the Legislature modifies the bill by the end of this year, everybody in the Healthy Michigan plan will lose all benefits at the end of next April: 600,000 people.\n\nThat would be devastating for them and the state.\n\nFew have noticed yet, but it is essential this be fixed, and that may be hard. The current Legislature seems less sympathetic to health care expansion than the one that barely passed this. It will be interesting, to say the least, to see what happens next..\n\nJack Lessenberry is Michigan Radio's political analyst.
