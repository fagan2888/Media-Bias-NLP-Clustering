Oh what a night!

President Barack Obama was holding nothing back as he fired some noteworthy shots Saturday night at the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.

Here is a list of top 5 hilarious jokes made by the President:

1.”Luther” the Anger Translator

Perhaps the funniest moment of the night was when POTUS called in an anger translator, “Luther” AKA comedian Keegan-Michael Key from Comedy Central’s hit comedy show, Key & Peele.

2. The ‘Bucket’ List

The President adopted a new White House protocol. When matters of executive life get too hard to deal with, he’s decided to “bucket.” The entire audience and the people watching at home, knew he probably meant two words that rhyme with bucket, instead.

3. Obamacare

What would a speech made by the president be without discussing his signature healthcare law, which helps all Americans get access to care even if they don’t have a job. Of the healthcare policy he said:

“Today thanks to Obamacare, you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job. You’re welcome Senate Democrats,” Obama said.

4. Joe Biden shoulder massages

As his presidency comes to an end, Obama noted that he was feeling “more loose and relaxed than ever.” Obama casually threw out references to a moment involving Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s wife.

“Those Joe Biden shoulder massages, they’re like magic,” Obama joked. “You should try one. Oh you have?”

Biden got a little touchy-feely with the newly-minted defense secretary’s wife in February — apparently giving her a taste of the Obama special, according to CNN.

5. Dick Cheney

Obama lashed back at former Vice President Dick Cheney, who recently called Obama “the worst President of my lifetime.”

“Dick Cheney said I was the worst president of his lifetime, which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime.”
