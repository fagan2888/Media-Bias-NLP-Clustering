Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) laid out in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News at the Iowa Freedom Summit the biggest coming scandal of 2015: That the Obama administration is allowing corporations to data mine from healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cWe finally have confirmation\u2014I had anecdotal evidence on that when healthcare.gov started up,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cThey denied, denied, denied. Now we have confirmation that yes, indeed, that what healthcare.gov has done is allowed data mining. What we\u2019re trying to find out now\u2014and we\u2019re investigating\u2014did they make money? Did they sell your data? Who got the money? What pool did that money go to? Did that come back into taxpayer funds? Or, have companies been given free access?\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBlackburn, the vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said congressional hearings are in the works right now, too. \u201cAbsolutely, you\u2019re going to see hearings on this,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the federal government first and foremost has to protect your data.\u201d\n\nBlackburn, a conservative Republican from Nashville, Tennessee, was one of the U.S. House members at the conference that featured several potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates.\n\nBlackburn is someone in Congress who can pull many Republicans from different sides of the party in her direction on an issue, and her keen interest in this Obamacare data mining scandal seems to indicate it will become a big deal moving forward.\n\n\u201cIt is totally outrageous,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cThe federal government\u2014think about it like this. They mandate that you go to this website, and that you enter your personal identifying information, healthcare information and sensitive data into this repository. Your file, if you will, at this website.\n\n\u201cThen they transit that website to the IRS, to the Department of Homeland Security, they transit it outside to verify your income and all this information and then they sell it to insurance brokers our outside companies who are going to call you up and try to sell you their product.\u201d\n\nBlackburn said it\u2019s a \u201chuge\u201d crony capitalist system, and they\u2019ve got \u201call this personal data about all these people who have to buy an insurance product.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody is making money off of you,\u201d Blackburn said.\n\nEarlier the week before the Iowa Freedom Summit, the Associated Press broke a story that revealed serious data mining concerns with the Obamacare website. Some top line findings from the AP article are that data firms may be tracking people as they use the healthcare website and that there were multiple connections to third-party technology firms confirmed by the AP.\n\n\u201cA little-known side to the government\u2019s health insurance website is prompting renewed concerns about privacy, just as the White House is calling for stronger cybersecurity protections for consumers,\u201d the AP wrote. \u201cIt works like this: When you apply for coverage on HealthCare.gov, dozens of data companies may be able to tell that you are on the site. Some can even glean details such as your age, income, ZIP code, whether you smoke or if you are pregnant.\u201d\n\nThe AP also wrote that the so-called \u201cdata firms\u201d have \u201cembedded connections on the government site,\u201d and \u201cever-evolving technology allows for individual Internet users to be tracked, building profiles that are a vital tool for advertisers.\u201d\n\n\u201cConnections to multiple third-party tech firms were documented by technology experts who analyzed HealthCare.gov, and confirmed by The Associated Press,\u201d the AP wrote. \u201cThere is no evidence that personal information from HealthCare.gov has been misused, but the number of outside connections is raising questions.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, the AP followed up with another story detailing how the Obama administration has now \u201creversed course Friday and scaled back the release of personal information from HealthCare.gov.\u201d The AP noted that the Obama administration\u2019s decision to back off using Obamacare-mined data for corporate sales purposes seemed to have come in response to its original investigation.\n\nWhen asked by Breitbart News if she thinks this will be the biggest scandal of 2015 when all this information comes out in congressional hearings, Blackburn said: \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we know they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cNow we know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive\u2014Marsha Blackburn Lays Out Biggest Coming Scandal of 2015: Obamacare Data Mining", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive\u2014Marsha Blackburn Lays Out Biggest Coming Scandal of 2015: Obamacare Data Mining", "title": "Exclusive\u2014Marsha Blackburn Lays Out Biggest Coming Scandal of 2015: Obamacare Data Mining - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP309220344874.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/26/exclusive-marsha-blackburn-lays-out-biggest-coming-scandal-of-2015-obamacare-data-mining/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive\u2014Marsha Blackburn Lays Out Biggest Coming Scandal of 2015: Obamacare Data Mining", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP309220344874.jpg", "title": "Exclusive\u2014Marsha Blackburn Lays Out Biggest Coming Scandal of 2015: Obamacare Data Mining - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Cybersecurity, data mining, healthcare.gov, Iowa Freedom Summit, Marsha Blackburn, privacy,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "privacy", "published_time": "2015-01-26T13:40:51-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c06\"", "article_summary": "Now we have confirmation that yes, indeed, that what healthcare.gov has done is allowed data mining.\nThey mandate that you go to this website, and that you enter your personal identifying information, healthcare information and sensitive data into this repository.\nEarlier the week before the Iowa Freedom Summit, the Associated Press broke a story that revealed serious data mining concerns with the Obamacare website.\n\u201cWe finally have confirmation\u2014I had anecdotal evidence on that when healthcare.gov started up,\u201d Blackburn said.\nWhen asked by Breitbart News if she thinks this will be the biggest scandal of 2015 when all this information comes out in congressional hearings, Blackburn said: \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cNow we know they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Blackburn said."}
