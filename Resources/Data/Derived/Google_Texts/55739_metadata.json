News-Star that she thinks Carroll High School is using its dress code to condemn her sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cI told my mom, \u2018They\u2019re using me,'\u201d she said. \u201cThey put me in all these honors and advanced placement classes so I can take all of these tests and get good grades and better the school, but when it\u2019s time for me to celebrate the fact that I\u2019ve accomplished what I need to accomplish and I\u2019m about to graduate, they don\u2019t want to let me do it, the way I want to.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s principal, Patrick Taylor, insisted to the newspaper that the tuxedo rule isn\u2019t about sexual orientation, rather just an issue of dress code. Geraldine Jackson, the girl\u2019s mother, said the principal told her that teachers said they would refuse to chaperone the event if the dress code wasn\u2019t enforced. Jackson said he told her that \u201cgirls wear dresses and boys wear tuxes, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nNow, in response to media coverage of the controversy, the local school board is getting involved.\n\n\u201cAs school board president, I don\u2019t agree with Carroll banning her from her prom just because of what she wants to wear \u2014 that\u2019s discrimination,\u201d Rodney McFarland, president of the Monroe City School Board, told the newspaper. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go making up policies.\u201d\n\n[The News-Star]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A gay honor student in Louisiana has decided to miss her prom this year after her high school told her she can't wear a tuxedo.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The school's principal insists it's just a matter of dress code", "title": "Gay Student to Miss Prom After Louisiana School Says No Tux", "url": "http://time.com/3771603/gay-student-prom-tux/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/tuxedo.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/tuxedo.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The school's principal insists it's just a matter of dress code", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gay Student to Miss Prom After Louisiana School Says No Tux"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "gay prom, lgbt prom, gay discrimination, prom, girl wants to wear tux to prom, louisiana discrimination", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gay prom, lgbt prom, gay discrimination, prom, girl wants to wear tux to prom, Louisiana discrimination"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdde3\"", "article_summary": "A gay student in Louisiana has decided to miss her senior prom this year after her high school told her she can\u2019t wear a tuxedo.\n\u201cAs school board president, I don\u2019t agree with Carroll banning her from her prom just because of what she wants to wear \u2014 that\u2019s discrimination,\u201d Rodney McFarland, president of the Monroe City School Board, told the newspaper.\nNews-Star that she thinks Carroll High School is using its dress code to condemn her sexual orientation.\nGeraldine Jackson, the girl\u2019s mother, said the principal told her that teachers said they would refuse to chaperone the event if the dress code wasn\u2019t enforced.\nJackson said he told her that \u201cgirls wear dresses and boys wear tuxes, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201dNow, in response to media coverage of the controversy, the local school board is getting involved."}
