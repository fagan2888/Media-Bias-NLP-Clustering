The vice president has appeared on “The View” three times in the past, becoming the first sitting vice president to appear as a guest on the show on April 22, 2010. His upcoming appearance is part of the show’s “Red, White & View” campaign, which launched in September 2008 and highlights interviews and informational segments that helped promote civic responsibility during the election season.

“Vice President Biden always proves to be an engaging, informative and candid guest,” Walters said. “I am delighted and honored to welcome him back to the program,” she concluded.
