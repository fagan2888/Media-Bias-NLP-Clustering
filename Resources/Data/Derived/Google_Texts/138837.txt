Hot on the heels of the #BanBossy campaign (remember that?), the Department of Health and Human Services has finally figured out how to get you to sign up for Obamacare. And it’s not at all manipulative or dishonest.

Doesn’t the Bible say “Honor thy father and thy mother,” you dumb wingnuts? Well, there you go. The government is your mother.

It doesn’t matter what you want. It doesn’t matter what you need. It doesn’t matter whether it makes sense. It definitely doesn’t matter if it’s even Constitutional. Mommy says so. Don’t you love Mommy? Don’t you want Mommy to be happy? Why are you hurting your mother?

Thanks to Kathy Sebelius for yet again proving that evil and incompetence aren’t mutually exclusive.
