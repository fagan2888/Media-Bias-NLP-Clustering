In battered northwestern Pakistan, more than 10,000 homes were damaged, as well as 147 schools, officials said.\n\nThe quake, which struck Monday, was centered in Afghanistan\u2019s sparsely populated Badakhshan province bordering Pakistan, Tajikistan and China.\n\nThe poverty-stricken region is vast, with mountains and valleys that make it difficult to reach affected areas. Taliban are active in some parts, further complicating access, Barmak said.\n\nSurvey teams have been sent to assess casualties and damage in areas that can be reached only on foot or donkey. Once the information they bring back has been assessed, food and non-food supplies would be delivered, Barmak said.\n\nBadakhshan is often hit by earthquakes and other disasters, including floods and landslides. Other regions, too, such as Nuristan and Kunar provinces in the east were presenting access challenges, he told parliament. \u201cWe have got some problems like security challenges and road blocks, and unfortunately all roads from Nuristan\u2019s capital to its districts are still blocked and some roads are blocked in Kunar too,\u201d preventing delivery of help.\n\nMeanwhile, funerals of the victims continued Wednesday and in Pakistan\u2019s worst-hit town of Shangla, residents demanded the government\u2019s help to rebuild their homes.\n\nAccording to Pakistan\u2019s disaster management authority, the quake damaged 10,586 houses in the country\u2019s northwest. Shangla is the worst affected town, with 49 people killed and 228 injured. Another 32 people died in Chitral, the Pakistani town closest to the epicenter of the quake.\n\nPakistan\u2019s National Disaster Management Authority said it had distributed 15,519 tents, 25,700 blankets and tons of food. Further supplies would be delivered to remote areas once roads had been cleared and reopened.\n\nIn Shangla, 70-year-old Zurqun Nain said his extended family was living at a relative\u2019s home after the quake damaged his house. \u201cI had my own home before the earthquake. Now I am homeless at this old age,\u201d he said.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the northwestern city of Peshawar on Wednesday to attend a briefing on quake damages. In televised comments, he pledged his government would provide \u201cmaximum compensation\u201d to the victims.\n\n\u201cWe are going to start the provision of compensation to those whose homes were damaged,\u201d he said, adding that 200,000 rupees (about $2,000) would be given to each person to rebuild their homes.\n\n___\n\nFaiez reported from Kabul, Afghanistan.
