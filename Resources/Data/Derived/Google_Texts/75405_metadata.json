But offensive lineman Trent Williams accused umpire Roy Ellison of cursing him late in the first half.\n\nWilliams claimed that on the final Redskins\u2018 drive of the half, as the two teams lined up for a snap, Ellison used a pair of expletives toward him that included the words \u201cgarbage\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Teammate Kory Lichtensteiger verified the strong claim even after teammates yelled at Williams to stop talking lest he incur a serious fine from the NFL.\n\n\u201cThey got 11 on the field and then we got to play against the refs and we\u2019re outnumbered,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty, week-in and week-out.\u201d\n\nWashington defensive coordinator Jim Haslett expressed frustration at what he saw as uncalled holding penalties in last week\u2019s loss to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nA pool reporter dispatched to speak with head referee Walt Coleman spoke briefly with him on the officials\u2019 bus, received a brief \u201cokay\u201d when he told of Williams\u2018 accusations before the door shut and the bus drove away.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is a players\u2019 league. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s no room for you to have to take that from the team and the ref,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very unprofessional\u2026I\u2019m at a loss for words. You never expect that as a player going into the game to have to beef with the refs also.\u201d\n\nMorgan benched\n\nJoshua Morgan, who led the Washington Redskins with 48 receptions last season but has seen his playing time steadily decrease this year, was inactive for Sunday\u2019s game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nMorgan, who has 11 catches for 124 yards this season, has gradually been phased out of the offense as wide receiver Leonard Hankerson has taken over as the top Z receiver.\n\nBut while Morgan was frustrated after the game \u2013 he told the Times he was asked not to speak to reporters \u2013 he may have a chance to play again soon.\n\nThat\u2019s because Hankerson was injured early in the second quarter and the initial diagnosis, according to Redskins coach Mike Shanahan, was a possible injured lateral collateral ligament (LCL) in his left knee.\n\nHankerson entered the game with an unspecified hamstring injury. He stayed on the field after failing to break a tackle by Eagles linebacker Connor Barwin in open space. He did not return to the game.\n\nQuestionable returns\n\nUndrafted rookie wide receiver Nick Williams, signed off the practice squad on Tuesday, returned punts in Morgan\u2019s place. Williams, whose 2,045 kickoff return yards are a record at UConn, grew up 45 minutes from Philadelphia in East Windsor, N.J.\n\nWilliams made a poor decision in the first half by letting a punt land at the 8 instead of fair catching it. The Redskins began their second drive at the 2. In the third quarter he muffed a punt before falling on the ball himself to avert disaster.\n\nIn the second half, Williams made his first career catch for a first down. He finished with six punt returns for no yards and that one reception and also caught a two-point conversion early in the fourth quarter to cut the Philadelphia lead to 24-8. Williams also allowed a late fourth-quarter punt to bounce at the 20. It was downed at the 4 for a 70-yard punt to put Washington in bad field position for its final drive.\n\nOther injuries\n\nDefensive end Stephen Bowen, who aggravated his injured right knee in practice on Thursday, was active and played on Sunday. Bowen originally tore the PCL in the knee in the Redskins\u2018 victory over the Chicago Bears on Oct. 20. But he left the game in the first half with what was again listed as a knee injury. He, too, did not return. Bowen said he will have an MRI on Monday and was hurt on a crackback block, but didn\u2019t believe the injury was serious.\n\nMore concerning for Washington: A concussion diagnosis for tight end Jordan Reed, who did not play in the second half, though he came out of the locker room for warm ups. Cornerback Josh Wilson missed time in the first half as he was being evaluated for a concussion, but returned to the contest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Washington Redskins were only whistled for four penalties in Sunday's crippling 24-16 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.
