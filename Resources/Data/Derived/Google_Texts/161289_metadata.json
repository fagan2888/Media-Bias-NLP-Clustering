ISIS\u2019 goal is to push the Christians out of the land that they claim as the caliphate.\u201d\n\nChristians fled Friday with little choice under the strict ISIS demand: Leave immediately, convert to Islam or be killed. Those who fled were robbed of all possessions with the exception of the \u201cclothing on their backs,\u201d according to CNN.\n\n\u201cIraqi Christians tragically have been the biggest losers in Iraq\u2019s recent meltdown,\u201d says Jim Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cChristians face a sectarian pogrom and a humanitarian nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe number of Christians in Iraq has severely dropped since the U.S. invasion in 2003, dropping from 1.5 million to 400,000 over the last ten years according to the Washington Post.\n\nMany of the abandoned Christian homes now have \u201cproperty of ISIS\u201d scribbled in black on the walls along with a red Arabic \u201cn\u201d signifying the Arabic word for \u201cChristian,\u201d marking a blatant branding all too reminiscent of previous genocides.\n\nISIS has also taken control of the 30 churches and monasteries in the city, according to the Assyrian International News Agency. The group removed all crosses from the churches, converting many of them into mosques or ISIS centers. Others have been looted, destroyed or burned to the ground.\n\nPhillips said the U.S. should work with Iraq and Turkey along with Kurdistan\u2019s regional government to ease the Christian and minority suffering. While concerted efforts by these governments to move refugees to safe areas in Iraq and protect Christians against ISIS aggression are necessary, Phillips doesn\u2019t see these actions as permanent solutions.\n\n\u201cThe crisis will continue as long as the Islamic state survives to enforce its harsh and brutal version of Islamic law,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe U.S. must help the Iraqi government defeat it militarily, drive a wedge between it and more moderate Sunni Iraqi rebel groups and chip away at its power in Syria by supporting rival Syrian rebel groups that already are fighting it there.\u201d\n\nThis article has been modified.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ISIS ultimatum that Christians leave Mosul to avoid purge expired Friday at noon, driving a reported 2,000 Assyrian families out of the area.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The ISIS ultimatum that Christians leave Mosul to avoid purge expired Friday at noon, driving a reported 2,000 Assyrian families out of the area.", "title": "ISIS Continues to Force Christians Out of Iraq", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140722_Christians_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-24T14:10:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/WF3jPZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The ISIS ultimatum that Christians leave Mosul to avoid purge expired Friday at noon, driving a reported 2,000 Assyrian families out of the area.", "title": "ISIS Continues to Force Christians Out of Iraq", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140722_Christians_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2014-07-23T17:11:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-24T14:10:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, Christians, Islamic State, ISIL, Mosul, Assyrian, Yohanna Moshe"}, "article_summary": "While concerted efforts by these governments to move refugees to safe areas in Iraq and protect Christians against ISIS aggression are necessary, Phillips doesn\u2019t see these actions as permanent solutions.\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ultimatum that Christians leave Mosul to avoid purge expired Friday at noon, driving a reported 2,000 Assyrian families out of the area.\nISIS has also taken control of the 30 churches and monasteries in the city, according to the Assyrian International News Agency.\nPhillips said the U.S. should work with Iraq and Turkey along with Kurdistan\u2019s regional government to ease the Christian and minority suffering.\n\u201cThe crisis will continue as long as the Islamic state survives to enforce its harsh and brutal version of Islamic law,\u201d Phillips said."}
