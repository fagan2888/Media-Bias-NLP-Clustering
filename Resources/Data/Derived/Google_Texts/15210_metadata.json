Crowds drape the perimeter of the civic center, huddling together to stay warm while they wait. Shards of glass sparkle in the parking lot, and participants beam as they talk about what their candidate will do for America. A man calls out, \u201cBomb the shit out of ISIS!\u201d The crowd, thickening by the minute, whoops in apparent agreement.\n\nIn many ways, the rally takes place before the Salesman even arrives. Enterprising eventgoers set up shop outside the civic center, offering their homemade wares to the highest bidder. One man displays his for-sale underwear, which read \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d on the rear. He says not to forget to check out his tie-dye shirts, and adds that he made all of these himself, that \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t get a penny of his profits,\u201d and that\u2019s \u201cexactly the way [he likes] it.\u201d Elsewhere, Hillary Clinton makes an appearance \u2014 usually in button form \u2014 wearing an orange pantsuit, her face partially obscured by prison cell bars.\n\nA female vendor, who said she traveled to Florence from Sarasota, Florida, and is selling baseball caps that feature \u201cThe Donald\u201d hair, tells me that she is voting for the Salesman because he is the one politician to say that if he makes a mistake, he will pay for it. She adds that this isn\u2019t her first rally for the candidate, either. \u201cWe follow him everywhere,\u201d she says, gesturing to her partner.\n\nA man in a sombrero briefly steps out of line, addressing everyone and no one in particular when he says that the country is $40 trillion in debt \u2014 but it might be closer to $100 trillion, actually \u2014 and that his candidate is the only person who can help dig the country out of it. When asked why he\u2019s sporting a sombrero, he says that approximately 40 percent of the Salesman\u2019s voters are Mexicans, who are legal in this country, and so he doesn\u2019t have a problem with them. He clutches his candidate\u2019s doll \u2014 still in the box \u2014 and laughs when he presses a button and the figurine says \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d in the colicky brusqueness that so many of the candidate\u2019s fans have come to love.\n\nAt 5 p.m. sharp, the civic center opens its doors to the public, and the crowd quickly files in, excited to see their star. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to the movies,\u201d one attendee says.\n\nAfter a prayer, two songs, and words from Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, the Salesman appears \u2014 and to the tune of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cRevolution.\u201d He holds up his thumbs \u2014 the bread and wine of this holy communion \u2014 and commands to his crowd of thousands, \u201cWe are going to make America great again.\u201d The Salesman then proceeds to praise himself for being the first to bemoan the menace of The Illegals, and thus \u201cmaking something happen.\u201d The audience does not respond. He then \u2014 and repeatedly \u2014 congratulates himself for being the only self-funded politician in the year\u2019s presidential race. The people applaud.\n\nThe Salesman continues to riff on this theme in pursuit of more praise, and then ventures into the topic of Medicare drug price negotiation. He receives no applause, and so the Salesman begins to talk about churches, and how \u201cChristianity is under siege.\u201d He has received his desired reaction: A plaintive chorus of \u201cBoo\u2019s\u201d reverberates throughout the auditorium. The Salesman, recognizing a winner when he sees it, proceeds to embed this into his pitch, using it to sculpt and sell his stances on immigration and ISIS to his believers, who at this point are increasingly responsive to his words. Politics, it would seem, is very similar to his business.\n\nIn the 1987 book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d the Salesman writes that in order to seal a transaction, he engages in what he calls \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d which he describes as an \u201cinnocent form of exaggeration.\u201d Essentially, the Salesman says, \u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies\u2026. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.\u201d He adds that he does this for one reason: effective promotion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I went to South Carolina to see Donald Trump in action.
