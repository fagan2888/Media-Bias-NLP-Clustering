But when a fracture is involved, often surgery is required.\n\nIt is not known yet how long Arenado will be out or how severely his finger is fractured.\n\nArenado came in to score the game\u2019s first run, but he did not come back out for the bottom of the second inning. He was replaced by Charlie Culberson.\n\nArenado, who earlier this season set a Rockies franchise record by hitting in 28 consecutive games, leads all major-league third basemen with 23 extra-base hits.\n\nAs he left the field, Arenado could be seen squeezing his finger.\n\nIn an apparent related move, the Triple-A Sky Sox pulled shortstop Josh Rutledge from the third inning against Memphis in Colorado Springs. He may be headed to Atlanta as Arenado\u2019s replacement on the 25-man roster\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nolan Arenado injures finger in Rockies\u2019 game at Atlanta", "title": "Nolan Arenado injures finger in Rockies\u2019 game at Atlanta", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/23/nolan-arenado-injures-finger-in-rockies-game-at-atlanta/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140523__RockiesBraves052314slidep1.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140523__RockiesBraves052314slidep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-23T19:34:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:37:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Rockies\u2019 official diagnosis was a \u201cleft mallet finger fracture.\u201dIn a general mallet injury, the tendon around a knuckle is torn and the remedy is wearing a splint for 6-8 weeks.\nAs he left the field, Arenado could be seen squeezing his finger.\nATLANTA \u2014 Bad things usually happen to the Rockies at Turner Field, but this could end up ranking as the worst.\nGold Glove third baseman Nolan Arenado, possibly headed toward his first All-Star Game appearance, suffered a fractured left middle finger Friday night while sliding head-first into second base with a double in the second inning.\nArenado came in to score the game\u2019s first run, but he did not come back out for the bottom of the second inning."}
