Is it a relic of a different era that should be repealed and replaced, or does its importance endure?\n\nAnn Yurcek\u2019s moving \u201cNarrative Matters\u201d essay in the September issue of Health Affairs demonstrates Medicaid\u2019s vital role in health care. Re-imagined a quarter century later, her story underscores just how much this vital role endures. Indeed, Becca Yurcek\u2019s very life is emblematic of the degree to which Medicaid goes where other payers fear to tread.\n\nAnn\u2019s Story\n\nThe events Ann Yurcek relates began nearly 25 years ago in 1989.\n\nFor readers familiar with Medicaid\u2019s role in American life \u2014 especially its role in that incredible space in which health and disability policy intersect \u2014 Becca\u2019s story is hardly uncommon. It started with young parents of a healthy and growing family, who were struggling to make ends meet even as a new baby was on the way. The father had begun a new job, but as a result of the peculiarities (a polite term under the circumstances) of the pre-reform insurance system, he was forced to pay for COBRA coverage at his old job even as he paid premiums at the new job \u2014 the new employer-sponsored health plan refused to cover Ann.\n\nWhen COBRA coverage was then abruptly (and illegally) cancelled midway through Ann\u2019s pregnancy, she turned to Medicaid. By 1989, because of bipartisan reforms enacted earlier in the decade under President Ronald Reagan, Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid program for pregnant women was sufficiently generous to come to her aid. But, because Becca Yurcek was born catastrophically ill, Medicaid\u2019s role did not end there.\n\nDuring the critical first year of Becca\u2019s life, the Yurceks endured the extraordinary practical and emotional burdens experienced by families of children with life-threatening conditions. For reasons that are inexplicable and lost to the mists of time, the family apparently was told that Becca could not qualify for Medicaid because infant coverage was less generous than coverage in pregnancy. (Medicaid\u2019s automatic newborn coverage rule should have protected Becca for the first months of her life, and spend-down coverage should have been available after that.)\n\nThe Yurceks battled to hold onto Medicaid for Becca. Mr. Yurcek literally impoverished the family, scaling back his work hours in order to maintain her coverage. When Becca was able finally to return home, she was discharged with seriously inadequate support.\n\nFollowing months of struggles by the Yurceks to maintain their medically frail baby with frequent emergencies, the hospital helped the family apply for a \u201cKatie Beckett\u201d waiver for the baby. Named after a little Iowa girl who grew into a vibrant young woman, and who devoted her far-too-short life to advocacy on behalf of persons with disabilities, the Katie Beckett waiver program was the conceptual brainchild of President Reagan who, appalled that a child like Katie could qualify for Medicaid only when institutionalized, ordered HHS Secretary Richard Schweiker to fix the problem (which HHS did via a \u00a71115 demonstration program, which ultimately became part of the Medicaid statute itself).\n\nToday, Ann Yurcek tells us, Becca is 23, an \u201camazing young woman.\u201d Living with a serious life-long disability, Becca defied the odds against her survival with the help of the abiding love and support of her remarkable family and medical care financed by Medicaid. Because of her disability, Becca presumably will continue to qualify for full Medicaid coverage.\n\nIn the context of the Affordable Care Act, Becca\u2019s story raises two obvious questions. First, what, if anything, about the story might change under the act? And second, what role would Medicaid play? Fully answering these questions requires deeper knowledge of the specific facts of her case and more space than provided a blog allows. But we can at least sketch the broad outlines of a post-reform landscape.\n\nReimagining Ann\u2019s Story\n\nImagine that Becca had been born, not in 1989, but in 2014. How might things be different?\n\nThe ACA bars insurers and employee benefit plans from refusing to cover pre-existing conditions such as pregnancy. Thus, were Ann eligible for her husband\u2019s plan, her pregnancy would be covered. But nothing in the Act compels employers to offer spousal coverage in the first place. Therefore, Ann might continue to depend on public insurance.\n\nIn that case, Ann presumably would complete a single, streamlined application to Minnesota\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplace and would be eligible either for Medicaid\u2019s continuing program for pregnant women or for coverage through a qualified health plan sold in the marketplace. The application process would be far simpler and more efficient than what she encountered in 1989. Depending on her income, Ann might pay a modest premium, and if her family income were under 250 percent of the federal poverty level, she would get help with cost sharing.\n\nAs for Becca, let\u2019s assume that Mr. Yurcek in fact had purchased family coverage for his children through his new employer. Becca would have been added to the plan from the moment of birth and without the application of any pre-existing condition exclusion. Furthermore, Becca\u2019s coverage under the plan would not have been subject to annual or lifetime financial limits. And beginning in 2015 (owing to the one-year delay recently announced by the Obama Administration), the family would also have been protected against excessive out-of-pocket expenses in connection with her covered care.\n\nHowever, certain challenges would remain.\n\nDepending on family income, the Yurceks might continue to face steep out-of-pocket costs for their catastrophically ill baby, given the limits of cost-sharing assistance. And these would be costs associated with covered services. In cases such as these, private health insurance would continue to fall far short of what a baby like Becca would need, both during childhood and into adulthood. The costs of uncovered services could be considerable, because of the inevitable limitations and exclusions that remain a fact of life under private health insurance, even after the ACA\u2019s considerable reforms.\n\nThese uncovered and excluded costs of care could take many forms: exclusion of round-the-clock home nursing to stabilize the baby and care for her during severe periods of illness; strict limits on the types of habilitative therapies that children like Becca often require; exclusion of respite care for the family; strict limits and exclusions on the types of medical equipment and basic medical supplies that could be covered; very limited prescription drug formularies; and other costs. Even post-reform, private insurance would continue to fall short for the Yurceks, covering standard health care needs but far, far off the mark for a child with intensive health care needs.\n\nMinnesota is one state that has chosen to expand Medicaid for low income adults. Even if it hadn\u2019t, Becca\u2019s disability would qualify her for ongoing Medicaid coverage into adulthood. Because Medicaid acts as a secondary payer in the case of individuals who have employer-sponsored coverage, it would \u201cwrap around\u201d her father\u2019s employer plan, paying for the treatments and therapies employer coverage does not offer. (However, had the family obtained subsidized private insurance coverage through the Markeplace, Medicaid would be barred from playing this supplementary role because of the ACA\u2019s anti-crowd-out provisions, which prevent families from receiving help through both subsidies and Medicaid).\n\nBecca\u2019s case drives home Medicaid\u2019s enduring role in the health care system. Medicaid remains the irreplaceable foundation on which a reformed private insurance market rests, one that absorbs the highest health risks within the insurance market. During Becca\u2019s childhood, the home and community care waiver, coupled with Medicaid\u2019s extraordinary coverage for children through its Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit, would allow her to develop and thrive. In adulthood, Becca would receive help through Medicaid\u2019s unequaled disability coverage, with the income level for the help she receives determined by the state.\n\nA Final Policy Question Worth Pondering\n\nA final question is worth exploring: What help will people like Becca receive after the Medicaid \u201cmaintenance of effort\u201d period expires? Under the ACA, states must maintain existing coverage levels for children (including more generous disability programs) through 2019. But for adults, this period expires once the Marketplace goes live. Will states continue to provide Medicaid to nonelderly adults with disabilities whose incomes surpass 138 percent of poverty? Or will states reduce their investments in low income adults with disabilities in order to make residents eligible for subsidized Marketplace coverage?\n\nBecca Yurcek\u2019s story underscores the urgency of this question. Despite the remarkable advances represented by the insurance reforms and marketplace coverage under health reform, children and adults like Becca will continue to need far more. The challenge that remains, therefore, is further modification of Medicaid to avert this Hobbesian choice; that is, a new option that permits states to either maintain Medicaid as a primary insurer for persons with disabilities as they do today, or alternatively, to use Medicaid to supplement Marketplace coverage for people with disabilities. In this way, people with disabilities can take full advantage of the new insurance market while continuing to offer essential health care protections for their most vulnerable residents.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/09/27/against-all-odds-what-one-familys-experience-tells-us-about-medicaids-enduring-role/", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "title": "Against All Odds: What One Family\u2019s Experience Tells Us About Medicaid\u2019s Enduring Role"}, "description": "Against All Odds: What One Family\u2019s Experience Tells Us About Medicaid\u2019s Enduring Role  | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd71f9\"", "article_summary": "Ann Yurcek\u2019s moving \u201cNarrative Matters\u201d essay in the September issue of Health Affairs demonstrates Medicaid\u2019s vital role in health care.\nFor readers familiar with Medicaid\u2019s role in American life \u2014 especially its role in that incredible space in which health and disability policy intersect \u2014 Becca\u2019s story is hardly uncommon.\nBecca\u2019s case drives home Medicaid\u2019s enduring role in the health care system.\nBut, because Becca Yurcek was born catastrophically ill, Medicaid\u2019s role did not end there.\nIndeed, Becca Yurcek\u2019s very life is emblematic of the degree to which Medicaid goes where other payers fear to tread."}
