As training camp grinds on through the hot summer, players get sick of practicing against each other.

The Broncos and Houston Texans came up with a remedy by agreeing to practice against each other for three days prior to their third preseason game, Saturday, Aug. 23 at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

The two teams will practice against each other during the final days of training camp — Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday on Aug. 19, 20 and 21 — then take a Friday break from each other before playing their preseason game on Saturday night.

Unfortunately for Bronco fans, they will not be allowed to attend the practices with the Texans. Broncos’ training camp is closed to the public because of construction. To make it up to fans, the team announced in April that it will hold three practices that will be open to the public at Sports Authority Field, on July 27, July 30 and Aug. 2.

The Texans are led by defensive linemen J.J. Watt, No. 1 overall draft pick Jadeveon Clowney and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick

The Broncos practiced during training camp against the Texans in Houston in 2003 and 2005, and the Dallas Cowboys in 2007 (in 112-degree Irving, Texas) and 2008 (at Dove Valley).
