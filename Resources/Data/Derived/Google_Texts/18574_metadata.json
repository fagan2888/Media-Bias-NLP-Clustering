Schneiderman announced that the ridesharing app Uber has agreed to cap its prices during emergencies in order to comply with the state's price gouging laws.\n\nSchneiderman seems pretty pleased with himself, and he's even got a quote from a highly domesticated version of bad-boy Uber CEO Travis Kalanick as a trophy in his press release. But Uber's customers and drivers should be pretty pissed off.\n\nRight now, Uber uses dynamic pricing to encourage drivers to come out when demand is high or conditions are unappealing. The app warns users that they will be paying higher prices and lets them estimate the cost of their ride before clicking the button to summon a car. But that kind of disclosure isn't enough for New York's regulators.\n\nAccording to the press release:\n\nNew York\u2019s law against price gouging (General Business Law \u00a7396-r), was passed in the winter of 1978-79 in response to escalating heating oil prices. It defines an \u201cabnormal disruption of the market\u201d as \u201cany change in the market, whether actual or imminently threatened, resulting from stress of weather, convulsion of nature, failure or shortage of electric power or other source of energy, strike, civil disorder, war, military action, national or local emergency, or other cause of an abnormal disruption of the market which results in the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor.\u201d During an abnormal disruption of the market, all parties within the chain of distribution of any essential consumer goods or services are prohibited from charging \u201cunconscionably excessive prices.\u201d\n\nWhat this means for New Yorkers: Assuming Uber doesn't have a behind-the-scenes plan to bump driver pay in times of crisis, fewer drivers are going to heroically schlep out to the far reaches of Brooklyn when it's snowy or subway strike-y. That means customers who would be willing to pay still can't get a ride and drivers who would be willing to work will stay at home instead.\n\nUber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick said this, hinting at broader implementation nationwide:\n\n\"This policy intends to strike the careful balance between the goal of transportation availability with community expectations of affordability during disasters. Our collaborative solution with Attorney General Schneiderman is a model for technology companies and regulators in local, state and federal government.\"\n\nAw. So warm and fuzzy. To be fair, Kalanick was probably trying to forestall a worse deal for his company and his customers in this negotiation.\n\nBut just as a reminder, here's Kalanick on regulators in 2012:\n\n\u201cEvery city we go to eventually the regulators will make something up to keep us from rolling out or continuing our business,\u201d he told an audience at TC Disrupt in San Francisco.... Kalanick...waxed philosophical about what it is that drives regulators in his industry specifically. \u201cI have been trying to understand the regulators,\u201d he said, and he\u2019d decided that they work on three levels \u2014 none too good. \u201cOne is cronyism,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get a Stockholm Syndrome with the folks they regulate\u2026 One even told me that they view themselves as customer support for the taxi and livery companies.\u201d Number two: \u201cIf they don\u2019t have rules they feel it is illegal,\u201d he said. This is the knee-jerk, err-on-the-side-of-caution approach that Uber has currently been fighting. Number three will sound familiar to anyone who has covered regulation in many other areas, like technology: \u201cThey are incredibly sensitive to what\u2019s the public view, the optics rather than the reality,\u201d Kalanick said.\n\nSigh.\n\nBonus: Here's the super-simple system Uber will be expected to use to determine a fair price during emergencies, as described in the agreement:\n\nClear as mud.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "This afternoon, New York Attorney General Eric T.
