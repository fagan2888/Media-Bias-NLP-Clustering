Under the bill, they would be allowed to treat, diagnose and prescribe medications without that oversight, so long as they were affiliated with a medical group. Those unaffiliated with a medical group would not be able to practice on their own.\n\nThe bill's author, Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), said SB 323 is meant to help ensure access to health care in the face of a looming provider shortage as millions more people get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The need will be especially acute in rural and inner city areas, he added.\n\n\"We need to make better use of the trained healthcare workforce we already have if we are ever going to meet demand, and nurse practitioners are some of the best trained people in that workforce,\u201d Hernandez asserted in a statement.\n\nIn California, only 16 of 58 counties have the recommended ratio of physicians to residents, according to the senator.\n\nSB 323 has garnered the support of the California Association of Nurse Practitioners, which considers it a step towards complete independence in the future. Nurse Practitioners have master\u2019s, and in some cases doctorate, degrees.\n\nThe California Medical Association - which represents doctors - opposes the bill, arguing that it could undermine the team approach to health care.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "SB 323 would let nurse practitioners affiliated with a medical group operate without a physician's oversight.
