The store opened an hour early, at 8 a.m., and reduced prices by 40 percent. A similar sale took place at the Maine Prison Industries outlet store in Windham, which cut prices 30 percent.\n\nThe Thomaston showroom attracted dozens of cars full of patrons in its first hour as buyers ogled ornamental wooden ball-and-chain sets and priced out porch furniture. Bookshelves, children\u2019s toys, paintings, cutting boards, rocking horses and even models of the USS Constitution \u2014 all made as part of an inmate work program \u2014 were also on sale to the public.\n\nItems range from $1.95 pencil holders to a $100,000 sculpture of the Roman god Neptune and a mermaid riding a motorcycle. The USS Constitution models, which retail for $2,150, were sold out by midday Friday.\n\nMaine Prison Industries manager Ken Lindsey said sales from the work program total more than $1 million per year. Prisoners are paid $1 to $3 per hour, which must first go toward court restitution and child support payments, but more importantly, the program teaches inmates job skills and people skills that they can use upon release, Lindsey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black Friday special: prison handicrafts", "title": "Black Friday special: prison handicrafts", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Black Friday special: prison handicrafts", "title": "Black Friday special: prison handicrafts", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/black_friday_special_prison_handicrafts/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/prison-crafts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black Friday special: prison handicrafts", "title": "Black Friday special: prison handicrafts", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/prison-crafts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patrick Whittle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d9c\"", "article_summary": "Maine Prison Industries manager Ken Lindsey said sales from the work program total more than $1 million per year.\nFriday\u2019s sale at the Thomaston showroom, located four miles from Maine State Prison in Warren, resembled a traditional Black Friday sale in many ways.\nA similar sale took place at the Maine Prison Industries outlet store in Windham, which cut prices 30 percent.\nThe Thomaston showroom attracted dozens of cars full of patrons in its first hour as buyers ogled ornamental wooden ball-and-chain sets and priced out porch furniture.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsTHOMASTON, Maine (AP) \u2014 Ken and Judy Carreras got up before sunrise and drove an hour to find their Black Friday treasure \u2014 an acorn-shaped birdfeeder crafted by an inmate at Maine State Prison."}
