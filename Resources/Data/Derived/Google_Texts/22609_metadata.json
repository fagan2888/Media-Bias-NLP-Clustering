I just have a lot to say so I\u2019m going to go pretty quickly here.\n\nYou know, America is a land of dreams, and it has fulfilled dreams of so many people from so many places. As a child, you know, I had a dream of becoming a physician. I loved anything that had to do with medicine: Dr. Kildare, Dr. Casey, anything, you know. I even liked going to the doctor\u2019s office, so it tells you I was pretty weird.\n\nBut what an incredible career it provided for me. If somebody had sat me in front of a keyboard and said, \u2018I want you to type out the career you want to have,\u2019 I could not have come up with a better scenario, because we live in a land of opportunity, because I had a mother who was no excuses, and because I believed in God. And those are really incredible things.\n\nI thought last year when I retired that I was going to learn to play the organ and learn some new languages and play golf. Well, I think the good Lord had a different plan, and I\u2019m not sure what the culmination of that plan is, but I am having a good time and Candy is having a good time as we go all over the country: red states, blue states, north, south, east, west.\n\nEnormous, enthusiastic crowds coming out, and it\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u201cYou mean there\u2019s somebody else with common sense, I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d\n\nWell here\u2019s the good news: The majority of people in this country have common sense, the problem is they have been beaten into submission.\n\nYou know, the PC police and all these people, and people are afraid to speak up for what they believe and, you know, one of the principles of Saul Alinsky is you make the majority believe that what they believe is outdated and nobody thinks that way and the way that they think is the only way intelligent people think.\n\nAnd if you can co-opt the media in the process, you\u2019re far ahead of the game. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened, and it\u2019s time for people to stand up and proclaim what they believe and stop being bullied.\n\nYou know, one of the most wonderful things. You know, people say, \u2018Don\u2019t you miss medicine?\u2019 Well, I miss what medicine used to be, I don\u2019t miss what it has become. But I do miss the patients, but the good thing is I\u2019ve operated on so many thousands of patients there\u2019s virtually no where that I go that I don\u2019t get to see some of them, so it\u2019s actually a wonderful thing to be able to get involved in people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe most important thing that they have is their health care, and that is the reason that we need to fight to make sure that stays in their hands and not in the hands of the government.\n\nYou know, medicine prepared me for out-of-the-box thinking, and it prepared me for a lot of controversy. You know, I got involved in doing, you know, new procedures and, you know, there was some people who didn\u2019t like that very much, but I\u2019ll tell you the difference.\n\nIn medicine, we actually talked about it. We talked about the differences. We talked about the evidence and the facts, and when the facts were shown, people made adjustments.\n\nUnfortunately, that does not happen in a political world because you\u2019re dealing with ideologues. They don\u2019t care how many facts you show, they just believe what they believe. And they want to keep doubling down on it. And the only people who could stop them are us, the American people. This is where it lies.\n\nNow as you know, I am not a fan of political correctness. I hate politically correctness. I will continue to defy the PC police who have tried in many cases to shut me up. You know, I actually find them pretty amusing.\n\nI still believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. You know, because I happened to mention that nobody gets to change the definition of marriage and mention some other categories, they said, \u2018Carson said that gay marriage and bestiality are the same thing.\u2019\n\nWell, that\u2019s preposterous, of course they\u2019re not the same thing. Anybody who believes that is a dummy, but anybody who believes somebody who said that somebody said that is a dummy. You know, that\u2019s the problem, okay.\n\nAnd then, of course gay people should have the same rights as everyone else, but they don\u2019t get extra rights. They don\u2019t get to redefine marriage.\n\nAnd then I said that Obamacare was the worst thing since slavery. Now, let me tell you why I said that. Of course, they said, \u2018Carson said that slavery and Obamacare are the same thing.\u2019 Of course they\u2019re not the same thing; slavery is much worse.\n\nBut, bear in mind. What happens with Obamacare? We, the American people, have with that program shifted the power that was given to us by the Constitution and by the founders to the government. It\u2019s the most massive shift of power in America that has ever occurred.\n\nThat\u2019s why we need to redo it. We need to put the power back in the hands of the people, and we need to make sure we keep it there.\n\nAnd then, recently, I said that in Nazi Germany, people did not believe in what Hitler was doing, most of them didn\u2019t. But did they speak up, did they say anything? Absolutely not. And look at the atrocities that occurred.\n\nAnd, of course, the left says, \u2018Carson says progressives are Nazis and that they are changing American into Nazi Germany.\u2019 Well, of course that\u2019s not the case, but that\u2019s what they do.\n\nThey repeat these lies over and over again because they cannot argue the actual facts. They don\u2019t want to talk about the real issues.\n\nAnd it\u2019s important for the American people to understand the tactics of these people who simply sit around and try to demonize people. Comes straight out of the book: \u2018Rules for Radicals,\u2019 by Saul Alinsky.\n\nHe said never have a conversation with your adversary because that would humanize them and you\u2019re job is to demonize them. That\u2019s why you see that all over. Intelligent people will understand that, because, you know, I find that, you know, there are so many people that get intimidated so easily. Stop being intimidated.\n\nYou know, I look at somebody like Dr. Melanie Cooper who is having a banquet a week from tonight in Atlanta: New Community Horizons, Victory over Diabetes. She\u2019s a wonderful woman who is concerned for the welfare and health in that community, and there are some organizations there that are telling people to boycott her, not to support her.\n\nWhy? Because I\u2019m coming to be the speaker, and they say we don\u2019t want him spewing his poison, particularly to the young people.\n\nWell, I wonder what kind of poison that would be. Would that be the poison of self-reliance and self-respect that people should have?\n\nWould that be the poison of telling people in minority communities that they need to learn how to turn over the dollar a few times in their community before they send it out and that\u2019s how you create wealth? You should reach back and pull others with you, and if you do that you don\u2019t have to depend on anybody else.\n\nWould it be the poison of talking about how education is the key, and that you don\u2019t have to be a victim? It\u2019s a matter of your mind and what you decide to do, and the most important person when it comes to your future is you and the decisions that you make?\n\nThis is America. We are free. We can do that.\n\nAnd most importantly, would it be the poison of putting what God says in front of what any man says? Think about that.\n\nYou know, we have the debut of a new black conservative magazine called \u2018CurrentSee.\u2019 It will be starting this Monday. It\u2019s an e-magazine through The Washington Times.\n\nBut you\u2019re going to see a different point of view, and it\u2019s not going to be about being victims. It\u2019s going to be about how we use our collective intellect and our resources to move up. And that\u2019s what all of us as conservatives should be emphasizing.\n\nNot like some other people to keep people down and keep a voting bloc. We want everybody to move up, and I\u2019m going to go there, let me tell you, I don\u2019t believe in political correctness. I\u2019m going to go there to the 47 percent, because I used to belong to the 47 percent, I belong to the 5 percent. I belong to the 1 percent, but I made the way up there, and I know there are a lot of people in the 47 percent who are decent, hardworking Americans who want to realize the American dream, and we\u2019re here to make sure that they do it.\n\nWe\u2019re going to bring them up.\n\nAnd, the other thing, so important, Save our Healthcare, part of the American Legacy PAC. And I thank all the people who have signed the petition, over 200,000 already. Keep signing, we want millions of people because, see, the left wing says the reason why people don\u2019t like Obamacare is because it doesn\u2019t go far enough. That\u2019s not true.\n\nSign that petition. Show them that we don\u2019t like it. We want it changed. We want something better. We want the health care in our own hands. We can do it. We pay twice as much per capita for health care in this country than the next closest nation. We can easily do this. We have a lot of alternatives. You\u2019ll be able to read about them on the American Legacy PAC.\n\nAnd then, the other thing I can\u2019t go without saying. 17 and a half trillion dollar national debt. Think about the implications of that. The only reason why we can do that is because our currency is the basis of the international reserve currency system and we can print money.\n\nYou now, if Greece could print money, they wouldn\u2019t be in trouble either. You know, in the 5th century B.C. they could, you know. It was a drachma. And they did, they were the currency, but that was a long time ago, and they\u2019ve been pretty irresponsible. We\u2019re being just as irresponsible, quite frankly.\n\n17 trillion. Do you know how long it would take to pay that off if you paid $10 million a day? 4700 years. That is absolutely absurd. We are killing the next generation. We have to think about that.\n\nAnd what did Putin say last week? He said, We, Russia, if you put sanctions on us, we may just decide that the American dollar will no longer be the reserve currency that we use.\n\nQuite frankly, that\u2019s not going to hurt us very much with just Russia. It\u2019ll probably hurt them more than it would hurt us, but what if they get other people to do that? China has voiced some concerns. The U.N. committee in 2010 voiced some concerns. It\u2019s because we are irresponsible, and the only way we can get out of that is we have to know who our representatives are and the ones who are voting to raise that debt ceiling \u2014 get them out of office and make a place for somebody else.\n\nYou know, I have several other things to say, but my time has expired, but one of the things that is so important for conservatives: The ship is about to sail off Niagra Falls and we\u2019re all going to be killed. And we got a bunch of people looking over the side of the ship and they\u2019re saying, But there\u2019s barnacles on the side, we\u2019ve got to get the barnacles off.\n\nForget about the barnacles. We got to get the ship turned around first, and, you know, when we get through with the primary season, if you\u2019re person hasn\u2019t won \u2014 and you can call them whatever you want to call them, you can call them a RINO, you can call them a tea bagger, you can call them whatever you want \u2014 vote for them, okay. We need those people. Okay? We need them.\n\nAlso, we have got to get back to the same mentality that Americans had in the pre-Revolutionary days. They got together with their friends and with their neighbors and their associates, and they talked about what kind of America do we want to have. What do we want to pass on to our children? And they encouraged each other. And that\u2019s how a bunch of ragtag militia men defeated the most powerful army in the world at that time.\n\nYou need to go out and talk to people, everybody you know. Have the discussion. Don\u2019t let the left shut you up. Everybody needs to talk about what we are doing and what we want to have as a nation. Encourage each other.\n\nTalk to your 87-year-old aunt who hasn\u2019t voted in 20 years. Go and make sure that she understands what the issues are. If she\u2019s an invalid, make sure she signs up for an absentee ballot. If you need to go and help her fill it out, go and help her fill it out. Get all of those people, bring them back to the fold.\n\nI run into particularly elderly people all the time, all over the country. They say I\u2019ve given up on America. I\u2019m just waiting to die. We have got to bring them back in. The Greatest Generation can help us save this nation once again.\n\nFinally, you think about the people who sacrificed so that we can be free. I could talk about a lot of them, but you can read about them in our book, \u2018One Nation.\u2019 And I know the left will say, He\u2019s just hawking his books, all he wants is money.\n\nI\u2019ve got plenty of money. That\u2019s not the problem. But, you know, what we need are action steps. We have action steps to help people, every American citizen to get involved and [get back] to having a country that is for, of and by the people. We can get it back, but we have to be brave.\n\nThink about those people during World War II. Nations falling like dominoes, one by one. The whole world coming under tyranny except for one thing: this nation, the United States of America that sent young men from the cities and suburbs of this country to fight a war on two fronts of the world. A country that sent young women into the factories to build more airplanes, tanks and mortars than anybody could imagine. A country that through its strength, and its might, and its determination changed the course of the world.\n\nYou want to tell me we\u2019re not an exceptional nation? You go jump in the lake. That is absolutely not the case.\n\nWhy were they willing to fight? Why, on D-day, did those guys storm the shores of Normandy, being mowed down by machine gun fire? Hundreds, thousands, stepping over their comrades, overwhelming the Axis powers. They did it because they wanted you to have a land that was free. They didn\u2019t do it so that you can have a land where our leaders pick and choose the laws that they want to enforce, a land where we pick winners and losers. They did it so we can have a nation where there was freedom and justice for all.\n\nAnd the next time you sing the national anthem, when you get to the end of that first stanza and it says \u201cthe land of the free and the home of the brave,\u201d don\u2019t just let those words roll off your tongue. We must remember we cannot be free if we are not brave.\n\nThank you, and God bless you.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Casey, Ben Carson", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/21/ben-carson-at-cpac-the-speech/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/09/3_9_2014_z-pk46886-030813358201.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Ben Carson at CPAC: The speech"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/09/3_9_2014_z-pk46886-030813358201.jpg", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ben Carson at CPAC: The speech"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95d0\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s speech at CPAC, March 8 in National Harbor, Maryland:Well, thank you for that very warm welcome.\nYou know, people say, \u2018Don\u2019t you miss medicine?\u2019 Well, I miss what medicine used to be, I don\u2019t miss what it has become.\nYou know, that\u2019s the problem, okay.\nWe want everybody to move up, and I\u2019m going to go there, let me tell you, I don\u2019t believe in political correctness.\nOf course, they said, \u2018Carson said that slavery and Obamacare are the same thing.\u2019 Of course they\u2019re not the same thing; slavery is much worse."}
