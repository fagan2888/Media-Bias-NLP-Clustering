Back in 2012, Rush Limbaugh famously attacked Sandra Fluke, then a college student advocating for contraception coverage, as a \u201cslut\u201d because \u201cShe's having so much sex she can't afford contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.\"\n\nI assume that many and hopefully most conservatives don\u2019t think the way Erickson and Limbaugh do. They object to the contraception mandate on more principled grounds. They think it encroaches upon their idea of religious freedom\u2014or, in some cases, because they think universal health care generally violates their sense of liberty. But I wouldn\u2019t assume Erickson and Limbaugh are total outliers, either. I\u2019ve never seen polling on this precise question, so I can\u2019t be sure, but I suspect a large fraction of conservatives would make the same basic argument that Erickson and Limbaugh have, albeit with more delicate language. If people want to have non-procreative sex, they would argue, then these people should pay for their own birth control\u2014or deal with the consequences. (Update: Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican, just did.)\n\nA few responses come to mind. For starters, women sometimes use contraception for reasons that have nothing to do with birth control. They need it to deal with medical conditions like abnormal bleeding or pelvic pain. (Zoe Fenson writes about that at the New Republic today.) Sometimes women need the most expensive forms of birth control, implants and inter-uterine devices, because oral contraceptives give them severe side effects. As my colleague Rebecca Leber pointed out yesterday, the ability to plan and time pregnancy has very real health benefits, for individuals and for the public at large. That is why the medical establishment recommended that \u201cessential benefits\u201d under Obamacare include contraception in the first place. And, of course, non-procreative sex is something in which the vast majority of people, married and unmarried, engage. If Erickson wishes to raise moral questions about that practice, directly or indirectly, he can. He\u2019s not going to have much company.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Say this for Erick Erickson, the Fox News pundit and editor of RedState: He tells you what he\u2019s thinking.On Monday, after the Supreme Court announced its ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, Erickson used Twitter to summarize his interpretation of the decision: \u201cMy religion trumps your \u2018right\u2019 to employer subsidized consequence free sex.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time a prominent conservative in the media s...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Why were so many women angry on Monday?
