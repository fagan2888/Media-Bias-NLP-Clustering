Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania supports a boost in the minimum wage. On the Democratic side, former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont are promoting a raft of benefits for the middle class, including free or subsidized college tuition, an increase in the minimum wage, jobs programs and funding for child care.\n\nCities and states are also attempting to address the persistent economic disparity. In June, California\u2019s state senate approved a bill to raise the minimum wage from $10 an hour to $11 an hour next year. The previous month, the city of Los Angeles voted to increase it its minimum wage from $9 an hour to $15 an hour by 2020, in a major victory for labor groups. Several other cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Oakland and Washington, D.C. have also approved increases, and many more are considering following suit.\n\nWhile state and local officials ponder other ideas for addressing the plight of the middle class, many of them are puzzling over a mystifying part of the problem: At the same time the income gap has widened between the middle class and the wealthy, economic growth in virtually every state has outpaced any gains in median household income.\n\nRelated: New Yorkers in favor of raising minimum wage to $15 per hour: poll\n\nIn other words, median-income families remain stuck in a rut even as the economies of their states are taking off after years of recession and retrenchment.\n\nThis disconnect between economic growth at the state level and median income was described in a recent analysis by Stateline, a publication funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The gaps differ from state to state, depending on local economic circumstances and investment strategies, the study found. But the bottom line is a notable contradiction between statewide economic growth and stagnant middle-class income.\n\n\u201cThe divergence between middle-class income growth and general economic growth has been a topic of debate among economists for years,\u201d according to Stateline. \u201cBut the new analysis\u2014which uses state gross domestic product per person as a measure of economic growth and income data through 2013, the most recent available\u2014reveals significant differences between states that often reflect their differing economies.\u201d\n\nFor instance, some of the biggest gaps between economic and median income growth were found in states with booming energy industries, such as North Dakota and Wyoming. Others in that category include Alaska, Louisiana and Nebraska, according to the study. The states with the narrowest gaps include Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho and Nevada.\n\nRelated: The Politics of Economics and \u2018Very Serious People\u2019\n\nThe District of Columbia was the only place where the median household income outpaced growth in the economy. A 2013 report by EPI found that \u201cknowledge-based economies\u201d like those in the nation\u2019s capital and in Massachusetts could prosper through a well-educated workforce.\n\nExplanations for this phenomenon vary \u2013 but integral to all of them is the fact that the rich are getting richer while median income and lower income people are getting poorer, relatively speaking. Lane Kenworthy, a sociologist at the University of California at San Diego, says in the Pew report that as the top one percent of income earners have amassed a larger portion of the country\u2019s total wealth, \u201chousehold income growth for the middle class has become decoupled from economic growth.\u201d\n\nMark W. Frank, a professor of economics at Sam Houston University in Texas who has done extensive research in this area, agrees that the stubborn disparity between middle and upper income Americans has a lot to do with the situation on the ground in many states.\n\n\u201cYou get some of these good state growth numbers that are coming out, but a lot of the good growth that comes from the states is highly correlated with what\u2019s going on with the top one percent of the population,\u201d Frank said in an interview. \u201cSo when the top one percent does pretty good, it just so happens that the state is generally doing really good too.\u201d\n\nRelated: Walmart Changes the Debate on Minimum Wage\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon over the last few decades now is that if you take out that growth in the income of the top one percent, the bottom 99 percent aren\u2019t growing nearly as much,\u201d he added. \u201cSo when you take a statistic by median income in a state or in the United States, you can see it\u2019s pretty flat.\u201d\n\nFrank said that he and other economists don\u2019t fully understand the economic dynamic at play here, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think we really have a strong grasp on the underlying mechanisms that are causing that \u2013 and what can be done to help those income gains at the top filter down through to the system.\u201d\n\nRelated: FOMC statement from Sept 16-17 meeting\n\nKenworthy said in an interview that while there are things that can be done at the state and local level to address these inequalities \u2013 including raising the minimum wage and providing middle-income people with tax credits, early education programs, job training and paid parental leave \u2013 the heavy lifting will have to come from Washington in the form of major tax reform and a uniform boost in the minimum wage.\n\nNone of that is likely to happen until after the 2016 election, at the earliest.\n\nThe Federal Reserve can help as well, he added, by continuing to focus more on the problem of unemployment than inflation.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest things that could help is that the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t panic and worry about inflation too soon,\u201d he said. The Fed decided late last week to keep short-term interest rates near zero as a hedge against a possible decline in the economy later this year \u2013 a good move as far as Kenworthy is concerned.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s willing to let unemployment go a bit lower, we might actually begin to see some real wage increase, just like we did in the late 1990s,\u201d Kenworthy said. \u201cThat\u2019s totally a national rather than a state government issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In another troubling sign of the wage stagnation bedeviling middle-class Americans, th", "title": "Where\u2019s My Raise?
