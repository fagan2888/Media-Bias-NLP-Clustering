It\u2019s working despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund and defame this law.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn particular, Obama highlighted a government report that showed that fewer mistakes in hospitals saved the lives of 50,000 people between 2011 and 2013, which the White House partly attributed to initiatives to reduce accidental overdoses, bedsores and patient falls.\n\nThe remarks came just two days after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz promised to repeal \u201cevery word of Obamacare\u201d in a speech launching his presidential campaign, the first Republican to join the 2016 race.\n\nObama took the opportunity to take a few shots at Republican critics of the law, joking that \u201cdeath panels, doom, [and] a serious alternative from Republicans in Congress\u201d have all failed to materialize and challenging candidates campaigning for repeal to explain how \u201ckicking millions of families off their insurance\u201d will strengthen the country.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that the Affordable Care Act works as intended to not only deliver access to care but to improve the quality of care and the cost of care, thats something that requires us all to work together,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "President Obama argued that the Affordable Care Act is working and challenged Republican critics on the fifth anniversary of the law.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "He argued it's increasing insurance rates, saving lives.", "title": "Obama on Obamacare: 'It's Working'", "url": "http://time.com/3757902/obama-affordable-care-act-anniversary/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/barack-obama4.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/barack-obama4.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Obama on Obamacare: 'It's Working'", "description": "He argued it's increasing insurance rates, saving lives.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, barack obama, anniversary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, barack obama, anniversary,"}, "article_summary": "President Obama had a simple message on the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act: It\u2019s working.\n\u201cThis law is also saving lives, lives that touch all of us.\n\u201cMaking sure that the Affordable Care Act works as intended to not only deliver access to care but to improve the quality of care and the cost of care, thats something that requires us all to work together,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking in the Executive Office Building next to the White House, Obama argued that his signature health care law was \u201cworking better than many of us \u2014 including me \u2014 anticipated\u201d at increasing health insurance rates and improving the quality of care.\n\u201cThe bottom line is this for the American people: this law is saving money for families and for businesses,\u201d he said."}
