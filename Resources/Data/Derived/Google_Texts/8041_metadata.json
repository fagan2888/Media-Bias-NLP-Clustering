A total of 70 people showed up.\n\nDena Wiberg says H & R Block has devoted a new computer program to help her estimate how much you may owe or get back depending upon your health insurance this year.\n\n\u201cIf you've gone though Nevada Health Link, Access to Healthcare, any of those will provide you with a document that you will need to complete your taxes. Most insurance companies will reflect on your W2 for if you have insurance through your workplace or that type of thing,\u201d says Wiberg, who is the office manager at the Wells Avenue office.\n\nFor those who thought they'd only have to pay $95 if they didn't buy insurance? Wilberg says that's only partially true.\n\nIt could be $95 per adult member of your household claimed on your tax return and $47.50 for dependents under 18 OR 1% of the household taxable income--whichever amount is greater.\n\nFor those who overestimated what they made in 2013 for 2014 health insurance, they may receive a tax return.\n\nFor those whose income status changed during the year and they didn't make changes in their health insurance, they could get a refund or owe money.\n\nFor those who underestimated their income and received a government subsidy in 2014 to pay for health insurance, they may owe the government money.\n\nWiberg says you can stop by the office and get a free estimate if you'll owe money this year because of the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nAll you will need to bring is your last paycheck stub of 2014.\n\nFor those who don't have health insurance over the next two years, the penalties are only going to increase. In 2015 instead of 95 dollars, it will go to $325 per adult or 2%.\n\nIn 2016 it jumps to $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Internal Revenue Service says this tax season may be one of the most complicated in recent history.
