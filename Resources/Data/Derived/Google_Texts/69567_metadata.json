But that\u2019s part of the good sense. Familiarity with the people being maligned is an excellent source of evidence against the allegations being made against them. Mr. Agema and his acolytes should get out more and see the reality of the people they\u2019re talking about. Stereotypes are like battle plans: They never survive contact with the enemy.\n\n\n\nFormer Michigan House Majority Floor Leader Chris Ward, R-Brighton, recently wrote about an \u201cuncomfortable truth\u201d Agema\u2019s supporters must consider.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of, if not the most, effective and successful strategists our party has are people who Dave Agema would consider \"filthy\" or in a more polite term, live an alternative lifestyle,\u201d he said.\n\nFor every Michigan political hack who pulled more than his or her share of the burden toward GOP policy victories over the last two decades, this isn\u2019t even a remotely controversial statement.\n\n\n\nCreation and expansion of school choice, Right to Work, business tax cuts, budget reform, defeat for the worst of Granholm\u2019s economic agenda, and much more were all accomplished with irreplaceable help from a very talented, small army of political professionals who prefer to lay their head down at night next to somebody of the same gender.\n\n\n\nThe GOP social agenda doesn\u2019t keep them on the job, and neither does a delusional committeeman publicly declaring them to be disease-riddled insurance cheats.\n\nWard notes their real motive: \u201cThey believe in smaller government and free markets\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nYup. In 2009, when thousands of tea party demonstrators gathered at the Michigan Capitol to support those principles, the gay staffers were there, smiling, joining the crowd at lunchtime, and snapping photos from their offices. The tea party was then their movement too.\n\n\n\nThey were the professionals behind the scenes who worked tirelessly during the 2010 election to create the massive GOP majorities in the House and Senate that made wins like Right to Work even thinkable. They are also the loyal soldiers who soberly took one for the team, saluted quietly, and did what they were told when a (soon to be shrinking) Republican House majority tried (and failed) to vote a proposal to ban gay marriage onto the 2004 ballot.\n\n\n\nAnother irony: Just like their straight coworkers, they often find their way into stable, committed relationships. And they\u2019re living healthy lives, often well past 40, contrary to what Mr. Agema would tell you when he cites his neo-Nazi \u201cexpert\u201d regarding homosexuals. Indeed, while Agema was on the floor of the Michigan House, doubtlessly in his early stages of worrying over how gays have sex, many of them were dutifully helping him get his bills passed and his image enhanced.\n\nToday, Michigan\u2019s tea parties often derail from their once reliable march against ObamaCare and dance to Agema\u2019s gay bashing drums instead. Not surprisingly, gay GOP operatives now see the tea party with more critical eyes. And the tea party can hardly draw much of a crowd anymore, despite ObamaCare being more hated than ever. (Hm\u2026 coincidences?)\n\nMany Republicans owe these people a \u201cthank you\u201d AND an apology. But the gay GOP professionals are just that: Professionals. They\u2019ll get by if the movement they love just shows some class and stops supporting charlatans who accuse them of being rabid, disgusting pests.\n\n\u201cWe \u2026 are the party of the individual,\u201d says Ward. \u201cLet\u2019s treat individuals with some respect.\u201d\n\nKen Braun was a legislative aide for a Republican lawmaker in the Michigan House and worked for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.
