Financial settlements — which when fully paid out will total roughly $18 million — were received by several families who lost loved ones and property during a 2012 prescribed burn that escaped containment, state officials said Tuesday.

The late-winter burn — known as the Lower North Fork fire — quickly grew out of control. It killed three people and consumed 4,100 acres and about two dozen homes.

Reports gathered after the fire showed a lack of communication between dispatchers and residents led to delayed evacuations and emergency response.

Victims of the fire had been fighting for years for compensation from the state, which they see as liable for the blaze’s destruction. Legislation that allowed for payouts exceeding a mandated cap was signed into law in June allotting the liability funds.

One man is set to be paid nearly $5 million for the loss of his wife and business, according to the law.

“I’m relieved to see that those victimized by the fire are finally receiving the settlements from the state that they deserve,” state Sen. Jeanne Nicholson, D-Gilpin, said in a statement.

“While no monetary compensation can bring back the property or lives lost, these payments represent a critical step forward in doing what we can to offer justice to the families affected by this tragedy.”

The payments are due to be distributed by September.
