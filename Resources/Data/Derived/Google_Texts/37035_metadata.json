In the guide, Maine lobsters are tagged with a \u201cyellow\u201d label, as something that\u2019s a good alternative, but not a best choice, because of the possible effects on the right whale. Yet some species of shrimp, farmed in Southeast Asia under murky conditions that recent news reports say include slavery, are given a \u201cgreen\u201d label \u2014 meaning it is a best choice for diners.\n\n\u201cThe Gulf of Maine lobster is extremely sustainable,\u201d Coombs said. \u201cOur fishermen work very hard, and I think of my husband and other lobstermen, and how well they treat their sternmen. It\u2019s a slap in the face to be considered yellow.\u201d\n\nThat Seafood Watch guide from the aquarium assesses the environmental impact of fisheries and fish farms, and does not incorporate social issues, according to a message posted on its website that encourages people to find more information from the organizations that do. But for Coombs and two nationally known writers who spoke in Belfast on Friday, the issue should not be stratified or simplified.\n\n\u201cWhere things are so complicated, how are you trying to break these things down into three colors?\u201d Coombs said.\n\nPaul Greenberg, a New York Times bestselling author whose most recent book is called \u201cAmerican Catch: The Fight For Our Local Seafood,\u201d had words that echoed hers. He told attendees of Belfast\u2019s Maine Fare on Friday that even though the United States is the country that controls the most ocean in the world, it imports more than 75 percent of its seafood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, what we are eating,\u201d he said Friday at the Belfast Boathouse, during the keynote talk for the two-day-long event put on by the Maine Farmland Trust. \u201cWe send wild-caught salmon to China, frozen. They defrost it, fillet it, freeze it and send it back to us. What kind of system is that?\u201d\n\nHe and Barton Seaver, an author and director of the Healthy and Sustainable Food Program at the Harvard School of Public Health, co-presented the address, called \u201cWhy We Need To Eat More Local Seafood.\u201d\n\nSeaver, who also is a chef and National Geographic Society Explorer, said that Americans eat only about 15 pounds of seafood a year, most of that the popular species of shrimp, tuna and salmon. He said that the choices people make for dinner have collapsed economies, when desirable species are overfished.\n\n\u201cWe are not sustaining our planet, and we are not sustaining ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t help when guilt-stricken people, anxious about the food they\u2019re eating, look too far afield for dinner.\n\n\u201cWe get so worried, we go the world over for sustainably fished cod,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created this system so inherently based on species.\u201d\n\nBoth Seaver and Greenberg said that eating locally caught seafood, including species that often go overlooked \u2014 like skate\u2014 may help decrease some of the pressure on the oceans. It is also critical, they said, to help fishermen and fishing communities, such as the ones that dot the Maine coast. A sharp decline in fish markets means that consumers are used to purchasing packaged and often frozen fish in the grocery store.\n\n\u201cIt presents us with a faceless product with no history, no intimacy, to it,\u201d Greenberg said.\n\nBut he is hopeful that consumers already interested in locally farmed food, and meeting their farmers, will also want to meet their fishermen \u2014 and help to sustain local fishing communities and fisheries.\n\nIt matters, Seaver said.\n\n\u201cOur health and that of our children are wholly dependent on oceans,\u201d he said. \u201cOur oceans are amazingly resilient, if we let them be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BELFAST, Maine \u2014 \u201cSustainable\u201d is one of those words that can be easily misused, especially when it comes to the idea of a sustainable fishery.
