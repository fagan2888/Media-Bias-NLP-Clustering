WASHINGTON– Sarah Palin gave a glowing social media shoutout today to Katrina Pierson, throwing her support to Pierson’s bid to unseat Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas.

“A feisty fighter for freedom, Katrina is taking on a powerful incumbent who has so lost touch with the people of his district that he’s not even bothering to spend much time in Texas anymore,” Palin posted on her Facebook page. “It’s not only his district he’s lost touch with, but also the issues important to the voters there. He used his powerful position to oppose the movement to defund Obamacare, has voted to raise the debt ceiling, and has been an advocate for the NSA intrusion into our freedoms.”

Critics have charged Sessions with spending less time in his district than in Florida, where his wife lives. Palin’s attacks echo those from Pierson, who says that Sessions lacks commitment to conservative values and hasn’t fought hard enough to cut government spending and repeal Obamacare.

Palin, a one-term Alaska governor and 2008 GOP nominee for vice president, remains a star in tea party circles. She urged conservatives to take advantage of early voting to cast ballots for Pierson.

She also put her support behind Greg Abbott in his race for governor.

Pierson is hoping to rev up tea party support. She’s basked in the praise of Sen. Ted Cruz, and collected a more explicit endorsement from his father, Rafael Cruz.

Sessions, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee and a member of the House GOP leadership, remains the favorite, with fundraising that vastly overshadows that of his rival.
