Because they\u2019d found no evidence of dumping of unused drugs, they evaluated figures from the national dispensary database from 12 months before to three months after the study. \u201cFor a conservative estimate, we assumed that there were no losses in sewage due to degradation,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nAfter comparing measurements and estimates, the team discovered at least 60 percent of the Viagra in the sewage treatment plants could not have resulted from legitimate prescriptions so, they concluded the \"unexplained portion\" must have resulted from illegal drugs. \u201cThe illicit fraction was similar for each city, despite major differences in tourism and commuting,\u201d the authors noted. \u201cIf our results are representative of other communities, the consumption of illicit erectile dysfunction drugs might dwarf the consumption of the legitimately dispensed versions.\u201d The team believes \"rogue online pharmacies\" are worthy of continued exploration.\n\nOnline Pharmacies and Illegal Websites\n\nLast year, BMJ reported a record number of counterfeit and unlicensed drugs seized in the United Kingdom as part of an international crackdown on illegal Internet trade. The operation, coordinated by Interpol, involved 99 countries and resulted in 9,600 illegal online websites being shut down or suspended. The authorities also seized 9.9 million doses of unlicensed and fake drugs and arrested 58 people worldwide. The counterfeit drugs included erectile dysfunction, weight loss, cancer, acne, and depression pills. The previous year, 18,000 illegal websites had been shut down.\n\nMost recently, a seventh seizure sponsored by Interpol took place between May 13 and May 20, 2014. According to the Food and Drug Administration, this effort resulted in \u201cthe detention or seizure of 19,618 packages containing medicines purportedly from Australia, the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand and Canada.\u201d The seized packages contained suspected counterfeit drugs from India, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Mexico, Laos, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.\n\nNimo Ahmed, acting head of enforcement for a UK regulatory agency, told BMJ many of the websites looked professional and featured a photograph of a doctor wearing a white coat and stethoscope. Most were feeder sites, with thousands of such sites feeding into one anchor site. A website may be registered in China and hosted in Russia, he explained, with drugs coming from all over the world.\n\n\u201cWhen people buy medicines from an illegal website they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting, where it came from, or if it\u2019s safe to take,\u201d Ahmed said. The dose could be dangerously high or simply too low and ineffective. \u201cIn addition to health risks, these pharmacies pose other risks to consumers, including credit card fraud, identity theft or computer viruses,\u201d said Douglas Stearn, director of the FDA's Office of Enforcement and Import Operations.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "viagra without prescription, online pharmacies, prescription drugs, illegal internet trade, pharmaceutical drugs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "At least 60 percent of Viagra found in sewage treatment plants must have resulted from illegal use of the drug, Dutch researchers hypothesize.", "title": "2 Out Of Every 3 Viagra Pills Used Are Not Prescribed", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/using-viagra-without-prescription-dwarfs-legitimate-use-same-true-other-prescription-drugs-291276", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/online-pharmacies.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least 60 percent of Viagra found in sewage treatment plants must have resulted from illegal use of the drug, Dutch researchers hypothesize.", "title": "2 Out Of Every 3 Viagra Pills Used Are Not Prescribed", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/using-viagra-without-prescription-dwarfs-legitimate-use-same-true-other-prescription-drugs-291276", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/online-pharmacies.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/03/online-pharmacies.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-07-03T10:56:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T10:56:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "At least 60 percent of Viagra found in sewage treatment plants must have resulted from illegal use of the drug, Dutch researchers hypothesize."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf78e\"", "article_summary": "At least 60 percent of Viagra found in sewage treatment plants must have resulted from illegal purchases of the drug, Dutch researchers hypothesize.\nThe previous year, 18,000 illegal websites had been shut down.\nThe operation, coordinated by Interpol, involved 99 countries and resulted in 9,600 illegal online websites being shut down or suspended.\nAfter comparing measurements and estimates, the team discovered at least 60 percent of the Viagra in the sewage treatment plants could not have resulted from legitimate prescriptions so, they concluded the \"unexplained portion\" must have resulted from illegal drugs.\nOnline Pharmacies and Illegal WebsitesLast year, BMJ reported a record number of counterfeit and unlicensed drugs seized in the United Kingdom as part of an international crackdown on illegal Internet trade."}
