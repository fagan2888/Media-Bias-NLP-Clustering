Hagan hits, then embraces Obama\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan beat up President Barack Obama before he arrived in town, then showed up at the airport to give him a kiss on the cheek.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of balance Hagan\u2019s trying to strike in a state where Obama\u2019s still very popular in some parts that helped her win in 2008, but dragging her down so much elsewhere that she\u2019s one of the Democrats\u2019 most vulnerable incumbents.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHagan issued an advanced draft of her speech to the American Legion here before Obama arrived, charging that the president \u201chas not done enough\u201d to restore trust after the Veterans Affairs scandal broke earlier in the summer, adding that the administration still \u201chas a long road ahead.\u201d She was scheduled to address the convention Wednesday afternoon.\n\n( Driving the Day: Florida gubernatorial primary recap)\n\nThat does not appear to have been the message she delivered to Obama, whom she greeted with a smile and an embrace as he came down the stairs at the North Carolina Air National Guard base.\n\nRichard Burr, the Republican who\u2019s Hagan\u2019s fellow North Carolina senator, also greeted the president as he arrived, offering his own handshake-embrace.\n\nNeither rode with Obama in the presidential limousine for his brief trip to the convention center here to address the American Legion himself.\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Campaign committee strategist Brad Dayspring said Hagan\u2019s greeting was a perfect portrait of Hagan\u2019s relationship with Obama.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 tough Senate races for Democrats)\n\n\u201cMore surprising than the tarmac embrace has been last few days of harshly worded Hagan press releases, considering her near unanimous support for this administration over the last five years,\u201d Dayspring said. \u201cThe big hug should be even less surprising considering the extent to which Kay Hagan is depending on President Obama and his allies to finance her campaign.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Obama traveled to Charlotte, White House press secretary Josh Earnest shrugged off the criticism from Hagan, chalking it up to her being an \u201cindependent voice.\u201d\n\nEarnest said Obama isn\u2019t concerned about being a drag on Hagan.\n\n\u201cThe president over the course of the last two elections has outperformed expectations in North Carolina,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThe president has a pretty deep reservoir of political support here in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nEarnest added that if Obama is asked to campaign for Hagan, \u201che won\u2019t hesitate to do it.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)\n\nOpinion was divided at the American Legion convention.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done a fine job, and she\u2019s supported veterans,\u201d said David Lewis, a Hagan supporter who\u2019s an Army veteran and was part of the North Carolina delegation. Asked if he thought she was being pulled down in the polls by the president, Lewis said, \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut Richard Neville, another Army veteran who\u2019s originally from Minnesota but moved to North Carolina in 1998, wouldn\u2019t say who he\u2019s supporting. He did say the race would be \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people in North Carolina are not pleased with the Obamacare, and Kay Hagan supported that, and I know that\u2019s one of the things that the opposition\u2019s thrown back at her,\u201d Neville said. \u201cWhether that will affect the election, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA poll last week from Public Policy Polling showed Hagan holding onto a narrow, but shrinking, lead over State House Speaker Thom Tillis, 42 percent to 38 percent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She\u2019s trying to strike a balance in a state where Obama\u2019s popular, but drags her down elsewhere.", "title": "Hagan hits, then embraces Obama", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/kay-hagan-president-obama-north-carolina-110356.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/08/26/140826_kay_hagan_barack_obama_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,North Carolina,Kay Hagan", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She\u2019s trying to strike a balance in a state where Obama\u2019s popular, but drags her down elsewhere.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hagan hits, then embraces ObamaCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 Democratic Sen.
