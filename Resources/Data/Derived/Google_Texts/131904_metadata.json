The enemy comes from within\u2014and wears a white hat.\n\nThis week, a French food blogger was issued an absurd fine of more than $2,000 for publishing a negative review of a restaurant there.\n\nBut it\u2019s the country\u2019s controversial \u201cfait mason\u201d law, which also debuted this week, that best demonstrates the troubled state of the country\u2019s restaurants.\n\nThe professed purpose of the law is to promote fresh French cooking, which has been on the wane for years.\n\nMore than half of the country\u2019s restaurant revenue last year came from fast food restaurants and sandwich shops. One figure claims nearly one-third of restaurants and bistros use packaged ingredients to prepare meals. A poll taken last year suggests the number is much higher.\n\nDespite\u2014or thanks to\u2014this data, nearly three-quarters of French polled state that they\u2019re happy with restaurant meals there.\n\nThe fait maison law, passed earlier this year, requires all restaurants throughout the country to put the word homemade\u2014\u201cfait maison\u201d\u2014on menus.\n\nSo just what constitutes \u201chomemade\u201d under the law? Food may be labeled as fait maison \u201conly when it\u2019s made in-house from fresh ingredients.\u201d\n\nThat sounds simple\u2014if costly and pointless. But it\u2019s an annoyingly complex law.\n\nThe law requires each restaurant menu to state that \u201chomemade dishes are made on site from raw produce\u201d\u2014even those that sell no such dishes. The law further requires that restaurants that serve only homemade food must display the words \u201cfait maison\u201d or display the fait maison logo\u2014which appears to have been drawn to resemble a character from The Terrance and Phillip Show. Restaurants that sell foods that contain foods made from scratch and those that aren\u2019t must describe on the menu whether each dish is fait mason or not.\n\nInspectors will attempt to enforce the law beginning later this year.\n\nOne segment of French society\u2019s that\u2019s unhappy with the law is France\u2019s chefs, among whom it\u2019s \u201ccausing a revolt.\u201d In some cases at least, it appears some are unhappy because the law isn\u2019t strict enough\u2014what with most frozen foods being exempt.\n\nOther critics contend that France\u2019s mandatory 35-hour workweek and high labor costs\u2014rather than the provenance of restaurant ingredients\u2014are the reasons the country\u2019s restaurants are in decline.\n\nSupporters of the fait maison law claim it will have several benefits. Among those benefits, supporters claim the law will create jobs by forcing restaurants to cook more of their food from scratch.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s more likely to have the opposite effect\u2014at least in the short term. If consumers truly want homemade food, and discover that restaurants are light on such options, they\u2019re more likely to stay at home and cook themselves. Alternately, less discriminating consumers who learn that their food isn\u2019t made from scratch might just opt to stay home and heat their dinner in the microwave.\n\nThe real winner, in either case, would be France\u2019s supermarkets.\n\nOther supporters paint the law as a Jose Bove-like stand against fast and \u201cindustrial\u201d food.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cthe government\u2019s way to protect diners from the many industrially prepared dishes served in most places and that are damaging the country\u2019s culinary reputation,\u201d writes Luxemborg-based Forbes contributor Cecelia Rodriquez.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "France\u2019s restaurants and French cooking are under attack.
