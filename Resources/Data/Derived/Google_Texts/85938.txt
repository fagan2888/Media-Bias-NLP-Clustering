Pushchair reviews

At Which? we've tested hundreds of pushchairs so we know exactly what to look for when we review and rate a new one.

A Best Buy pushchair will have passed our stringent safety tests with flying colours, and also earned the approval of our parent panel. It will be smooth to push on different types of ground, easy to steer around corners and a doddle to get up and down kerbs.

The best pushchairs we've tested are simple to fold and unfold, keep your little one comfortable, and have useful features such as lockable swivel wheels and adjustable backrests and leg support. The worst ones are awkward, tricky to use, and lacking in genuinely helpful features.
