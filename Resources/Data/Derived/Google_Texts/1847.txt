In his “Real Time” monologue last night, Bill Maher addressed the Supreme Court’s monumental marriage equality decision — and of course, used the opportunity to take some jabs at homophobic GOP candidates.

“Of course, the Republican candidates for president are all against this—but they took the news with grace and good will. I’m joking, of course. They all went completely ape-shit and said crazy things,” said Maher, who went on to elaborate on some of the GOP’s anti-gay marriage talking points.

“‘We will not honor any decision,’ Rick Santorum said, ‘which will force us to violate our clear, biblical understanding.’ Mike Huckabee said, ‘The Supreme Court can’t overrule God.’ Bobby Jindal said, ‘This ruling paves the way for an all-out assault on religious freedoms of Christians.’ Fellas, you do realize that this is not mandatory. You don’t have to have sex with another man—it’s just an option now. OK, I just wanted to make that clear,” said Maher, adding with a grin “they’re such drama queens, aren’t they?”
