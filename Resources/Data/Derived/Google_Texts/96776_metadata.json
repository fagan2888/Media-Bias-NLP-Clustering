(Jenni Grubbs / Fort Morgan Times)\n\nOver the last four years, the class of 2015 had many moments when they wondered if they would make it through high school and reach graduation, according to Co-Salutatorians Ashley Lauck and Lia Shaver.\n\n\"I'm looking at 171 people who made it! How does that feel?\" they asked their classmates Saturday in their speech at graduation.\n\nIn his speech, Valedictorian Joseph Smits explained that he thinks his class was perfect because of how adaptable they had been over the years.\n\nAs evidence, he pointed out, \"This is the first time in 30 years we've had to move graduation indoors.\"\n\nThat was only one of many obstacles \u2014 hopefully the last one \u2014 the class of 2015 had to overcome, he said.\n\nFort Morgan High School Class of 2015 Valedictorian Joseph Smits told his class they had overcome many obstacles to reach graduation on Saturday, May 23, 2015. \"Now, all I see is success, potential and the best years of our lives in front of us,\" Smits said. \"I'm proud of all we've accomplished, and how we've grown into the perfect class.\" (Jenni Grubbs / Fort Morgan Times)\n\n\"Now, all I see is success, potential and the best years of our lives in front of us,\" Smits said. \"I'm proud of all we've accomplished, and how we've grown into the perfect class.\"\n\nFort Morgan High School Principal Ben announced that the class of 2015 had amassed more than $873,000 in scholarships for the coming year.\n\nCommencement speaker the Rev. Kelly Cupples of Life Fellowship Church in Fort Morgan quoted Ernest Hemingway: \"True nobility is being superior to your former self,\" telling the graduates to \"feed your soul\" in whatever ways made sense to their lives.\n\nAnd, putting the emphasis on the last syllable of each word, Cupples urged the class to \"stay mobile, agile, hostile and remember that you're fragile.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfterward, Cupples said he felt \"very honored\" to have been asked to be the commencement speaker.\n\n\"It was just a lot of fun,\" he said.\n\nAlso part of the fun was the Fort Morgan High School Jazz Band's performance of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" and the Morgan High Singers' rendition of Five for Fighting's \"100 Years.\"\n\nFor Bauman, seeing this class graduate was special but also a bit bittersweet.\n\nLia Shaver receives her diploma and shakes hands with Morgan County Re-3 School District Superintendent Ron Echols at Fort Morgan High School graduation Saturday in the FMHS gymnasium.

(Jenni Grubbs / Fort Morgan Times)\n\n\"This is always the top of my year, seeing all of their accomplishments,\" the principal said after the streamlined, one-hour-long graduation ceremony was finished.\n\nGetting a bit emotional, he pointed to a special connection he had with this class.\n\n\"I've been following them since Baker (Central School),\" he said. \"This is my last group. They're a special group.\"\n\nIt also was an emotional time for the graduates and their families and friends, as evidenced by a lots of tear-filled faces, yells of congratulations as names were read and they walked across the front, receiving their diploma from Superintendent Ron Echols and shaking hands with Board of Education President Rogelio Segura and Bauman.\n\nAnd after the names were all read, tassels moved to the other side of the mortar boards, and the caps flung in the air, it was time for the 171 FMHS graduates to head out, first to parties and then into the world.\n\nJenni Grubbs: jgrubbs@fmtimes.com, Twitter @JenniGrubbs or tout.com/jennigrubbs", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-05-25T19:54:38-0600", "modificationDate": "2015-05-26T12:01:02-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2015/0525/20150525__26ftFMHSgraduation~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jenni Grubbs \n \n  Times Staff Writer", "description": "Over the last four years, the class of 2015 had many moments when they wondered if they would make it through high school and reach graduation, according to Co-Salutatorians Ashley Lauck and Lia Shaver.", "ag": {"canon": "FortMorganTimes:article:28187506:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2015/0525/20150525__26ftFMHSgraduation~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Over the last four years, the class of 2015 had many moments when they wondered if they would make it through high school and reach graduation, according to Co-Salutatorians Ashley Lauck and Lia Shaver.", "title": "Fort Morgan sends off 171 graduates"}, "twitter": {"domain": "fortmorgantimes.com", "description": "Over the last four years, the class of 2015 had many moments when they wondered if they would make it through high school and reach graduation, according to Co-Salutatorians Ashley Lauck and Lia Shaver.", "title": "Fort Morgan sends off 171 graduates", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2015/0525/20150525__26ftFMHSgraduation~1.jpg", "site": "@fortmorgantimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-25T19:54:38-0600", "sailthru.site": "fortmorgantimes.com", "endDate": "2025-05-25T19:57:19-0600", "sailthru.title": "Fort Morgan sends off 171 graduates", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Jenni GrubbsTimes", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "eft02te25vH0XbQ44RHik-QVdSWBMa6FaMX67tqgeec", "verify-v1": "LR4Od6pVdw+l77OvOjnTMA990zoSdsdx5+1eNeWXVCw=", "y_key": "87220ae8e8f6d27d", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site32/2015/0525/20150525__26ftFMHSgraduation~3.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-05-25T19:56:22-0600", "news_keywords": "Fort Morgan news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, The Fort Morgan Times"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11ce\"", "article_summary": "Also part of the fun was the Fort Morgan High School Jazz Band's performance of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" and the Morgan High Singers' rendition of Five for Fighting's \"100 Years.\"\nLia Shaver receives her diploma and shakes hands with Morgan County Re-3 School District Superintendent Ron Echols at Fort Morgan High School graduation Saturday in the FMHS gymnasium.\nClass of 2015's college scholarships total $873KNewly minted Fort Morgan High School graduates throw their caps in the air Saturday in celebration of their big accomplishment.\nFort Morgan High School Principal Ben announced that the class of 2015 had amassed more than $873,000 in scholarships for the coming year.\nFort Morgan High School Class of 2015 Valedictorian Joseph Smits told his class they had overcome many obstacles to reach graduation on Saturday, May 23, 2015."}
