The pope\u2019s grandfather fought in Italy\u2019s 1915-17 offensive against the Austro-Hungarian empire waged in the nearby battlefields, surviving to impress upon the future pope the horror of war.\n\nAn Italian defense ministry official presented the pope with his grandfather\u2019s military record during the commemorations, and the parents of an Italian soldier killed in Afghanistan last year presented Francis with the distinctive feathered Bersagliere cap worn by the Piedmontese corps, famed for a rugged endurance epitomized by their tradition of marching at a jog.\n\nFrancis\u2018 grandfather, who hailed from the Piedmont region, belonged to the corps, said Redipuglia parish priest the Rev. Duilio Nardin.\n\nThe military records showed that the pope\u2019s grandfather, Giovanni Carlo Bergoglio, was a radio operator during the Isonzo campaign aimed at piercing the Austro-Hungarian defenses. The 12 battles are memorialized at the Redipuglia monument which was dedicated by Italy\u2019s Fascist government in 1938 on the eve of World War II.\n\nThe elder Bergoglio, who was drafted at age 31 as Italy entered the war, obtained a certificate of good conduct and 200 lire at the war\u2019s end, according to documents discovered by the Italian bishops\u2019 conference\u2019s media outlets. With postwar Italy\u2019s economy stalled, he emigrated to Argentina where the future pontiff - Jorge Mario Bergoglio - was born.\n\nThe pope in the past has recalled the \u201cmany painful stories from the lips of my grandfather.\u201d\n\nBefore arriving at the monument, the pope prayed privately among the neat rows of gravestones for fallen soldiers from five nations buried in a tidy Austro-Hungarian cemetery just a couple of hundred of meters (yards) away.\n\nIn his homily during an open-air Mass at the Italian monument, the pope remembered the victims of every war \u2014 up to today.\n\n\u201cToday, too, the victims are many,\u201d fallen to behind-the-scenes \u201cinterests, geopolitical strategies, lust for money and power,\u201d the pope said.\n\nHe lamented that the human toll of \u201csenseless massacres\u201d and \u201cmindless wars\u201d has been met with apathy. Francis urged: \u201cHumanity needs to weep, and this is the time to weep.\u201d\n\nThe enduring impact of World War I, 100 years on, is evident in the visitors who continue to make pilgrimages to the monument, although in ever decreasing numbers, said Fogliano di Redipuglia Mayor Antonio Calligaris.\n\n\u201cThe Repiduglia sanctuary until 20 years ago was always full of visitors, but it has been forgotten by institutional memory,\u201d Calligaris said. \u201cThe papal visit is very important because it renews attention on this history.\u201d\n\nDays before the papal visit, several dozen mostly elderly visitors scaled the 22 granite levels reaching dramatically upward toward three towering crosses that point skyward. The largest Italian war memorial, Redipuglia entombs 100,000 Italian soldiers killed in battle, 60,000 whose identity remains unknown and 40,000 who were identified.\n\nThe nearby Austro-Hungarian cemetery, one of several in the area, contains 14,406 dead from five nations that fought under the Austro-Hungarian empire, only 2,406 identified. Among recent tributes is a Hungarian flag signed in July by relatives of a soldier named Istvan Arnter, who died on Nov. 20, 1917.\n\nMany visitors to the Italian monument search the engraved names for their forbears.\n\n\u201cThey are making a lot of saints these days. Even popes,\u201d said Margherita Braga, 52, of Brescia, who was visiting the site with her Italian military veteran husband. \u201cBut for me, these are the real saints.\u201d\n\nJust two levels up from the altar where Francis stood, the name of a fallen soldier named Adolfo Bergoglio is engraved in a wall. Nardin, the local priest, said he is not believed to be related to the pope. But World War I historian, Col. Lorenzo Cadeddu, who has found two Bergoglios listed among the Italian casualties of World War I, said it remained a possibility.\n\n\u201cBergoglio is not a common name,\u201d Cadeddu said. \u201cIt is likely that they are related.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope Francis urged the world Saturday to shed its apathy in the face of what he characterizes as a third world war, intoning \"war is madness\" at the foot of a grandiose monument to soldiers killed in World War I.", "Author": "Colleen Barry, Luca Bruno", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Pope Francis urged the world Saturday to shed its apathy in the face of what he characterizes as a third world war, intoning \u201cwar is madness\u201d at the foot of a grandiose monument to soldiers killed in World War I.", "title": "Pope: Global chaos looks like \u2018piecemeal\u2019  World War III", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/13/popes-wwi-tribute-infused-with-personal-ties/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/13/italy-pope-wwijpeg-02a86.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/13/italy-pope-wwijpeg-02a86.jpg", "title": "Pope: Global chaos looks like \u2018piecemeal\u2019  World War III", "description": "Pope Francis urged the world Saturday to shed its apathy in the face of what he characterizes as a third world war, intoning \"war is madness\" at the foot of a grandiose monument to soldiers killed in", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Redipuglia, Francis, Giovanni Carlo Bergoglio, Italy"}, "article_summary": "But World War I historian, Col.
