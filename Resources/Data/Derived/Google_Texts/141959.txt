Syracuse, N.Y. -- I am answering readers' questions about the state's new health insurance exchange that opens Oct. 1 and other aspects of Obamacare.

Here's another one:

I have medical coverage under my husband's employer's plan, but I am also offered coverage from my employer. Under Obamacare, can his employer refuse to cover me since my employer offers me the option of medical coverage? -- Donna Britton

A growing number of employers are doing this to save money, but it is not required by Obamacare. UPS recently told workers it would no longer offer coverage to spouses who have their own job-based coverage. In its memo to employees, UPS said it is doing this to offset anticipated higher costs related to Obamacare.

Employers looking to control health care costs began rethinking their policies on spousal coverage before the passage of the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. While some are dumping spouses who can get coverage through their own employers, others are making employees pay more for spousal coverage.
