Or cynicism. Or some kind of ism. Any kind of ism... except the liberalism that is really responsible.\n\nAn estimated seven out of every 10 physicians in deep-blue California are rebelling against the state's Obamacare health insurance exchange and won't participate, the head of the state's largest medical association said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't surprise me that there's a high rate of nonparticipation,\u201d said Dr. Richard Thorp, president of the California Medical Association.\n\nCalifornia offers one of the lowest government reimbursement rates in the country -- 30 percent lower than federal Medicare payments. And reimbursement rates for some procedures are even lower.\n\nIn other states, Medicare pays doctors $76 for return-office visits. But in California, Medicare\u2019s reimbursement is $24, according to Dr. Theodore M. Mazer, a San Diego ear, nose and throat doctor.\n\nIn other states, doctors receive between $500 to $700 to perform a tonsillectomy. In California, they get $160, Mazer added.\n\nOnly in September did insurance companies disclose that their rates would be pegged to California\u2019s Medicaid plan, called Medi-Cal. That's driven many doctors to just say no.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "You're about to trade your health plan for a very expensive Medicaid plan", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "You're about to trade your health plan for a very expensive Medicaid plan", "title": "7 Out of 10 California Docs Boycott ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/212591/7-out-10-california-docs-boycott-obamacare-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:19-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/212591/7-out-10-california-docs-boycott-obamacare-daniel-greenfield", "description": "You're about to trade your health plan for a very expensive Medicaid plan", "card": "summary", "title": "7 Out of 10 California Docs Boycott ObamaCare"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-06T13:47:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8e3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt doesn't surprise me that there's a high rate of nonparticipation,\u201d said Dr. Richard Thorp, president of the California Medical Association.\nCalifornia offers one of the lowest government reimbursement rates in the country -- 30 percent lower than federal Medicare payments.\nIn other states, doctors receive between $500 to $700 to perform a tonsillectomy.\nBut in California, Medicare\u2019s reimbursement is $24, according to Dr. Theodore M.
