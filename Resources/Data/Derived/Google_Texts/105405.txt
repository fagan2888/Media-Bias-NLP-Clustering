Sioux Falls, SD

Farm management specialists in the Dakotas say corn farmers will likely face per-acre losses this season with high seed, land and fertilizer costs eating up any potential profits from low commodity prices.



South Dakota Center for Farm/Ranch Management director Jared Hofer says some grain farmers either broke even or faced small losses last year, but this year's spread between input costs and sale prices will likely widen. Hofer says revenue is about half of what it was three years ago, but expenses are just as high.



NDSU Extension farm management specialist Andrew Swenson says the total production cost for a bushel of corn in North Dakota will likely be about $4, though expected higher yields could bring that cost down to about $3.80. Unfortunately, bushels will likely sell for $3.10.
