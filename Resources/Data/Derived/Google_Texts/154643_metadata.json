Imagine that this system claims to be charitable, but in practice \u201cprovides only an average amount of charity care,\u201d and serves fewer low-income people than comparable institutions. At the same time, this system offers legal protection for denying women life-saving healthcare.\n\nThe system in question is the array of Roman Catholic-affiliated hospitals in the United States, which, according to a new report from the American Civil Liberties Union and MergerWatch, now are responsible for one in nine hospital beds. In the past decade, the number of such hospitals has risen by 16%, thanks to mergers that often leave the new combined organization under Catholic health care directives.\n\nAccording to the authors of Miscarriage of Medicine report, released Thursday, such hospitals \u201chave organized into large systems that behave like businesses \u2013 aggressively expanding to capture greater market share \u2013 but rely on public funding and use religious doctrine to compromise women\u2019s health care.\u201d The report notes that \u201cif these 10 Catholic systems were viewed as one, they would constitute the largest health system in the country.\u201d\n\nMost people are familiar with Catholic prohibitions on elective abortion, but don\u2019t realize how the directives affect a range of reproductive services. They encompass denying access to emergency contraception to rape victims, refusing to perform tubal ligations on women who are having cesarean sections, declining to offer prenatal diagnosis if there is an \u201cintention of aborting an unborn child with a serious defect,\u201d and putting miscarrying women at risk of infection by refusing to end a non-viable pregnancy.\n\nThe ACLU recently brought a suit against the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, on behalf of a woman who miscarried at a Catholic hospital in Michigan. They charge that Tamesha Means was put at further risk by Catholic directives prohibiting abortion that were also applied to involuntary miscarriage.\n\nMany of these Catholic health organizations are the same ones who say their own religious values are being trammeled by the Obama administration. Under the Affordable Care Act, religious institutions like churches, which primarily employ or serve fellow members of their religion, can opt out of the requirement to cover contraception if it violates their beliefs. Medical associations and universities that are affiliated with the Catholic church but have employees that don\u2019t follow its teachings on contraception were granted an accommodation that allowed employees to get their contraception directly covered by the insurer. But several such organizations have sued the administration, claiming their religious freedom rights are still being violated by the third-party accommodation because they\u2019re still technically involved in their employees getting contraception. On Monday, a federal district court judge in New York agreed, saying the accommodation still violates the religious freedom of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, and granting them a permanent injunction.\n\nLast month, MergerWatch director Lois Uttley participated in a discussion about Catholic hospitals and women\u2019s healthcare on Melissa Harris-Perry.
