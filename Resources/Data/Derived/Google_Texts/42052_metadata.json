Rape prevention activists praised the effort as a good way to communicate how consent works in practice.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly clear that teaching people to understand all of the angles of consent \u2014 how to give it, how to take it away, and how to recognize when either of those things are happening \u2014 is a good way to instill the cultural approach to sexuality that helps prevent sexual crimes. A recent international study on rape found that many male rapists don\u2019t understand that they don\u2019t automatically have a right to take control of women\u2019s bodies, and those unhealthy attitudes take root at an early age. To combat that, sexual assault prevention advocates recommend thoroughly instructing young men and women about their bodily autonomy and how they can navigate around the boundaries of physical consent.\n\nBut consent is a concept that doesn\u2019t just begin and end with sexual assault. Pervasive cultural attitudes toward other areas of sexual and reproductive health reveal that Americans could learn how to better apply it elsewhere, too.\n\nAt the heart of the anti-choice movement is a lack of understanding of what it means to consent. Ultimately, denying women the access to the reproductive services they want is forcing them to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term without their consent. It\u2019s preventing them the basic right to make their own choices about what happens to their body. And even though Roe technically still stands, this violation of bodily consent is still happening all the time. Even when state-level restrictions to abortion care don\u2019t ban the procedure outright, they often still end up limiting women\u2019s right to make their own decisions about their bodies.\n\nFor instance, when states impose mandatory waiting periods before women are allowed to have an abortion, that forces women to remain pregnant longer than they want to and would have otherwise. There\u2019s no reason to deny women the right to choose that medical procedure immediately. Studies have shown that nearly 90 percent of women are \u201chighly confident\u201d about their decision to end a pregnancy when they first approach a doctor, and being forced to wait extra time doesn\u2019t change their mind.\n\nSome women are forced to put off their abortion procedure until they can receive an ultrasound procedure that they haven\u2019t actually consented to. That\u2019s one of the clearest images of a violation of consent. Forced ultrasound laws often mean that women having early abortions must have a transvaginal ultrasound, which is conducted with an invasive probe. While that\u2019s a normal type of medical exam that is frequently recommended by medical professionals \u2014 and often the only way to accurately detect an image during the first trimester \u2014 it\u2019s not actually medically necessary. A state-mandated law that requires it in every situation ultimately removes women\u2019s consent from the equation, and that\u2019s why women\u2019s health advocates have decried these type of laws as \u201cstate-sponsored rape.\u201d\n\nAnd many low-income women can\u2019t realize their decision to end a pregnancy even after navigating a web of complicated state laws. Economically disadvantaged women often can\u2019t get an abortion because it takes them too long to save up the money for it, and public insurance programs have been barred from helping to cover the procedure. Most of those women go on to have unintended births, and are more likely to slip deeper into poverty. The women who carry a pregnancy to term against their will are more likely to have long-term mental health issues.\n\nAnd one of the things that\u2019s hardest for the anti-choice community to grasp is the fact that consensual reproductive rights don\u2019t just apply to the right to have an abortion if you want one. The concept of consent also extends to the women who want to remain pregnant and have a child \u2014 a decision that shouldn\u2019t be taken from them. This week, a Florida man pleaded guilty to slipping abortion-inducing drugs to his girlfriend without her knowledge, ultimately ending her wanted pregnancy. Abortion opponents typically leap on these cases as an example of a double standard \u2014 why should a man who ends a pregnancy get jail time, when a woman who does the same thing doesn\u2019t? The answer is, of course, the issue of consent.\n\nAs sexual assault illustrates so clearly, the absence of consent signals violence. It\u2019s a specific kind of violence inflicted on an individual, one that\u2019s perpetrated on removing their autonomy and control. And it\u2019s why reproductive rights advocates are so insistent that the movement that calls itself \u201cpro-life\u201d can\u2019t also call itself nonviolent.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Controversies over sexual assault have elevated discussions about consent to the national stage.
