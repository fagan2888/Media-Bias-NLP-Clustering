And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\u201d\n\nDenver law enforcement officials said they were initially notified about the alleged TSA groping scheme by an anonymous tip.\n\n\"The original 'case,' you may recall, was declined in April because there was no identified victim,\" Kimbrough said. \"Media coverage of that prompted a series of new reports by alleged victims and those were then investigated. Most of those were declined because the reporting victim was not able to identify the suspect, others were declined because the incident either occurred after the alleged suspect was fired or occurred outside the statute of limitations.\"\n\nThe Denver police department said the male TSA agent would provide a signal to a female worker when he wanted to pat down a male passenger in her lane. She would then tell the agency\u2019s computer system that it was scanning a female passenger. The confusion would lead the scanning machine to request further inspection.\n\nTSA protocols normally require pat downs to be conducted by an agent of the same gender.\n\nFormer interim TSA Administrator Melvin Carraway said the allegations against the Denver agents were \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis blatant violation of public trust by two individuals has significantly tarnished TSA\u2019s reputation,\u201d he wrote in an April blog post on the TSA's website.\n\n\u201cThink about it \u2014 in an agency that employs more than 50,000 people, the irresponsible and potentially illegal behavior of just one or two reckless employees can severely and negatively impact the operational effectiveness of everyone else committed to carrying out our vital national security mission.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The agents allegedly had a system for patting down \"attractive\" male passengers.", "description": "The agents allegedly had a system for patting down \"attractive\" male passengers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The agents allegedly had a system for patting down \"attractive\" male passengers.", "title": "No charges for TSA agents accused of groping scheme", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247096-no-charges-in-tsa-groping-case", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/tsa_050211getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247096-no-charges-in-tsa-groping-case", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-07T16:07-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Transportation Security Administration, TSA groping allegations, Denver International Airport,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-07T16:07:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247096-no-charges-in-tsa-groping-case", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The agents allegedly had a system for patting down \"attractive\" male passengers.", "card": "summary", "title": "No charges for TSA agents accused of groping scheme"}, "dcterms.title": "No charges for TSA agents accused of groping scheme"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd999f\"", "article_summary": "And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\u201dDenver law enforcement officials said they were initially notified about the alleged TSA groping scheme by an anonymous tip.\nTSA officials said in April that the Denver agents were fired as soon as the groping allegations against them were validated.\nA spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney\u2019s office told The Hill that officials were unable to press charges against the terminated TSA agents because they were unable to fully substantiate the groping allegations against them.\nNo charges are being filed against a pair of Transportation Security Administration agents at Denver International Airport who were fired for allegedly plotting to grope male passengers.\nThe Denver police department said the male TSA agent would provide a signal to a female worker when he wanted to pat down a male passenger in her lane."}
