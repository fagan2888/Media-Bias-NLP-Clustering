Sioux Falls, SD

Organizers believe it's the first Pink Pool Club in the country and it started right here in Sioux Falls.

Bright pink popped Sunday afternoon at what is normally a dark billiard hall. The Nickel Spot on Minnesota Avenue was filled with pool players wanting to make an impact.

Rebecca Skinner was diagnosed with breast cancer in March. She found that battling cancer isn't just about the physical pain, but also the financial.

Her son organized the event. He had a goal of six teams, but the response was so high they had 14 play on the first day.

The money raised is going to be distributed locally to those battling cancer. And it's not just those diagnosed with breast cancer, Skinner wants to make sure this supports people battling all cancers.
