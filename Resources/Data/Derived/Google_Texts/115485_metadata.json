However, there are some important clarifications and tweaks.\n\nImmediately loses, key exemptions\n\nHere are some key highlights of the final regs:\n\nOne plan\u2019s status change doesn\u2019t change all benefits packages. While a plan\u2019s grandfathered status is lost immediately when a prohibited plan change is made (even mid-year), that status loss applies separately to each different benefits package offered. In other words, the loss of grandfathered status for a PPO plan won\u2019t impact the status of an HDHP option.\n\nMulti-employer plan exemption. Under the final regs, new employers can join a multi-employer plan for the express purpose of taking advantage of the plan\u2019s grandfathered status without violating anti-abuse rules.\n\nTreatment option changes that eliminate substantially all benefits. Another move that can cost firms a grandfathered status: Eliminating the coverage of anything that\u2019s needed to diagnose or treat a particular condition. The agencies see this as eliminating substantially all benefits for that condition.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: When the treatment of a mental condition requires both drugs and counseling, and the plan eliminates the counseling option, it will lose its grandfathered status in the process.\n\nGeneric alternatives. Employers can move brand-name drugs to a higher cost-sharing tier when a generic alternative becomes available without losing its grandfathered status.\n\nA premium reimbursement option for small employers. Under the ACA, stand-alone HRAs \u2014 as well as FSAs not offered through a Section 125 plan \u2014 are still illegal, and employers can be hit with steep penalties for non-compliance.\n\nHowever, firms with fewer than 20 employees \u2014 those exempt from having to offer coverage to Medicare-eligible employees \u2014 can now integrate premium reimbursement plans with Medicare Part B or D if they offer group health coverage to workers who aren\u2019t Medicare eligible.\n\nDependent coverage and geographic areas. Under the health reform law, plans are required to extend coverage to dependents up to the age of 26 if they offer healthcare coverage to employees. However, certain HMO plans had required plan participants to live within a stated geographic area, a rule that caused some dependents to lose coverage when they went away to college. Under the final rules, if a plan eliminates the coverage of a dependent under the age of 26 because that dependent no longer lives within the plan\u2019s stated geographic area, the plan will lose its grandfathered status.\n\nOne caveat: Plans may still impose residence, financial dependence or similar coverage requirements on dependents other than children (e.g., grandchildren).\n\nEmergency Service billing. According to the feds, plans have been abusing out-of-network providers, a practice that has ultimately resulted in excess balance billing of patients. So in an effort to curb this abuse, the final rules require plans to pay out-of-network emergency services at least the greatest of:\n\nthe median amount paid to network providers\n\nthe product of the formula that the plan generally uses for out-of-network services (e.g., Usual, Customary and Reasonable or UCR), or\n\nthe Medicare payment amount.\n\nExternal appeals\u2019 fees. With one exception, plans can no longer condition external reviews on the payment of a filing fee. The exception: If the plan is located in a state that expressly permits nominal filing fees \u2014 those consistent with the 2004 NAIC model. In these cases, plans may charge a fee of up to $25 per appeal \u2014 with a $75 annual per-claimant limit \u2014 if the plan also refunds fees paid for successful appeals and waives fees that would cause a financial hardship on the claimant.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Employers that have managed to hang on to their grandfathered health plans for this long will want to pay close attention to the feds\u2019 final regs on the subject.", "title": "5 sneaky ways your health plan could lose grandfathered status", "url": "http://www.hrmorning.com/5-sneaky-ways-your-health-plan-could-lose-grandfathered-status/", "image": {"width": 507, "identifier": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/462919173.jpg", "height": 338}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-25T17:54:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-30T20:57:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/462919173.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In other words, the loss of grandfathered status for a PPO plan won\u2019t impact the status of an HDHP option.\nWhile a plan\u2019s grandfathered status is lost immediately when a prohibited plan change is made (even mid-year), that status loss applies separately to each different benefits package offered.\nImmediately loses, key exemptionsHere are some key highlights of the final regs:One plan\u2019s status change doesn\u2019t change all benefits packages.\nEmployers can move brand-name drugs to a higher cost-sharing tier when a generic alternative becomes available without losing its grandfathered status.\nAnother move that can cost firms a grandfathered status: Eliminating the coverage of anything that\u2019s needed to diagnose or treat a particular condition."}
