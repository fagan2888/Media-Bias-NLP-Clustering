Harvard researchers studied the food consumption of school children during lunch and realized many only have 20-minute lunch periods, leading them to eat less and inevitably throw out more. Their findings, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, reveal the consequences of a shorter lunchtime.\n\n\"We were surprised by some of the results,\" said the study\u2019s co-author Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard Chan School, in a press release. \"I expected that with less time children may quickly eat their entr\u00e9e and drink their milk but throw away all of their fruits and vegetables. Not so \u2014 we found they got a start on everything, but couldn't come close to finishing with less time to eat.\"\n\nThe research team examined the effect the time allotted for school lunch had on a student\u2019s food choice and consumption. They looked at 1,001 students in six different elementary schools in low-income districts, with lunch periods ranging from 20 to 30 minutes. After each lunch period, researchers measured and recorded what was left on the child\u2019s tray.\n\nIt turns out, the students who had less than 20 minutes to eat lunch consumed an average of 13 percent less of their entr\u00e9es, 13 percent less of their fruit, 12 percent less of their veggies, and 10 percent less of their milk than the students who had at least 25 minutes to eat. As a result, there was, perhaps unsurprisingly, more food waste among the students with less time to eat.\n\nTime runs out for students eating lunch in low-income elementary schools.

A child looking at his or her tray, knowing they only have a certain amount of time left, grabs at the food in what researchers describe as a kind of desperation in order to eat as much of their entr\u00e9e, milk, fruits and vegetables.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to take into account the amount of time children have to spend waiting in serving lines, which the researchers observed often left them with as little as 10 minutes to actually eat the food.\n\nThe majority of children attending school in low-income districts rely on the National School Lunch Program, which reportedly feeds more than 30 million children in 100,000 schools every day in America. But according to Rimm, there has been little research in the field of school lunch. While the program is a federally assisted system that outlines and reinforces the standards of food, there are no regulations for the timespan of school lunch. The nutritional quality of school lunches has become an increasingly important focus for parents and teachers who believe there is a direct correlation between hyperactivity and nutrition.\n\n\"Many children, especially those from low-income families, rely on school meals for up to half their daily energy intake,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Juliana Cohen, professor of Nutrition at Harvard Chan School, is a press release. \u201cIt is essential that we give students a sufficient amount of time to eat their lunches.\"\n\nSource: Cohen J, Rimm E, and Jahn J.
