JOHN McLAUGHLIN: Question. Do either of these bills (Obamacare reform) stand a chance of pass Congress? And if one does reach the president's desk, will the president veto it? I ask you, Pat.



PAT BUCHANAN: If the president is not in on, he will veto it. But I don't think it's going to reach the president's desk, to be very honest. Mary Landrieu, herself, repeated that you can keep your healthcare plan and that's being used against her. I think this is a defensive move. But, John, let me just say one point. If there is anything like 76 million healthcare plans voided, not only is Obamacare dead, thereâ€™s going to be guillotines set up at Farragut Square.



ELEANOR CLIFT: Dream on, Pat.
