Ted Chen reports for NBC4 News at at 5 p.m. Friday, July 3, 2015. (Published Friday, July 3, 2015)\n\nThieves crashed a stolen pickup into a jewelry store before ramming into a nearby video game shop Friday morning in a smash-and-grab rampage caught on at least one store's security camera system.\n\nA red pickup was seized after the heists and two people were later taken into custody when police searching for a dark-colored vehicle, which was likely the getaway car, witnessed three men burglarizing a Sprint Store at Westminster Center. Two men were apprehended and a third ran into a nearby neighborhood, Westminster police said.\n\nOfficers found the men in possession of about $25,000 worth of stolen items, likely merchandise taken during the thefts, police said.\n\nThe smash-and-grab crime spree began just after 2 a..m. when officers responded to a Long Beach jewelry store in the 4600 block of Los Coyotes Diagonal. About 15 to 20 Long Beach police officers arrived, some less than a minute after the getaway, the store's owner of 24 years said.\n\nThieves Crash Pickup Into Stores\n\nFour thieves crash a pickup into at least two stores in smash-and-grab heists in Long Beach. Ted Chen reports for the NBC4 News at Noon on Friday July 3, 2015. (Published Friday, July 3, 2015)\n\nA witness in a nearby camper called police, she said.\n\nNew digital color cameras installed about a month ago captured the rampage \"clear as day\" inside the store, said owner Janis Krantz. The pickup crashed through a glass door, window and security gate before three men sneaked through the side of the gate as a female driver waited outside.\n\n\"One was smashing all the cases, the others had trash bags grabbing what they could,\" said Krantz. \"They did more damage to showcases than they got merchandise.\n\n\"Things were strewn all over the place. They missed a lot. They were just grabbing what they could grab. Very sloppy.\"\n\nStore Owner Describes Smash and Grab\n\nA jewelry store owner says she was sickened by what she saw on security camera video that shows thieves in a pickup crashing into her business before \"grabbing everything they could.\" Toni Guinyard reports Friday July 3, 2015. (Published Friday, July 3, 2015)\n\nMost of the store's highest-value items were locked away in a different area, Krantz said. They hastily grabbed items, including some made of cubic zirconia -- a low-cost colorless crystal similar in appearance to diamonds.\n\n\"I was really sick,\" Krantz said. \"You work hard to get a business going. I love what I do. It's like a personal assault to have things smashed and destroyed.\"\n\nStrips of carpet were torn from the floor where the pickup slid to a stop.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, police received another report of red pickup slamming into a Game Stop in the 400 block of West Anaheim Street in Long Beach. Merchandise also was stolen from the video game store.\n\nSouthern California Crimes Caught on Camera\n\nThe pickup was recovered about two blocks away from the Game Stop.\n\nThe two men taken into custody in Westminster are believed to be connected to the Long Beach crimes. Authorities are still searching for the third man and female driver.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thieves crashed a pickup into a jewelry store before ramming into a nearby video game shop Friday morning in a smash-and-grab rampage in Long Beach.", "title": "'Very Sloppy' Thieves Follow Jewelry Store Crash-and-Grab With Video Game Store Heist", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "Thieves crashed a pickup into a jewelry store before ramming into a nearby video game shop Friday morning in a smash-and-grab rampage in Long Beach.", "title": "'Sloppy' Thieves Crash Into Jewelry, Video Game Stores", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Smash-Grab-Game-Stop-Jewelry-Store-Pickup-SUV-Crash-311565591.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1216*675/07-03-2015-game-stop-jewelry-store-burglary-long-beach.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thieves crashed a pickup into a jewelry store before ramming into a nearby video game shop Friday morning in a smash-and-grab rampage in Long Beach.", "title": "'Sloppy' Thieves Crash Into Jewelry, Video Game Stores", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Smash-Grab-Game-Stop-Jewelry-Store-Pickup-SUV-Crash-311565591.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1216*675/07-03-2015-game-stop-jewelry-store-burglary-long-beach.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "smash and grab, game stop, jewelry store, heist, robbery, burglary, pickup crashes into store, long beach", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "smash and grab, game stop, jewelry store, heist, robbery, burglary, pickup crashes into store, long beach"}, "article_summary": "The smash-and-grab crime spree began just after 2 a..m. when officers responded to a Long Beach jewelry store in the 4600 block of Los Coyotes Diagonal.\nStore Owner Describes Smash and GrabA jewelry store owner says she was sickened by what she saw on security camera video that shows thieves in a pickup crashing into her business before \"grabbing everything they could.\"\nThe owner of a jewelry store that was burglarized gave NBC4 an inside look into the damage thieves caused at the Long Beach shop.\nMerchandise also was stolen from the video game store.\nThieves Crash Pickup Into StoresFour thieves crash a pickup into at least two stores in smash-and-grab heists in Long Beach."}
