With the election a little over two weeks away, the two squared off in a debate.The challenger had waited two years for the face-to-face rematch.\"After you've misled the voters this many times, how can they expect to trust anything that you say,\" Dold said.Dold was trying to get his old job back and the man who took it in 2012, Democrat Brad Schneider, listed what he says he's done better.\"I said I would fight for a woman's right to choose a hundred per cent of the time and I have,\" Schneider said. \"I will fight for our environment a hundred per cent of the time and I have.\"Schneider and Dold agreed that Obamacare should be fixed. But Schneider made an issue of what happened during Dold's only term.\"Each and every time Mr. Dold voted with his party to totally repeal the affordable care act. That's not fixing it,\" said Schneider.\"We need to take a step back and take a look at what we want in our healthcare system,\" Dold said.\"I think what you're saying is you voted to repeal it before and you'll vote to repeal it again,\" Schneider countered.\"He has no record to run on therefore he wants to poke holes at me,\" Dold responded.The 10th includes expensive real estate on the north shore as well as working class neighborhoods in the district's far north and northwest.The candidates also sparred over Medicare and the environment and which party is to blame for Washington gridlock affecting the federal budget and immigration reform.\"My opponent is part of the 'party of no,'\" Dold said. \"He voted against every single time and hasn't come up or offered his own budget.\"\"I respect people's right to vote yes or no, but the fact of the gridlock in Washington. The party of no, the Republicans, have said we will not even allow a vote is unacceptable,\" Schneider said.Two years ago, Schneider won the 10th District seat by barely one per cent or just over three thousand votes. Most experts predict another close race this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a 10th District re-match on Chicago&#39;s North Shore, Republican Robert Dold is trying to wrest back the seat he lost to Democrat Brad Schneider two years ago.", "og": {"site_name": "ABC7 Chicago", "description": "In a 10th District re-match on Chicago's North Shore, Republican Robert Dold is trying to wrest back the seat he lost to Democrat Brad Schneider two years ago.", "title": "10th District candidates Dold, Schneider square off in debate", "url": "http://abc7chicago.com/356401/", "image": "http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/wls/images/cms/automation/vod/356467_1280x720.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a 10th District re-match on Chicago's North Shore, Republican Robert Dold is trying to wrest back the seat he lost to Democrat Brad Schneider two years ago.", "creator": "@abc7chicago", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc7chicago-hd-for-ipad/id402259941", "iphone": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc7chicago-hd-for-ipad/id402259941", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abclocal.wls.news"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "ABC7Chicago", "iphone": "ABC7Chicago", "googleplay": "ABC7Chicago"}, "id": {"ipad": 402259941, "iphone": 402259941, "googleplay": "com.abclocal.wls.news"}}, "title": "10th District candidates Dold, Schneider square off in debate", "site": "@abc7chicago", "image": "http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/wls/images/cms/automation/vod/356467_1280x720.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "59C39F9AA91BE12CB90B7EF18335463D", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402259941, affiliate-data=ct=wls-smart-banner&pt=302756, app-argument=http://abc7chicago.com/politics/10th-district-candidates-dold-schneider-square-off-in-debate/356401/", "fb": {"app_id": 381722608635006, "pages": 165583971161}, "keywords": "congressional election,bob dold,brad schneider,10th district", "google-site-verification": "_i4LFDbbRvxBCacg1iQ5vdwg1w2LSBzJbcBSOyTpEso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "congressional election,bob dold,brad schneider,10th district"}, "article_summary": "In a 10th District re-match on Chicago's North Shore, Republican Robert Dold is trying to wrest back the seat he lost to Democrat Brad Schneider two years ago.\n\"Each and every time Mr. Dold voted with his party to totally repeal the affordable care act.\n\"I think what you're saying is you voted to repeal it before and you'll vote to repeal it again,\" Schneider countered.\n\"Schneider and Dold agreed that Obamacare should be fixed.\n\"I said I would fight for a woman's right to choose a hundred per cent of the time and I have,\" Schneider said."}
