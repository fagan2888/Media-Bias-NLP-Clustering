None of the signers has renounced their support. The state\u2019s presidential primary is June 7.\n\nSweeney said there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll stray to Vice President Biden\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already committed. I won\u2019t speak for anyone else but I\u2019ve already committed for the secretary of state,\u2019\u2019 Sweeney said. \u201cI\u2019m not backing away from my commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vice president is a great human being. I know him personally and I think he\u2019d make a great president, too, but I\u2019ve already made a commitment to Clinton.\u2019\u2019\n\nState Sen. Raymond Lesniak \u2014 like Sweeney, a potential 2017 gubernatorial candidate \u2014 faulted Biden for staying on the fence for so long.\n\n\u201cI believe Biden waited too long to decide. We can't have a president who's indecisive about being president,\u2019\u2019 Lesniak said. \u201cI'll stay with Hillary. She's come a long way towards my views on vital public policy issues during the campaign. I'm good with that.\u2019\u2019\n\nStill, a Biden bid would get off to a fast start, based on a Monmouth University poll released Monday showing Biden with 17 percent support nationwide for the Democratic nomination as an undeclared candidate. Clinton is the pick of 48 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters and Bernie Sanders is at 21 percent.\n\nBiden supporters were asked who they would support if the vice president does not enter the race, and most swing toward Clinton, giving her a formidable 57 percent to 24 percent lead over Sanders.\n\nPollster Patrick Murray said, \u201cThe specter of a Biden candidacy still hangs over this race, but Clinton can take comfort that she has appeared to win back some support with a solid debate performance (last week).\u201d\n\nClinton as a presidential candidate has a strong New Jersey track record, besting Barack Obama 54 percent to 44 in the Garden State\u2019s 2008 primary. Obama went on to secure the nomination.\n\nThe August endorsement letter for Clinton was also signed by U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, several members of New Jersey\u2019s congressional delegation and nearly all of the state\u2019s Democratic legislators and county chairs.\n\nThe letter to Clinton said: \u201cWe believe that your record embodies precisely what our country needs in our next president, and that your policy agenda \u2014 one that embraces and emboldens middle class America in a safer, more secure world \u2013 offers a vision to keep our country moving forward.\u201d\n\nBob Jordan 609-984-4343, bjordan@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
