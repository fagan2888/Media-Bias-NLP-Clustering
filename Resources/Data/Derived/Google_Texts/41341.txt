Police are searching for a suspect who allegedly dragged a man with his pickup truck following a burglary attempt.

A 25-year-old man spotted the suspect around 7:30 Sunday morning breaking into his vehicle in the 1500 block of south Webb Road, near Harry.

Police said the man confronted the suspect, who ran to a 90s model black Dodge pickup and attempted to drive away with the victim hanging onto the truck.

The suspect circled a parking lot several times before hitting a planter, which threw the suspect and the victim from the vehicle. The suspect was able to get back to the truck and took off.

The victim suffered minor injuries, and the suspect, described only as a man is his 40s, got away with cash and tools.

Anyone with information is asked to call police.
