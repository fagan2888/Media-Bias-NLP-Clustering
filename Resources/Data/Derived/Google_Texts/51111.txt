FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. - Deputies in Nassau County are trying to identify two women sought in connection with the theft of eyeglasses.

Deputies said the women stole a $450 pair of Gucci designer eyeglasses from Eye Envy Optical and Sunglasses off State Road 200 in Fernandina Beach on Saturday.

One of the women wearing a black dress removed a hat from a display and used it to conceal her taking the eyeglasses, deputies said. They said she went to the restroom to further conceal the sunglasses, and then left the store without purchasing them.

The other woman dressed in a multi-colored shirt distracted and blocked the viewpoint of the store clerk, deputies said.

Store owner Michael Sharpe said the two women planned to steal the eyeglasses.

"She was professional," Sharpe said. "She knew what she was doing. It wasn't the first time she had done it, clearly."

Sharpe said he was surprised because both women seemed pleasant and introduced themselves.

"We're a small business, and like other small businesses we have bills to pay and employees to pay," Sharpe said.

News4Jax crime analyst Gil Smith said crimes like this typically increase this time of year, and business owners should post signs saying they have surveillance cameras.

Sharpe is hoping the women will be caught.

"I will track her down. I will find her," he said. "I don't care if I have to spend 10 times as much as those glasses cost me."

If you may know the identities of the women, call Nassau County Sheriff's Office Detective Rhoden at 904-548-4025 or Crime Stoppers at 866-845-TIPS (8477). Callers can remain anonymous and could be eligible for a cash reward.



Sharpe said he's also offering $200 worth of merchandise at his store to anyone who has information leading to an arrest.
