Despite this disparity, having calorie information posted proved to be an overall effective strategy for reducing national weight gain.\n\n\u201cBased on our findings, we\u2019re trying to get the FDA to finalize menu-labeling guidelines and propose nutritional education campaigns,\u201d Green said.\n\nWhile these presentations are open to the public, the primary target audience is doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty, Hooker said.\n\n\u201cWe really want to get our doctoral students connected with the types of things that they\u2019re interested in to perhaps spur their research here or their job search later,\u201d Hooker said.\n\nEach session tends to draw about 25 to 30 attendees, according to Glenn Gaesser, associate director of health promotion.\n\nGaesser says attendees can expect to see topics that cover \u201cgenerally diet, exercise and healthy lifestyle habits\u201d for the remaining seminar sessions.\n\nThis semester\u2019s weekly seminar series is the fourth in a collection of series that began in fall 2012 and will wrap up on May 1.\n\nContact the reporter at kkwestga@asu.edu", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Kristy Westgard", "og": {"site_name": "Downtown Devil", "description": "The School of Nutrition and Health Promotion's weekly seminar series will focus this week on a calorie information requirement policy in the Affordable Care Act and will be hosted by nursing graduate student Jessie Green.", "title": "ASU weekly seminar series deals with diet, exercise, healthy lifestyle habits", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://downtowndevil.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NHI2_post.jpg", "height": 300}, "url": "http://downtowndevil.com/2014/02/13/54821/phoenix-asu-health-seminar-research/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Downtown Devil", "description": "The School of Nutrition and Health Promotion's weekly seminar series will focus this week on a calorie information requirement policy in the Affordable Care Act and will be hosted by nursing graduate student Jessie Green.", "title": "ASU weekly seminar series deals with diet, exercise, healthy lifestyle habits", "image": "http://downtowndevil.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NHI2_thumb.jpg", "creator": "@DowntownDevil", "site": "@DowntownDevil", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 469910153072284}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://downtowndevil.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-12004029_10153319887651676_1842773764625141302_n-270x270.png", "article": {"section": "Community", "tag": "Steven Hooker", "published_time": "2014-02-13T08:11:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-13T08:16:03+00:00", "author": "http://downtowndevil.com/author/kwestgard/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b2b\"", "article_summary": "This semester\u2019s weekly seminar series is the fourth in a collection of series that began in fall 2012 and will wrap up on May 1.\nThese hourlong presentations are part of a weekly seminar series sponsored by the ASU School of Nutrition and Health Promotion held in the Arizona Biomedical Collaborative building.\nDespite this disparity, having calorie information posted proved to be an overall effective strategy for reducing national weight gain.\nGaesser says attendees can expect to see topics that cover \u201cgenerally diet, exercise and healthy lifestyle habits\u201d for the remaining seminar sessions.\nAt noon every Thursday, ASU doctoral students and faculty researchers pack into a small conference room to hear the latest in health research."}
