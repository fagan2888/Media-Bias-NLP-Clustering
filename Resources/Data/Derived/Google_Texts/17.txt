GREAT FALLS -- David Schuler found a weather balloon while skiing on Saturday at Kings Hill.

Schuler tells us: "Skiing today up on Kings Hill with my friends Greg and Bill and we found a Weather Balloon today. It came with stamped mailing envelope so I will be mailing to NOAA in Kansas City, Missouri."

These weather balloons carry a very important piece of equipment known as a "radiosonde."

Every day, the NationalOceanicc & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launches weather balloons from 102 sites across the U.S., and these radiosondes play a crucial role in weather forecasting.

Radiosondes measure atmospheric conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, pressure, etc., at various points throughout the atmosphere.

If you ever stumble upon one of these, be sure to to send it to NOAA as they generally includes a stamped envelope as well.

As for the skiing on Saturday, Schuler said: "Another good day, before all the snow starts melting. Snow was a little crusty showing signs of surface warming and freezing. Hard to believe winter is almost over."
