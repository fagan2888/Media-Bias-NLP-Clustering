Forty-four alleged gang members, corrections officers and drug suppliers were accused of running a lucrative smuggling operation at the downtown jail. Most have pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges, but eight defendants maintain their innocence.\n\nMontemarano wrote that the public has a poor understanding of how jails are run and the wide latitude he says officials gave to gang members.\n\n\"A civilian cannot even begin to grasp the environment which exists in these facilities,\" he wrote.\n\nBut the prosecutors said they anticipate photos and diagrams of the jail will be introduced as evidence, as will testimony from inmates and staff who are familiar with it. In other filings, prosecutors have indicated that Wendell M. France, a senior corrections official, will testify about how detention centers are run.\n\nBesides, they added, organizing a tour for the 30 or more people who would be included in the visit -- judge, jurors, attorneys, and potentially members of the public -- would be impractical.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services said jail management had not been contacted about the tour idea, but said they had arranged a visit for a jury to see part of the jail in the past.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Defense: Jury in BGF case should be taken on tour of Baltimore jail", "Description": "A lawyer for a corrections officer accused in the Black Guerrilla Family jail plot wants to take federal jurors on a walking tour of the Baltimore City Detention Center so they can see for themselves the conditions officers worked in.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "A lawyer for a corrections officer accused in the Black Guerrilla Family jail plot wants to take federal jurors on a walking tour of the Baltimore City Detention Center so they can see for themselves the conditions officers worked in.", "title": "Defense: Jury in BGF case should be taken on tour of Baltimore jail", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bal-defense-jury-in-bgf-case-should-be-taken-on-tour-of-baltimore-jail-20141016-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-544014b6/turbine/bal-defense-jury-in-bgf-case-should-be-taken-on-tour-of-baltimore-jail-20141016", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/81697528", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-16", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06dc\"", "article_summary": "Such a comment might be grounds for defense lawyers to seek a mistrial, the prosecutors wrote.\nForty-four alleged gang members, corrections officers and drug suppliers were accused of running a lucrative smuggling operation at the downtown jail.\nBut in a response filed Wednesday, prosecutors urged the judge to reject the idea, arguing that a visit might scare jurors and cause the case to fall apart.\nIn other filings, prosecutors have indicated that Wendell M.
