It\u2019s about are you skiing in three weeks. That\u2019s the mindset of the baby boomer community,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMiller, Doyle and Hackensack University Health Network CEO and president Robert Garrett were on a panel to discuss health care at the event.\n\nMillennials are the new puzzle for the medical industry to solve, Doyle said.\n\nTelehealth may be one way to engage younger patients \u2014 using text messages to communicate and send reminders, and offering video conferencing or pictures as a way to be diagnosed or seen by a physician.\n\nBut the problem is, many millennials have no loyalty to any one physician, according to a recent survey Virtua conducted.\n\n\u201cThe last bastion of loyalty we found is OB/GYN,\u201d Miller said.\n\nTime is one of the greatest factors contributing to the lack of loyalty. A shortage of primary care providers has overloaded the system, forcing many to wait long periods of time just to be seen at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been to our primary care office, right?\u201d Miller asked the crowd Friday. \u201cNobody is sitting there for an hour anymore. It\u2019s not going to happen. That\u2019s how the (baby) boomers feel about it, and the millennials feel even stronger about it.\u201d\n\nWhich is why the state is seeing an unfettered growth of minute clinics and urgent cares. And health systems are partnering or creating affiliations with these clinics and centers, in order to refer patients who need further care within their system.\n\n\u201cThe millennials are driving a lot of the innovation and \u2026 we are reacting to them,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWe are trying to make more things convenient for them.\u201d\n\nOne attendee asked how the industry is handling costs of care, since the market for hospitals and health systems has traditionally never had competitive pricing pressures like other markets.\n\nPatients never used to be seen as consumers, but that is changing, Garrett said.\n\n\u201cTraditionally there hasn\u2019t been pricing pressures built in to make it as efficient as possible,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThere are signs that some of that is starting to change \u2014 with the Affordable Care Act, with a focus more on value (fee structure), and these insurance partnerships that are starting to develop really can go a long way in controlling costs and bending the cost curve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe health care insurance exchange is more consumers and more employers are getting involved in that and there is more information available. There is more transparency in terms of pricing. A couple of years ago, you wouldn\u2019t be able to even find out what a particular procedure would cost, and now \u2026 you can find out. It\u2019s not an exact science, but at least you have a range of what this health system is charging versus the next health system,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nAll of these components have contributed to a slowdown in the increase of health care costs, he said.\n\nMiller agreed, adding, \u201cWe are not seeing the cost increases year-over-year that we might have seen 10 years ago. Virtua\u2019s cost last year, we saw net cost increase of 1 percent.\u201d\n\nWith a shift in focus to outpatient and ambulatory services, as well as a focus on telehealth \u2014 how does this affect employment for health systems, which are the largest employers in some towns?\n\nA reduction in the number of inpatient beds, repurposing buildings to include outpatient and ambulatory services, and a change in roles of nurses will all balance the scales, Miller said.\n\n\u201cPart of it is going to be retraining people in the outpatient settings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we are going to need less care, it\u2019s going to be a different level of care.\u201d\n\nGarrett said that, as the system moves toward more outpatient or tech-involved care, there will be a \u201credeployment\u201d of staff into different roles to adapt to the changes.\n\n\u201cThe role of the advanced practice nurse, the role of the pharmacist has certainly changed. We are seeing more specialization in some of the more traditional professions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to be a large employer; I don\u2019t see that trend going any other way.\u201d\n\nAnd as the shift in focus to outpatient grows, the real estate needs of the industry will change.\n\nGarrett said repurposing existing buildings is one route that many hospitals are already taking.\n\nDoyle added: \u201cBrick and mortar is kind of pass\u00e9. It\u2019s now about IT and infrastructure. That said, outdated and old, dilapidated buildings have to be replaced, to some extent. What you are going to do with excess space is probably convert it into a day care for seniors, since we are going to need that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "The needs of the baby boomer and millennial generations are driving the changes in health care delivery around the state.", "title": "Boomers', millennials' health needs are shaping the health care landscape, providers say | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20160118/NJBIZ01/160119782/boomers-millennials-health-needs-are-shaping-the-health-care-landscape-providers-say", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160118/NJBIZ01/160119782/AR/0/AR-160119782.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "The needs of the baby boomer and millennial generations are driving the changes in health care delivery around the state.", "title": "Boomers', millennials' health needs are shaping the health care landscape, providers say | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160118/NJBIZ01/160119782/AR/0/AR-160119782.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The needs of the baby boomer and millennial generations are driving the changes in health care delivery around the state.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not an exact science, but at least you have a range of what this health system is charging versus the next health system,\u201d Garrett said.\nThe needs of the baby boomer and millennial generations are driving the changes in health care delivery around the state.\nMiller, Doyle and Hackensack University Health Network CEO and president Robert Garrett were on a panel to discuss health care at the event.\nAll of these components have contributed to a slowdown in the increase of health care costs, he said.\n\u201cThe technology is going that way, partnerships are going that way,\u201d Miller said."}
