NEW YORK â€” Officers responding to the home of an 86-year-old New York City man who called 911 to say he'd shot his daughter fatally shot the man Saturday after he turned toward them with a shotgun and refused to drop it when they arrived, police said.

Jack Calvello was shot once in the torso by a uniformed police officer following the 11:16 a.m. call to his Queens home and was pronounced dead at a hospital, police said.

Calvello's 65-year-old daughter, Carolann Matyka, was found with a gunshot wound to the head in the kitchen of the red-brick home and rushed to a hospital where she was pronounced dead at 3:45 p.m., police said.

A loaded 12-gauge shotgun was recovered from the scene, according to investigators.

It wasn't immediately clear what sparked the incident.

Two teenage boys playing basketball near the home told local media they saw Calvello come out of the house's doorway pointing the shotgun at the two officers and then heard police tell him to drop the weapon before the shot was fired.

Police said a dog was also injured in the dispute and was believed to be shot as well.

The two responding policemen, a sergeant and a police officer, were unhurt.
