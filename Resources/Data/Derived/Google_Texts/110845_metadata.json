Another report released Monday by the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that expansion of the Pioneer ACO model would reduce net Medicare spending.\n\nHowever, the independent report also showed that significant savings were not necessarily realized to the same extent in every participating Pioneer ACO, two of which lost millions of dollars, and others which did not book significant savings or losses.\n\n\n\nRead More ER visits rise under Obamacare\n\n\n\nStill, Burwell said that overall, \"The report shows that the model has delivered high-quality patient care without limiting coverage or benefits.\"\n\n\"This is a crucial milestone in our efforts to build a health-care system that delivers better care, spends our health-care dollars more wisely and results in healthier people,\" Burwell said. \"The Affordable Care Act gave us powerful new tools to test better ways to improve patient care and keep communities healthier. The Pioneer ACO model has demonstrated that patients can get high-quality and coordinated care at the right time, and we can generate savings for Medicare and the health-care system at large.\"\n\nDr. Lawrence Casalino of Weill Cornell Medical College, in an editorial published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association about the report, noted that the amount of money saved in the first year, about $280 million, may \"seem small.\"\n\n\"But if this rate of savings could be sustained, and achieved throughout a large part of the U.S. health-care system, it would be more than enough to 'bend the cost curve' so that health-care expenditures do not continue to increase as a percentage of the gross domestic product and the federal budget,\" Casalino wrote.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Medicare realized more than $384 million in savings in two years due to an Obamacare program designed to lower the costs of treating beneficiaries.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Medicare booked more than $384 million in savings from an Obamacare program designed to lower the costs of treating beneficiaries.", "title": "'Substantial' savings for Obamacare pilot program", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/04/obamacare-program-generates-substantial-medicare-savings.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/04/102645370-524564_208208855950448_892542922_n.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicare booked more than $384 million in savings from an Obamacare program designed to lower the costs of treating beneficiaries.", "title": "Obamacare program generates 'substantial' Medicare savings", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/04/obamacare-program-generates-substantial-medicare-savings.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/04/102645370-524564_208208855950448_892542922_n.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Health Insurance, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-05-04T13:39:36-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T15:28:39-0400", "tag": "Politics"}, "pageNodeId": 102645291, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Pioneer, Accountable Care, savings, substantial, HHS, burwell"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfaed\"", "article_summary": "The department called savings that have been realized so far \"substantial\" for a program that currently serves more than 600,000 beneficiaries in Medicare, the federally run health-care coverage system that primarily serves senior citizens.\n\"This is a crucial milestone in our efforts to build a health-care system that delivers better care, spends our health-care dollars more wisely and results in healthier people,\" Burwell said.\nThe Pioneer ACO model has demonstrated that patients can get high-quality and coordinated care at the right time, and we can generate savings for Medicare and the health-care system at large.\"\nAnother report released Monday by the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that expansion of the Pioneer ACO model would reduce net Medicare spending.\n\"The Affordable Care Act gave us powerful new tools to test better ways to improve patient care and keep communities healthier."}
