Williams is a three-time summer Olympian who helped the U.S. win a gold medal in the 400-meter relay at the London Games. Jones is a two-time veteran of the Summer Games in the 100-meter hurdles, missing out on gold in Beijing after a late stumble.\n\nJones is in her second season of bobsledding, then recruited Williams to the sport last year. They will join Aja Evans, another Winter Olympic first-timer, as the push athletes in Sochi, along with drivers Jamie Greubel, Elana Meyers and Jazmine Fenlator.\n\nU.S. officials announced the selections Sunday night.\n\n\u201cThis is the deepest field of push athletes we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Darrin Steele, the CEO of the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation. \u201cWe knew heading into the season that the Olympic selection was going to be extremely difficult. It\u2019s a good problem to have, but it meant that some outstanding athletes would not make the Olympic team.\u201d\n\nIn short, the U.S. had five women who became de facto finalists for the three push spots. Evans was widely considered a lock to make the team after a series of strong performances, both on and off the track.\n\nWilliams was part of four World Cup races this season, winning two silvers earlier in the campaign and then teaming with Greubel for a gold medal on Sunday that surely made her resume look a whole lot better.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what was in store for me this season,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI just wanted to come in with positive energy and help out. This is the first time I\u2019ve been a part of a true team sport, and there\u2019s someone else counting on you. You can\u2019t let that person down, and that\u2019s what drives me. It\u2019s very important to give everything I have whenever I\u2019m on that start line.\u201d\n\nThat seemed to leave Jones, Emily Azevedo and Katie Eberling as the candidates for the final spot on the push crew. Jones won silvers with Greubel and Meyers driving this season. Eberling also had a strong resume, with world championship medals in the past and three World Cup bronzes this winter.\n\nIn the end, Jones was the call.\n\nThe U.S. qualified three men\u2019s two-man sleds and two four-man sleds for Sochi. Reigning Olympic four-man champion Steven Holcomb will drive USA-1 and Nick Cunningham will be at the control of USA-2 in both disciplines, and Cory Butner will drive the third two-man entry.\n\nHolcomb and his crew of Curt Tomasevicz, Steve Langton and Chris Fogt will be USA-1. Holcomb snapped a 62-year U.S. gold medal drought in the four-man event at the 2010 Vancouver Games, and now will try to give the U.S. its first two-man gold since 1936.\n\nJustin Olsen, Johnny Quinn and Dallas Robinson will push Cunningham\u2019s four-man sled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They are now positioned to join a group of eight other Americans who have competed in both the Summer and Winter Games.
