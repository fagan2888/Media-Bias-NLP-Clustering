She replaces Seb Bishop, who stepped down from that role earlier this year (he continues to serve as a consultant for the brand).\n\nGoop is aimed squarely at affluent women between the ages of 25 to 45. The site and associated weekly newsletter feature a mix of musings from Ms. Paltrow and other contributors as well as lots of high-end fashion products from smaller designers, like the underwear brand Cheek Frills. Goop also features a heavy emphasis on food editorial content, such as this recipe for Chocolate Hazelnut Scones.\n\n\u201cI see this as hopefully a \u2018next-level\u2019 type of move,\u201d said Ms. Paltrow of Ms. Gersh\u2019s hiring (the two met through a headhunter). \u201cWe want to build the business out in all conceivable ways.\u201d\n\nMs. Gersh, who also logged stints as president of strategic initiatives at NBC Universal and managing director of the Weather Channel, sees Goop at the forefront of a major trend: content blended with commerce.\n\n\u201cToday I think women buy and think about buying in a very different way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey read about a product or see it on TV and say, \u2018where can i get that?\u2019 This is the kind of stuff we were thinking about at Oxygen years ago, and today it\u2019s really opening up.\u201d\n\nBut what about similar content/commerce blends, like say the email newsletter Daily Candy, which Comcast recently shuttered, or Gilt Groupe, which went from red hot a few years ago to layoffs and retrenchment.\n\nMs. Gersh argued that Daily Candy was mostly focused on local content, while Gilt has been driven by consumers seeking short-lived flash sales. Goop is blending content and commerce in a way that reflects the way people are using the Web in 2014, she contends.\n\nMs. Gersh and Ms. Paltrow say they want to expand Goop\u2019s small roster of local city guides, and are also planning more pop-up retail stores during key periods\u2013including one in Dallas this November. Both said they\u2019d also like to experiment with more video.\n\nGoop is also working with more top designers and will eventually roll out its own label.\n\nPlus, Ms. Paltrow is exploring whether to start selling ads on Goop, and may look to start marketing the site more as well. In fact, Ms. Paltrow spent some time in New York last week during Advertising Week taking meetings with industry executives. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really talked to advertisers before,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019re talking about running more ads and sponsorships.\u201d\n\nMs. Paltrow also wants Goop\u2019s audience to keep growing. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking at syndicating content,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this completely organic base [of fans]. We\u2019ve never bought a mailing list or anything. Now we\u2019re starting to get more aggressive about acquiring more users.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Lisa Gersh Named CEO of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Shopping Blog Goop", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/10/06/lisa-gersh-named-ceo-of-gwyneth-paltrows-shopping-blog-goop/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Lisa Gersh Named CEO of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Shopping Blog Goop", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Mike Shields", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-06T10:00:29-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/10/06/lisa-gersh-named-ceo-of-gwyneth-paltrows-shopping-blog-goop/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-1713", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/10/06/lisa-gersh-named-ceo-of-gwyneth-paltrows-shopping-blog-goop/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "title": "Lisa Gersh Named CEO of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Shopping Blog Goop"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-1713", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-03T21:38:18-04:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI see this as hopefully a \u2018next-level\u2019 type of move,\u201d said Ms. Paltrow of Ms. Gersh\u2019s hiring (the two met through a headhunter).\nMs. Gersh and Ms. Paltrow say they want to expand Goop\u2019s small roster of local city guides, and are also planning more pop-up retail stores during key periods\u2013including one in Dallas this November.\nIn fact, Ms. Paltrow spent some time in New York last week during Advertising Week taking meetings with industry executives.\nPlus, Ms. Paltrow is exploring whether to start selling ads on Goop, and may look to start marketing the site more as well.\nMs. Gersh argued that Daily Candy was mostly focused on local content, while Gilt has been driven by consumers seeking short-lived flash sales."}
