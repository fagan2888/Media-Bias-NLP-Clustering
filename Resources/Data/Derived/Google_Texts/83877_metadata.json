Following the address, NewsHour political analysts Mark Shields and David Brooks will discuss the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nTonight, President Barack Obama will address the nation in a prime-time speech on the U.S.\u2019s strategy for combating the Islamic State militant group. His address, on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 attacks, will outline the President\u2019s goal in \u201cdegrading and ultimately destroying\u201d the terrorist group.\n\nThe president will be stealing the costly prime-time slot from the television networks. But his address comes at a time when the American public is increasingly aware and concerned about the growing threat of the Islamic State militants, especially in the wake of the beheadings of American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.\n\nAddressing the nation in prime time is not new, but it is relatively rare. Back in April, Mr. Obama tried to give a prime-time speech on the Affordable Care Act but the network executives refused the request. It was probably for good reason \u2014 according to a 2009 Adweek article, breaking into the prime-time slot for the big four broadcast networks (FOX, CBS, ABC, NBC) in one night costs them nearly $30 million in revenue.\n\nHere is a list of some of the major prime-time speeches \u2014 not counting State of the Union addresses \u2014 President Obama has delivered:\n\nAug. 7, 2014 9:30 p.m. EDT \u2014 Authorizing airstrikes in Iraq\n\nOct. 16, 2013 8:30 p.m. EST \u2014 Announcing the end to the government shutdown\n\nSept. 10, 2013 9:01 p.m. EDT \u2014 Making the case to launch a limited military strike against Syria\n\nApril 19, 2013 10:05 p.m. EDT \u2014 Calming the nation after the Boston Marathon bombing\n\nMay 1, 2012 7:39 p.m. EDT \u2014 Announcing the plans for the end of the Afghanistan war\n\nMay 2, 2011 11:35 p.m. EDT \u2014 Announcing the death of Osama Bin Laden\n\nApril 8, 2011 11:04 p.m. EDT \u2014 Announcing a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown\n\nJan. 28, 2011 6:33 p.m. EST \u2014 Addressing the situation in Egypt", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tonight, President Barack Obama will address the nation in a prime-time speech on the U.S.\u2019s strategy for combating the Islamic State militant group.
