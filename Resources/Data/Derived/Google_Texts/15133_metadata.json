Not at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still keeps them stuck. They\u2019re getting money for free. They feel worthless. They\u2019re uneducated. I mean, as long as you are that way, [Democrats] can keep you under their control\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have a plantation mentality. As long as they give you this much money, you\u2019ll stay right there. You don\u2019t need to know too much because if you do, you might start thinking for yourself.\u201d\n\nIn addition to coming for Obama, Dash has also been outspoken \u2014 and created controversy \u2014 in the past about other issues, including her response to Kanye West\u2019s remarks during a July 2014 concert in London where he compared the paparazzi taking photos of himself and wife, Kim Kardashian, to \u201crape.\u201d\n\n\"For Kanye to say 'rape,' maybe he needs to spend some time on Rikers Island, go to Rikers for a little while, and then he'll know what rape is,\" she said during an interview on Fox News' \"Outnumbered.\" \u201cI don't get celebrities not understanding that the paparazzi are doing their job ... I don't think [celebrities are] out of touch, I just don't think they're understanding what the business is.\"\n\nCheck out more of Stacey Dash\u2019s appearance on \u201cHannity\u201d in the clip above.\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Stacey Dash Photos Stacey Dash Photos\n\n1 of 15 Jamie Foxx, Stacey Dash FILE - In this Sunday, March 7, 2010, file photo Stacey Dash arrives at the Elton John Oscar Party in West Hollywood, Calif.
