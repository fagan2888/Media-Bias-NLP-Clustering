When Laurence "Laurie" Paddock helped create the Daily Camera's Pacesetters Awards in 1985, his goal was to honor the people who help make Boulder County the special place it is.

Now Paddock, the longtime Camera editor, is being recognized for all he has done for Boulder and its surrounding communities.

As recipient of the Luminary Award, Paddock is a member of the 30th class of Pacesetters. And he is in fine company, including Spenser Havlick, who is the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award for the many roles he has played through the years.

The rest of the Class of 2014 Pacesetters have distinctly varied achievements, but they have one thing in common â€” a love for their communities and the people in them.

The recipients of the Daily Camera's 2014 Pacesetter Awards will be honored during a luncheon at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, April 22, at the Millennium Harvest House, 1345 28th St., Boulder.

If you would like to help honor those who make our community better, RSVPs will be accepted until noon Monday, April 20, either online, dailycamera.com/pacesetters, or via email, jelineks@dailycamera.com.
