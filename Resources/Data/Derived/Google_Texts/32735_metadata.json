Companies of 50 people or more that don\u2019t provide affordable healthcare to full-time workers will be forced to pay a penalty of up to $3,000 per person.\n\nOne anonymous Staples employee, who says she worked 30- to 35-hour weeks for nine years, started a Change.org petition last month that\u2019s garnered more than 160,000 signatures, asking the retailer to refrain from limiting part-time shifts because she and others need the money from the extra hours. Some workers say they can\u2019t obtain one of the few full-time positions in stores while others are balancing the hours with school or children.\n\nA representative for Staples told BuzzFeed that the limit on hours for part-time workers is not new and has, in fact, been in effect for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cWe have reiterated the policy as we work to increase the efficiency of our retail network,\u201d Mark Cautela, a spokesman, said in an e-mail.\n\nHowever, Cautela didn\u2019t respond to follow-up questions about why the memo said Staples was \u201cimplementing\u201d the rule starting this month or why it used the phrases \u201cnew guidelines\u201d and \u201cnew part time hour policy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2890700, "userid": 683073}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Staples managers are now forbidden to schedule part-time associates for more than 25 hours a week, according to a Dec. 6 memo.
