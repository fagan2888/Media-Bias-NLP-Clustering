Insulin and carbohydrates are his staunchest allies (or, depending on how he\u2019s feeling, most hated enemies). Planning for uncertainty is his routine.\n\nUncertainty is also routine for Kristina, Christopher\u2019s mother and primary caregiver. The stress of caring for a child with diabetes \u2013 or anyone with a life-changing illness \u2013 can be intense and constant. Days weighed down by anxiety. Sleepless nights worrying \u2013 about your child, your family, and what the next minute will bring.\n\nWhile Christopher and his mother\u2019s story is theirs alone, it demonstrates many of the universal realities of diabetes. These narratives add context to a disease that can all too often be reduced to statistics. Stories like Christopher\u2019s help brands better understand the reality of managing a disease, and build products and messaging that improve that reality for the patient and caregiver alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd there our new life began\u201d\n\nYou have diabetes. The initial psychological impact of these three words, when heard for the first time, is in an instant shocking, deflating, and transformational. When the doctor said these words to Christopher, \u201cI looked at the pediatrician, tears coming down, because I didn\u2019t understand fully what it was,\u201d remembers Kristina. \u201cAnd there our new life began.\u201d\n\nAfter the numbness wears off, helplessness and confusion set in. To restore some sense of balance and control, many caregivers depend upon educational tools and resources \u2013 like diabetes starter kits or peer support groups \u2013 and lean heavily on professional expertise to familiarize themselves with the disease and all the available treatment options.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for many parents to experience a period of intense guilt as they adjust to this new life. Questions of Why him? or Why now? or What could I have done to prevent this? become top-of-mind. Many spend countless hours online, searching for a potential cure or advice on how to cope. \u201c[M]ake sure that you take care of yourself, in addition to your children,\u201d writes a Joslin Diabetes Center discussion board moderator to a mother of a newly-diagnosed child. \u201cYou cannot take care of your child with diabetes if you do not take care of yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a time of unknown\u201d\n\nCaregivers bear an incredible burden of near-constant stress and worry \u2013 especially about what can happen in moments of not being there.\n\nDaily readiness is therefore a necessity. Sending your child to school requires careful preparation. Does he have the right food with him? Will he remember to check his blood sugar? Is the school prepared to handle a diabetic emergency?\n\nBut the scariest time of all can be at night. \u201cThe biggest fear is I\u2019m going to be going to sleep one night and I just won\u2019t wake up,\u201d says Christopher. For his parents, that fear takes its toll. \u201cThe nighttime tends to be frightening for me and my husband as parents because it\u2019s a time of unknown,\u201d Kristina says. \u201cMy alarm clock on my iPhone is ridiculous.

According to the American Diabetes Association, people living with diabetes have medical expenses that are, on average, 2.3 times higher than what they\u2019d be in the absence of the disease. Average medical expenditures end up costing about $13,700 per year, with about $7,900 of that directly attributed to the cost of diabetes management and care. And that cost is rising: a new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the cost of managing diabetes has more than doubled in the past 20 years. The average diabetes patient spends $2,790 more per year than they did in 1987 \u2013 and more than half of that additional cost is spent on medications.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t let diabetes ever stop you\u201d\n\nPatient and caregiver stories can provide unlimited inspiration and insight for improving care, and many companies are realizing the benefits of listening, learning, and empathizing with those managing health issues. The result is often innovative, patient-inspired solutions \u2013 like easier-to-use blood glucose monitors and insulin delivery systems, for example \u2013 that improve outcomes by putting the patient at the center of every decision and action.\n\nAbove all, parents just want their child to feel normal and unhindered by their condition. Whether it\u2019s through books or toys or, of course, love, parents work hard so their children will grow up knowing that diabetes doesn\u2019t have to hold them back.\n\nAs Christopher advises, \u201cDon\u2019t let it be like a barrier in your life.
