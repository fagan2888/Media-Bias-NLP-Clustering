If things keep going in this amiable manner, there could be a new tax title and a new airport security title, a feeding frenzy for policy-hungry lobbyists and advocates.\n\nDemocrats have a handful of asks as the chamber prepares to begin debating the legislation, co-authored by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) and ranking Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida.\n\nLawmakers from both sides say those requests won\u2019t necessarily tank the legislation. A procedural vote to begin debate on the bill, which would authorize FAA funding through September of 2017, is set for Wednesday.\n\nAt the top of the Democratic wish list are at least three energy-related tax provisions that some lawmakers say were unintentionally left out of a tax package signed into law last December. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday that the inclusion of the provisions is a requirement for the legislation to move forward.\n\nCurrently, there are no tax credit provisions attached to the FAA bill, and lawmakers say negotiations are fluid. Still, Thune acknowledged that in order to avoid a Democratic filibuster, the bill would need to address the Democrats\u2019 concerns in some fashion. Thus, they plan to include a tax title.\n\nRemarkably, lawmakers of various stripes are in agreement that last year\u2019s tax extender negotiations were chaotic. They even acknowledge that a revision may be needed. Thune said some tax provisions were left out of December\u2019s tax bill by accident, but he also noted that in the whirl of eleventh-hour deal making, the definition of what is \u201cunintentional\u201d is often murky.\n\n\u201cThe things that were left out last year \u2014 there were some of them, I think, that were unintentional,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there probably may have been some where there was some rhyme or reason to why they were left out, too.\u201d\n\nAnd, with a dearth of tax-related bills on the horizon, Thune said he anticipated requests to tack on even more tax provisions than the three Schumer specifically named.\n\n\u201cThis is what [Democrats] always viewed as the best opportunity to get some of these things that were left out of last year\u2019s extender bill,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAnd so, we\u2019re listening to them and we\u2019re working for them.\u201d\n\nThune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, added that negotiations over the tax portion of the FAA bill would rest largely with Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon.\n\nWyden is optimistic a deal could be struck. \u201cI think we\u2019re making good progress,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday, adding that in deference to his colleagues, he would like to keep discussions private. \u201cI\u2019m convinced we can get this done. All sides recognize that this was a major omission and we\u2019re moving to get it done.\u201d\n\nBeyond the energy provisions, Democrats also want to add a number of airport security measures in the wake of the Brussels terror attacks last month.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference featuring Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, a handful of Senate Democrats unveiled three specific proposals that they want to add to the FAA bill.\n\nFirst, they want to double the number of bomb-sniffing dog teams \u2013 or Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response teams (VIPR) \u2013 from 30 to 60 nationwide and to expand their operations to non-secure \u201csoft\u201d targets in airports such as outside of checkpoints, according to summaries of the proposals provided by Democratic staff.\n\nAdditionally they hope to explicitly authorize DHS grants to fund active shooter training exercises and beef up security in \u201csoft\u201d areas at airports and other surface transportation venues.\n\n\u201cThe FAA bill is a perfect opportunity for both sides to work together to toughen up security at our airports,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cAll of us here are optimistic and hopeful that our Republican colleagues will join us and do just that.\u201d\n\nThune, the lead negotiator for the Republicans, is generally on board. In a floor speech, he highlighted several other potential add-ons to the FAA bill, including another Thune-Nelson collaboration that would enhance the vetting process for airport workers with access to restricted areas. He also said House-passed legislation that encourages public-private partnerships to enroll more passengers in the TSA PreCheck program could be an amendment.\n\nIn keeping with the \u201cget it done\u201d atmosphere permeating through the Senate, Thune also said he was open to a variety of ways to get the security provisions enacted. He is open to \u201chotlining\u201d the airport security measures \u2014 i.e., passing them on the floor separately without a prior committee vote \u2014 or including them as amendments to the FAA legislation, whichever is most efficient.\n\nAs to the Democrats\u2019 proposals, Thune is generally receptive, but he also said he would withhold judgment until he saw the final legislative text and a cost estimate.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any text or draft on it yet. They\u2019ve talked about it in generalities, but we need to look at language before we can make any final decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Democrats are willing to work with us and we can find some common ground on a security package, we can move as part of the FAA bill. I\u2019m not adverse to doing that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "At least for the moment, the Senate is negotiating agreeably on a modest reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "At least for the moment, the Senate is negotiating agreeably on a modest reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.", "title": "Senators Play Nice on FAA Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1623, "identifier": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/040516-FAA-Dems-2.jpg", "height": 1080}, "updated_time": "2016-04-06T13:55:28-04:00", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/2016/04/05/senators-play-nice-on-faa-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least for the moment, the Senate is negotiating agreeably on a modest reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.", "creator": "@wcd_a", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/040516-FAA-Dems-2.jpg", "title": "Senators Play Nice on FAA Bill", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Congress", "published_time": "2016-04-05T17:48:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-06T13:55:28-04:00"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2526\"", "article_summary": "Currently, there are no tax credit provisions attached to the FAA bill, and lawmakers say negotiations are fluid.\n\u201cThe FAA bill is a perfect opportunity for both sides to work together to toughen up security at our airports,\u201d said Schumer.\nIn a floor speech, he highlighted several other potential add-ons to the FAA bill, including another Thune-Nelson collaboration that would enhance the vetting process for airport workers with access to restricted areas.\nA procedural vote to begin debate on the bill, which would authorize FAA funding through September of 2017, is set for Wednesday.\nAt a Tuesday news conference featuring Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, a handful of Senate Democrats unveiled three specific proposals that they want to add to the FAA bill."}
