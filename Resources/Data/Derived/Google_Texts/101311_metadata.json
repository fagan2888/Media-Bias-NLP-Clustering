It described how hospitals buy information about you to determine how likely you are to get sick and what it would cost to treat you. For more we\u2019re joined by one of the co-authors, Shannon Pettypiece of Bloomberg News. So what are they buying and who are they buying it from?\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well they are buying the same type of data that retailers have been using for years to target products at you and what we\u2019re talking about here is that information that\u2019s collected by companies called data brokers, which can track every transaction a consumer can make, every purchase they make, with a drug store or a grocery store loyalty card.\n\nThey can find out how much your home is worth, what type of car you own. Even things like your interests, whether you like hiking or rock climbing based off of public databases or even your web browsing history. And for years, retailers have used this to send you a coupon or to figure out who might want to subscribe to their certain list or product.\n\nNow hospitals are saying, can we use this data this information to try to predict who\u2019s going to get sick and who is going to end up at the emergency room.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So why are hospitals interested in having this kind of information?\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well under Obamacare they have an increased incentive to keep patients healthy because the law changes the way they are paid.\n\nSo under the law, hospitals now get penalized if you come back to the emergency room too frequently and if a hospital isn\u2019t meeting certain patient quality and health outcomes and insurers are following the same mold too.\n\nInsurers no longer want to pay for hospitals who are just doing more and more test and procedures over and over again and they want to be paying for quality so hospitals are going to be held accountable if patients are too sick if patients are coming to the emergency room too frequently.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: What about all this information as a patient am I opting into this or am I opting out of it and if something is wrong can I correct the assumption that the hospital is going by?\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, so right now hospitals are at the very early stage of using this data but there is very large hospital chain called Carolina\u2019s Health Care System. They own over 900 hospitals, nursing homes, physicians\u2019 offices all throughout North and South Carolina, so they are on the forefront of using this and what they hope to eventually do is to allow patients to opt but only to opt out of some of it if you\u2019re now filling your prescription the hospital feels they want to know and they should be able to know that.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want the hospital knowing what your buying form CVS or at the grocery store you can have an option to opt out of that but certain thing they wasn\u2019t to definitely know about you because they\u2019re now being accountable for your health.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And very briefly they cannot use this to discriminate against a preexisting condition even if this information tells them you might have a heart condition\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Absolutely, there are a lot of things that are illegal for hospitals to do and it\u2019s also bound by the same privacy rules as anything else you would share with your doctor.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Alright Shannon Pettypiece from Bloomberg News thanks so much.\n\nSHANNON PETTYPIECE: Thank You.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report this week describes how hospitals are buying information from data brokers to determine how likely you are to get sick and what it may cost to treat you.
