Hopefully I will raise my level.\"\n\nSharapova is favorite to win the title after the early exits of defending champion and world No.1 Serena Williams and second seed Li Na, although Simona Halep of Romania is the fourth seed and in great form.\n\nThe difference between Sharapova at the start and finish of the match was huge \u2013 her serve took a set and a half to find its groove and Stosur\u2019s energy clearly discomfited her opponent.\n\nStosur broke for 4-3 in the first set, on her fourth break point when Sharapova netted a forehand, and then did it again in the final game of the set when the Russian double-faulted on set point.\n\nStosur hit long with the court at her mercy on break point to lose the first game of the second, but she broke back for 2-2. The Australian took a 4-3 lead but that was as good as it got, because Sharapova was now motoring, her shots finding the corners and Stosur could not keep up.\n\nA net cord gave Sharapova a break for 5-4 and Stosur hit long to lose the set.\n\nThe Australian gradually had the life squeezed out of her as games came and went before Sharapova wasted her first match point with a double fault and then delivered the final blow.\n\n(Reporting by Robert Woodward;
