That popular part of the website allows consumers to browse for subsidized health insurance.\n\nIt used to take digging to find plan details. Now consumers would be able to enter their doctors, hospitals and medications. When they compare plans, they could see whether those doctors, hospitals and drugs are covered.\n\nSign-ups for 2016 start Nov. 1. The Obama administration says some 10 million people who are still uninsured but eligible for coverage will be harder to sign up.\n\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
