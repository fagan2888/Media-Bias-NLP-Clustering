The opening paragraph tells us, \u201cIf you\u2019re considering Male-To-Female (M2F) gender reassignment surgery (GRS), no doubt you have many questions and concerns.\u201d Questions, maybe, but even if you\u2019ll be out in only seven years, you may not have that many concerns. M2FGRS has to beat serving time in a men\u2019s prison.\n\nOf course, Manning won\u2019t get to experience the \u201csupportive, caring environment dedicated to handling your every care and need \u2026 and one of the world\u2019s most experienced in every aspect of transitioning and well-being\u201d that the Philadelphia Center for Transgender Surgery offers. But it\u2019s not wholly unfair that there are some costs for having leaked the largest cache of classified documents in U.S. history.\n\nNow, please understand that the Philadelphia Center for Transgender Surgery is no fly-by-night operation. It has standards and \u201cMandatory Prerequisites for Gender Reassignment Surgery.\u201d Let\u2019s see if she meets them.\n\n\u2022 A true transsexual with gender dysphoria. Check \u2014 whatever it means. \u2022 Surgery recommended by 2 mental health specialists trained in gender identity issues. Any number of organizations ought to be able to line those up. \u2022 Hormone treatment for at least one year. Well, that\u2019s what the Department of the Army just approved \u2014 and the officer who made that decision ought to be asked to explain her decision before Congress in closed session so that she might feel free to describe the pressure brought to bear by the Obama administration. And if she isn\u2019t brave enough to do that, why should we expect her to be brave in combat? What do we train these officers to do? \u2022 Living \u201ctrue life\u201d test for a minimum of one year. Well, she\u2019s got a lot of days to go in a place where they can keep close track of him. \u2022 Emotionally stable. Hmm. Can anyone who wants to change his gender be considered emotionally stable? Just asking. \u2022 Medically healthy with any medical conditions being treated and under control. Check.\n\nWhat about the cost of the whole hebang? Well, M2FGRS is surprisingly affordable because, like other free-market medical procedures (e.g., laser eye surgery), it\u2019s not mandated by Obamacare. The cost for all the itemized procedures, everything, is $108,000, but you probably wouldn\u2019t opt for all of them. And \u2014 Philadelphia really is the City of Brotherly Love \u2014 you get, as it says in capital letters at the bottom of the price list: discounts on surgical fees for multiple procedures. That means you can discard every trace of the sex God gave you for only $100,000.\n\nOnly in America.\n\nStill, someone has to come up with the $100,000. But who? Why not the Chinese?\n\n[White House telephone transcript, made available per FOIA Request #47cfr0461.]\n\nBarack Obama: Who\u2019s there?\n\nXi Jinping: Hu long gone.\n\nBarack Obama: Oh hang!\n\nXi Jinping: Jiang gone too.\n\nBarack Obama: Who\u2019s he?\n\nXi Jinping: I\u2019m Xi.\n\nBarack Obama: Well, I thought so, but I\u2019m not known for jumping to conclusions.\n\nXi Jinping: <Chuckling sounds> What can I do for you, Bo?\n\nBarack Obama: C\u2019mon, Xi. Please don\u2019t call me \u201cBo.\u201d\n\nXi Jinping: Hee, hee. What can I do for you, Bo?\n\nBarack Obama: I need 100,000 fortune cookies.\n\nXi Jinping: Ooh. Big party. What for?\n\nBarack Obama: M2FGRS.\n\nXi Jinping: <Pause> Must double funds to guarantee Republican subservience?\n\nBarack Obama: No. Gender reassignment surgery.\n\nXi Jinping: Ah. Sorry to hear. We like Michelle.\n\nBarack Obama: No, not for me.\n\nXi Jinping: Ahhh. You have found solution to Ted Cruz problem?\n\nBarack Obama: No. It\u2019s for Bradley Manning.\n\nXi Jinping: Ahhhhh! Honorable Bradley E. Manning, PFC, United States Army, RA 12 523 650, date of birth: December 17, 1987. Pasty face. Weak chin. Will cause you trouble, skinny little bastard.\n\nBarack Obama: He\u2019ll be a bitch.\n\nXi Jinping: We eat dogs.\n\nBarack Obama: We have strict moral rules against animal cruelty.\n\nXi Jinping: Of course you do.\n\nBarack Obama: Can you help, Xi?\n\nXi Jinping: What precisely is in it for the people of China?\n\nBarack Obama: Afterwards I may have more flexibility.\n\nXi Jinping: Ah, reset, of course. Yes, I\u2019ll help. You remember old Chinese saying?\n\nBarack Obama: Refresh my recollection.\n\nXi Jinping: Give a man sex, own him for night. Change a man\u2019s sex: own her for life.\n\nBarack Obama: Thanks, Xi. Sayonara.\n\nXi Jinping: You Americans all look alike too. Hasta la vista.\n\nActually, only (!) 8 percent of U.S. debt is owed to China. The rest we owe to a variety of lenders, including \u2014 ourselves! Which, in progressive liberal thinking, means we\u2019ll never have to pay it off. If only.\n\nIt is we the people who will get to pay for Manning\u2019s hormone therapy. And Manning will probably be out of prison in only seven years, which means that if he goes on to have a sex-change operation (also courtesy of us the people?), he will probably be free before his scars have healed. What a country.\n\nYou can\u2019t make this stuff up.\n\nDaniel Oliver is Chairman of the Board of Education and Research Institute and Senior Director of White House Writers Group in Washington, DC.
