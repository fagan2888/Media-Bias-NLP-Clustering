In fact, the majority of respondents to the group's survey agreed that mental and behavioral health services should be the top priority for healthcare investment in the years ahead.\n\n\"Forward-looking healthcare organizations are starting to change their structures to link the treatment of mental distress and maladaptive behavior to primary care,\" wrote Compton-Phillips.\n\nOn the issue of population health, respondents were largely in favor (77 percent) of pursuing it as a goal, but clinicians were more skeptical, due to questions of reimbursement and the issue of healthcare's individual nature and the relationship between provider and patient.\n\nMany hospitals across the country are dragging their feet when it comes to adopting the population health model. But population health initiatives can be a valuable tool in helping hospitals acheive cultural comeptency and create greater connections to the community.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospitals can bridge cultural differences through population health\n\nReal population health management takes flexible, innovative leaders\n\nPopulation health management: Survey finds too many hospitals drag their feet\n\nKaiser spearheads patient-centered care, population health initiatives\n\nPopulation health management: How lean manufacturing principles can drive improvement", "article_metadata": {"description": "Population health management is far from one-size-fits-all, and frontline caregivers are less enthusiastic about the model as a panacea for all of healthcare's ills than executives are,\u00a0according to\u00a0a post on the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine's\u00a0Catalyst\u00a0blog.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Population health management is far from one-size-fits-all, and frontline caregivers are less enthusiastic about the model as a panacea for all of healthcare's ills than executives are,\u00a0according to\u00a0a post on the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine's\u00a0Catalyst\u00a0blog.", "title": "U.S. healthcare still undervalues population health management", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/us-healthcare-still-undervalues-population-health-management/2016-04-01", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Behavioral Health,Care Delivery,care redesign,Patient Care & Outcomes,Population Health Management,reimbursement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the postRelated Articles:Hospitals can bridge cultural differences through population healthReal population health management takes flexible, innovative leadersPopulation health management: Survey finds too many hospitals drag their feetKaiser spearheads patient-centered care, population health initiativesPopulation health management: How lean manufacturing principles can drive improvement\nMany hospitals across the country are dragging their feet when it comes to adopting the population health model.\nBut population health initiatives can be a valuable tool in helping hospitals acheive cultural comeptency and create greater connections to the community.\nThe council's Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., wrote that while population health is a laudable goal, it is not an ideal care model for all situations.\nPopulation health management is far from one-size-fits-all, and frontline caregivers are less enthusiastic about the model as a panacea for all of healthcare's ills than executives are, according to a post on the New England Journal of Medicine's (NEJM) Catalyst blog."}
