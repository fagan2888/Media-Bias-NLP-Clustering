Former enthusiast for Sandinista-like political movement in Nicaragua.\u201d\n\nWhile Noonan was working for Reagan in the 1980s, De Blasio opposed the former president\u2019s fight against the left-wing Sandinistas in Nicaragua.\n\nTo destabilize the Sandinistas, Reagan funneled CIA funds to a group known as the \u201ccontras.\u201d But eventually the U.S. public forced Reagan to stop openly funding the contras, and the proceeds from U.S. arm sales with Iran were illegally transferred to the counter-revolutionary forces.\n\nFourteen Reagan administration officials were indicted and 11 were later convicted over the Iran-Contra affair. All of those convictions were either vacated or pardoned by the end of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nJust days after De Blasio was elected in November, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh referred to him as a \u201ca Sandinista\u201d and a \u201ccommunist.\u201d It\u2019s a theme that also has been repeated on Fox News.\n\nWatch this video from CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, broadcast Jan. 5, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cbs_ftn_noonan_deblasio_140105a-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "CBS host calls out Peggy Noonan for labeling De Blasio a \u2018former Sandinista\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3be\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut the answer so for to inequality is being presented so far \u2014 even in New York \u2014 brand new mayor, progressive, lefty, former Sandinista.\u201d\u201cFormer Sandinista!\u201d the CBS host exclaimed.\n\u201cYes, and this administration used to brag about how well the stock market was going,\u201d Noonan quipped.\nFormer enthusiast for Sandinista-like political movement in Nicaragua.\u201dWhile Noonan was working for Reagan in the 1980s, De Blasio opposed the former president\u2019s fight against the left-wing Sandinistas in Nicaragua.\n\u201cHistorians will write books about how this got so messed up,\u201d Washington Post journalist David Ignatius opined.\nNoonan said that the \u201cfunny thing\u201d about income inequality was that everyone seemed to have just discovered that rich people were wealthy and poor people were impoverished."}
