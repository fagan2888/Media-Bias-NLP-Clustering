It started with small employers in those regions, but Cigna plans to expand this year to larger employers and to other markets.\n\nCigna Corp. said Tuesday it has launched its first proprietary private health insurance exchanges, setting up employer-based marketplaces to sell coverage to workers in four major metropolitan regions.\n\nSome private exchanges are operated by brokers or consultants, such as Aon Hewitt, which offer health plans from a variety of insurers. The Cigna announcement Tuesday is different.\n\nThe Bloomfield health insurer has a proprietary relationship with each of the employers to be the only insurer offering health plans to workers at those companies. The workers typically have more choices of medical coverage than they would in an ordinary employer-insurer arrangement \u2014 such as four options instead of one or two, said Cigna spokesman Joe Mondy.\n\nEmployers have different options for how they choose to fund medical coverage for workers \u2014 and what share of the costs the employer will pay compared with the worker, Mondy said.\n\n\"Cigna's goal is to offer a full range of plan choices to employers, and employees and their families as they become more actively involved in their health and benefit choices,\" Dave Guilmette, president of Cigna's global employer segment, said in a prepared statement.\n\nA private health insurance exchange is different from the public exchanges that got a lot of attention leading up to the start of the year. Public health exchanges were created by the Affordable Care Act and allow people earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level to get a tax credit or subsidy.\n\nPrivate exchanges are increasingly common as employers look to control health care costs for workers. The health-care consulting firm Accenture released research last year that said \"private health insurance exchanges will rapidly upend insurance purchasing for many of the 170 million people who receive benefits through their employer.\" Accenture estimated that the number of people who buy coverage on private exchanges will increase from about 1 million this year to about 30 million by 2017.\n\nIn September 2013, the global benefits business Aon Hewitt announced that 18 large employers \u2014 including Walgreens, Sears Holdings and Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and Red Lobster \u2014 offered health benefits last fall through the Aon Hewitt Corporate Health Exchange, the nation's largest multi-insurer private health care exchange.\n\nAon Hewitt estimated more than 600,000 U.S. employees and their family members would be covered through plans offered by the company's exchange. Worker enrollment tripled this year over 2013, according to Aon Hewitt.\n\nIn Cigna's proprietary private exchanges, workers also can buy other types of insurance, such as dental, pharmacy, vision, life/accident and disability coverage.\n\nIn addition to proprietary private exchanges, Cigna has participated in other private exchanges run by brokers or benefit consultants since 2012. Cigna participates in a number of private exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "business", "og": {"url": "http://articles.courant.com/2014-02-04/business/hc-cigna-private-exchange-20140204_1_small-employers-health-insurance-health-plans", "site_name": "tribunedigital-thecourant", "type": "article", "description": "Cigna Corp. said Tuesday it has launched its first proprietary private health insurance exchanges, setting up employer-based marketplaces to sell coverage to workers in four major metropolitan...", "title": "Cigna Announces New Private Exchanges, The Latest In A Growing Trend"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 115228168554095}, "description": "Cigna Corp. said Tuesday it has launched its first proprietary private health insurance exchanges, setting up employer-based marketplaces to sell coverage to workers in four major metropolitan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c81\"", "article_summary": "In addition to proprietary private exchanges, Cigna has participated in other private exchanges run by brokers or benefit consultants since 2012.\nCigna Announces Private Exchanges, Latest In Growing TrendThe programs are offered for the first time this year in Atlanta, Dallas, Washington D.C. and San Francisco.\nIn Cigna's proprietary private exchanges, workers also can buy other types of insurance, such as dental, pharmacy, vision, life/accident and disability coverage.\nSome private exchanges are operated by brokers or consultants, such as Aon Hewitt, which offer health plans from a variety of insurers.\nCigna Corp. said Tuesday it has launched its first proprietary private health insurance exchanges, setting up employer-based marketplaces to sell coverage to workers in four major metropolitan regions."}
