Driving in a group is said to help each save fuel \u2014 a big deal for the environment, considering how many trucks are on the road.\n\nThe British government hopes the trucks will make deliveries and traffic run faster.\n\nIn October, Daimler successfully tested a self-driving truck on a German public road. However, some remain skeptical of how well the tech will work in the U.K.\n\nThe president of the Automobile Association said the U.K.'s highway network has \"more entrances and exits ... than any other motorways in Europe or indeed the world.\"\n\nAnd because cars are constantly trying to enter and exit the roads, it'd be hard for them to get around a pack of 10 trucks.\n\nAmerica faces a similar situation. Seventy percent of goods shipped within the U.S. are moved by trucks, requiring over 3 million drivers, which means road congestion and pollution.\n\nDaimler's subsidiary, Freightliner, is currently working on making driverless trucks a reality in the U.S.\n\nThis video includes clips from Daimler AG and Freightliner and images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "British roads may pose extra challenges for the new technology.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "British roads may pose extra challenges for the new technology.", "title": "Driverless Trucks: Coming To A UK Road Near You", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/driverless-trucks-coming-to-a-uk-road-near-you/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1457287975.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "British roads may pose extra challenges for the new technology.", "title": "Driverless Trucks: Coming To A UK Road Near You", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/driverless-trucks-coming-to-a-uk-road-near-you/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1457287975.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=plamNvMTE6YVOcKhYpHuMn2UZBzrE-OV&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://57777", "iphone": "newsy://57777", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://57777", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "keywords": "driverless trucks,driverless truck test UK,driverless trucks US,UK truck problem,US truck problem,daimler driverless trucks,daimler driverless trucks tests,driverless trucks testing", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1457287975.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Driverless trucks are expected to be tested on British roads this year.\nBritish roads may pose extra challenges for the new technology.\nThis video includes clips from Daimler AG and Freightliner and images from Getty Images.\nDaimler's subsidiary, Freightliner, is currently working on making driverless trucks a reality in the U.S.\nSeventy percent of goods shipped within the U.S. are moved by trucks, requiring over 3 million drivers, which means road congestion and pollution."}
