Parade Float Insults Obama, Department of Justice Initiates Investigation

The DoJ has determined that the greatest potential threat to the Constitution, our national security and personal freedoms is... a parade float that pokes fun at President Obama. The threatening float consisted of an outhouse labeled “Obama Presidential Library”. Omaha.com reports The U.S. Department of Justice has joined the discussions over a controversial float in the Norfolk Independence Day parade. The department sent a member of its Community Relations Service team, which gets involved in discrimination disputes, to a Thursday meeting about the issue. There are only a finite number of resources at Eric Holder’s Department of Justice, so there's no time or manpower available to look into trivial matters such as NSA spying on Americans, IRS targeting political enemies, or the Veterans Administration allegedly killing thousands of vets and covering it up.

What kind of paranoid, insecure presidential administration reacts to an insult to their honor with a federal investigation, particularly when there are so many urgent critical threats to Americans that they have refused to investigate? Even Nixon wasn't this Nixonian. This is Kim Jong-un territory. Thomas Lifson adds: The DoJ Community Relations Service played a shameful role in ginning up racial animus surrounding the trial of George Zimmerman, as documented by Jack Cashill in his book, If I Had a Son. It is best thought of as an agitprop organization with prosecutorial powers. Andrew Thomas blogs at http://darkangelpolitics.com
