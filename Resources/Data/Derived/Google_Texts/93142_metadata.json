The first two said lifetime American earnings was somehow highly specialized information. I kept dialing for data because it was necessary to quantify the disbelief and rage.\n\nAs reported in the last \u201cOregon Trial\u201d dispatch, it\u2019s not only possible but likely that the state of Oregon scuttled the launch of a functional Obamacare website for political reasons, after wasting $300 million in federal taxpayer dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s right: the total earnings of 300 working American lifetimes just tossed aside like it was nothing. This happened because a corrupt governor badly wanted to win reelection for a fourth term. He pulled it off last November, and lasted all of 38 days of the new term before resigning.\n\nAccording to IT contractor Oracle, the site was ready to launch. The state chose to cancel the initiative and kick Oregonians into the federal insurance exchange instead, thus opening the subsidies of about 100,000 Oregonians up to a Supreme Court challenge this summer.\n\nThe government also decided to sue Oracle \u2014 which counter sued, of course. The legal fees alone could run to tens of millions of dollars. That\u2019s before we get to damages, and the government case is not the strongest.\n\nThere was a slight delay before the last dispatch, during which I called up about a dozen folks who have some expertise when it comes to government spending. It\u2019s a boring truism that government wastes a lot of money, but, really, $300 million?\n\nHow could anyone spend $300 million on something and just abandon it and wash their hands of it? That sounds a lot less like negligence and a lot more like theft on a massive scale.\n\nOne answer I got back again and again from these consultants, watchdogs, lawyers, journalists, economists, etc. was that they had all seen government waste of similar magnitudes before. It happens, often without anybody going to jail for it.\n\nThe most famous liberal take on paying for government comes from Mr. \u201cYou can\u2019t shout fire in a crowded movie theater\u201d himself, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. \u201cI like to pay taxes. With them I buy civilization,\u201d Holmes smugged.\n\nIt has to be granted that, yes, taxes can be used to do things we associate with civilization \u2014 like build and repair roads, set up courtrooms and libraries, and maintain parks. But in light of the spending patterns of our current government, Democrat or Republican, Holmes\u2019s words sound na\u00efve at best \u2014 or borderline batty.\n\nTo earn $300 million, 300 Americans had to work hard \u2014 often including long commutes on top of long hours, short vacations, and demeaning treatment by bosses. Time spent earning that money to pay for families ate up a good chunk of their lives.\n\nAnd then the State of Oregon, empowered by a blank check from the federal government, went and casually tossed the sum total of all their lifetime incomes right into the delete folder and didn\u2019t give it a second thought.\n\nThis is civilization? It can\u2019t be, Mr. Holmes. If it is, give me barbarism.\n\nThe Cover Oregon scandal is not just about a website that didn\u2019t launch, nor is it \u201cjust\u201d about $300 million wasted. It\u2019s about our nation\u2019s complete disconnect of other people\u2019s money from any sense of responsibility for that money.\n\nIn the last fiscal year, the federal government spent $3.5 trillion. That\u2019s the sum total of the total lifetime incomes of 3.5 million working Americans, give or take.\n\nHow much of that was that was misspent? Ten percent? Fifteen? Twenty? More? Do we really want to know?\n\nMost elected Republicans pay lip service to the waste of government but ultimately do not care to do anything about it. Democrats want to spend even more money and don\u2019t want to be bothered with arguments about how that might not be the greatest idea.\n\nA country that can readily wave off such waste is courting not renaissance but ruin.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "To earn $300 million, 300 Americans had to work hard \u2014 often including long commutes on top of long hours, short vacations, and demeaning treatment by bosses.\nHow could anyone spend $300 million on something and just abandon it and wash their hands of it?\nThe Cover Oregon scandal is not just about a website that didn\u2019t launch, nor is it \u201cjust\u201d about $300 million wasted.\nIt\u2019s a boring truism that government wastes a lot of money, but, really, $300 million?\nThat\u2019s the sum total of the total lifetime incomes of 3.5 million working Americans, give or take."}
