Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans are required to provide coverage for recommended preventive health care services without copays. Increased access to preventive services can reduce and prevent costly chronic diseases and help Americans live healthier lives. These services include but are not limited to:\n\n* Blood pressure screening * Well-baby and well-child visits\n\n* Obesity screening and counseling * Flu vaccination and other immunizations\n\n* Well-woman visits * Tobacco cessation interventions\n\n* Domestic violence screening and counseling * Vision screening for children\n\n* Breastfeeding support and supplies * HIV screening\n\n* FDA-approved contraceptive methods * Depression screening\n\nThe data released today are broken down by state, age, gender, and race and ethnicity. Of the about 137 million individuals with access to recommended preventive services without cost sharing:\n\n28.5 million are children, who have access to free preventive service coverage for flu vaccinations and other immunizations, vision screening, and well-baby and well-child visits.\n\n55.6 million are women, who have access to free preventive services such as well-women visits, breastfeeding support and supplies, and recommended cancer screenings.\n\n53.5 million are men, who have access to annual wellness visits, blood pressure screening, and cancer screenings.\n\nAnd an estimated 15 million are Black, 17 million are Latino, and 8 million are Asian-Americans who have access to recommended preventive services without cost sharing.\n\nIt is well known that the ACA is helping people save money by lowering the cost of health insurance, but individuals and families are saving money out of pocket when they go to the doctor because basic preventative services are free. This important aspect of the law not only saves money, it also saves lives.\n\nRepublicans are looking to do financial harm to millions of men, women, and families across the country by repealing the ACA. The reality is that even people who haven\u2019t bought policies through the exchange are saving money. The ACA is a law that is benefitting all insured Americans, no matter how they get their coverage.\n\nThe GOP is being obliterated by facts. As the data is rolling in, the Republican arguments against Obamacare are being washed away. Democrats should be begging Republicans to argue that they want to take money out people\u2019s pockets by repealing the ACA.\n\nThe ACA is a weapon that Democrats can and should use to their advantage in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New data released today blew the Republican anti-Obamacare argument to smithereens as 137 million Americans are saving money due to the ACA's free preventative services.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "New data released today blew the Republican anti-Obamacare argument to smithereens as 137 million Americans are saving money due to the ACA's free preventative services.", "title": "Fact Bomb Obliterates Republicans: Obamacare Helps 137 Million Americans Save Money", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/14/fact-bomb-obliterates-republicans-obamacare-helps-137-million-americans-save-money.html", "updated_time": "2015-05-14T14:45:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,ACA,cost of obamacare,Obamacare,obamacare saves money,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-05-14T14:45:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-14T14:45:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, cost of obamacare, Obamacare, obamacare saves money"}, "article_summary": "And an estimated 15 million are Black, 17 million are Latino, and 8 million are Asian-Americans who have access to recommended preventive services without cost sharing.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, most health plans are required to provide coverage for recommended preventive health care services without copays.\nIncreased access to preventive services can reduce and prevent costly chronic diseases and help Americans live healthier lives.\nNew data released today blew the Republican anti-Obamacare argument to smithereens as 137 million Americans are saving money due to the ACA\u2019s free preventative services.\n55.6 million are women, who have access to free preventive services such as well-women visits, breastfeeding support and supplies, and recommended cancer screenings."}
