Collinsville Police arrested a man for the assault of a neighbor on Main Street Saturday afternoon after several people called 911. Thomas Kevin Shepherd was booked on a complaint of assault with a deadly weapon after a former felony conviction.

Police say Shepherd, 50, told them he was bored watching TV so he went out into the street and used a mirror to reflect sunlight into his neighbor's home in the 600 block of East Main Street. The neighbor came outside asking him to stop, and the two men started yelling at each other, the arrest report states.

"Shepherd stated that he then went back to his house, got a tool -- metal punch looking like an ice pick -- and ran after (the victim) stating he was going to stab him," the arresting officer said.

Shepherd is in jail on a $60,000 bond. Court records show he has previous convictions for drug manufacture and possession charges.
