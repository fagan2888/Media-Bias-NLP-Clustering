It\u2019s fun to see coach (Michael) Malone start to develop his philosophy with our guys and them getting a sense of him and his staff. And it\u2019s certainly fun to see a lot of young guys who are going to get the opportunity to sink or swim. I think overall it\u2019s just a real positive vibe, and I think there a sense of the unknown that, quite frankly, is exciting.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets open camp with 14 guaranteed contracts \u2014 one under the maximum number allowed by the NBA. The preseason figures to be heavy on establishing the foundation of work Malone demands of his players.\n\n\u201cI just like the fact that we have a fully committed locker room,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cI like the fact that we have a bunch of guys here that don\u2019t just care about the team but care about the city. They\u2019ve chosen to be here despite being coveted by other markets that might be painted bigger markets. We really have an all-in mentality. It\u2019s evident when you walk in the gym. I know we have a group of guys that are really about the right things. It\u2019ll be fun to see how that manifests itself when training camp begins.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tim Connelly, Nuggets GM, says team has \u201cfully-committed locker room\u201d", "title": "Tim Connelly, Nuggets GM, says team has \u201cfully-committed locker room\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/tim-connelly-nuggets-gm-says-team-has-fully-committed-locker-room/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__emmanuel-mudiay-denver-nuggets-DPp1.jpg", "height": 477}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__emmanuel-mudiay-denver-nuggets-DPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T13:38:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:39:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s what training camp will answer for the Nuggets when the regular season starts Oct. 29.\nIt\u2019ll be fun to see how that manifests itself when training camp begins.\u201d\nThere may be no individual more interested to see how different the Nuggets will be after five months of moves than general manager Tim Connelly.\n\u201cI just like the fact that we have a fully committed locker room,\u201d Connelly said.\nI know we have a group of guys that are really about the right things."}
