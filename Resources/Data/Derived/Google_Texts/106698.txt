Justin Wilson will be buried in his native England, and the American service for the late IndyCar driver who resided in southwest Weld County will be in Indianapolis, his brother said Wednesday.

Wilson, who died from a freak accident Sunday at Pocono (Pa.) Raceway, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two young daughters living in Dacono, a small town off Interstate 25 east of Erie. Wilson was 37.

“There’s plans in the works to do the official funeral ceremony in the UK, and there will be some sort of memorial celebration of his life in Indianapolis,” said Stefan Wilson, 25, also an IndyCar driver. “Lots of plans in the works, but as far as I know there’s nothing that’s been discussed for Colorado.”

Indianapolis is the American open-wheel hub and is where Stefan Wilson resides. At the 2013 Grand Prix of Baltimore, Justin and Stefan Wilson became the first brothers to compete in a race since 1983.

Stefan vows to work with IndyCar to make its open-wheel series safer but declined to offer his opinion on adding a cockpit canopy or a roll-bar cage to protect the driver’s head. Justin Wilson died of blunt force trauma, being hit by a large piece of debris from a wreck in front of him.

“I don’t want my comments on that to be used right now,” Stefan said of cockpit safety. “I’m going to talk about that internally with the series, and I want to do everything I can with the series to make it safer.”

IndyCar has established a trust fund for Justin’s daughters: Wilson Children’s Fund, c/o IndyCar, 4551 W. 16th St., Indianapolis, IN 46222.
