His eyes bulged. Blood boiled to just below his Broncos cap.\n\nAdam Gase, the Broncos\u2019 offensive coordinator, was asked this week if, essentially, Peyton Manning stinks in cold weather.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been around him two years, but the thing that probably (ticks) me off more than anything is the fact that I don\u2019t want anybody else as my quarterback,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go in with him every Sunday, and it\u2019s a great feeling to have. When you don\u2019t have a guy like that \u2014 and I\u2019ve been in that spot a lot \u2014 it (stinks) when you know you walk in there and you don\u2019t have a shot. So I\u2019ll take him any day of the week.\u201d\n\nAll this hot-air chatter about how Manning can\u2019t play in the cold is getting reckless. Since he joined the Broncos, Manning has played in three cold-weather games when the temperature was 35 degrees or lower: the 2012 regular-season finale against Kansas City, the 2012 playoff game in January against Baltimore and the game two weeks ago at New England.\n\nThese are the only cold-weather games in Manning\u2019s career when he has worn The Glove on his right throwing hand.\n\nHere\u2019s how Manning and The Glove have fared in those three cold-weather games:\n\n1. Kansas City (35 degrees): 23-of-29, 304 yards, three touchdown passes, no interceptions, 144.8 passer rating.\n\n2. Baltimore (13 degrees): 28-of-43, 290 yards, three TDs, two picks, 88.3 rating.\n\n3. New England (22 degrees, 22 mph wind): 19-of-36, 150 yards, two TDs, one INT, 70.4 rating.\n\nThree-game cold-weather totals: 70-of-108 (64.8 completion percentage), eight touchdown passes, three interceptions, 97.9 rating.\n\nTrue, Manning\u2019s numbers are better in games when the temperature is above 35 degrees. But help me out here. Since when do eight touchdown passes against three interceptions and a 97.9 rating suggest a guy can\u2019t play in the cold?\n\nA 97.9 rating would rank No. 8 overall, good weather or bad, in the NFL quarterback rankings this year. Maybe what causes Manning\u2019s cold-weather rap is his NFL-best 119.0 rating this year when the temperature isn\u2019t noted.\n\nManning will play his fourth cold-weather game for the Broncos on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans. It\u2019s supposed to be 16 degrees at kickoff at Sports Authority Field at Mile High but with little wind.\n\nIt was the gust in New England, not the cold, that caused Gase to employ a ball-carrying game plan that resulted in 280 yards rushing and Manning\u2019s only sub-200-yard passing game with the Broncos.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, the cold is not an issue for us in the passing game,\u201d Gase said. \u201cIt\u2019s anytime you get a condition of wind, that\u2019s when I see that it\u2019s hard for the passing.\u201d\n\nFair or not, there will be intense scrutiny on Manning\u2019s performance Sunday against the cold. Not against the Titans, but the cold.\n\nThe perception of Manning\u2019s cold-weather performances may lack substantiation. But it\u2019s a perception, nonetheless. On a day when there will be chattering of teeth, Manning will have another chance to alter the chatter.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Klis: Peyton Manning will see chance to address cold-weather critics vs. Titans", "title": "Klis: Peyton Manning will see chance to address cold-weather critics vs. Titans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/07/klis-peyton-manning-will-see-chance-to-address-cold-weather-critics-vs-titans/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131205_115311_peyton-manning.jpg", "height": 495}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131205_115311_peyton-manning.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-07T17:41:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T18:57:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Maybe what causes Manning\u2019s cold-weather rap is his NFL-best 119.0 rating this year when the temperature isn\u2019t noted.\nManning will play his fourth cold-weather game for the Broncos on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\nThe perception of Manning\u2019s cold-weather performances may lack substantiation.\nAdam Gase, the Broncos\u2019 offensive coordinator, was asked this week if, essentially, Peyton Manning stinks in cold weather.\n\u201cFor the most part, the cold is not an issue for us in the passing game,\u201d Gase said."}
