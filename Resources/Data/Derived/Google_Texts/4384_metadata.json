Vail Pass also enforced the chain-up law before closure.\n\nResidents in Yuma and Washington counties lost power early Sunday morning. but it was restored quickly.\n\nXcel Energy had crews standing by Sunday night should there be outages in its coverage areas.\n\nThe snow caused minor delays at Denver International Airport as airlines de-iced planes, but no major cancellations were reported.\n\nA representative of Copper Mountain said it was \u201cdumping\u201d until midafternoon Sunday and said the day\u2019s official snowfall totals would be released Monday morning.
