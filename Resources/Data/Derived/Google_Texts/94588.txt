Seasonal workers are a key part of the workforce for several sectors of the economy this holiday season. But be forewarned: The benefits of having these temporary employees can be outweighed by risks associated with their employment.

Retailers and delivery services are among the sectors which hire the most seasonal workers in the current holiday season. Hiring firm, Challenger, Gray & Christmas, has projected retailers will add about 755,000 seasonal workers from October through December. That is about the same as last year, but still less than the 786,800 retail jobs added in the last quarter of 2013 and far less than the approximately 850,000 seasonal workers added in 1999.
