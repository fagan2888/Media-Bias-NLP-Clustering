Wendy Davis has been profiled quite a lot already; Greg Abbott, the attorney general and front-runner, will be campaigning for months yet. I was focusing on competitive (or meaningfully noncompetitive) primaries. But I did hear Republicans talking praisefully about Abbott's campaign. He'd hired 50 staffers to organize early, something Texas Republicans didn't normally do in the modern age of party dominance.\n\nImpressive, and reactive. The Democratic effort to \"turn Texas blue,\" by registering nonwhites and turning them out at a higher rate, absolutely has sunk in with Republicans. D.C.-based FreedomWorks, where Cornyn's campaign manager used to work, responded to the rollout of Battleground Texas by announcing a \"Come and Take It\" strategy that would allegedly cost $8 million and spring 250,000 volunteers into action. (Republicans here say they haven't seen much there; one speculated that it was a smart fundraising gimmick but not much more.) Not long after, Cornyn's campaign launched a vertical called Keep Texas Red, which is really just an outlet for his campaign. It's worked\u2014look at the email list/social media numbers\u2014while irritating some Tea Partiers who feel co-opted. And it came with a wonderful dystopian horror video.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Keeping Texas Red, With Memes", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "My trip to Texas didn't involve much reporting on the gubernatorial race.
