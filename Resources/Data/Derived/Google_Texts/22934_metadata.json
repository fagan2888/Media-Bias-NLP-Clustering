Its population once numbered in the millions, but widespread development has contributed to a sharp decline; as few as 200,000 are left.\n\nThe drop has been so dramatic that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is in the process of deciding whether to list the greater sage grouse as an endangered species \u2014 a designation that would bring with it stringent restrictions in the 11 Western states, including Colorado, that are considered part of the bird\u2019s range.\n\nThat possibility has sparked a major political battle, and Weller has stepped into the melee. Using as leverage the restrictions that would go along with an endangered listing, Weller and his office are offering ranchers a deal.\n\nIn exchange for helping protect the bird on their land, ranchers essentially would be spared \u2014 for 30 years \u2014 from being forced to do anything more if the greater sage grouse is listed as endangered. This even includes leeway if some of the birds are killed accidentally on their property.\n\n\u201cIf you agree to implement pro-sage grouse practices, Fish and Wildlife will give you 30 years of predictability,\u201d Weller said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the bird is listed or not. It\u2019s like an insurance policy.\u201d\n\nAs an added incentive, the Agriculture Department has doled out at least $267 million of federal funds to ranchers who have set aside part of their land for conservation or agreed to follow a checklist of pro-sage grouse measures vetted by Fish and Wildlife.\n\nSome of the results have been significant, according to federal figures. Since 2010, the Sage Grouse Initiative has recruited more than 1,100 ranches and led to the conservation of 4.4 million acres.\n\nMost of that acreage is the property of ranchers who have agreed to follow the checklist and who often are paid to do jobs such as cutting down invasive conifers, which are bad for the bird\u2019s habitat. At least 361,000 acres are for conservation easements.\n\nOne Colorado participant is Ray Owens, who manages the Bord Gulch Ranch in Moffat County.\n\nThe ranch has gotten about $300,000 from the Sage Grouse Initiative to make improvements, he said. These include the installation of nearly 20 miles of wildlife-friendly fencing and water wells designed to lure livestock away from sensitive wetlands considered crucial to the development of sage grouse chicks.\n\n\u201cBetween the fencing and the water, we\u2019ve been able to protect the habitat,\u201d said Owens, who added the improvements are helpful for cattle, too. \u201cWhat we do for the cows helps the sage grouse, and what we do for the sage grouse helps the cows.\u201d\n\nThat idea \u2014 helping ranchers and the bird simultaneously \u2014 is what Weller called the \u201csecret of the pudding.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also aided the agency in enlisting allies. A broad spectrum of groups has pledged support, from the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association to the National Audubon Society to the energy company ConocoPhillips, which promised $1 million in January to help the Sage Grouse Initiative.\n\n\u201cWe often see the rancher demonized, and we have to recognize these people are trying to make a living on a very tough landscape,\u201d said Brian Rutledge of the National Audubon Society.\n\nBut backing from environmentalists has not been universal. Some fear the program could be used as cover to ignore other threats such as energy development and \u201cunhealthy levels\u201d of livestock grazing.\n\nAnd the Natural Resources Conservation Service \u2014 at least for now \u2014 cannot say for sure what effect the program has had on the population, although officials there expect to get back survey results in the next couple years that will show an improvement.\n\n\u201cThis program is not going be a substitute for strong regulations,\u201d said Erik Molvar of WildEarth Guardians. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful, and it\u2019s prudent. But it\u2019s not going to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nTravis Bruner, executive director of the Western Watersheds Project, struck a similar tone and questioned whether the program has led to \u201cfurther subsidization of the livestock industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSage grouse habitat on public lands should be given more priority,\u201d he said.\n\nAn estimated 31 percent of sage grouse habitat is on private land, and Weller said enlisting landowners was critical. \u201cAt the end of the day, you could invest significant money in public lands and never move the needle,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal officials are so committed to this approach that they mirrored the sage grouse program with six other species, such as the gopher tortoise. Efforts also are underway to expand the concept and encourage landowners to help preserve entire ecosystems.\n\n\u201cIt all started with sage grouse,\u201d Weller said. \u201cThis was the laboratory.\u201d\n\nBut in his own life, the idea of bringing together landowners and environmentalists began one summer with a rancher named Dave Larson.\n\n\u201cEvery day, I try to think \u2018what would Dave think?\u2019 \u201d Weller said.\n\nFor his part, Larson likes the sage grouse program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good deal. The federal government is not your friend,\u201d Larson said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about the environment necessarily, but I do give a damn about my checkbook.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former ranch-hand wants to corral ranchers into saving the sage grouse", "title": "Former ranch-hand wants to corral ranchers into saving the sage grouse", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/former-ranch-hand-wants-to-corral-ranchers-into-saving-the-sage-grouse/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411__20150412_B8_CD12PDCWHISPERERJHEDp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411__20150412_B8_CD12PDCWHISPERERJHEDp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T01:54:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T01:47:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad33\"", "article_summary": "The project seeks to help all types of sage grouse, although attention lately has focused on the greater sage grouse.\nFor his part, Larson likes the sage grouse program.\nAn estimated 31 percent of sage grouse habitat is on private land, and Weller said enlisting landowners was critical.\n\u201cIt all started with sage grouse,\u201d Weller said.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Thanks to Brad Pitt, the sage grouse may have a future."}
