(Photo: Liz O. Baylen/Los Angeles Times/MCT)\n\nLast fall, I listened as a mother named Cary Dixon told her family\u2019s story at a forum I convened in West Virginia. It was heartbreaking. Cary\u2019s adult son has struggled with a substance use disorder for years, and she described the pain that families like hers have gone through. \u201cWe dread the next phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take vacations for fear of the next crisis. We come back from vacations because there\u2019s a crisis.\u201d\n\nCary and her family are far from alone. As the use of prescription drugs has increased over the past 15 or 20 years, so has their misuse \u2014 as well as the wreckage caused by other opioids like heroin. In fact, four in five heroin users started out by misusing prescription drugs, and then switched to heroin. As a consequence, between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin-related deaths in America nearly quadrupled. More Americans now die of drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes. In Michigan, overdoses claimed 1,762 lives in 2014 alone.\n\nThis crisis doesn\u2019t discriminate. It touches everybody \u2014 men and women, young and old, rich and poor, urban, suburban, and rural alike. It affects the coal miner or construction worker who takes pain medications for a work-related injury \u2014 or the doctor who writes them the prescription.\n\nYet for too long, the stigma of addiction has discouraged too many Americans from seeking and receiving the help they deserve. With no other disease do we expect people to wait until they\u2019re a danger to themselves or others to self-diagnose and seek treatment.\n\nSo we need to address this disease like we would any other \u2014 through effective prevention and treatment. We need to educate ourselves, our family members, and our communities about the dangers of prescription drug misuse as well as the availability of treatment and the hope of recovery. And we need to make sure every American seeking treatment can get it.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve directed my administration to address this crisis. We\u2019ve been working with communities to prevent and treat substance use disorders, pursue effective law enforcement strategies, reduce overdose deaths and support those in recovery. And in October, I announced plans to train more federal health care workers who prescribe opioids, identify barriers to good treatment, and rally support from outside of government to help address this epidemic.\n\nBut we need to do more to help families like Cary\u2019s. That\u2019s why the budget I\u2019m sending to Congress includes $1.1 billion in new funding to stop the opioid overdose epidemic \u2014 funding to help every American seeking treatment get the care they need. It will help states like Michigan expand their treatment capacity and make services more affordable. My budget will continue to support education, prevention, drug monitoring programs, and law enforcement efforts to keep illegal drugs out of our communities. And, finally, it will improve access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone \u2014 so that we can save more lives.\n\nThese are commonsense steps \u2014 steps to help Americans get the treatment they need, support law enforcement already stretching their resources, and support families and communities ravaged by this disease. I\u2019m encouraged by the bipartisan support we\u2019ve seen from leaders across the country on this issue, and I expect Congress to act. Because, rather than keep spending billions of taxpayer dollars on overly long prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, we can save money, improve public safety, and achieve better outcomes by focusing on getting treatment to those who need it.\n\nThis is a crisis that could touch any of us. These kids are our kids. These folks are our parents; our brothers and sisters; our neighbors and friends. We should treat them that way. We should take on this issue for their sake. And if we do that, we\u2019ll not only help our loved ones, we\u2019ll help strengthen our families, our community and our entire country.\n\nBarack Obama is President of the United States.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1XbfjlS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin-related deaths in America nearly quadrupled.", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "description": "Between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin-related deaths in America nearly quadrupled.", "title": "Congress must act to help curb prescription drug abuse", "url": "http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/02/06/congress-must-act-help-curb-prescription-drug-abuse/79845358/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/freep.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin-related deaths in America nearly quadrupled.", "creator": "@freep", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/04/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635902078374534802-US-NEWS-OXYCONTIN-1-3-1-654TC4N6-L276278991.JPG", "title": "Congress must act to help curb prescription drug abuse", "site": "@freep", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600072714", "fb": {"app_id": 185931034751252}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "painkiller addiction, drug abuse, gateway drug, heroin, heroin in the suburbs, heroin addiction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddec8\"", "article_summary": "In fact, four in five heroin users started out by misusing prescription drugs, and then switched to heroin.\nPrescription drugs have become a gateway to heroin and other opioids.\nAnd if we do that, we\u2019ll not only help our loved ones, we\u2019ll help strengthen our families, our community and our entire country.\nBut we need to do more to help families like Cary\u2019s.\nThese are commonsense steps \u2014 steps to help Americans get the treatment they need, support law enforcement already stretching their resources, and support families and communities ravaged by this disease."}
