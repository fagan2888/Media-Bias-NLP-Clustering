Rams starting to get healthier, look like last year's conference title team

FORT COLLINS — The Colorado State women's basketball team has established itself as the best defensive unit in the Mountain West. CSU leads the conference in both scoring defense and opponent field goal percentage.

Saturday, though, the Rams were up against an offensive unlike any other in the league.

San Jose State likes to shoot, and score, about as much as any team in the country. The Spartans' 85.1 points per game entering the day ranked fifth in the nation. They play fast and free, jacking up 3-pointers as often and as quickly as possible.

But the Rams' stingy defense held up to the unique matchup just fine. Their offense was pretty good too.

Holding SJSU to its second-lowest point total of the season, CSU won its ninth straight at Moby Arena, 77-59, for the Rams' fifth consecutive win overall and ninth victory in their past 10.

"San Jose State had us scared to death coming into this game," CSU coach Ryun Williams said. "They can really get out and go. I thought we controlled them pretty well for most of the (day). So this is a really good win against a team I thought is tough for us to guard and play against."

After dropping their Mountain West opener at Boise State, the Rams are now 5-1 in league play, just a game behind first-place Fresno State, which remained atop the conference after a last-minute one-point win at Wyoming on Saturday.

Injury-plagued for much of 2014-15, the Rams are now about as healthy as they've been all season, and it showed Saturday.

Alana Arias and AJ Newton each scored a game-best 14 points, while Jamie Patrick added 13 and Keyora Wharry 10 for CSU, which held the lead for all but a minute and 34 seconds and went up by 29 midway through the second half.

The 3-happy Spartans attempted 31 shots from behind the arc and made just seven, part of a 36.8 percent shooting day (25 for 68). They managed to play the game at their pace, averaging just 13 seconds a possession, but weren't nearly efficient enough to keep it close.

They tried pressing the Rams early but didn't find much success, and instead the full-court pressure led to several easy buckets to help CSU establish a commanding 43-23 halftime lead.

"We haven't really gotten pressed like that — Fresno does it — so it was nice to know that we can break a press under control without turning it over, because I don't think we had any turnovers on the press," said Newton, whose 14 points were her most since scoring 16 in the season opener.

SJSU senior guard Ta'Rea Cunnigan, the conference's fifth-leading scorer (16.2), was held to a season-low eight points on 3-of-12 shooting. Jasmine Smith was the lone Spartan in double figures with 11 as San Jose State dropped its third straight to fall to 8-9 overall and 2-4 in the MW.

"We have great scouting," said CSU forward Ellen Nystrom, who led all players with nine rebounds and had five assists and six points. "We know personnel, who to go out on, who to back off."

At times Williams has been down on his team's intensity this year, but not Saturday. He was particularly pleased with a transition layup Wharry had in the second half that put the Rams up 21 with 14 minutes still to play.

"The emotion that our kids played with today, we've been lacking that," Williams said. "These noon starts haven't been the best for us, so our kids got themselves ready to play, and I loved their emotion and togetherness."

CSU will not play Wednesday for the first time since the start of conference play before traveling to play at San Diego State on Jan. 24.
