Fat bikes are bicycles with large, low-pressure tires designed for travel on snow or sandy soil.\n\nThe park now has 6 miles of multiuse trails packed for nonmotorized recreation, including fat biking. The park is located on Post Road off State Hwy. 5, just west of the main terminal exit for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.\n\nMinnesota state parks and trails now have 78 miles suitable for winter fat-bike riding, according to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Other sites in the metro area include:\n\n\u2022 Luce Line State Trail (Wayzata), with 7 miles of multiuse trails groomed for nonmotorized recreation.\n\n\u2022 Gateway State Trail (St. Paul). The trail from Cayuga Street to Jamaica Avenue (11.9 miles) is open to winter biking, but east from Jamaica is groomed for cross-country skiing only.\n\nThe DNR advises people riding a fat bike to avoid snowmobile and cross-country ski trails, because almost all of those trails are not open to other uses during the winter. Skier and snowmobiler user fees pay for grooming and maintenance of these trails.\n\nFor more information on fat biking and where to ride in Minnesota, go to www.mndnr.gov/fatbike or contact the DNR Information Center at info.dnr@state.mn.us or 651-296-6157 or 888-646-6367 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nBurnsville\n\nFree skating event coming to ice center\n\nJanuary is National Skating Month, and on Sunday, Jan. 4, a free skating event will be held at the Burnsville Ice Center, 251 Civic Center Pkwy.
