Cory Monteith never won an Emmy.\u201d\n\nKlugman was quick to emphasize the fact that he had nothing against Cory Monteith personally and that he was in fact a big fan of the show, Glee. But, he said:\u201dto compare the contribution he made to the contribution my father made \u2014 it doesn\u2019t compare.\u201d\n\nThis year is the first time the organizers of the Emmy\u2019s are running the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d section, including tributes to five well known television stars. They include Jack Klugman, James Gandolfini, Gary David Goldberg, Jonathan Winters and Jean Stapleton.\n\nKen Ehrlich, the executive producer for the Emmy\u2019s said in a statement:\n\n\u201cEvery generation of television viewers has its favorites, and when we decided to expand the \u2018In Memoriam\u2019 segment to remember certain individuals, we wanted these pieces to be representative as well. To a younger generation, Cory Monteith\u2019s portrayal of Finn Hudson was highly admired, and the producers felt that he should be included along with the four other individuals we have singled out.\u201d\n\nAdam Klugman scoffed at the statement saying the organizers were side-stepping the main issue: \u201cLet\u2019s call this what it is. They\u2019re doing this because they think they\u2019re gonna get a younger generation of viewers to watch.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about the omission of Jack Klugman from the Emmy main feature? Do you think it is wrong that Cory Monteith will take the main spot or are you happy the organizers chose him?
