The body of a man found in a burning home in Golden on Saturday morning was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck, according to an arrest affidavit released Monday.

William Burchett, 54, was discovered by firefighters lying face down near his bed, his body suffering severe burns, according to the affidavit.

Thomas Kevin Laperch, 22, was arrested Sunday night on Denver’s 16th Street Mall. He faces arson and murder charges in the case.

Investigators say Laperch moved into the home at 711 Iowa St. from Maryland after answering the victim’s ad for a roommate on Craigslist, according to the affidavit.

Since then, the two argued about the rent, and Burchett told family he was planning to ask Laperch to leave.

Burchett’s body had multiple stab wounds to the face, neck and arms, according to the affidavit.

A judge advised Laperch of his rights Monday, but he hasn’t been formally charged yet.

Among other clues, police found the man’s home ransacked and an empty kerosene bottle lying on the floor.
