Today Wheatsville Co-op announced that its membership had voted to remove Eden Foods products from its shelves. The packaged organic giant was among the companies calling for an end to Obamacare's contraception mandate.

The grocery issued the following statement on its website:

"We know that some of our customers have been enjoying Eden Foods products for years and will be disappointed to learn that we will no longer stock that brand. As a cooperatively owned retail grocery, we abide by the rules mutually agreed upon in our bylaws and the collective decision reached by our owners. We appreciate the effort and time it took members of the co-op to bring this issue to a vote and are very proud of the cooperative and democratic process used to make the final decision."

The final totals had 65% for the ban, 35% against.
