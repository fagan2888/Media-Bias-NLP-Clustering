But the Republicans did win every contest they tried for, and one major loss was in Arizona, where Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle failed to unseat Democratic Senator Harry Reid.\n\nEven in an election where anger against the passage of the Affordable Care Act and rumblings against \u201cWashington insiders\u201d allowed a wave of business people with little to no elective experience to win high level congressional races, Angle was just a step too far for even most GOP voters.\n\nFrom calling for \u201csecond amendment remedies\u201d to election results if they didn\u2019t swing conservative, telling rape victims to \u201cmake lemonade\u201d out of their pregnancies and some of the most racist, anti-immigration language of the election cycle, Angle proved that there is such a thing as too extreme for the extreme right.\n\nDespite this lesson, and despite the GOP worrying about an election cycle where they are not only on the brink of catastrophe when it comes to endorsing a presidential candidate, but that they could possibly lose the Senate again, too, Angle is pushing her way back into the conversation in Nevada.\n\nWith Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s decision to step down at the end of 2016, Nevada Republicans know this is their best chance in decades to flip it into their party control. GOP Rep. Joe Heck had been the anointed party choice, but now Angle is prepped to primary the establishment\u2019s choice and see if she can snag the endorsement away from him.\n\n\u201cSharron Angle\u2019s entry into the Nevada Senate race creates a headache for Republicans hoping to sail through a primary and focus on a tough general election,\u201d reports The Hill. \u201cThe 2010 Republican Senate nominee\u2019s decision to run upends the party establishment\u2019s plan to rally behind Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.) in an uncontested primary as the GOP looks to flip the seat being vacated when Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) retires.\u201d\n\nAngle returning to the stage to challenge an \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate to the party nomination makes perfect sense when considering the wider landscape of GOP politics. With businessman Donald Trump solidly on the way to winning the party nomination for president \u2013 or at the very least blocking any Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d politician from winning enough delegates to secure the nomination himself \u2013 the frontrunner is serving up a model for any big name, anti-establishment politician to follow in order to win a lower level primary race similarly. It is a blueprint that could work especially well for Angle, who has similar extreme views on immigration and a love of xenophobic campaign rhetoric that has helped Trump soar to popularity among the far right.\n\nThe problem for Angle, however, is that this go around, she may be extremely unlikely to get the support of the anti-establishment political groups she needs to make a run at the nomination \u2013 either because they don\u2019t want to expend the resources, or they see her as already too damaged a candidate to win a general election.\n\n\u201cBack in 2010, Tea Party Express spent about half a million dollars helping Angle in the primaries\u2014playing a decisive role in supporting her then. Their less-than-enthusiastic statement about her entry in the 2016 primary isn\u2019t a positive sign for Angle,\u201d reports Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cFreedomWorks, another organization that spent about $300,000 on Angle in 2010, told Breitbart News it doesn\u2019t expect to endorse in the Nevada GOP senatorial primary. \u2018We do not anticipate endorsing in the Nevada Senate race,\u2019 FreedomWorks said in a statement. \u2018We\u2019re concentrating our resources on defending the House Freedom Caucus and a few Senate races, including Mike Lee in Utah.\u2019 Western Representation PAC, which was started in 2010 specifically to help defeat Reid and which spent more than a hundred thousand dollars in that effort, also said it won\u2019t be backing Angle again.\u201d\n\nWhile money groups may not be interested in backing Angle this go around, her decision to primary Heck shows that Tea Party candidates from the past are still not happy with the current GOP slate \u2013 even when some of their own are the ones in office. And with Trump\u2019s run successfully exposing the growing schism within the right, more Tea Party followers are increasingly vocal about demanding more anti-establishment representation on every level \u2013 even in calling out and primarying some of the biggest leaders of the party, like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\n\nWhat should be especially worrisome to the GOP currently is that those who were considered insurgent in 2010 and 2012 \u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio, Rep. Paul Ryan, Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 just a few years later are now already too centrist and \u201cinsider\u201d for a Tea Party that believes any involvement in governing actually taints a politician and makes him or her unsuitable to be in government itself.\n\nWith a mindset like that, is it any wonder that the GOP is falling to pieces, or that candidates like Sharron Angle are on their way back to the ticket?\n\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia commons", "article_metadata": {"description": "Angle's return shows the far right is even more divided than anyone thought.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3173/3172156.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "sharron angle,tea party,2016 elections,2016 nevada senate race,joe heck", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBack in 2010, Tea Party Express spent about half a million dollars helping Angle in the primaries\u2014playing a decisive role in supporting her then.\nBut the Republicans did win every contest they tried for, and one major loss was in Arizona, where Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle failed to unseat Democratic Senator Harry Reid.\n\u201cFreedomWorks, another organization that spent about $300,000 on Angle in 2010, told Breitbart News it doesn\u2019t expect to endorse in the Nevada GOP senatorial primary.\nWith a mindset like that, is it any wonder that the GOP is falling to pieces, or that candidates like Sharron Angle are on their way back to the ticket?\nTheir less-than-enthusiastic statement about her entry in the 2016 primary isn\u2019t a positive sign for Angle,\u201d reports Breitbart News."}
