NOW, IT\u2019S NEVER\n\nThe American College of Cardiology is changing its guidelines for when implanting coronary stents is appropriate \u2014 by banishing the term \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nNext year, the nation\u2019s leading heart-doctor group will remove the word used since 2009 to describe cases in which people don\u2019t need the metal-mesh tubes in their blood vessels. The label has become a liability in disputes with insurers and regulators, said Robert Hendel, who led the effort to update the wording.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018inappropriate\u2019 caused such a visceral response,\u201d said Hendel, a cardiologist at the University of Miami. \u201cA lot of regulators and payers were saying, \u2018If it\u2019s inappropriate, why should we pay for it, and why should it be done at all?' \u201d\n\nThe cardiology group replaced the \u201cInappropriate\u201d label with \u201cRarely Appropriate.\u201d Another category, cases in which there is medical doubt, will switch from \u201cUncertain\u201d to \u201cMay be Appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe changes reflect the controversy that has enveloped coronary stents, which are threaded through the circulatory system to open blocked arteries. With 700,000 procedures in the U.S. annually \u2014 at an estimated cost of $14 billion \u2014 use of the devices has become one of the hottest issues in cardiology.\n\nEight studies have found that stents are no better than drug-based therapy in preventing heart attacks and death in patients with stable heart disease. About 7 million Americans received stents over the past decade; roughly half of them had a heart attack or other acute syndrome.\n\n\u2014 Peter Waldman, Bloomberg News\n\nPREVENTING THE FLU MAY HELP YOUR HEART\n\nGetting a flu vaccine is associated with a lower risk of death in people with heart disease, a review of studies has found, and the effect is greatest in those who have had a recent heart attack or chest pain.\n\nThe review included five randomized trials that involved more than 6,400 heart patients. For patients with stable heart disease, a flu vaccination decreased the relative risk for a cardiovascular event by 36 percent. For people who had had a heart attack within the last year, the effect was greater: a 55 percent reduction in relative risk. Overall, those who were vaccinated had a 19 percent reduced risk of death.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that their conclusions are based on a relatively small number of cardiovascular events and deaths. At the same time, the review, published in JAMA, covered all randomized trials done on the subject, and there is no suggestion of inconsistency among them.\n\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t like vaccines probably don\u2019t like dying from heart attacks either,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Jacob A. Udell of the University of Toronto. \u201cMaybe this is a good enough reason for the skeptics to go and get their flu shots.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nicholas Bakalar, The New York Times\n\nCHILDREN\u2019S BRAIN SIZES MAY DEPEND ON UPBRINGING\n\nPoverty and lack of nurturing in early life may have a direct effect on a child\u2019s brain development, according to a study that found smaller brains in poor, neglected children.\n\nThe study of brain scans, published in JAMA Pediatrics, found children living in poverty without adequate nurturing had a smaller hippocampus, a brain region linked to learning and memory, than those who weren\u2019t poor or neglected. Poor children, even if not neglected by parents, were found to have less gray matter, which is linked to intelligence; less white matter, which helps transmit signals; and smaller amygdala, key to emotional health.\n\nThe study adds to previous research suggesting the stress of poverty in childhood can have lifelong effects on learning and emotional health, said Charles Nelson, who wrote an accompanying editorial. The findings bring researchers closer to understanding how experience shapes biology, he said.\n\n\u201cThis work adds to a growing body of evidence that early life events powerfully shape not only the course of child development but also adult development,\u201d said Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\u2014 Nicole Ostrow, Bloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "New rules on labeling coronary stents; staving off the flu may help your heart; and brain sizes in children"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd6d\"", "article_summary": "For patients with stable heart disease, a flu vaccination decreased the relative risk for a cardiovascular event by 36 percent.\n\u201cThe term \u2018inappropriate\u2019 caused such a visceral response,\u201d said Hendel, a cardiologist at the University of Miami.\nThe label has become a liability in disputes with insurers and regulators, said Robert Hendel, who led the effort to update the wording.\nAbout 7 million Americans received stents over the past decade; roughly half of them had a heart attack or other acute syndrome.\nEight studies have found that stents are no better than drug-based therapy in preventing heart attacks and death in patients with stable heart disease."}
