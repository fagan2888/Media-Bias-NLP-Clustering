In the United States and Canada, Muslim communities are fast becoming the target of violent and racist threats.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating several threats against mosques as potential hate crimes, according to the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).\n\nCAIR\u2019s Florida chapter reported two separate calls to mosques in the state over the past several days that threaten to bomb or shoot up the places of worship. For instance, just hours after the attacks in France on Friday night, a mosque in St. Petersburg, Florida received a voicemail from a man who said he planned to shoot Muslims, including children. The man made reference to the Paris murders, saying, \u201cthis act in France is the last straw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI [expletive] personally have a militia that is going to come down to your Islamic Society of Pinellas County and firebomb you and shoot whoever is there in the head,\u201d the man said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they are [expletive] two years old or 100. I am over your [expletive] [expletive] and our whole country is.\u201d\n\nCONTENT NOTE: The following recording contains graphic language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been other recent acts of violence against Muslims living in North America, too.\n\nIn Orange County, Florida, a Muslim family found three bullet holes on the side of their home this weekend. According to the incident report, they told the police they suspect people are retaliating against them in the aftermath of the Paris attacks. Mahmoud Elmasri and his family were not home at the time because they were \u201cout painting pictures of peace for the victims of the attacks in France,\u201d the Orlando Sentinel reports.\n\nIn Michigan, police have been investigating an individual who posted a threatening message to Muslims on Twitter after news broke that ISIS had claimed responsibility for the violence in France. \u201cDearborn, MI has the highest Muslim population in the United States. Let\u2019s [expletive] that place up and send a message to ISIS. We\u2019re coming,\u201d the individual tweeted on Saturday night. Cops in Dearborn say the person is \u201cno longer a threat.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Canada, authorities are investigating a case of arson at a Peterborough mosque on Saturday evening. No one was inside the mosque at the time, but the fire caused $80,000 in smoke damage and put the local Muslim community on edge. \u201cThis attack is very disturbing. The mosque is regularly attended by families with young children,\u201d the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) said in a news release following the incident.\n\nCAIR says these threats \u201cfit a pattern of increased hate-motivated crimes and bias incidents nationwide targeting persons and property associated, or perceived to be associated, with Islam and the American Muslim community.\u201d\n\nAside from violent threats stemming from radicals, anti-Muslim sentiment is also becoming evident in mainstream U.S. policy. A growing list of conservative governors have announced they won\u2019t accept any Syrian refugees within their borders, citing potential safety concerns \u2014 a position that President Obama has sharply criticized, saying that it\u2019s \u201cshameful\u201d to reject Muslim refugees and noting that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d\n\nMuslims around the world have condemned the recent terror attacks perpetrated by ISIS. The global Muslim community has long been harshly critical of ISIS, an extreme group that faith leaders insist is not representative of the fundamental tenets of Islam.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The deadly attacks in Paris and Beirut are already leading to an uptick in Islamophobic sentiment thousands of miles away.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The deadly attacks in Paris and Beirut are already leading to an uptick in Islamophobic sentiment thousands of miles away.", "title": "People Are Threatening To Retaliate To The Paris Attacks By Bombing Mosques In North America", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/11/16/3722637/threats-mosques-paris/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16130552/AP_639856467441-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The deadly attacks in Paris and Beirut are already leading to an uptick in Islamophobic sentiment thousands of miles away.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16130552/AP_639856467441-321x214.jpg", "title": "People Are Threatening To Retaliate To The Paris Attacks By Bombing Mosques In North America", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16130552/AP_639856467441-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16130552/AP_639856467441-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-16T14:32:03+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "I am over your [expletive] [expletive] and our whole country is.\u201dCONTENT NOTE: The following recording contains graphic language.\nAccording to the incident report, they told the police they suspect people are retaliating against them in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.\nThe deadly attacks in Paris and Beirut, which the militant terrorist group ISIS has claimed responsibility for, are already leading to an uptick in Islamophobic sentiment thousands of miles away.\nThere have been other recent acts of violence against Muslims living in North America, too.\nIn the United States and Canada, Muslim communities are fast becoming the target of violent and racist threats."}
