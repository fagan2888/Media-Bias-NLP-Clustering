The college has seen a decline since record enrollment in 2009.

Camden County College is looking to reverse its declining enrollment numbers following record-highs for the college in 2009, the Courier Post reports.

The college saw a decline of 885 students overall between 2009 and 2012, according to the report.

There are several contributing factors to the decline, according to the report: county population growth of just 2 percent between 2000 and 2008 as well as an aging demographic, the emergence of for profit post-secondary institutions and higher dropout rates for “at risk” students.

More people are also choosing work over college and the onset of the Affordable Care Act means potential students are covered by their parents’ insurance until they are 26, eliminating one need to enroll in college, according to the report.

The College is looking to reverse this decline with more outreach, more job training programs and the message that students can use Camden County College as a launching pad to other institutions, according to the report.
