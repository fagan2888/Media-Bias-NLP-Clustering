MARYS \u2014 The main strategic deterrent to nuclear conflict are the submarines home-ported at Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, and there is money in the budget to design the replacements for the Ohio Class subs that will begin going offline in 14 years, Adm. Jonathan W. Greenert, chief of Naval Operations said Tuesday.\n\nThat was good news to an appreciative crowd that gathered at a luncheon to thank Greenert, who visited sailors at Kings Bay at noon and Mayport later, for his continued support of the base. The Camden Partnership hosted the luncheon.\n\nAmong other things, Greenert came away with a resolution from Camden County, St. Marys, Kingsland and Woodbine declaring it Jonathan W. Greenert Day.\n\nMost of the talk, however, was a serious discussion about the Navy\u2019s needs, especially the new class of subs for Kings Bay. Kings Bay has eight Ohio Class subs.\n\nAlthough Greenert cautioned the Navy needed \u201cmoney help\u2019\u2019 in getting the replacements done on time, he said, \u201cIt will happen. It has to be done right.\u201d\n\nSome of the costs will be reduced because the U.S. is working with the United Kingdom to design the missile compartments for the submarines, Greenert said.\n\nWhen the boats are complete, the U.S. and Great Britain will be capable of firing each other\u2019s missiles, Greenert said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., who greeted Greenert at the luncheon, said simply of the $1.2 billion in design funding, \u201cThat\u2019s huge. We\u2019ve got to keep it going. That\u2019s full funding.\u201d\n\nChambliss also gave the same weight to Greenert\u2019s description of Kings Bay in the Navy\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cWhen he says Kings Bay is the No. 1 base in the U.S. for strategic deterrence, that\u2019s huge,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe man who is running to replace Kingston, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., said Congress has to make sure there is continued funding for military programs such as Kings Bay\u2019s key mission as money gets diverted.\n\nHe pointed to President Barack Obama\u2019s proposal to increase the funding for administration of the Affordable Care Act from $5 billion to $23 billion in a single year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just for the bureaucrats. That\u2019s not one dime in medicine,\u2019\u2019 Kingston said.\n\nCUTS STILL A DANGER\n\nProtecting Kings Bay\u2019s subs doesn\u2019t mean Obama won\u2019t cut other military funding, Kingston said.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have trouble finding money for programs he likes, but when it comes to the military, we\u2019re out of money,\u2019\u2019 Kingston said.\n\nEven if all the money is there, Greenert said there could be trouble finding the companies and labor force to build the replacement submarines and other ships.\n\nThe Navy needs major ship builders to construct the submarines and other replacement ships and their numbers have fallen from 10 in the 1990s to five now with another going out of business, he said.\n\n\u201cImagine losing one more,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn addition to building a new class of submarines, the Navy must also modernize its fleet of 22 cruisers.\n\nEleven already have been modernized but the rest must undergo the same transformation or they\u2019ll be obsolete in five or six years, he said.\n\nHe also said the Navy is still suffering the impact of sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The reduction in funds slowed the maintenance of ships so that others had to remain on deployment longer than they otherwise would have, but the Navy is finally catching up, Greenert said.\n\nHe made one announcement that should make Navy spouses happy.\n\nBy 2015, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking at a stable eight-month deployment.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat depends, however, on stability, and should the \u201cworld go crazy\u201d more ships would have to be deployed, he said.\n\nFormer state representative Charlie Smith of St. Marys advised Greenert the Navy could save a lot of money by moving \u201ca squadron of fast attack submarines from the icy north to Kings Bay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Smith,\u2019\u2019 Greenert joked, \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Kings Bay, Greenert was due to visit Mayport.\n\nTerry Dickson: (912) 264-0405", "article_metadata": {"description": "ST.
