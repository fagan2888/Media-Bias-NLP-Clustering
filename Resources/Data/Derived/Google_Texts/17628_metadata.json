Yours! Welcome to the sick world of the Obama administration, where taxpayer-funded sex changes are just the latest example of a presidency completely off the rails.\n\nTurns out, the White House was pretty busy last Friday after it dropped the bathroom bombshell on public schools. After threatening to pull federal funds from districts that protect the privacy of their students in locker rooms and showers, the administration took its agenda from the principal\u2019s office to the doctor\u2019s office. In a quiet rule change, Health and Human Services lowered the transgender boom on every hospital, physician, and insurer in America. Under these new regulations, which lean on the same radical interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as the Department of Education\u2019s order, \u201csex discrimination\u201d in health care has been unilaterally rewritten by HHS to include \u201cgender identity\u201d \u2014 something Congress never intended when it passed the statute a half-century ago. But when has the plain language of the law ever stopped this administration?\n\nCertainly not in this instance, when it\u2019s demanding that the entire health care industry include gender transition treatments as part of their services. Refuse, the president\u2019s team warns, and kiss your Medicare and Medicaid dollars goodbye. And it gets worse: the rule doesn\u2019t include a single religious exemption. In other words, as our own David Christensen pointed out to Breitbart, \u201cthis intolerant and unjust rule\u2026 forces health care providers to participate in and perform services that substantially violate their consciences.\u201d Heritage\u2019s Ryan Anderson takes it a step further: \u201cThey will effectively require controversial procedures, such as \u2018sex-reassignment\u2019 surgery, that respected medical professionals argue have not been proven to be effective in treating serious mental health conditions. Rather than respect the diversity of opinions on sensitive and controversial health care issues, the proposed regulations endorse and enforce one view.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what FRC warned about when Obamacare was passed. In the 2,000-plus pages of the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act, there are literally 4,156 issues left to the administration\u2019s discretion. (Or indiscretion, as this case would imply.) People everywhere are realizing \u2014 too late \u2014 that those issues include outrages like contraception mandates and politically-correct surgeries that no Congress would have approved. That\u2019s why the health care law is so dangerous. It empowers the government to practice politics \u2014 instead of empowering others to practice medicine. Making matters worse, the price tag of this kind of surgery is estimated at anywhere from $58,000 to $70,000 \u2014 a steep price for anyone to pay, let alone taxpayers.\n\nWith so many insurers ready to jump ship on Obamacare, this is far from a selling point. Despite the sky-high costs and an even higher controversy quotient, the Obama administration obviously thinks it\u2019s our responsibility to cover an elective body enhancement that only adds to the mental and physical risks for people suffering from gender confusion. In reality, if leaders truly cared about helping these suffering people, it would consider making counseling more accessible \u2014 and work to free Americans, not further enslave them, from this destructive lifestyle. As piles of research and personal testimonies confirm, this extreme health care doesn\u2019t help \u201cadvance equity,\u201d as the administration insists \u2014 but deep emotional and physical turmoil instead. In one of the largest studies of its kind, Sweden discovered that in many cases, the surgery may have actually exacerbated the problems. \u201c\u2026 [Ten] years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable non-transgender population.\u201d\n\nVictims like Walt Heyer understand that all too well. In his heart-wrenching story, the man who lived as a woman for eight years (and is now a happily married man) explains the torment of gender confusion.\n\n\u201cI myself suffered greatly to come to terms with my gender. I underwent gender reassignment surgery and lived for eight years as Laura Jensen, female. Eventually, I gathered the courage to admit that the surgery had fixed nothing\u2014it only masked and exacerbated deeper psychological problems. The deception and lack of transparency I experienced in the 1980s still surround gender change surgery today. For the sake of others who struggle with gender dysphoria, I cannot remain silent\u2026 The reprieve provided by surgery and life as a woman was only temporary. Hidden deep underneath the make-up and female clothing was the little boy carrying the hurts from traumatic childhood events, and he was making himself known. Being a female turned out to be only a cover-up, not healing. I knew I wasn\u2019t a real woman, no matter what my identification documents said. I had taken extreme steps to resolve my gender conflict, but changing genders hadn\u2019t worked. It was obviously a masquerade.\u201d\n\nLike most patients, Walt would have benefited greatly from a doctor who compassionately went through the alternatives to surgery. Now, others like him will have an even harder time finding a person willing to do so when the administration is strong-arming doctors into performing these harmful procedures. Dr. Jane Orient is one of the many physicians who thinks the profession is seriously compromised by Obama\u2019s orders. \u201cTransgender treatment, especially to minors, inflects irreversible harm on persons too young to consent. It constitutes radical social experimentation. Chemical or surgical castration should be considered a crime against humanity. Affirming a patients' delusions is considered psychiatric malpractice in other contexts.\u201d\n\nThis agenda doesn\u2019t offer parity \u2014 but pain. It\u2019s time for the president and his party to recognize that their extreme policies come at the expense of the population he claims to help. For more on this firestorm, don\u2019t miss FRC\u2019s lecture next Monday, May 23, \u201cThe Scientific Objectivity and Universality of Gender Difference\u201d at noon.\n\nOriginally published here.\n\nRep. Smith\u2019s Statute of Liberty\n\nPresident Obama may not be doing anything to protect religious liberty, but thank goodness the House is! Earlier this week, Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) made a big splash for our First Freedom by passing his bill out of the chamber \u2014 with unanimous support. Essentially, the measure gives some teeth to a 1998 bill that created the International Religious Freedom office and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. Both bodies operate under the umbrella of the State Department, but in a world where the threats to liberty are under unprecedented assault, Congress felt some \u201cupgrades\u201d were necessary to the original law.\n\nAmong other things, the Ambassador at-Large for International Religious Freedom will report directly to the Secretary of State. According to CNSNews, \u201cThe bill would also create \u2018a Designated Persons List of individuals sanctioned for participating or directing religious freedom abuses,\u2019 and would create a \u2018tier system\u2019 for International Religious Freedom reports on countries of particular concern (CPC) and a special watch list to identify countries with religious freedom violations that do not yet meet the criteria to receive a CPC designation.\u201d Another new feature of the policy would be the \u201cmandatory training on religious freedom for all Foreign Service officers.\u201d\n\nTogether, Republicans and Democrats agreed that the U.S. needs to better address a crisis that\u2019s led to global extremism, violence, and conflict. Our congratulations to Rep. Smith, who has been one of Congress\u2019s greatest champions on the plight of the persecuted. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) had plenty to say about the topic the next day at the Catholic Prayer Breakfast, where he made religious liberty the centerpiece of his keynote.\n\nTouching on topics from the Little Sisters of the Poor case to the abortion mandate, Ryan gave a powerful defense of the priority in American lives and policy.\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to know God, period \u2014 whatever your circumstances in life \u2014 rich or poor, strong or weak, famous or obscure. It is not that faith inspires you to work hard or raise a family or achieve your goals \u2014 though it very well might. Instead, faith is its own reward. The reason I bring this up is, these days religious liberty is under assault. A lot of people think faith is just an odd, colorful mask for the ugly face of intolerance. I am not saying we should feel put upon. I mean, saints were thrown to the lions. By that standard, we have it easy. What I am saying is, we have to advocate for our faith. And we should defend religious liberty not just on material grounds \u2014 that is, because people of faith do good things, like give to charity or volunteer. We should also defend it on spiritual grounds \u2014 that is, because living out our faith gives us joy.\u201d\n\nOriginally published here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What kind of country forces Marines to scavenge parts to keep their planes flying, but has no problem paying for *new* parts for the gender-confused?
