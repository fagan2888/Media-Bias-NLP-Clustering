And with the current Congress passing the fewest substantive bills of any Congress in modern history, it has become a more frequent tactic to accomplish certain goals.\n\nAs for Perdue\u2019s claim that Majority Leader Reid is in on the scheme, both of Congress\u2019 majority leaders \u2014 he and Republican House Speaker John Boehner \u2014 are tasked with scheduling votes on a tiny fraction of the thousands of bills introduced every year. Members of the minority party in both houses have voiced frustration when they don\u2019t get a vote on a bill they care about, and have tried several tactics to force the majority to hold one. Democrats in the House tried to force votes on immigration reform and unemployment insurance when Boehner refused to allow those bills to the floor, while Republicans in the Senate have tried to force votes on approving the Keystone XL pipeline and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Those same Senate Republicans have filibustered hundreds of bills that Reid has brought up for a vote, from background checks for gun purchases to the nominee for Surgeon General.\n\nStill, the idea of the president going overboard on executive actions resonates among many Republican voters, including Gene and Sandy Yancey, who lead the Grace Church of Georgia and came out to Perdue\u2019s rally this weekend. Sandy Yancey told ThinkProgress she fears this November \u201cmight be our last election ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rogue government and they consider our Constitution tissue paper, toilet paper!\u201d she said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re in the crux between freedom and slavery for 300-plus million people. That\u2019s what the rogue government wants to do. To me, [this election] is our last great hope for freedom.\u201d\n\nHer husband agreed, adding that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned about every one\u201d of the president\u2019s executive orders. \u201cObama is trying to enslave us and become a dictator, using his executive orders and bypassing the Congress,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing we\u2019re drifting into and we need to stop it on November 4th. The only thing we can do is try to vote for these people to give us a little freedom, a little longer to be free.\u201d\n\nThe Yanceys told ThinkProgress they fear the President will \u201cconfiscate anyone\u2019s food, clothing and shelter\u201d and \u201cdeclare martial law.\u201d\n\nNearly every past president, Republicans and Democrats, have used the constitutional power of the executive order, and many have used it far more than President Obama. To date, he has signed 192 executive orders\u2014on issues ranging from LGBT workplace rights to immigration. To put that in perspective, Ronald Reagan signed 381, while Teddy Roosevelt issued a whopping 1,081. Of course, President Obama has a few more years in office, but he\u2019s been averaging about 33 orders per year, fewer than any president going back to Grover Cleveland.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Supporters of David Perdue (R-GA) told ThinkProgress they agree, and fear President Obama will \"confiscate anyone's food, clothing and shelter\" and \"declare martial law.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Supporters of David Perdue (R-GA) told ThinkProgress they agree, and fear President Obama will \"confiscate anyone's food, clothing and shelter\" and \"declare martial law.\"", "title": "Senate Candidate Claims Harry Reid Is Conspiring To Let Obama Run The Country Unilaterally", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/10/25/3584521/david-perdue-obama-tyranny/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSCN3175.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Supporters of David Perdue (R-GA) told ThinkProgress they agree, and fear President Obama will \"confiscate anyone's food, clothing and shelter\" and \"declare martial law.\"", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSCN3175-321x214.jpg", "title": "Senate Candidate Claims Harry Reid Is Conspiring To Let Obama Run The Country Unilaterally", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSCN3175.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DSCN3175.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-25T12:50:02+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AliceMOllstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdee8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cObama is trying to enslave us and become a dictator, using his executive orders and bypassing the Congress,\u201d he warned.\nTo me, [this election] is our last great hope for freedom.\u201dHer husband agreed, adding that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned about every one\u201d of the president\u2019s executive orders.\nPolitics Senate Candidate Claims Harry Reid Is Conspiring To Let Obama Run The Country Unilaterally CREDIT: Alice OllsteinMCDONOUGH, GEORGIA\u2014David Perdue, the Republican candidate for Georgia\u2019s open Senate seat in one of the tightest races in the nation, told a crowd of supporters this weekend that Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid is in cahoots with President Obama to allow him to govern through executive orders.\nThe president has said repeatedly that he resorts to executive orders only when Congress refuses to act on urgent matters of national importance.\nOf course, President Obama has a few more years in office, but he\u2019s been averaging about 33 orders per year, fewer than any president going back to Grover Cleveland."}
