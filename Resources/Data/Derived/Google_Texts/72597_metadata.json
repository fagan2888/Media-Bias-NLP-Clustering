It\u2019s a sad speech to read, in some sense, since it contains within it the promise of a presidency that we never saw come to fruition \u2013 the sort of policy effort that might have been launched to bipartisan success in the first year of his presidency, instead of his effort on Obamacare.\n\nIn context today, it comes after the point where most Americans have begun to tune him out, just as they do with nearly all second term presidencies. For the first time, Obama is now below 40 percent approval on every issue polled. As the Washington Post notes, even on issues where Obama looks to be in agreement with the American people, he\u2019s now lagging terribly. Even Millennials are now down on Obama. Whether this is because Americans have lost faith in Obama personally, or just reached a threshold where they are tired of his presence on the screen, his call for an effort to combat inequality is falling on deaf ears.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just as well, since the president has things all backwards. Consider this passage of his remarks:\n\n\u201cA new study shows that disparities in education, mental health, obesity, absent fathers, isolation from church, isolation from community groups \u2013 these gaps are now as much about growing up rich or poor as they are about anything else. The gap in test scores between poor kids and wealthy kids is now nearly twice what it is between white kids and black kids. Kids with working-class parents are 10 times likelier than kids with middle- or upper-class parents to go through a time when their parents have no income. So the fact is this: The opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race, and that gap is growing.\u201d\n\nDoes the president really not realize that he has the causation here completely backwards? He\u2019s spoken eloquently in the past about the dangerous decline of fatherhood among the working class. It\u2019s not that being poor means you\u2019ll have absentee parents, it\u2019s that absentee parents \u2013 particularly absentee breadwinners \u2013 means you end up poor. Where the middle class and upper class are better insulated from the consequences of the economic pain that comes from family breakups, the poor are not.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, it means you can\u2019t afford to live in a place with a good school, and government policy prevents you from learning elsewhere; it means mom has to work two jobs and can\u2019t take time off to take you to the dentist, which can\u2019t be scheduled because you\u2019re on Medicaid; it means you\u2019re likelier to drop out and end up permanently ensconced on assistance programs because you never had the intact family pressure to stay in school and learn a skill.\n\nThe greatest elevator of people from lower class to middle class life is an intact household. Robert Rector has done plenty of digging on this, and the ramifications are staggering:\n\nIncome inequality is not primarily an economic problem. It is a problem of societal decline and the breakdown of family structures, accelerated by government but not solely by government. Barack Obama the family man could\u2019ve made a difference in this regard, but decided not to. Instead, he embarked on an agenda which has been great for corporate America, Big Banks, and Wall Street, and generally terrible for wage growth and working families. Evan Soltas has a little piece here, frustrated that people are looking to get rich off Obamacare, wringing his hands about how \u201cthe expected increase in health-care profits has a whiff of rent about it.\u201d What do you expect to happen when you make it illegal not to buy a corporation\u2019s product which drives these profits? That\u2019s who this presidency has been for all along. As Jeffrey Anderson notes:\n\nThe utter failure of Obama\u2019s trickle-down-government approach is perhaps best captured by two contrasting stats. When he took office, we were a full year into a major recession. Economically, there was almost nowhere to go but up. And, indeed, that\u2019s what the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks the stock prices of 30 very large companies, has done: gone up. In January 2009, the Dow was at about 8,000. It\u2019s now at about 16,000. It has essentially doubled on Obama\u2019s watch. Meanwhile, according to Census Bureau figures compiled by Sentier Research, the median American household income when the Obama household took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in January 2009 was $55,972 (in 2013 dollars). Now, nearly five years later, the median American household income is just $52,529. That\u2019s a decrease of $3,443 \u2013 or more than 6 percent. And that\u2019s during a \u201crecovery\u201d! If Americans\u2019 median income were now merely the same (in real dollars) as during the recession, that would mark Obama\u2019s tenure as a miserable economic failure. Instead, Americans\u2019 median income has noticeably dropped. It\u2019s important to note that these median-income figures include government payments, such as unemployment.\n\nToday, Obama is describing inequality as \u201cthe defining challenge of our time\u201d. But his agenda for the second term has been about everything but that. His second term has seen payroll taxes go up for all working Americans and a prioritization of immigration reform, gun control, climate change and a host of environmental issues which \u2013 while they might appeal to his allies on Wall Street and in Hollywood \u2013 have nothing to do with income inequality. In many cases, these policies are actually negatives for the working class, driving up the costs of goods and negatively impacting wages and working hours.\n\nIf this was the defining challenge of our time, why did he spend so much time on policies unrelated to it? Why did he go down a policy path which led in the opposite direction? And why, even today, is he bypassing any possibility of brokering a bipartisan effort to combat \u201cthe defining challenge\u201d and instead prioritizing a clumsy, tired, politically dead-end solution \u2013 minimum wage hikes \u2013 which without question has a negative effect on low-skill job creation while aiding his powerful union allies?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/obamas-shallow-inequality-speech-and-the-presidency-that-might-have-been/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obama-speech.jpeg", "type": "activity", "title": "Obama\u2019s Shallow Inequality Speech And The Presidency That Might Have Been"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2a7\"", "article_summary": "The gap in test scores between poor kids and wealthy kids is now nearly twice what it is between white kids and black kids.\nHe\u2019s spoken eloquently in the past about the dangerous decline of fatherhood among the working class.\nPresident Obama\u2019s speech yesterday on inequality is being lauded as one of the best of his life, by people who paid attention to it.\nIt\u2019s not that being poor means you\u2019ll have absentee parents, it\u2019s that absentee parents \u2013 particularly absentee breadwinners \u2013 means you end up poor.\nIn many cases, these policies are actually negatives for the working class, driving up the costs of goods and negatively impacting wages and working hours."}
