Armed with two handguns, a trio of young men drove a silver Toyota 4Runner up Highway 101. Near a Belmont neighborhood off the Holly Street exit, they spotted their rival, Chew, in a Dodge Charger. At least a dozen shots were fired as the vehicle carrying Chew, its doors pierced by bullets, screeched onto the freeway, swerving through lanes before crashing into a construction fence.\n\nA week later, Baker, 21, was shot several times and bled to death on Terra Villa Avenue in East Palo Alto. Two nights after that, four young men with handguns waited for Gipson outside the Impala nightclub in San Francisco. The 27-year-old\u2019s lifeless body was found in the early morning darkness.\n\nThe skies were clear on a Monday afternoon in January 2013 when bullets hailed on Illinois Street in East Palo Alto, killing 24-year-old Alcazar. On a Saturday evening two weeks later, 21-year-old Coleman died of gunshot wounds on the city\u2019s Capitol Avenue.\n\nThe attempted murder of Chew and the killings of Baker, Gipson, Alcazar and Coleman led the San Mateo County District Attorney to launch an 18-month investigation that officials consider the county\u2019s most extensive crackdown on gang activity. Investigators nicknamed their operation \u201cSunny Day,\u201d a reference to the code words that gang members occasionally used to signal a successful hit.\n\nClosely monitoring cellular and GPS data, along with youthful boasts on social media, the investigators uncovered an ongoing series of gang retaliations that extended past East Palo Alto\u2019s borders into cities from Menlo Park to San Francisco. The electronic trail led to the indictment of 16 people, 11 of whom were from East Palo Alto. None have yet to go to trial.\n\nLaw enforcement officials continue to pursue leads, according to the East Palo Alto Police Chief Lee Violett, who noted that this year the city has experienced a decrease in shootings and other types of violent crime. During the first half of 2013, East Palo Alto had seven homicides. Since last August there have been two.\n\nSteve Wagstaffe, the San Mateo County District Attorney, believes Operation Sunny Day served to warn gang members of the severe consequences of their violent activity.\n\n\u201cI had a person from [East Palo Alto] come in last week and said she\u2019s lived in EPA for over 20 years,\u201d Wagstaffe said in April. \u201cThe shocking thing is that since this all went public \u2026 she had not heard a gunshot or a police siren.\u201d\n\nA city in transition\n\nThough it remains one of the few places in the Silicon Valley where housing costs are within reach for low-income families, East Palo Alto has seen dramatic change in recent decades. Latinos make up the majority in the once-predominantly black city, and even this demographic shift might be fleeting. The latest tech boom has caused home prices to soar, as start-ups and behemoths like Facebook encroach along the city\u2019s edges, pricing out longtime residents.\n\nThe demand for housing among skilled tech workers would have been unfathomable in 1992, when the city boasted the country\u2019s highest murder rate. Since then, East Palo Alto has seen a dramatic drop in crime, including 345 fewer homicides, rapes, armed assaults and robberies in 2012 than in 1992.\n\nBut one problem persists \u2014 the city has struggled to lose its unwanted reputation as a center for gang activity in San Mateo County.\n\nIn 2012, the situation became particularly acute for residents, some of who found themselves living in a war zone. The number of assaults involving a weapon jumped from 129 to 230 between 2011 and 2012, and again remained high last year.\n\nTypically gangs do not target innocent people, but bystanders are sometimes caught in the crossfire. On an early Sunday morning in 2011, shots on Wisteria Drive fatally wounded 3-month-old Izak Jesus. Law enforcement officials often refer to the \u201cbaby Izak\u201d case to illustrate the communitywide toll of gang violence.\n\nLast year\u2019s fatal shooting of 16-year-old Jose Luis Quinones led then-East Palo Alto Police Chief Ron Davis to declare a \u201ccrime emergency,\u201d requiring officers to work overtime and canceling off days. While Davis declared the emergency over three weeks later, gang warfare continued to rattle the city in the months that followed.\n\nGang members contributed to a rise in burglaries within the county, according to officials from the San Mateo Gang Task Force and the East Palo Alto Police Department. In addition to stealing firearms, gang members tapped into the statewide prescription drug epidemic by breaking into expensive homes in the middle of the day. They\u2019d often head straight for the medicine cabinet, investigators said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten so bad that if you have an open house and you\u2019re selling your home, your Realtor will tell you to remove all prescription pills,\u201d said Sgt. Leo Capovilla of the San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Office Gang Investigative Unit.\n\nHistory of gang violence\n\nViolence in East Palo Alto often takes the form of shootings, and inter-gang disputes nearly always involve \u201cturf,\u201d or areas in the city where gangs can sell drugs.\n\nThe gangs have changed over time, however, based on generational and demographic shifts. In the 1980s, East Palo Alto was home to the Midtown Hogs, a predominantly African-American gang whose primary source of income was crack cocaine. The Midtown Hogs are partly blamed for the city\u2019s crack epidemic of the late eighties and early nineties.\n\nMidtown Hogs evolved into the Taliban, which most recently fought Da Vill, another predominantly African-American gang, and Sac Street, a Norte\u00f1o subset, according to members of the San Mateo County Gang Task Force, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they often work undercover.\n\nEast Palo Alto\u2019s demographic shift has helped determine which gangs pervade the city. In recent years, African-American gangs spread to other parts of the Bay Area, while Latino gangs stayed closer to home.\n\nAlthough most gangs are divided along racial lines, some, like \u201cSac Street,\u201d have absorbed African-Americans and Latinos who live on Sacramento Street.\n\nDrugs \u2014 namely marijuana \u2014 are the gangs\u2019 primary financial pipeline, according to the task force.\n\nTask force members said a handful of families living in East Palo Alto have connections to Mexican cartels, which smuggle drugs across the border and give them to gang members to sell on city streets. Most of the clientele is not from East Palo Alto, the task force explained. Located along Highway 101, the city is a convenient stopping point for outsiders to make a quick purchase and then speed away.\n\nWhile the Norte\u00f1os funnel some drug funds to Nuestra Familia, a Mexican-American gang operating from state and federal prisons, much of the money is spent on accessories that promote image. One task force member recalls finding a closet filled with Air Jordans, each pair worth around $100. Angel Santuario, a community organizer for Peninsula Interfaith Action, said \u201cbling\u201d gives gang members status.\n\n\u201cSome of it may be about liberation and freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge need in our communities to feel respected, to feel like we have dignity. For some of those folks, that\u2019s why they go out and buy brand new Nikes. It\u2019s to be respected in their world.\u201d\n\nOften divided along racial and ethnic lines, the gangs capitalize on the vulnerability of youth in search of identity and community. Many gang members show their allegiance through the colors they wear and the tattoos they sport.\n\nThe Sac Street gang uses the Stanford University logo as its symbol \u2014 the S stands for its street name, the red for the gang\u2019s color and the tree for marijuana, a primary source of income.\n\nThe Norte\u00f1os operate along the border between Menlo Park and East Palo Alto. In late 2012, a generational struggle for leadership triggered a significant increase in shootings and assaults in East Palo Alto, according to the task force.\n\n\u201cThe younger generation of the gang members are hanging out separately,\u201d one task force member said. \u201cThey started feuding with each other \u2026 they\u2019re part of the same gang [but] killing each other.\u201d\n\nOperation Sunny Day\n\nThe four murders and attempted murder in 2012 and early 2013 sent San Mateo County officials on a manhunt that would unravel a longstanding gang war between Da Vill, Sac Street and the Taliban. The war extended past East Palo Alto\u2019s borders into Menlo Park, Belmont, Redwood City and San Francisco.\n\nIn the following months, the San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Office partnered with every police agency in the county and three federal agencies \u2014 Homeland Security, the U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Detectives obtained warrants to monitor GPS and cellular data, as well as recorded telephone conversations from inside jail cells to understand the inner workings of gang activity.\n\nWagstaffe, the District Attorney, emphasized that investigators based their case entirely on electronic surveillance. \u201cThey were right down to the same area where [crime] was located,\u201d he said.\n\nAs detectives listened in on conversations, one phrase stood out: \u201cIt\u2019s a sunny day in East Palo Alto.\u201d Based on the timing, they concluded the phrase could mean only one thing. The killings were being planned and carried out.\n\nSocial media also helped connect the dots. According to the task force, the notion of \u201crespect\u201d \u2014 or instilling fear \u2014 and an obsession with \u201cimage\u201d motivate gang members to use social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to brag about their activities.\n\nAt the same time, social media desensitizes the severity of crime, according to a task force member, who said gang members sometimes post videos of a violent act, evoking a \u201cmentality that it\u2019s funny to shoot someone.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Wagstaffe announced the indictments. The 16 suspects were charged with murder, attempted murder, coercion of witnesses, drug trafficking and illegal firearms possession.\n\nThe Police Department and Community Outreach\n\nAlthough Da Vill and Sac Street are based in East Palo Alto and the Taliban has reached across the border into eastern Menlo Park, Operation Sunny Day required little involvement from the city police.\n\nViolett said the multi-agency probe served to offset East Palo Alto\u2019s \u201cfinite resources,\u201d allowing his department to assign just one detective to the investigation.\n\nTo fight gangs in recent years, the Police Department also has enlisted the help of neighboring departments and promoted community-policing programs, often funded by state and federal grants.\n\nIn March 2011, East Palo Alto implemented Operation Ceasefire, a federally funded initiative designed to target and motivate youth with violent pasts to reshape their lives.\n\nKimberly Smith, the former director of Operation Ceasefire, managed the program\u2019s law enforcement side and served as an intermediary between the city and the county. One of the program\u2019s initial challenges was to relieve tension between the need to promote community relations and the need to crack down on gang violence, she said.\n\n\u201cThe community was very sensitive to having a lot of people all of a sudden being labeled as gang members,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat created pushback and resistance.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating matters is that the city\u2019s Latino population \u2014 about 65 percent \u2014 has trust issues with the police, said Angel Santuario of Peninsula Interfaith Action, a community nonprofit. Santuario has heard complaints that the department makes it difficult for citizens to report suspected criminal activity anonymously. Because residents fear retribution, they are reluctant to come forward.\n\nCity Councilman Ruben Abrica believes community-policing programs have helped improve those relations. In March, after rumors circulated that the city might outsource police services to the county Sheriff\u2019s Office, hundreds showed up at a council meeting to protest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not every day the community comes out to defend the police,\u201d Abrica said. \u201cEven young people were saying that the Police Department is not perfect but we can work with the police.\u201d\n\nCommunity groups, notably members of the clergy and youth organizations, helped close gaps between the community and the police, according to Smith and Melvin Gaines, the department\u2019s special projects manager. Gaines said community policing reflects a change in a past mentality that police officers could \u201carrest [their] way out of a problem.\u201d\n\nOperation Ceasefire approached 83 potential participants, many with gang backgrounds. Forty-eight agreed to take part and 18 remain active. Two of the suspects arrested in Operation Sunny Day were Ceasefire candidates, according to Gaines.\n\nThe grant money for Operation Ceasefire ran out in December 2013. Although the city reapplied, the application was not approved because \u201cother agencies had more compelling proposals,\u201d Gaines said.\n\nReliance on such money poses its own challenges, he added. While grants allow for East Palo Alto to experiment with a range of community initiatives, the city is also under constant pressure to find a steady source of funding. Sarah Lawrence, the director of UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Law\u2019s Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation, sees little alternative, saying this is the \u201cnature of federal, local and state dynamics of funding streams.\u201d\n\nLooking back, Smith thinks Operation Ceasefire could have been more successful had law enforcement been more aggressive.\n\n\u201cThe whole message of Ceasefire is that \u2018we hope you guys get some assistance [but] if you call our bluff we\u2019re coming after you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we never went after anyone.\u201d\n\nWhile she does not advocate for a \u201cpolice state,\u201d Smith said, having a greater number of police officers on the street is an inherent deterrent.\n\nViolett said he could not speak to Operation Ceasefire\u2019s effectiveness because the program was implemented under Davis, but he acknowledged that a key component to any community-policing program is to \u201cback up what you say you\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nGaines believes Operation Ceasefire\u2019s future will depend on whether community groups, once a financial incentive is removed, will continue to work with the police or shift resources to other initiatives.\n\nWhile Operation Sunny Day is credited with helping to curb gang violence, this state of peace is likely temporary, according to the task force. Gang members may just be taking a step back to try to anticipate what law enforcement will do next, all while leaving a lingering power vacuum.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Angel Santuario,East Palo Alto,East Palo Alto City Council,gang violence,Kimberly Smith,Lee Violett,Leo Capovilla,Marianne Levine,Melvin Gaines,Operation Ceasefire,Operation Sunny Day,Ruben Abrica,San Mateo County Gang Task Force,Steve Wagstaffe,violence,violence prevention,Crime,Features,Culture & Features,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia,Politics & Gov", "description": "Overall crime has dropped in East Palo Alto as gentrification continues, but one problem persists \u2014 the city has struggled to lose its unwanted reputation as a\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f6c\"", "article_summary": "The electronic trail led to the indictment of 16 people, 11 of whom were from East Palo Alto.\nA week later, Baker, 21, was shot several times and bled to death on Terra Villa Avenue in East Palo Alto.\nSince then, East Palo Alto has seen a dramatic drop in crime, including 345 fewer homicides, rapes, armed assaults and robberies in 2012 than in 1992.\nThe skies were clear on a Monday afternoon in January 2013 when bullets hailed on Illinois Street in East Palo Alto, killing 24-year-old Alcazar.\nDuring the first half of 2013, East Palo Alto had seven homicides."}
