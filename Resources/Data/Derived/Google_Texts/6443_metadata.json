That's what JC Penney's store leader says Thanksgiving evening is for the hundreds of customers crowding the store in search of great deals.\n\n\"It has been a wonderful response,\" Josh Sanders says. \"The line formed about 30 minutes before we opened the doors, and it went from about 12 people to almost 300 people in a matter of 15 minutes.\"\n\nSanders says JC Penney will pull in about 300 percent more tonight than what they usually see on an average Saturday. Workers have been preparing for an entire week to make sure everything goes smoothly. But keep in mind, these are some of your most dedicated shoppers, and they're prepared to deal with a little discomfort.\n\n\"There's a lot of people in one spot, like I said, it's pretty crowded and chaotic at some points, but it's worth coming out and seeing the good deals,\" shopper Robert Allen Palmer says.\n\n\"Last year I couldn't have come out here freezing my butt off to get into a store for almost hours in a line,\" shopper Kayla Douglas says.\n\nMany of the shoppers, like Polly Medcaff, are seasoned vets at this game.\n\n\"I'm kind of like an old pro. I've probably been doing this over 10 years now,\" she laughs.\n\nShe says she's pretty much mastered the art of Black Friday sales. Her advice to newcomers: be prepared and be fast.\n\n\"You have to plan what stores you're going to hit first,\" Medcaff explains. \"Then, you have to know exactly where your items are. Once you hit those items, you run to the cash register, and then you run to the car, and then you run on to your next store!\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Hundreds of shoppers crowd Bonita Lakes for Thanksgiving shopping.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "Hundreds of shoppers crowd Bonita Lakes for Thanksgiving shopping.", "title": "Hundreds of Shoppers Crowd Local Stores", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Hundreds-of-Shoppers-Crowd-Local-Stores-284115531.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/CB8/CBE/CB8CBEE9041D4EB98303A5F51E9EEC2A", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A1E/C46/A1EC46B4350F417AA71147B8DCBF2EF8.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Hundreds of shoppers crowd Bonita Lakes for Thanksgiving shopping.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Hundreds-of-Shoppers-Crowd-Local-Stores-284115531.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/line+(400x225).jpg", "title": "Hundreds of Shoppers Crowd Local Stores", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Hundreds of Shoppers Crowd Local Stores", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hundreds of Shoppers Crowd Local"}, "article_summary": "That's what JC Penney's store leader says Thanksgiving evening is for the hundreds of customers crowding the store in search of great deals.\nBut keep in mind, these are some of your most dedicated shoppers, and they're prepared to deal with a little discomfort.\n\"Last year I couldn't have come out here freezing my butt off to get into a store for almost hours in a line,\" shopper Kayla Douglas says.\nMany of the shoppers, like Polly Medcaff, are seasoned vets at this game.\nOnce you hit those items, you run to the cash register, and then you run to the car, and then you run on to your next store!\""}
