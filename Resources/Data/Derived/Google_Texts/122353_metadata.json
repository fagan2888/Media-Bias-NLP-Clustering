The horrors were mostly baked into the law, with some made worse by the president\u2019s dishonest hard sell to get unsuspecting Americans to sign up.\n\nPremium defaults\n\nObama claimed Friday that 7.5 million people have enrolled in exchange coverage. In fact, perhaps 20 percent haven\u2019t paid their first premium and therefore aren\u2019t covered, according to estimates by RAND Corp. and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe bigger question is how many will keep paying premiums. That\u2019s got the American Medical Association, a chief ObamaCare booster, so worried that it\u2019s sending warnings to its members.\n\nWhy the concern? First-time insurance purchasers, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, will be shocked by ObamaCare\u2019s high deductibles, about $3,000 for the silver plan (the most commonly selected) and $5,000 for the bronze plan (the most affordable).\n\nBasically, you\u2019ll have to pay thousands out of pocket for appointments, tests and prescriptions until you reach your deductible.\n\nMillennials who heard Obama say on \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d that they can buy a health plan for the price of a cellphone contract won\u2019t be laughing when they realize what the $5,000 deductible means. (It\u2019s like a cellphone contract that makes you pay $5 a text for your first thousand texts.) Rather than pay thousands out of pocket for care while also paying premiums, some will quit paying premiums.\n\nThat\u2019s why the AMA is worried. Section 1412 of the health law gives consumers a 90-day \u201cgrace period\u201d before their subsidized plan is canceled for nonpayment. But insurers only have to keep paying doctors and hospitals for 30 days. The next 60 days of care are on the care provider. The AMA says \u201cit could pose a significant financial risk for medical practices.\u201d\n\nPremium hikes\n\nConsumers reeling from Obama\u00adCare premium shock are in for another jolt when the 2015 rates come out.\n\nOverall, consumers had to pay far more for individual plans this year. In some states (Delaware and New Hampshire), rates went up 90 percent or even 100 percent, according to a newly released Morgan Stanley analysis.\n\nAnd insurance executives already are warning about double- or triple-digit hikes for next year. \u201cI do think it\u2019s likely premium-rate shocks are coming,\u201d said Chet Burrell, CEO of Care First BlueCross BlueShield. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, one of the first to raise the alarm, said increases \u201ccould go as high as 100 percent.\u201d\n\nIn most states, insurers will be setting their 2015 rates in June, but the administration is doing everything possible to keep the grim news under the radar until after the November elections. It even postponed the beginning of the open enrollment period until Nov. 15.\n\nLosing on-the-job coverage\n\nBut there\u2019s no way to hide the impact on the 25 million to 30 million Americans who could lose coverage in the coming months.\n\nFor the same reasons that millions of policies in the individual market were canceled last year, employers who buy plans in the small-group market will have a hard time renewing their old plans this year. Many will have to choose between providing the more costly ObamaCare benefit package or dropping coverage altogether.\n\nCount on employers with low-wage work forces (such as retailers, hoteliers and restaurateurs) to push employees and their families into the exchanges.\n\nProtests over cancer care\n\nCancer is the leading cause of death in America and our No. 1 health fear. But access to the nation\u2019s top cancer centers is becoming a hot-button issue, as ObamaCare enrollees are finding how few choices of hospitals and doctors they have.\n\nMany plans exclude all specialty cancer hospitals, even though research shows that women with ovarian cancer, for example, live a year longer when they are treated at high-volume cancer hospitals instead of local facilities. But insurers say they\u2019d have to raise premiums for exchange plans even higher if this growing outrage over access to cancer centers forces them to broaden their networks.\n\nThe president said Friday that ObamaCare has \u201cturned the corner.\u201d Not exactly. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says he hopes the confirmation hearings for Sebelius\u2019 successor, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, \u201cwill be the start of a candid conversation about ObamaCare\u2019s shortcomings.\u201d\n\nThat could take a while.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is author of \u201cBeating ObamaCare 2014.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "On Friday the president used the long-awaited resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to again claim victory for his namesake health law. \u201cShe got it fixed, got the job", "title": "The next ObamaCare disasters", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/obama_35612033.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-4306873\"}", "sailthru.tags": "cancer,kathleen-sebelius,obamacare,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-13 19:37:00", "sailthru.title": "The next ObamaCare\u00a0disasters", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/obama_35612033.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "On Friday the president used the <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/04/11/sebelius-quits-after-obamacare-nightmare/\">long-awaited resignation</a> of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to again claim victory for his namesake health law. \u201cShe got it fixed, got the job done,\u201d Obama said.\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nSorry, there is plenty more bad news ahead.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not called SebeliusCare, and she wasn\u2019t to blame for most of its problems.
