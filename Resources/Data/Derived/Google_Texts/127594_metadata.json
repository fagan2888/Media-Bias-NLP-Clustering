With the business relying heavily on cash purchases, Banks and Holbrook worried too, about the effect the Affordable Care Act would bring to the store\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cWith that coming, that will interrupt the cash flow a great deal,\u201d Holbrook said.\n\nThe pharmacy business also has changed over the years, said Banks, who owns Banks Pharmacy in Edgefield, and Banks Drugs in Ridge Spring, S.C.\n\nChains are gobbling up \u201cMain Street\u201d pharmacies and mail-order drugs are being pushed by insurance companies, he said. Although his smaller pharmacies can out-service big companies, the Augusta store didn\u2019t have the volume to make up for the loss in revenue, Banks said.\n\nAt the downtown location, Banks said his profit margin slipped to as low as 6 percent. The combination of those factors, on top of having to pay license fees and overhead costs, put the final nail in the coffin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Wal-Mart syndrome,\u201d Banks said.\n\nThe pharmacy, which underwent three changes in ownership since it opened, made personal deliveries to customers. It carried greeting cards, snacks, $1 items, pet supplies and hard-to-find products like Father\u2019s John Medicine and 666 Cold syrup. The business employed a full-time staff of three people.\n\n\u201cIt really is the end of a local era,\u201d Holbrook said.\n\nAnother longtime Augusta pharmacy, Hill Drug Co., closed in 2012 after the business was sold to Rite-Aid pharmacy. The pharmacy, which served the Summerville community since 1932, was located on the corner of Monte Santo and Central avenues. The building now houses a Wesley Cadle Inc. lifestyle store.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Downtown's only locally owned and operated pharmacy, Maxwell House Pharmacy, closed its doors Monday after 60 years.", "title": "Downtown Augusta's Maxwell House Pharmacy closes after 60 years", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/local-business/2014-06-24/downtown-augustas-maxwell-house-pharmacy-closes", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/13477637_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "Another longtime Augusta pharmacy, Hill Drug Co., closed in 2012 after the business was sold to Rite-Aid pharmacy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only ones who completely serviced the downtown area.\u201dOne of most trying issues for the pharmacy, Holbrook said, was declining reimbursements from insurance companies.\nThe pharmacy, which served the Summerville community since 1932, was located on the corner of Monte Santo and Central avenues.\nThe Maxwell House Pharmacy had been open since the 1950s in a storefront under the Maxwell House apartments on the corner of Greene and 10th streets, but a number of financial challenges have plagued the business in recent years, according to pharmacy employees and owner Bo Banks.\n\u201cI\u2019m sad because this is the oldest independent drug store left in Augusta,\u201d said pharmacy tech and manager Becky Holbrook, who worked at the business for 13 years."}
