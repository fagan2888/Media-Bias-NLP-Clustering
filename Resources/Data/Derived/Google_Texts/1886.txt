Former first dog Miss Beazley has passed away after a battle with lymphoma, President George W. Bushannounced Saturday on Facebook. She was 9.

“[Miss Beazley] was a source of joy during our time in Washington and in Dallas,” Mr. Bush wrote.

“She was a close companion to her blood relative, Barney. And even though he received all the attention, Beazley never held a grudge against him. She was a guardian to our cats, Bob and Bernadette, who — like Laura and I — will miss her,” he said.

The Scottish terrier was given to then First Lady Laura Bush as a birthday present in 2005.

She and Barney were the stars of a 2005 White House video titled “A Very Beazley Christmas,” in which various politicians fawn over the new pooch “as Barney is pawed out of the limelight,” the New York Daily News reported.
