Americans forced out of their health care plans by the Affordable Care Act will not find out how much their new insurance will cost until after the Nov. 4 elections.\n\nEnrollment on the Healthcare.gov website doesn\u2019t begin until Nov. 15, six weeks later than its Oct. 1 kickoff last year. Critics say there\u2019s a simple reason for the delay.\n\n\u201cThis is more than just a glitch,\u201d Tim Phillips, president of free-market Americans for Prosperity, said in a Friday statement. \u201cThe administration\u2019s decision to withhold the costs of this law until after Election Day is just more proof that Obamacare is a bad deal for Americans.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Petitions urge Obama to disclose immigration policy, premium hikes before election\n\nMillions of Americans have lost their insurance plans under new guidelines in Obamacare \u2014 which require everyone to be covered for a slew of conditions that they will never need (I now have coverage in case I suddenly get pregnant \u2014 comforting, but expensive).\n\nMillions more have seen their rates double, triple, even quadruple \u2014 insurance companies say the new stringent guidelines have outlawed many existing health care plans.\n\nMeanwhile, people across the country are receiving cancellation notices from their health care providers. A wave of such notices went out last week in Colorado, a state with a tight Senate race. More than 22,000 Coloradans received cancellation notices in the last month \u2014 and nearly 193,000 more will lose their policies at the end of 2015, The Washington Times reported last week.\n\nIn all, more than a half-million people in the state have lost their insurance. And the scene is being replayed in states across the country. Hence Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to hold off on just how much the Obamacare premiums are going to rise.\n\nThen there\u2019s immigration reform, which Mr. Obama has pushed hard for years, pledging to act without Congress. That won\u2019t happen until at least the winter session of Congress, if at all (and be extra wary if the Democrats lose the Senate on Nov. 4). Mr. Obama has all but ignored the issue in his campaign stump speeches, aware that fears of a blanket \u201camnesty\u201d for the 12 million to 15 million illegal aliens in the U.S. will turn off voters.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if Republicans take over the Senate as expected, any \u201creform\u201d could be permanently tabled. The highly partisan president has created a toxic atmosphere on Capitol Hill, and finding Republicans to support his overhaul will prove difficult, even impossible. Plus, not too many Democrats want to be near the radioactive president right now, with his sub-40 approval rating.\n\nIn another delay-and-deflect move, Mr. Obama last week announced he would not pick a new attorney general until after the elections.\n\nCurrent Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., a lightning rod for many Republicans \u2014 including a majority in the House, which held him in contempt of Congress last year \u2014 has announced he is stepping down. Several names have circulated as replacements have prompted anger from Republicans, setting up a contentious battle to win confirmation for any nominee.\n\nAnd Mr. Obama still has made no decision on the Keystone oil pipeline, which would create more than 100,000 jobs by some estimates and drive down prices at the gas pump. The pipeline would help wean America off foreign oil but Democrats would be furious if Mr. Obama approved it.\n\nBut Mr. Obama couldn\u2019t care less what\u2019s best for America. If he did, he would have closed the borders before Ebola came to our shores. And he certainly doesn\u2019t care whether Americans think he\u2019s being straight with them.\n\nFor the president, the only path to victory on Nov. 4 is to not tell the country what he plans to do if he wins. And maybe it\u2019s just me, but that looks like a real loser.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
