She probably can cope with the strains of legislative life.\n\nToday, her task is to persuade Oregonians to act on the cogent exhortation of her campaign\u2019s bumper stickers: \u201cKeep Your Doctor. Change Your Senator.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s trying to take a Senate seat away from freshman Democrat Jeff Merkley, who was elected in 2008 with 49 percent of the vote when Barack Obama carried the state with 57 percent.\n\nThis year, Merkley\u2019s task is to run far ahead of Obama\u2019s 43 percent job-approval among Oregonians, with 54 percent of independents disapproving of the president.\n\nOregon is one of the 18 states that have supported Democratic nominees in at least six consecutive presidential elections. About half the state\u2019s voters live in the Portland metropolitan area, which has become emblematic of urban progressivism.\n\nBut from 1969 to \u201995, both Oregon senators were Republicans, and Wehby\u2019s pollster says Merkley\u2019s two-point lead (41-39) derives from the incumbent\u2019s perishable advantage in name recognition. She\u2019s up one point among voters who say they \u201cknow\u201d both candidates.\n\nWehby not only has two X chromosomes but supports abortion rights and the right of states to recognize same-sex marriages, which complicates the Democratic Party\u2019s continuing accusation that Republicans wage \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nStill, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kimberley Strassel noted in a May 22 column that Democrats were complicit in attempts to portray Wehby as having had an unstable romantic life.\n\nNever mind the selective prurience of some members of Bill Clinton\u2019s party.\n\nNote, however, Strassel\u2019s information: Of the two men with whom Wehby is said to have had tumultuous relationships, one, a former boyfriend, says he regrets his \u201cemotional\u201d behavior. The other, her ex-husband, lives four doors from her, calls her a friend and has contributed to her campaign.\n\nAnother Democratic theme is that all Republicans are extremists. Wehby, however, won 50 percent of the vote in a five-candidate primary in which her rivals accused her of moderation.\n\nOregonians interested in real extremism should note that Merkley is co-sponsoring a constitutional amendment that would do something unprecedented \u2014 alter the Bill of Rights to reduce its protections. It would eviscerate the First Amendment by empowering Congress to regulate the quantity and content of political campaign speech, including speech about Congress.\n\nThe federal government owns 32.7 million \u2014 53 percent \u2014 of Oregon\u2019s acres, some of which are inhabited by sage grouses. These birds the size of chickens might be big enough to matter in November.\n\nThe federal government, resourceful at devising ways to burden economic activity, might declare the bird an endangered species.\n\nThis could have large economic consequences, so Merkley, caught between liberal environmentalists and timber and other agricultural interests, supports a measure that is pluperfect liberalism: Let\u2019s spend $15 million to study how birds and bipeds can coexist.\n\nOregon had the worst of all the unpleasant experiences that states had with the ObamaCare rollout. The FBI is investigating how the state managed to spend $250 million on an online insurance exchange that failed.\n\nWhich is just one reason health care matters here. Oregon\u2019s largest employer is not Nike, which is only sixth. The three largest employers, and 13 of the top 25, are health-care providers.\n\nBut, then, in the archetypal Rust Belt manufacturing city of Cleveland, the largest employer is the Cleveland Clinic and the second-largest is another health-care provider.\n\nHouston is America\u2019s energy capital, but four of its five largest employers are in the health-care field.\n\nGiven the enormous and growing role of medicine in this aging nation\u2019s economy, it is unfortunate that only three senators are physicians \u2014 John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), an orthopedic surgeon, Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), an obstetrician, and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), an ophthalmologist.
