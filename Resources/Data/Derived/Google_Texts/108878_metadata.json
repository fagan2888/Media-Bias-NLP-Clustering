The information details whether the sponsor -- the principal beneficiary -- and his or her dependents had minimum essential coverage during the previous year. Beneficiaries use the information when filling out federal tax forms.\n\nUnder the new law, U.S. citizens must have health coverage that meets a minimum standard -- called minimum essential coverage -- by Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nPeople who receive Tricare benefits, whether by electing to pay an enrollment fee or by paying monthly premiums, meet the minimum essential coverage requirement. This includes users of Tricare Prime, Prime Remote and Standard, and the premium-based plans -- Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Retired Reserve, and the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.\n\nBut eligibility alone for the premium-based plans does not constitute minimum essential coverage, the DoD said. For that, eligible beneficiaries need to actually purchase a plan and be in good standing by paying the premiums.", "article_metadata": {"dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Katy OHara", "keywords": "TRICARE,Bryant Jordan", "dc.description": "Pentagon officials say the only difference that most Tricare beneficiaries will see with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is an additional piece of mail every January and an extra box to check off on their tax forms each April.\r\nThat\u2019s because Tricare, for most people using it, alrea...", "dc.identifier": "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/10/14/dod-tricare-beneficiaries-unaffected-by-obamacare.html", "dc.contributor": "Katy OHara", "viewport": "width=980", "dc.datesubmitted": "2013-10-14T10:58:02Z", "dc.date.created": "2013-10-14T10:58:02Z", "dc.subject": "TRICARE,Bryant Jordan", "description": "Pentagon officials say the only difference that most Tricare beneficiaries will see with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is an additional piece of mail every January and an extra box to check off on their tax forms each April.\r\nThat\u2019s because Tricare, for most people using it, alrea...", "dc.source": "Military.com", "msvalidate.01": "025B9B5D734615E165952EE006CF8C36", "article": {"tag": "Bryant Jordan"}, "dc.date.modified": "2013-10-14T10:58:02Z", "dc.language": "en", "dc.title": "DoD: Tricare Beneficiaries Unaffected by Obamacare", "ma": {"source": "orig", "image": "http://images.military.com/media/shared/icons/default-military-m-logo.png", "contenttype": "maNews", "id": 1199444765196, "name": "DoD Tricare Beneficiaries Unaffected by Obamacare"}, "og": {"site_name": "Military.com", "description": "Pentagon officials say the only difference that most Tricare beneficiaries will see with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is an additional piece of mail every January and an extra box to check off on their tax forms each April.\r\nThat\u2019s because Tricare, for most people using it, alrea...", "title": "DoD: Tricare Beneficiaries Unaffected by Obamacare", "url": "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/10/14/dod-tricare-beneficiaries-unaffected-by-obamacare.html", "image": "http://images.military.com/media/shared/icons/default-military-m-logo.png", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text", "p": {"domain_verify": "d63ea8dea5c5b3636abbfd1d1f15fd56"}, "dc.creator": "Katy OHara"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1003\"", "article_summary": "But eligibility alone for the premium-based plans does not constitute minimum essential coverage, the DoD said.\n\u201cSimply speaking, the Affordable Care Act will have very little impact on Tricare beneficiaries,\u201d the Defense Department said in a statement.\nUnder the new law, U.S. citizens must have health coverage that meets a minimum standard -- called minimum essential coverage -- by Jan. 1, 2014.\nThis includes users of Tricare Prime, Prime Remote and Standard, and the premium-based plans -- Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Retired Reserve, and the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.\nJust two groups of Tricare beneficiaries do not meet the minimum essential coverage requirement, said DoD -- those receiving care for line-of-duty-only conditions, and those eligible only to receive care in military hospitals or clinics."}
