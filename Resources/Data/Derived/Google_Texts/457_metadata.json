These itty-bitty bots make up a colony of 1,024 self-organizing machines. Their purpose is to study collective behavior in nature \u2014 like a colony of ants \u2014 and serve as a precursor to transforming robots. Nature via Huffington Post explains:\n\n\u201cThe puck-shaped robots, called Kilobots, cost roughly US$20 each and are programmed with a simple set of rules and an image of the shape to be formed. To begin with, the robots are arranged in a tightly packed, arbitrary shape on a flat surface. Then four \u2018seed robots\u2019 are placed in a cluster next to the swarm, and the robots on the far side of the pack begin to inch around the edge of the formation towards the seeds, propelled by motors that make them vibrate like ringing mobile phones.\n\nThe robots communicate using infrared light, but they are only able to transmit and receive information with the robots nearest to them \u2014 so they cannot \u2018see\u2019 the whole collective. However, the seed robots act as the point of origin for a coordinate system; information on their position propagates outward through the swarm like fire signals across the peaks of a mountain range. This allows each bot to determine where it is and whether it is inside the shape programmed by researchers. Over a period of about 12 hours, the programmed configuration \u2014 such as the letter \u2018K\u2019 or a star \u2014 takes form, robot by robot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch thousands of little robots swarm to create programmed shapes VIDEO", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Watch thousands of little robots swarm to create programmed shapes VIDEO", "title": "Real-life Transformers: Harvard scientist created a swarm of shape-shifting coin-size robots", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/the_precursor_to_transformers_harvard_scientist_created_a_swarm_of_shape_shifting_coin_sized_robots/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-18-at-11.49.08-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watch thousands of little robots swarm to create programmed shapes VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-18-at-11.49.08-AM.png", "title": "Real-life Transformers: Harvard scientist created a swarm of shape-shifting coin-size robots", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Real-life Transformers: Harvard scientist created a swarm of shape-shifting coin-size robots", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Harvard, innovation, Robot, technology, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93ae\"", "article_summary": "Computer scientists at Harvard University, led by Michael Rubinstein, created the largest swarm of tiny shape-shifting robots.\nThis allows each bot to determine where it is and whether it is inside the shape programmed by researchers.\nTheir purpose is to study collective behavior in nature \u2014 like a colony of ants \u2014 and serve as a precursor to transforming robots.\nOver a period of about 12 hours, the programmed configuration \u2014 such as the letter \u2018K\u2019 or a star \u2014 takes form, robot by robot.\u201d\nHowever, the seed robots act as the point of origin for a coordinate system; information on their position propagates outward through the swarm like fire signals across the peaks of a mountain range."}
