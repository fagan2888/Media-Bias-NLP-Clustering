The songs on his debut album tended to search his soul.\n\nBut on \"Wild Ones,\" Moore occasionally explores gray areas. The song \"I'm to Blame\" features a guy who regularly makes bad choices \u2014 an alternative to the confident chest-beating so common in contemporary country music. The mid-tempo \"Comeback Kid\" is as subtly dramatic as a good Bruce Springsteen ballad, and \"That's All Right With Me\" advances a loopy, laid-back vibe reminiscent of Joe Walsh's stoner anthems.\n\nToo often, though, Moore retreads cliched themes. He links drinking and staying up late with being wild and reduces love songs to creepy sexual come-ons. \"Come and Get It\" and \"What You Got on Tonight\" both deliver the title lines over the phone to a lover \u2014 sentiments that were creepy even before Internet chatrooms.\n\nMusically, the album consistently serves up clever roots-rock riffs and rhythms that separate Moore from the rock-meets-rap focus of his Nashville peers. If more of the lyrics matched the best efforts here, \"Wild Ones\" would be a triumph. Instead, it's an album ripe for cherry-picked downloads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Music Review: Kip Moore explores gray areas on 'Wild Ones' - AP News: Kip Moore, \"Wild Ones\" (MCA Nashville)Of all the backward-ball cap-wearing .05/26/2016 4:34:25AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Kip Moore, \"Wild Ones\" (MCA Nashville)Of all the backward-ball cap-wearing male country singers, Kip Moore", "title": "AP News - Music Review: Kip Moore explores gray areas on 'Wild Ones'", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/08/18/music-review-kip-moore-explores-gray-areas-on-wild-ones-n2040684", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\230\\266023a2-11f6-4bac-99e4-8a5c9103b73c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Kip Moore, \"Wild Ones\" (MCA Nashville)Of all the backward-ball cap-wearing male country singers, Kip Moore", "title": "AP News - Music Review: Kip Moore explores gray areas on 'Wild Ones'", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/08/18/music-review-kip-moore-explores-gray-areas-on-wild-ones-n2040684", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/230/266023a2-11f6-4bac-99e4-8a5c9103b73c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Music Review: Kip Moore explores gray areas on 'Wild Ones', AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccad3\"", "article_summary": "Kip Moore, \"Wild Ones\" (MCA Nashville)Of all the backward-ball cap-wearing male country singers, Kip Moore takes the dirt road less traveled.\nBut on \"Wild Ones,\" Moore occasionally explores gray areas.\nIf more of the lyrics matched the best efforts here, \"Wild Ones\" would be a triumph.\nHe links drinking and staying up late with being wild and reduces love songs to creepy sexual come-ons.\nMusically, the album consistently serves up clever roots-rock riffs and rhythms that separate Moore from the rock-meets-rap focus of his Nashville peers."}
