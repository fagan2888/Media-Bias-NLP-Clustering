It\u2019s based on a false premise.\u201d\n\nHost Joe Scarborough then read Brock a 2009 federal regulation that requires all federal employees to preserve emails \u201cin the appropriate recordkeeping system.\u201d This is something Clinton did not do until recently, at least until two years after leaving the State Department. Brock appeared to argue that in doing so she did in fact comply. Of course, Brock has no way of knowing that. Because she skirted the law for 6 years, and apparently used her own email server, there is no way to know if she turned over every email.\n\nThis appears to violate both the letter and spirit of the law that requires \u201ca system not operated by the agency MUST ensure that \u201cemails outside of the federal system are preserved.\u201d [emphasis mine]\n\nUnbound by facts, Brock added this to his bizarre defense, \u201cThe State Department said yesterday that the emails were regularly preserved.\u201d Brock is arguing here that the emails were preserved by \u2026 Ms. Clinton.\n\nWhen reminded that the law requires that the emails be \u201cpreserved in the appropriate agency\u201d and not by the individual\u2019s home-brewed server, Brock didn\u2019t appear to grasp what that meant. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that didn\u2019t happen, Joe,\u201d Brock replied. \u201cThe New York Times doesn\u2019t establish that at all. In fact, the 2009 law you\u2019re referring to isn\u2019t even cited in the New York Times.\u201d\n\nIf I\u2019m interpreting Brock correctly, he is again demanding a New York Times retraction \u2014 not because there isn\u2019t a law that Ms. Clinton appears to have broke \u2014 but because the Times didn\u2019t publish the law Ms. Clinton appears to have broke.\n\nThis is a ploy Media Matters regularly uses to kill stories and narratives the pro-Hillary, left-wing blog wants killed. They find a little something to dig away at and usually a mainstream media eager for an escape hatch is grateful to grab hold of it. The narrative in question dies, the Democrat is saved from political damage, and the media can return to demanding Republicans declare Obama a Jesus-loving patriot.\n\nBrock may still find the media a way out of this. This stupid argument is probably not going to be it, though. He\u2019s obviously been spoiled by a media that usually does his bidding. Moreover, Brock is obviously a terrible spokesman for Ms. Clinton. His dazed and oftentimes incoherent answers did her more damage than good.\n\nCo-host Mika Brzezinski summed things up with, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what planet I\u2019m on right now.
