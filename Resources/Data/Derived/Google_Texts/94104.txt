It isn’t the government shutdown or even Obamacare that will results in the end of America as we know it. It’s Miley Cyrus.

In the cold open of this week’s Saturday Night Live, it’s 2045 and two survivors — Kenan Thompson and SNL newcomer Noel Wells — are reflecting on the day America ended: the 2013 Video Music Awards. Specifically, the controversial performance by this week’s SNL host, Cyrus herself.

Before her VMA gig, Cyrus was visited by the ghost of her former self, played by Vanessa Bayer, who warned her that the performance was too controversial. One of Cyrus’ teddy bear backup dancers, played by Bobby Moynihan, seems a bit disturbed by their rehearsals.

“We shouldn’t be doing this!” Moynihan cries. “This is for kids!”

Even Will Smith — played by Jay Pharoah — drops by to tell Cyrus to keep it G-rated, a reference to the apparent shocked faces the Smith family made during Cyrus’ actual act at the VMAs.

But Cyrus didn’t heed the advice of her former self and thus America was destroyed.
