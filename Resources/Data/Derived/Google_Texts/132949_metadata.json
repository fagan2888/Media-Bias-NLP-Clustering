In that theory, fluoridated water damages the human pineal gland, promoting docility.\n\nMore credibly, researchers from Harvard University in 2012 reviewed studies on the effects of water fluoridation on children, finding those who lived in areas with heavily fluoridated water \"had significantly lower IQs than those who lived in low-fluoride areas.\" Those investigators concluded that fluoride is an additive \u201cwith substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity.\u201d\n\nYet a new study from researchers at the University of Otago in New Zealand, with funding from neither the U.S. government nor the Nazis, casts aspersions on the theory. Analyzing data from 1,000 New Zealanders born in Dunedin during 1972 and 1973, study author Jonathan Broadbent compared suburban residents who were exposed to fluoride with those who were not, also accounting for the chemical additive in toothpaste and tablets.\n\nSince the early 20th century, the U.S. and many other countries began adding the chemical routinely to water supplies, as a way of lowering tooth decay in the promotion of greater dental health.\n\n\"Our analysis showed no significant differences in IQ by fluoride exposure, even before controlling for the other factors that might influence scores,\u201d Broadbent told Medical News Today. \u201cIn line with other studies, we found breastfeeding was associated with higher child IQ, and this was regardless of whether children grew up in fluoridated or non-fluoridated areas.\"\n\nThe long-term study on which Broadbent based his conclusions compared IQ scores for 992 study participants, ages 7 to 13, who were again tested at age 38 for verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. The researchers also accounted for factors known to influence IQ in childhood, such as socioeconomic status, birth weight, breastfeeding, and educational achievement.\n\n\u201cOur findings will hopefully help to put another nail in the coffin of the complete canard that fluoridating water is somehow harmful to children\u2019s development,\u201d Broadbent told Medical News Today. \u201cIn reality, the total opposite is true.. as it helps reduce the tooth decay highlighting the childhood of too many New Zealanders.\u201d\n\nIn explaining the stark difference between his study and Harvard\u2019s, Broadbent had some trash talk for his American counterparts: \u201cIt\u2019s a meta-analysis based on poor-quality research.\u201d\n\nThe study was published this month in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nSource: Broadbent, Jonathan.
