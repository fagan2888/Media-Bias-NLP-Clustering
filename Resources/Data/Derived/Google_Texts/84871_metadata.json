The group includes chief of staff Cheryl Mills; her deputy chief Jake Sullivan; Heather Samuelson, also on Mills\u2019s staff; and Philippe Reines, who served as Clinton\u2019s spokesman at State.\n\nAs Politico notes: The united front suggests they plan to tell investigators the same story \u2014 although legal experts say the joint strategy presents its own risks, should the interests of the four aides begin to diverge as the probe moves ahead. (snip) Hiring the same attorney allows Clinton\u2019s advisers to have one gatekeeper for most of the DOJ's inquiries \u2014 and it likely indicates that they expect to offer substantially similar testimony if they're questioned. Lawyers are barred from simultaneously representing people who may have conflicting interests in an investigation, or who would say something negative or potentially legally harmful about the lawyer\u2019s other clients, experts say, although some such conflicts can be waived by the clients. Thus, the aides' decision to use a so-called \u201cjoint-representation\u201d or \u201ccommon-defense\u201d strategy suggests the staffers believe they\u2019re in this together and are unlikely to turn on each other. On the other hand, if one of the aides ends up in criminal jeopardy as part of the probe, choosing a \u201ccommon-defense\u201d strategy could mean trouble for that staffer, who may need to say something adverse about his or her attorney\u2019s other clients. \u201cThe premise of employing the same counsel is that they believe there is not likely to be a situation where they start pointing a finger at one another to save their own skins \u2014 or perhaps at Secretary Clinton,\u201d said Dan Metcalfe, founding director of the DOJ's office of information and privacy. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a sense that if one of them goes down, they all go down. It shows they think they can coordinate the defense to everyone\u2019s benefit.\u201d Metcalfe, now a law professor at American University, called it an \u201coptimistic approach\u201d: \u201cThey must believe prosecutors don\u2019t have that much.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear when the agreement for joint counsel was made. Senator Grassley quizzed Wilkinson late last year about who is paying her for serving as counsel and was rebuffed on the ground of client confidentiality. It is clear, however, that Hillary Clinton would be the outside party positioned to benefit from a unified set of answers among her aides, and also in a position to pony up the large sums a lawyer like Wilkinson would charge. But if and when any differences in responses appear in testimony, the aides will face heightened peril, as their common attorney will face a conflict of interest in whom to protect.\n\nIt was necessary for the Department of Justice to grant exemption from conflict-of-interest rules for this arrangement to be legal. That seems to indicate that the DoJ is not neutral in the case, something Joe DiGenova sees clearly:\n\nDiGenova questioned why the DOJ would greenlight the arrangement in the first place, arguing that it \u201cpresents an amazing conflict of interest\u201d and allows for coordination of stories. \u201cIf it\u2019s a serious case, you don\u2019t run the risk of having all sorts of collusion between people \u2014 it\u2019s just not done,\u201d said diGenova. \u201cIf the department has accepted that, that tells me they\u2019re walking down the line of not bringing a case, because they\u2019re not serious if they have accepted that arrangement \u2026 They\u2019ve thrown in the towel.\u201d The DOJ declined to comment.\n\nIf all goes as Hillary plans, this arrangement will surely benefit her. But if the FBI has information that the four people do not anticipate and they give conflicting answers, then the arrangement could blow up on her.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/04/four_hillary_aides_hire_joint_defense_counsel.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Four Hillary aides hire joint defense counsel"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Senator Grassley quizzed Wilkinson late last year about who is paying her for serving as counsel and was rebuffed on the ground of client confidentiality.\nIt was necessary for the Department of Justice to grant exemption from conflict-of-interest rules for this arrangement to be legal.\nIf all goes as Hillary plans, this arrangement will surely benefit her.\nThus, the aides' decision to use a so-called \u201cjoint-representation\u201d or \u201ccommon-defense\u201d strategy suggests the staffers believe they\u2019re in this together and are unlikely to turn on each other.\nBut if the FBI has information that the four people do not anticipate and they give conflicting answers, then the arrangement could blow up on her."}
