Commerce City police have arrested a man for investigation of attempted murder after numerous gunshots were sprayed into a home occupied by many people and struck a 19-year-old woman early Saturday.

“One victim is in surgery at Denver Health with a gunshot wound to the chest,” said Deputy Chief Lowell Richardson. “Somebody had shot several times into the home.”

Richardson was not yet releasing the name of the man arrested.

The name of the victim was not being released pending notification of family. Richardson said he did not know the current condition of the woman.

Gunshots were fired into a small home in the 6100 block of East 60th Avenue at 5:55 a.m.

It’s not clear whether the suspect targeted the woman or fired randomly into the home.

“At this stage, we’re investigating all possibilities,” Richardson said. “We don’t know if gangs were involved. I don’t know what the motive was for the shooting. We’re processing the scene right now.”

Several ambulances were called to the home as police searched for any other injured people.

Denver police and Adams County sheriff’s deputies were also called to help in tracking down suspects.
