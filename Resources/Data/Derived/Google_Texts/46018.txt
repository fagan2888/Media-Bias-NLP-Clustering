China's Imports Soar

The Associated Press China's imports have doubled since 2007 and more than tripled since 2004, growing at a rate that is at least twice as fast as imports worldwide each year, according to the United Nations' Comtrade Database. With its robust workforce and diverse geography, just about anything can be made in China. But the global economic powerhouse has made strategic decisions to bring a large amount in from abroad. So, what do you ask for when you have it all? Here are the top five countries that China imported from in 2014 and the goods they offer.

5. Australia

At $54.3 billion, iron ore and its concentrate from Australia are China’s most expensive import from a single country. The trade of iron ore is currently tariff-free between the two nations, an agreement that would be formalized with the enactment of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, signed by China’s commerce minister and Australia’s minister for trade and investment in June and awaiting approval by the nations’ leaders. Other top imports from the resource-rich Land Down Under, including coal ($9.0 billion), copper ($3.2 billion) and wool ($1.5 billion), would also become tariff-free under the agreement. Accounting for about one-third of its total exports, China is Australia’s largest trade partner.

4. Germany

German cars are the favorite foreign automobile in China, making up 31 percent of imported cars and parts -- $27.4 billion -- overall in 2014. Only the United States and the United Kingdom import more cars than China. Since 2013, overall imports from Germany have more than doubled, driven largely by increased imports of cars -- four times more than in 2007 -- aircraft, spacecraft and vaccines.

3. United States

Two-thirds of the world’s soybean imports go to China, $16.3 billion -- or 30 million tons -- of which come from the United States. China’s demand for the legumes has increased significantly in recent years, largely to create a protein-rich feed for their growing livestock industry. While much is grown on home soil, China has looked beyond its borders to increase the supply. Other large-ticket items that contribute to the two nations’ bilateral trade of $536 billion include imports of aircraft, spacecraft and recycled paper to China. The United States is China’s largest export market.

2. Japan

China imported more from Japan than any other country until 2013, after a dispute over islands in the East China Sea in 2012 soured relationships. China’s exports to Japan have since resumed normal levels, but their imports from the island nation are still building momentum. In 2014, China’s top imports from Japan were microchips ($12.3 billion), cars ($8.6 billion) and car parts ($7.2 billion). Smaller manufactured goods that China imports from Japan include diapers, buttons and pens.
