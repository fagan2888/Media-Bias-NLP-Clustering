Alas, this badge of shame has done little to deter politicians and their acolytes from stretching the truth now and again. So some states have decided to take matters into their own hands. In Ohio, for example, anyone making a false statement about a candidate during a campaign risks jail time and a $5,000 fine. But does this violate the First Amendment rights of all citizens, including the deceitful?\n\nIn a Supreme Court ruling on Susan B Anthony List v Driehaus on June 16th, the justices unanimously furrowed their brows at Ohio\u2019s ban without resolving whether it violates anyone's freedom of speech. The constitutional challenge to the state\u2019s law came from two advocacy groups, and the justices gave them permission to press on. Lower-court rulings had found that the groups lacked standing to sue, since they did not face any imminent injury under the law. The Supreme Court, however, held that the \u201cthreat\u201d of criminal prosecution for dubious campaign literature \u201csuffices to create an...injury under the circumstances of this case.\u201d\n\nThe dispute arose in 2010 when an Ohio congressman rankled at this billboard: \u201cShame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus voted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d The message was courtesy of Susan B Anthony List (SBA), a pro-life advocacy group, and the allegation involved Mr Driehaus\u2019s support for the Affordable Care Act (ie, Obamacare). Mr Driehaus, a Democrat who opposes abortion, says the billboard was a lie: under Obamacare, insurers may not pay for abortions with federal funds. (SBA dismisses this rule as an accounting gimmick, noting that Obamacare subsidises insurance that may then be used to pay for abortions.)\n\nMr Driehaus complained to the Ohio Elections Commission that SBA was misrepresenting his views and his voting record. The commission initially found in favour of Mr Driehaus but halted its hearing after SBA raised the constitutional objection. Mr Driehaus lost the election and withdrew his complaint, but the SBA and a gaggle of pro-free-speech groups continued to fight the law.\n\nIt is rare for Justice Clarence Thomas to pen a free-speech decision, as he did here. It is rarer still for the Court to reach unanimity on a first-amendment controversy that touches on abortion. Justices left and right coalesced around the worry that attempts to clean up political discourse will do more harm than good, stifling opinionated speech for fear of legal sanction. False-statement laws also give campaigners a tool to harass their adversaries: \u201cBecause the universe of potential complainants is not restricted to state officials who are constrained by explicit guidelines or ethical obligations,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote, \u201cthere is a real risk of complaints from, for example, political opponents.\u201d\n\nThe justices were more divided this week in Abramski v United States, a gun-control case. Bruce Abramski, a former police officer, bought a Glock 19 handgun for his uncle, Angel Alvarez. But when filling out a form asking whether he was the \u201cactual buyer\u201d of the gun, Mr Abramski said yes. This despite a clarification, in bold print, \u201cwarning\u201d against any misinterpretation of that term: \u201cYou are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person.\u201d Though Mr Abramski never intended to own the gun, he confirmed that he was its \u201cactual buyer\u201d and that his answers were \u201ctrue, correct and complete.\u201d\n\nThese lies caught up with Mr Abramski when federal agents searched his home for an unrelated crime and found a receipt his uncle gave him for the $400 gun. In his defence, Mr Abramski argued that he was not trying to procure a gun for a criminal; his uncle was legally eligible to buy one. This excuse fell on deaf ears. The district court gave Mr Abramski five years\u2019 probation, and the appeals court for the fourth circuit upheld the sentence. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court\u2019s liberal wing plus Justice Anthony Kennedy, agreed with the lower courts. Allowing a surrogate or \u201cstraw\u201d gun buyer to purchase weapons for other people, she wrote, \u201cwould virtually repeal...the gun law\u2019s core provision\u201d of checking the backgrounds of people buying guns.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote a testy dissent. \u201c[I]f I give my son $10 and tell him to pick up milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say that the store \u2018sells\u2019 the milk and eggs to me.\u201d Justice Kagan, an English speaker, issued this footnote retort: \u201cIf I send my brother to the Apple Store with money and instructions to purchase an iPhone, and then take immediate and sole possession of that device, am I the \u2018person\u2019...who has bought the phone or is he? Nothing in ordinary English usage compels an answer either way.\u201d She adds that while the language is not without \u201csome ambiguity\u201d, the gun law is fairly clear on the meaning of \u201cactual buyer\u201d: \u201cthe man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm.\u201d Only such a reading, she concluded, allows the gun laws to \u201caccomplish their manifest objects.\u201d\n\nDig deeper:\n\nIs it wise to criminalise lies?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/guns.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "The Supreme Court", "description": "The justices rein in handgun sales and frown on a truth test for political adverts", "pubdate": 20140618, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "The justices rein in handgun sales and frown on a truth test for political adverts", "title": "Guns and lies", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/06/supreme-court", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/guns.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "The justices rein in handgun sales and frown on a truth test for political adverts", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-18 05:12:38", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/guns.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/guns.jpg", "articleid": 21604486, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/guns.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "The Supreme Court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2014/06/blogs/democracy-america/guns.jpg", "news_keywords": "The Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4a8\"", "article_summary": "The district court gave Mr Abramski five years\u2019 probation, and the appeals court for the fourth circuit upheld the sentence.\nBut when filling out a form asking whether he was the \u201cactual buyer\u201d of the gun, Mr Abramski said yes.\nAllowing a surrogate or \u201cstraw\u201d gun buyer to purchase weapons for other people, she wrote, \u201cwould virtually repeal...the gun law\u2019s core provision\u201d of checking the backgrounds of people buying guns.\nMr Driehaus, a Democrat who opposes abortion, says the billboard was a lie: under Obamacare, insurers may not pay for abortions with federal funds.\nThe commission initially found in favour of Mr Driehaus but halted its hearing after SBA raised the constitutional objection."}
