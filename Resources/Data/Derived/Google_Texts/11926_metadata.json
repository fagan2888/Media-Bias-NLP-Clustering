Gov. Anthony Brown\u2019s unequivocal acquiescence.\n\nRepublican candidate Larry Hogan may benefit from this scenario and Brown will not be able to hide from the tax and spend initiatives he supported as O\u2019Malley\u2019s No. 2 man.\n\nAs Hogan mentioned in the first debate, O\u2019Malley has approved forty tax increases since taking office in 2007. The most controversial of these is the Storm Water Management Fee; more commonly known as the \u201crain tax.\u201d Additional burdens have been applied to gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol.\n\nThese policies have had a devastating effect on the state\u2019s middle class, and as a result over thirty-thousand Marylanders decided to seek refuge in other parts of the country.\n\nMany employers have also left the state during O\u2019Malley\u2019s tenure in office. Among these include an estimated 8,000 small businesses.\n\nThe Maryland Public Policy Institute claims that Maryland has lost $330 million in taxes in the last decade and that \u201cAccording to the Maryland Comptroller\u2019s Office, the number of taxpayers in this category (those older than 65 with a taxable income of $500,000 or more) declined steadily between 2007 and 2010- from 2,161 to 1,543.\u201d\n\nBrown defended these tax increases by claiming that they were necessary to combat rising costs in college tuition and to improve miscellaneous infrastructure problems.\n\nBut taxes aside, it is uncertain whether the Lieutenant Governor has sufficient experience to serve as an effective manager.\n\nBrown failed to adequately perform the major task that was assigned to him in his current position: implementing Maryland\u2019s health care exchange program via the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNot only was the exchange\u2019s website riddled with errors (which delayed many people from signing up for alternative healthcare plans) but will cost taxpayers an estimated $43 million to repair.\n\nBrown is still facing heavy criticism for his failure to exercise decisive leadership in carrying out that task, and Hogan rightfully decided to zero in on this vulnerability during their second debate on Monday evening.\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor also wants to initiate a program that would provide children ages four and older with a free pre-school education. However, he has not come up with a credible plan as to how it would be funded.\n\nBrown has repeatedly stated that he would not raise taxes as governor, but such claims are dubious considering his close ideological proximity to O\u2019Malley.\n\nIt is for these reasons as well as others that the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s popularity is steadily declining.\n\nA Baltimore Sun poll taken earlier this month illustrated that Brown\u2019s once gigantic lead over Hogan had shrunk to a mere seven points (49 percent to 42 percent). That same poll also revealed that many Democrats are indifferent to the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s candidacy.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether Hogan can gain enough support to defeat an unapologetic liberal in a state where registered Democrats encompass sixty-percent of the electorate.\n\nBut the answer to Reagan\u2019s question is simple enough for any honest observer to recognize.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Marylanders head to the polls, the election will likely be a referendum on Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s term, with Lt.
