Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan has joined the long list of Republicans who say President Obama’s selective enforcement of federal laws makes it difficult for Republicans to negotiate a high-stakes immigration deal.

“The challenge with all of this is we have a hard time trusting this president in enforcing the laws,” he told a friendly audience of business executives gathered by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in San Antonio, Texas.

“Look what he’s doing on health care and all these extra-legal things he’s doing with executive orders and executive actions that we don’t believe he has the authority to do,” Ryan said.

But Ryan insisted the GOP leadership should be trusted to negotiate a deal that will work.

“We have to find a way to write these laws so that they are actually enforced. … I won’t get into all the details on how to do that, but we have strong opinions on how to do that,” he said.

Ryan’s criticism of the administration echoes recent statements from numerous other GOP leaders and legislators who say the president has made a habit of overstepping his legal authority.

“The president’s not allowed to write legislation, he’s not allowed to amend legislation, he’s not allowed to initiate war, and he’s not allowed to tell us when we’re in recess and when we’re not,” Sen. Rand Paul told CNN’s Candy Crowley Jan. 26.

The Senate’s GOP leadership voiced the same concern in their weekly address, delivered by Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt. “The administration has decided which parts of the [Obamacare] law to follow, and which parts to delay,” he said.
