But federal prosecutors renewed their attempt to compel his testimony at trial. Earlier this year, Risen asked the Supreme Court to establish a federal reporter\u2019s privilege, but the court declined to hear his case.\n\n\n\n[READ: Risen Doubts New Book Will Provoke Leak Probe]\n\nHolder appeared to buckle in May, telling reporters, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m attorney general, no reporter who is doing his job is going to go to jail.\u201d Risen, however, wasn\u2019t impressed and said he didn't know what would happen. Holder is leaving office when the Senate confirms his successor.\n\nAmid months of uncertainty, more than a dozen fellow Pulitzer Prize winners and a coalition of advocacy groups demanded the government drop its insistence on Risen\u2019s testimony. Activists delivered a petition with more than 125,000 signatures to the Justice Department in August.\n\nThe Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment on Risen\u2019s case.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Collections: Political", "title": "Holder OK's Subpoena for James Risen Testimony at Leak Trial", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A court filing implies the reporter won't be asked to identify his source.", "title": "Holder OK's Subpoena for Risen Testimony&nbsp;", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/16/holder-oks-subpoena-for-james-risen-testimony-at-leak-trial", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3e/53/6ddd1cbc4fe0978e9a0263a8ced4/141216-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "<div>A court filing implies the reporter won't be asked to identify his source.</div>", "card": "summary", "title": "Holder OK's Subpoena for James Risen Testimony at Leak Trial"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Steven Nelson,Pulse,picks,CIA,Holder, Eric,leaks,New York Times,Collections: Political", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A court filing implies the reporter won't be asked to identify his source."}, "article_summary": "Attorney General Eric Holder has authorized a subpoena that would require author and New York Times reporter James Risen to testify at the trial of Jeffrey Sterling.\nA grand jury indicted Sterling on 10 felony counts in 2010 without Risen\u2019s testimony, after the reporter successfully fought off a subpoena.\nAmid months of uncertainty, more than a dozen fellow Pulitzer Prize winners and a coalition of advocacy groups demanded the government drop its insistence on Risen\u2019s testimony.\nEarlier this year, Risen asked the Supreme Court to establish a federal reporter\u2019s privilege, but the court declined to hear his case.\nBut federal prosecutors renewed their attempt to compel his testimony at trial."}
