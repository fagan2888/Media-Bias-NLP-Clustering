They still have a chance to secure the No. 1 seed if they win out and Carolina (14-0) loses its last two games.\n\nThe Eagles (6-8) would win the NFC East title if they beat Washington (7-7) at home and the Giants (6-8) on the road.\n\nBut they\u2019re not even close to Arizona\u2019s level.\n\nThe Cardinals outclassed Philadelphia in every way on their way to their eighth straight win.\n\nJohnson, a rookie filling in for injured backs Chris Johnson and Andre Ellington, had a pair of 1-yard TD runs and a 47-yarder.\n\nPalmer gave Cardinals fans a brief scare when he came out for one play after injuring his right index finger on a throw. But he returned to toss a 16-yard TD pass to John Brown and finished 20 of 32 for 274 yards.\n\nDeone Bucannon returned Sam Bradford\u2019s interception 39 yards for a touchdown to give Arizona a 37-10 lead early in the fourth quarter, sending fans to the exits.\n\nBradford threw for 361 yards and two TDs.\n\nTyrann Mathieu intercepted Bradford\u2019s pass late in the fourth quarter and limped off the field. There was no immediate word on his injury.\n\nThe Eagles had fumbles end consecutive drives in the third quarter. Bradford lost the ball on a sack by Markus Golden at Arizona\u2019s 44 and Ryan Mathews turned it over at midfield.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Johnson runs for 3 TDs, Cardinals beat Eagles 40-17", "title": "Johnson runs for 3 TDs, Cardinals beat Eagles 40-17", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Johnson runs for 3 TDs, Cardinals beat Eagles 40-17", "title": "Johnson runs for 3 TDs, Cardinals beat Eagles 40-17", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/21/johnson_runs_for_3_tds_cardinals_beat_eagles_40_17/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/cardinals-eagles-football.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Johnson runs for 3 TDs, Cardinals beat Eagles 40-17", "title": "Johnson runs for 3 TDs, Cardinals beat Eagles 40-17", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/cardinals-eagles-football.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rob Maaddi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c35\"", "article_summary": "David Johnson ran for 187 yards and three touchdowns, Carson Palmer threw a TD pass and the Cardinals beat the Philadelphia Eagles 40-17 on Sunday night to clinch the NFC West title.\nBut he returned to toss a 16-yard TD pass to John Brown and finished 20 of 32 for 274 yards.\nJohnson, a rookie filling in for injured backs Chris Johnson and Andre Ellington, had a pair of 1-yard TD runs and a 47-yarder.\nThe Eagles (6-8) would win the NFC East title if they beat Washington (7-7) at home and the Giants (6-8) on the road.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The Arizona Cardinals can check division champions off their to-do list."}
