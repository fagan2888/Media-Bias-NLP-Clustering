I can\u2019t point to a state where it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d said Becky Vaughn, vice president of addictions at the National Council for Behavioral Health.\n\nThe problem could be particularly acute in Arizona, which had just 20 substance abuse professionals per 1,000 adults with addictions, the sixth-lowest rate in the nation, according to a new analysis. The national average is 32 per 1,000.\n\nNeal Cash, CEO of the Community Partnership of Southern Arizona, said the workforce shortage is getting \u201cmore severe and more critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more people have health care that includes mental health and substance abuse benefits, that\u2019s compounding a situation that was already there,\u201d Cash said.\n\nIn 2013, only 18 percent of adults with substance abuse disorders got treatment, according to a study by the Pew Research Center, in part because of a lack of insurance coverage.\n\nBut in 2014, as many as 60 million Americans got access to new or expanded behavioral health benefits, which includes substance abuse treatment, due to two federal laws, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, named substance abuse disorders as one of 10 essential health benefits that must be cover\n\ned by Medicaid and by any insurance plan sold through a health care marketplace.\n\nAnd the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act mandated that, as of 2014, insurance companies could no longer treat behavioral health care differently than primary care by charging higher copays or limiting the number of treatments patients can receive.\n\nThe new laws mean that mental health and substance abuse can no longer be treated \u201cas a stepchild,\u201d said Jeff Zornitsky, director of strategic initiatives at Advocates for Human Potential, a research firm specializing in health and behavioral health.\n\n\u201cThey have to be treated the same way as people with, say, diabetes,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvocates welcomed those changes, but predict they will overwhelm an already strained workforce.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Zornitsky, the number of substance abuse specialists per 1,000 adults with addictions ranges from a low of 11 in Nevada to a high of 70 in Vermont. He said Arizona falls in the bottom quartile of states.\n\n\u201cThese folks in Arizona are probably going to have a tougher time meeting need than places that were at the top of the heap,\u201d Zornitsky said. \u201cAccess to care suffers.\u201d\n\nAnd Vaughn said access is critical for people with behavioral health problems like substance abuse disorders, who need \u201ctreatment on demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018What\u2019s the waiting list for that facility?\u2019 There\u2019s no waiting list,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cWhen people come in and they are addicted \u2026 and they\u2019re seeking help, if you tell them to come again in six weeks, more than likely you\u2019ll never see them again.\u201d\n\nBut the industry has had a hard time recruiting and retaining a workforce in part because workers make less money than their counterparts in other health care areas, Vaughn said.\n\n\u201cWe lose a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe burnout rate, as you can imagine, is tremendous \u2013 low pay, long hours, working with difficult people. It\u2019s hard to inspire people to want to work with people who are addicted to alcohol or drugs.\u201d\n\nBy 2020, Arizona will have 4,900 behavioral health jobs to fill, Zornitsky said. Nationally, there will be about 300,000 jobs that need filling.\n\nCash said licensed substance abuse workers will likely be overwhelmed as demand for service increases, affecting the quality of care patients receive.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re seeking help and you need help, you don\u2019t want to be shortchanged and you want to be able to get the kind of care that you need,\u201d Cash said.\n\n\u201cI would say that for the most part that occurs, but as the system gets more strained, the demand exceeds the capacity to effectively treat people, and that could certainly become a problem,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "../../../wp-content/themes/cronkitenews/img/favicon-129.png", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Changes to health care law in the past year gave millions of Americans access to mental health and substance abuse treatment, but did nothing to address a shortage of professionals who can provide that care.
