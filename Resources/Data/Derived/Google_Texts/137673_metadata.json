Critical thinking is something you do automatically. Critical thinking is something you can\u2019t stop doing. Critical thinking is who you are.\n\nHopefully you\u2019re on the spectrum somewhere, preferably at four or working your way to it.\n\nI noted this because I\u2019ve been thinking about Facebook memes. We all see them \u2013 zillions of them \u2013 purporting to provide us with useful (or conclusive, or irrefutable, or mic drop) facts and information. Some of these are quite helpful. Many are misdirections and outright deceptions.\n\nIf we\u2019d like to benefit from these bits of ever-circulating wisdom (instead of becoming some cynical manipulator\u2019s dupe), it\u2019s important for us to apply a lot of critical thought.\n\nHere\u2019s an example that streamed through my feed this morning. It, and the way I read it, illustrate what we should all be doing. All the time.\n\nAnd here\u2019s how my brain read and responded to it, point by point.\n\nStock Market Tripled\n\nGreat for millionaires, How much better are YOU economically?\n\nUnemployment Cut in Half:\n\nOK, but some of this results from people simply giving up the search and dropping out of the analysis and a lot more involves people taking worse jobs for lower wages. I can\u2019t quantify this, so I suspect the answer is something like yes, he\u2019s done a far better job than the GOP alternative, but there\u2019s probably less room for celebration that the meme would have you believe.\n\n16 Million More Insured\u2026:\n\nGood, and yes, it\u2019s a step in the right direction. Obamacare also guarantees coverage for many previously at-risk children and it prevents insurance companies from denying care based on pre-existing conditions. These are big wins. However, I\u2019ve been on Obamacare, and make no mistake \u2013 the cost of it can be borderline prohibitive. In sports terms, then, let\u2019s call this a solid RBI single and let\u2019s not kid ourselves that it was an upper deck slam.\n\n$2 Gas, Oil Imports Cut By Two Thirds:\n\nFrom one angle \u2013 how much money working people have to spend getting around \u2013 this is very good. No argument. Reduced reliance on foreign oil? Again, great. Big win. And our overall oil consumption is down a good bit since Obama took office \u2013 another win. Now, what I want to be reading about is a massively increased commitment to sustainables and getting those carbon numbers down even more.\n\nIran\u2019s Nuclear Program Disarmed:\n\nGood. Let\u2019s keep an eye on them, though. Given the volatility of the region and the complexities of Iran\u2019s government there\u2019s no need to be printing \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banners. (Also, by way of being fair, Iran\u2019s government is, at its worst, nothing like the threat to peace posed by our own government.)\n\nMarriage Equality Nationwide:\n\nUh-huh. Of course, he was against it before he was for it. So let\u2019s not give the guy too much praise for following the polls and doing the only expedient thing he could, mmkay?\n\nBin Laden Dead:\n\nGreat. The terror threat doesn\u2019t seem to have been eradicated, so let\u2019s not, as a citizenry, make the mistake of confusing just vengeance with policy solutions.\n\nThe world is full of people with a vested interest in what you think. Government, corporate, private, public, you name it. If you think what they want you to then they can harness you to their goals. Their goals may or may not benefit you, so it\u2019s essential that you only allow yourself to be harnessed for things that align with your best interests. Otherwise you\u2019re just somebody\u2019s dupe. Their punk. Their bitch. They\u2019re appropriating your power and using it against you and they\u2019re laughing all the way to the bank (or the capitol, or the statehouse). They\u2019re holding you by the arms and playing the old \u201cwhy are you hitting yourself?\u201d game.\n\nIndividual citizens have very little power these days. What little power they have begins with their willingness to think critically about what they are told. Whether it\u2019s a presidential candidate in a televised debate or an innocent meme coming from somebody you trust to be on your side \u2013 like, say, Occupy Democrats, in the case above \u2013 you have to ask whether or not the message is supported by actual facts, and if you don\u2019t know those facts you have to go find them. This is true whether you\u2019re Republican, Democrat, Green, Libertarian, Socialist, Independent or Freak Power Party.\n\nYou\u2019re being lied to every day. That isn\u2019t your fault.\n\nBut falling for it is.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Progressive Culture | Scholars & Rogues", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Critical thinking 101: how to read a meme (think \u2013 it ain\u2019t illegal\u00a0yet) | Progressive Culture | Scholars & Rogues on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Progressive Culture | Scholars & Rogues", "description": "The four stages of critical thinking: Critical thinking is something you make yourself do.
