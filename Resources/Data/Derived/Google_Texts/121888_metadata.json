Steve Santarsiero, a Democratic candidate in the 8th Congressional District, is criticizing primary opponent Shaughnessy Naughton for coming out against a public healthcare option in a Bucks County Courier Times editorial board meeting.\n\nSantarsiero linked Naughton to congressional Republicans, who oppose the public healthcare option that is supported by the vast majority of Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe public option is a common-sense health care reform that would force private insurance companies to stay competitive, give customers greater health care options and ultimately save lives \u2014 all without raising taxes. I\u2019m dismayed that Shaughnessy Naughton is siding with Tea Party Republicans and insurance companies over patients, health care advocates and the hardworking Pennsylvania families she is seeking to represent in Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nThe public option was originally part of the Affordable Care Act, but was stripped from the reconciled bill. The public option was to be a federally administered insurance plan that customers could buy into, offering competition with private insurers to bring down costs. It also included the so-called \u201cMedicare buy-in option,\u201d where customers could purchase into Medicare before reaching retirement age.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn other campaign news, Santarsiero has earned the backing of the National Education Association and Pennsylvania State Education Association.\n\nSantarsiero is the son of a teacher. Following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he left his law practice to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and teach social studies at Bensalem High School.\n\n\u201cAs a former teacher, I couldn\u2019t be prouder to have the support of Pennsylvania teachers and the education community,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Congress, I will continue the fight for early childhood education, fully funded classrooms and affordable higher education for every student who dreams of attending college.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteve Santarsiero is a friend to public education, and that means he\u2019s a friend to the 1.8 million kids who learn in Pennsylvania\u2019s public schools and to the educators who work so hard to give them the power of a great education,\u201d said PSEA President Jerry Oleksiak. \u201cSteve has a great track record of supporting issues that PSEA members care about in the General Assembly, and he\u2019ll take that experience to Washington and keep fighting for policies that help kids learn, help educators teach, and help our members provide for their families.\u201d\n\nIn the state House, Santarsiero introduced legislation for a plan that reimbursed local school districts for costs associated with renovating new and replacing dilapidated classrooms. He\u2019s opposed more standardized testing and worked to give teachers and school districts more local control.\n\nOleksiak said, \u201cSteve Santarsiero can win this race, and if he does, our schools, students, and educators will be better off. That\u2019s why he has PSEA\u2019s and NEA\u2019s endorsement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Midweek Wire", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "WirePOLITICS: Naughton criticized for public healthcare stance | The Midweek Wire on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Midweek Wire", "description": "Tom Waring,\u00a0the Wire State Rep.
