The first is that Alabama is one of those \u201cweak union\u201d states. The other is that teachers\u2019 unions give all their political money to Democrats.\n\nThe Alabama Education Association (AEA) is attempting to put both of those beliefs to rest simultaneously as it makes an unprecedented effort to dismantle the Republican supermajority in the state legislature. Its unique method of accomplishing this is to throw huge amounts of money at Republicans.\n\nOur story begins with National Research Services, a previously unknown firm with a Tennessee post office box that incorporated in Delaware on a Friday and received hundreds of thousands of dollars of AEA PAC money the next Monday.\n\nNational Research Services then provided campaign advertising to a slew of friendly Republican incumbents and the primary challengers to the unfriendly Republican incumbents. On May 9, the union\u2019s PAC had already spent more than $2.1 million on the primaries, far exceeding any other group.\n\nAEA is so set on ousting the sitting GOP legislators, it is spending money on mailers accusing the incumbent Republicans of voting to \u201cbring Obamacare to Alabama.\u201d\n\nThe weekly campaign disclosure reports continue to show almost all of AEA\u2019s PAC contributions going to Republican candidates.\n\nState representative Todd Greeson is a Republican running for an open senate seat. He has received $200,000 from AEA, but sought to highlight his independence.\n\n\u201cOutside of probably the NRA, that\u2019s probably the only group I\u2019ve voted 100 percent with,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd pro-life \u2013 I\u2019m about 100 percent (voting) on pro-life. That\u2019s about it. That\u2019s the only areas I\u2019ve voted with a special interest group. But the NRA doesn\u2019t really contribute money in a legislative race.\u201d\n\nAEA is either getting very broadminded in supporting gun-toting, abortion-hating, Obamacare-damning Republicans for office, or it is engaging in the worst kind of cynical political power play \u2013 the kind of thing teachers\u2019 unions always claim to be above.\n\nBut there\u2019s plenty of cynicism to go around. The Republicans and pundits who have complained for years about the percentages of teacher union money going to Democrats can now see what the reverse looks like. Do they feel better or worse?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Reversal.", "title": "Teachers Union Tries to Buy Alabama GOP", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/03/teachers-union-tries-to-buy-alabama-gop/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T14:41:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T12:56:55+00:00"}, "keywords": "alabama education association, education, elections, primaries, Republicans,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Teachers Union Tries to Buy Alabama GOPposted at 10:41 am on June 3, 2014 by Mike AntonucciTwo articles of faith about teachers\u2019 unions are being put to the test in Alabama\u2019s primaries tomorrow.\nOn May 9, the union\u2019s PAC had already spent more than $2.1 million on the primaries, far exceeding any other group.\nThe other is that teachers\u2019 unions give all their political money to Democrats.\nThe Republicans and pundits who have complained for years about the percentages of teacher union money going to Democrats can now see what the reverse looks like.\nOur story begins with National Research Services, a previously unknown firm with a Tennessee post office box that incorporated in Delaware on a Friday and received hundreds of thousands of dollars of AEA PAC money the next Monday."}
