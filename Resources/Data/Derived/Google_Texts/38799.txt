MONTGOMERY, Alabama - A study commissioned by the Alabama Hospital Association predicted that expanding Alabama’s Medicaid program, under the Affordable Care Act, would create 30,700 new jobs over the next six years.

The report conducted by researchers at the University of Alabama’s Center for Business and Economic Research estimated the number of new jobs could climb to 51,918 if all eligible individuals enrolled in an expansion.

“The report concludes that ‘from an economic perspective, Alabama will significantly gain jobs and the associated income, grow its GDP, increase business activity, and generate much-needed tax revenues if it chooses to undertake Medicaid expansion under the ACA,’” Alabama Hospital Association President J. Michael Horsley said in a statement.

Horsley said the numbers bolstered the case that Alabama should be moving in the direction of expansion.

The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, suggests states expand Medicaid coverage for most low-income adults to 138% of the federal poverty level, which in 2012 was $15,415 for an individual and $26,344 for a family of three.

The federal government would pay 100 percent of those newly eligible for the first three years and then the state's share of the cost would gradually grow to 10 percent.

The study estimated economic benefit based off enrollment estimates made by researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health. The UAB study estimated that an expansion would lead to just under 300,000 more people on Medicaid in Alabama with nearly 80 percent of those being previously uninsured.

The Alabama Hospital Expansion study predicted expansion would create:

- 11,290 jobs in health care and social assistance.

- 6,390 jobs in retail trade.

- 5,490 jobs in professional, scientific and technical services.

- 1,423 jobs in administrative and other support services.

- 1,247 jobs in accommodation and food service.

- 1,095 jobs in the finance and insurance industry.

Gov. Robert Bentley has declined to expand Medicaid in Alabama saying he would not make a broken program bigger.

“Reforming Medicaid is a long-term process. Our focus is making sure we have an efficient, well-managed system,” Bentley Communications Director Jeremy King said.

The Hospital Association recently issued a resolution commending Bentley’s effort to reform Medicaid.



Bentley signed legislation to revamp Alabama’s Medicaid program into a network of community-led managed care organizations. Bentley also created a group to suggest ways to reduce pharmacy costs in the state's Medicaid program.

“Again, we understand the Governor’s desire to explore options that best fit Alabama, but we are also hopeful that as the efforts to reform the system continue to progress, this report, coupled with the UAB study, will be helpful in underscoring not only the potential for additional insurance coverage for many working Alabama adults, but also the tremendous number of jobs that would be created that could significantly boost the state’s economy,” Horsley said.
