But before they get all excited, it\u2019s not a masochistic device. The \u201cElectric Eel\u201d is equipped with electrodes that send mild electrical impulses up the shaft of the condom, or as its creators, two Georgia Tech students, Firaz Peer and Andrew Quitmeyer, describe it, it\u2019s an \"open-source digital condom prototype using electrodes and soft-circuitry.\" It comes as a contender in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s \u201cNext Generation Condom\u201d challenge, launched last March.\n\n\u201cRubbers\u201d have come a long way, long before latex form \u2014 bladders and animal membranes early on \u2014 to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Yet popular opinion has held that latex condoms reduce pleasure by diminishing sensation, so people often eschew safe sex all together. Last March, the Gates foundation sought to change that, proposing the innovative condom challenge for a $1 million prize. The contest\u2019s winning design should enhance pleasure while also providing ease-of-use, which should, ultimately, convince more people to choose condoms over reckless, unprotected sex.\n\nDuring its 400 years in use, the condom has hardly undergone any major redesigns or improvements in the last 50 years, the challenge notes. Peer and Quitmeyer developed the concept for the \u201cElectric Eel\u201d with those improvements in mind. \u201cOur goal is that such explorations in design could help disease prevention while also promoting safe, exhilarating experiences for people of all sorts,\u201d they say in the video. If manufactured, the electric condom would come in latex form, of course. The amount of electricity, which is applied in \"very small\" amounts could be controlled through Internet APIs or with controllers.\n\nThe prototype shown in the video below features a cucumber wrapped in an electrode-implanted fabric. Early tests consisted of conductive threads sewn into latex condoms, which Peer and Quitmeyer say shows \u201cgreat promise for adding new sensations to existing condom styles.\u201d With only 27 days left in the challenge, they've raised $950 on IndieGogo \u2014 a tad bit shy of their $10,000 goal.\n\nFor an in-depth look and awkward demo of someone testing it, watch below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "condom, challenge, electric, eel, sends, electrical, impulses, shaft, users, pleasure", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The \"Electric Eel\" condom, a contender in the \"Next Generation Condom\" challenge, aims to enhance pleasure and promote safe sex, all while sending electrical impulses up the wearer's manhood.", "title": "This Condom Electrifies You...
