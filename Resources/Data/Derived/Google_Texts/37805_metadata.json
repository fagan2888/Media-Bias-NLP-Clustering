High deductibles, copayments and coinsurance mean some people are avoiding medical care altogether to save money. But regular medical care is important, and you shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice your health to save money. By tackling your health care strategically, you may be able to avoid that tough decision.\n\n\n\nMore than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance, leaving 29 million still without coverage, according to the latest data from the federal government. But in a 2014 Associated Press survey of insured adults, one in four said they were not confident they could afford care if they or someone in their family had an unexpected medical need.\n\n\n\nIf you fear that a future medical expense may too steep, the following steps may help:\n\n\n\n1. Find the right plan.\n\nSaving on health care begins with selecting the right insurance plan. Consider how much the monthly premium will cost, but don\u2019t choose your plan based on that factor alone. Instead, evaluate all of your options.\n\n\n\nA plan that trades lower premiums for higher out-of-pocket cost \u2014 like a high deductible health plan (HDHP)\u2014 may make sense for someone with relatively few expected medical needs. Someone with a chronic condition, however, could save more with a plan that has higher premiums and lower deductibles, copays and coinsurance, as he or she will be going to the doctor more often.\n\n\n\nConsider your medical needs for the coming year, and use them to estimate how much you\u2019d spend with a few different plans.\n\n\n\n2. Visit only in-network providers.\n\nInsurance plans contract with groups of doctors and facilities to form a network that offers lower rates for members. When you use providers within that network, your care is covered at a higher rate. If you venture outside, you\u2019ll have to pay more.\n\nFor example, one visit to an in-network family doctor for acute illness could result in a $35 copay, with your insurance picking up the remainder. A visit to an out-of-network doctor for that same illness could cost about $150, or the entire billable cost.\n\nAlways check your insurer\u2019s website and search for doctors under your specific plan\u2019s network.\n\n\n\n3. Take advantage of FSA and HSA offerings.\n\nFlexible spending accounts (FSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) can help you budget for medical expenses while providing tax benefits. If your employer offers one, sign up. When deciding how much to contribute, estimate your medical expenses for the year and go from there. If you have a deductible, set aside at least that much.\n\nA few important points:\n\n\u25cf FSAs are\u2014 with few exceptions\u2014 \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d accounts, so estimate your contribution carefully because if there are funds left at the end of the year, you may lose that money.\n\n\u25cf HSAs are only available for people with qualifying high-deductible health plans. If you have such a plan, but your employer doesn\u2019t offer an HSA, you can open one yourself through an outside financial institution.\n\n\u25cf Unlike FSAs, an HSA is your account and the balance can be carried over from year to year, and even follow you as you change jobs.\n\nREAD MORE: What Exactly Is an HSA?\n\n4. Know what\u2019s covered under free preventive care.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insured Americans are allowed certain free preventive services and screenings. These include immunizations and screenings for some types of cancer. Take advantage of this care because it can help you stay healthy and save you money.\n\nREAD MORE: What\u2019s Covered Under the ACA\u2019s Free Preventive Care?\n\n5. Save on prescription drug costs.\n\nPrescription drugs can be a major expense, particularly if you need recurring prescriptions.\n\nSave on your medication costs by:\n\n\u25cf Choosing generics over brand names whenever possible.\n\n\u25cf Asking about a therapeutic alternative when your doctor recommends a brand name with no generic available.\n\n\u25cf Asking your doctor for samples.\n\n\u25cf Visiting the drug maker\u2019s website for coupons or patient assistance programs.\n\n\u25cf Getting your medicine in larger doses and splitting the pills.\n\n\u25cf Refilling multiple months at a time.\n\nA money-saving example: A one-month supply of the cholesterol drug Crestor could carry a $65 copay under some plans if a generic is not available. A one-month supply of Zocor\u2014 a different brand-name drug that treats the same condition\u2014 would cost $215, as insurance wouldn\u2019t cover the brand name because there is a generic available. The cost of a one-month supply of simvastatin, the generic version of Zocor: $15 copay.\n\nREAD MORE: How to Save on Prescription Drug Costs\n\n6. Negotiate high medical bills.\n\nWhen you receive a medical bill, don\u2019t automatically accept the balance as the final amount due. Contact the provider\u2019s billing office to ask if they can reduce the cost. If the person on the phone won\u2019t offer to lower the bill, ask to speak with a supervisor. Also, ask if a monthly payment plan is possible to make the bill more manageable.\n\nREAD MORE: A Guide to Negotiating Your Own Medical Bills\n\n7. Carry lessons into the next year.\n\nYou may find the plan you chose for this year wasn\u2019t the best for your situation.
