Bush.\n\nThe lawmakers said that prior documents overturned to the committee were insufficient.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner DHS disciplines 41 Secret Service agents for Chaffetz leak The Department of Homeland Security Department said Thursday that 41 Secret Service agents are being disciplined, after a watchdog report found personal information from Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, was leaked. Last September, the DHS Inspector General confirmed that several Secret Service agents accessed information about Chaffetz, now chairman of the House Oversight Committee, from an application he submitted for a job at the Secret Service in 2003. This information was also \"wrongfully\" leaked to the press. Of the 57 agents that were reviewed, 41 are \"receiving some level of discipline,\" said DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in a statement.\n\nSeveral agencies said they withheld information due to confidentiality issues.\n\nReps. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Kevin Brady, R-Texas, wrote the letters. Upton heads Energy and Commerce and Brady heads Ways and Means.\n\nThe letters were sent to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, director of the Office of Budget and Management Shaun Donovan and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican lawmakers are using a major legal victory to press for answers from the Obama administration on Obamacare payments to insurers.\nLeaders from two influential House committees wrote to several agencies that the administration has no excuse for delaying giving them documents about the source of funding for cost-sharing reduction payments.
