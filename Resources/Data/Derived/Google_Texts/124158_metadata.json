Dunkin\u2019 Brands, the company that owns Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, has announced 100 Dunkin\u2019 Donuts stores in the United States are set to close this year and next.\n\nWhile the company hasn\u2019t provided a list of stores impacted, it has said they are all owned by the Speedway gas station and convenience store chain. The reasons behind the franchisee\u2019s decision to shutter the locations remains unclear as Dunkin\u2019 Brands insists poor performance has not factored into the decision.\n\nDunkin\u2019 Brands still has plans to open stores in California and internationally soon, the company insists. It also points out the Speedway locations represent only a small fraction of its business and overall revenue.\n\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts Footprint will Remain Large\n\nThe Speedway closings are likely to be felt by those who enjoyed the convenience offered by the combination stores. Even so, the closing of 100 locations is a drop in the bucket for the company\u2019s overall footprint. Dunkin\u2019 has more than 11,300 stores worldwide with more than 8,000 found within the United States, the company\u2019s website states.\n\nAll told, the Quincy, Mass.-based chain boasts about 3 million customers a day. With additional expansion planned in California and abroad, the loss of the Speedway locations shouldn\u2019t create a big impact on the company\u2019s overall numbers.\n\nYou Might Also Enjoy: Sleep In: McDonald\u2019s Breakfast Will Soon Be Offered All Day\n\nGrowing Competition, Lackluster Performance\n\nThe Speedway closings might not significantly change Dunkin\u2019s footprint, but the company has been struggling to maintain performance. With plenty of competition in the field courtesy of players like Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, Krispy Kreme and other big-name chains, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts issued earnings guidance for the year that fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. It also lowered its outlook for the third quarter to 1.1% same-store sales growth as competition pulls customers away from its doors.\n\nInvestors are noticing the struggle and they are reacting. News of the Speedway closings caused shares to drop by more than 12%.\n\nWhether America still runs on Dunkin\u2019 remains to be seen. Some analysts worry that growing competition and costly promotional gimmicks \u2013 such as free coffee on National Coffee Day \u2013 combined with rising labor costs could spell more bad news down the road.\n\nGet Free Updates!
