John Cornyn, R-Texas.\n\nDuring a visit to Community Impact Newspaper headquarters April 1, Cornyn discussed the federal minimum wage, a decision Cornyn said he would prefer to see controlled by states; how a recent federal highway bill will address traffic congestion in major Texas metropolitan areas; and his 2008 vote supporting the federal bailout of major financial institutions.\n\nThe following questions were submitted via Twitter by readers and responded via email to Community Impact Newspaper by Cornyn. Will you work with the federal administration to expand Medicaid access as recommended by the Texas Medical Association?\n\nMedicaid is an unsustainable program in dire need of reform, and expanding it under \u201cObamacare\u201d would subject Texas to burdensome, harmful mandates from the Obama administration that would negatively affect health care for folks across the state. If the federal government were to free the state from the micromanagement of Medicaid, there are better ways\u2014like premium support for private health insurance\u2014to address the needs of low-income Texans. Will you amend the new open carry law to let public universities limit guns per their own guidelines?\n\nThe law the Texas Legislature passed in 2015 gives universities some discretion to regulate campus carry. I respect that the state Legislature passed a law they thought was appropriate, and having served at the state level, I am very respectful of their role versus mine. I support the right of law-abiding Texans to open carry under the law passed by the Legislature, and I will continue to defend the Second Amendment at the federal level. Do you believe Merrick Garland is a qualified nominee?\n\nMy belief that the next president should nominate the next Supreme Court justice is not about personalities, but about the principle that Texans should have a say in the selection of the next lifetime appointment to our nation\u2019s highest court. Will you support [GOP presidential candidate Donald] Trump?\n\nAny of the current Republican candidates running would make a far better president than former Secretary Hillary Clinton, and I plan to support the Republican nominee in November.\n\nPrior to his election to the U.S. Senate in 2002, Cornyn served as a Texas Supreme Court justice and as Texas attorney general. As majority whip in the Senate, Cornyn said he aims to ensure Republicans in the Senate maintain discipline and that votes are in line with the party\u2019s policies.\n\nWhy did the Senate decide to withhold hearings for confirming the next Supreme Court justice?\n\nGiven the fact that [the parties] are divided on that issue, I felt like we should take the time we do have to do things where there is consensus\u2014things like criminal justice reform, mental health reform and the like, some of the things we\u2019ve done this year. I would just say it\u2019s an unfortunate development, but it\u2019s kind of where we are. I don\u2019t believe \u2026 it\u2019s really about [Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland] so much as it is the impact of the Supreme Court on our society and the fact that the next justice will affect the balance of power on the Supreme Court for the next generation.\n\nDo you see the Senate or anyone in Washington looking at the federal minimum wage now and making any changes?\n\nThere are always people who advocate that the federal government ought to mandate more things, including how much you pay your employees or how much a fast-food worker gets. And we\u2019re all for people making more money; that\u2019s great. I\u2019d say why make it $15 an hour? Why not make it $100 an hour? The simple answer to that is you can\u2019t have an effective business model with those sorts of overhead and costs. So really you ought to leave that to the marketplace, where those decisions are made.\n\nHow will the five-year, $305 billion federal bill signed in December help relieve traffic congestion in Austin, Houston and Dallas?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the consequences of [traffic congestion]. It strangles commerce, people going back and forth taking their kids to school. \u2026 The city manager from Georgetown at the meeting we attended [April 1] was just telling me about making sure they had the flexibility to do smart lanes and \u2026 using technology to figure out when the traffic is flowing and to provide people incentives, perhaps, if they want to pay a little bit more to get better access. \u2026 If not, everybody\u2019s got the opportunity to drive on the highway and not have to pay more than the gas tax. It\u2019s a huge challenge, and I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s got a perfect answer for it.\n\nWhy did you decide to vote for the federal bailout in 2008?\n\nAll of the experts, from [then-U.S. Secretary of the Treasury] Hank Paulson to the George [W.] Bush White House, said that if we didn\u2019t do this that we would see a complete meltdown of the U.S. financial system, and it would have a devastating impact on the country. It really transcended political consideration.\n\nWould you vote for it again?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t change the vote I made back then. I hope I never have to vote for something like that again.\n\nIs the political scene viewed differently now from when you first took office?\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly how [the presidential primaries are] going to work out, but I\u2019m a pretty optimistic person. I also think rather than having someone come in and impose things on us, we\u2019re free to choose our leaders ourselves, and this is the process by which we do it. It\u2019s not always pretty. \u2026 My hope is that we are sort of working through a period here that we\u2019ll look back on and say, \u2018Boy, that was strange.\u2019 We\u2019ll get back into a better place.\n\nWould you change anything about your decision 21 years ago as a Texas Supreme Court justice to uphold the Robin Hood school finance law?\n\nThere was quite a pushback [to my 1995 decision] because some school districts in the state have benefited from the large and wealthy [school district] tax base. You had some school districts where students were receiving roughly $19,000 or $20,000 per student in terms of tax-based support, and others, because they lived in other poorer tax bases, getting a couple thousand dollars. The [Texas Supreme Court] back in 1989 said that [disparity] was unconstitutional. \u2026 As long as our courts are [financing schools] based on property tax and sales tax with disparate tax bases \u2026 it\u2019s going to be hard.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-144.png", "description": "April 27, 2016: https://youtu.be/9aGq9iSajE0 Confirming a new U.S. Supreme Court justice should be delayed until the next president takes office, said U.S. Sen.
