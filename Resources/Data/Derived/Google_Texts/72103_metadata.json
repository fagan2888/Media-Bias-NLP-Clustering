A graduate of the class of 1995, the Bergenfield man said the lyrics were outdated and hearkened back to the days when Rutgers was an all-male school.\n\n\"The lyrics are outdated if you take them seriously,\" he said, adding that the changes are \"a sign of the times. It just makes everything more inclusive.\"\n\nDguerra pointed to changes being made in Alabama regarding exclusive sororities.\n\n\"If they can do it in Alabama, we can do it in Rutgers,\" he said.\n\nAs the glee club took the field in one of many pre-game traditions, the new lyrics were displayed on monitors throughout the stadium.\n\nMany mumbled through the first lines but picked up after. Despite almost universal animosity about the changed lyrics, a big cheer went up when the song was finished.\n\n\"I just think Rutgers always has to muff something up,\" said Peggy Hutchinson, who was singing along. A former graduate student at the school, she and her husband have season tickets.\n\nShe was disappointed in the change in lyrics, even though she said it was barely noticeable.\n\n\"Most people are trying to develop traditions,\" she said. \"We have one and we're trying to get rid of it.\"\n\nTravis Russo, 30, was with the group. He pointed out that \"man\" could be a reference to humanity in general.\n\n\"All mankind means all person kind,\" he said.\n\nAnother reveler was more blunt.\n\n\"It's B.S.\" said Michael Coates, 25. He referred to himself as an honorary alumni and a big Rutgers fan. \"Why change it to be politically correct?\"\n\n\"This isn't France, this is America,\" he said. \"Hashtag, boom.\"\n\nStar-Ledger staff writer Kelly Heyboer contributed to this report.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Rutgers new alma mater not really 'gender neutral'\n\n\u2022 After 140 years, Rutgers nixes 'be a man' and rewrites alma mater with gender-neutral lyrics\n\n\u2022 Update Rutgers alma mater to recognize female students", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','@rutgers-football','middlesex-county','new-brunswick','piscataway','rutgers-university'", "title": "Rutgers football fans' reactions mixed on alma mater lyric change at game", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Rutgers football fans\\u0027 reactions mixed on alma mater lyric change at game\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/rutgers_boosters_lament_politically_correct_lyric_change.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13451460-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11287575\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-21T20:17:36Z\", \"author\": \"David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"@rutgers-football\",\"middlesex-county\",\"new-brunswick\",\"piscataway\",\"rutgers-university\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13451460-small.jpg", "creator": "@Giambusso", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "On the Rutgers alma mater lyric change: \"I think they're changing too many things,\" said the mother of a recent alum."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 21, 2013,  8:18 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13451460-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dgiambus\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"5470\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "On the Rutgers alma mater lyric change: \"I think they're changing too many things,\" said the mother of a recent alum.", "title": "Rutgers football fans' reactions mixed on alma mater lyric change at game", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/rutgers_boosters_lament_politically_correct_lyric_change.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 21, 2013,  4:16 PM", "article_author": "David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "On the Rutgers alma mater lyric change: \"I think they're changing too many things,\" said the mother of a recent alum."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbca\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Rutgers new alma mater not really 'gender neutral'\u2022 After 140 years, Rutgers nixes 'be a man' and rewrites alma mater with gender-neutral lyrics\u2022 Update Rutgers alma mater to recognize female students\nShe was disappointed in the change in lyrics, even though she said it was barely noticeable.\nThe change comes after decades of debate at the 65,000-student state university, where half of the students are women.\nInstead, the first verse will begin: \"From far and near we came to Rutgers / And resolved to learn all that we can.\"\nMarianne Fitzgerald, whose son is a Rutgers senior, felt the song, now 150 years old, should not have been updated to be \"politically correct.\""}
