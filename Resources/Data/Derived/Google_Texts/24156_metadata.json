For most of those hours, the students provide unpaid labor in the schools' own salons.\n\nThe state's requirements have been crafted to perpetuate a business model for these schools that is out of sync with many other states. Iowa's 2,100 hours is twice as large as some states require. In addition, Iowa's requirements exceed the requirements for such licensed professions as emergency medical technician, hearing aid dispenser or commercial pilot.\n\nThe attorney general's lawsuit alleges La'James violated Iowa's consumer fraud law through deception and misrepresentation when selling education to students.\n\nThe Des Moines Register has written repeatedly about problems at La'James. Dozens of current and former students contacted us. They told strikingly similar stories about not being given credit for the hours worked and being unable to graduate on time. Some were forced to drop out because La'James \"pays itself first\" with students' student loan and grant money, leaving them with no money for rent or living expenses.\n\nOne student told us she had to pay a $1,300 \"cancellation fee\" when she withdrew from La'James. Another who did graduate said she was afraid to give haircuts to men because she had had no practice during her 2,100 hours of instruction. The mother of one young woman said La'James refused to refund the enrollment fee of her daughter, who had been killed in a car accident a month before classes began.\n\nAt La'James, students sat in classrooms without instructors, performed janitorial duties and were forced to sell beauty products to graduate, the lawsuit says. Students had no choice but to recruit customers who pay the school for beauty services provided by the unpaid students.\n\nWhen students enroll, they sign an agreement to complete the training hours by a specific date. Yet some say the school wouldn't extend the deadline if they were ill or faced a family emergency.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, one-fourth of La'James students could not meet their completion deadline and had to pay more than $630,000 in additional fees to obtain the hours needed to graduate.\n\nMiller's lawyers rightly observe that the school treats students like \"free labor.\" Of course, this is essentially the same observation about cosmetology and barber schools made by an Iowa public health official 50 years ago when he noted that they are the only businesses where \"people pay you to work for nothing.\"\n\nFor this decades-old arrangement, students can thank Iowa lawmakers.\n\nIowa's training requirement guarantees the cosmetology schools a stream of customers. These customers take out student loans and use federal Pell Grants to pay tuition, and then spend months as free laborers providing services to customers who also pay the school.\n\nSo it's a relief the Iowa attorney general's office is pursuing La'James for wrongdoing. Yet the bigger problem is one that must be addressed by the Legislature.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1odisPp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Iowa's licensing requirements are way out of sync with other professions.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Iowa's licensing requirements are way out of sync with other professions.", "title": "The Register's Editorial: It's time to change cosmetology law", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/09/07/time-revise-cosmetology-law/15228881/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa's licensing requirements are way out of sync with other professions.", "title": "The Register's Editorial: It's time to change cosmetology law", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d5dcc884cfd8badc208ab782bd7dfd53d614336/c=0-0-300-300&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/08/28/1409246219000-beauty.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Iowa Legislature", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Iowa Legislature", "title": "The Register's Editorial: It's time to change cosmetology law", "author": "The Register\u2019s Editorial Board", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/041187107a49e6e50dc2d77608b9ba0dc9813e35/c=30-0-255-300/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/08/28/1409246219000-beauty.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f4ee580bcbd424aa923c3b2b66ed751f64e13cc2/c=0-0-300-300/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/08/28/1409246219000-beauty.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b0df0238f7df6b749057f97a43d7826720d7cab/c=1-0-400-300/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/08/28/1409246219000-beauty.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/667e37f2af25884d6723fce3f1f82ff77495da8b/c=0-14-400-239&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/08/28/1409246219000-beauty.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-06T23:29:49.027000-05:00", "shorthed": "The Register's Editorial: It's time to change cosmetology law", "articleid": 15228881, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0cb6096b42563f6ba8431f0e7073d479a3f9f96d/c=0-14-400-239/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/08/28/1409246219000-beauty.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79220a12dc46441345cb85e56903e8b8d10080a1/c=63-0-231-300/local/-/media/IAGroup/DesMoines/2014/08/28/1409246219000-beauty.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda35f\"", "article_summary": "At La'James, students sat in classrooms without instructors, performed janitorial duties and were forced to sell beauty products to graduate, the lawsuit says.\nIowa requires people who want to cut and style hair to receive 2,100 hours of education and training at a cosmetology school.\nThe state's requirements have been crafted to perpetuate a business model for these schools that is out of sync with many other states.\nThe attorney general's lawsuit alleges La'James violated Iowa's consumer fraud law through deception and misrepresentation when selling education to students.\nStudents had no choice but to recruit customers who pay the school for beauty services provided by the unpaid students."}
