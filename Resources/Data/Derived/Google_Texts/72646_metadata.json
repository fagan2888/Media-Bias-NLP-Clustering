O\u2019Hara expressed confidence in Robert Malone\u2019s ability to right the troubled exchange\u2019s finances \u2014 if it\u2019s possible at all.\n\n\u201cIf this is doable,\u201d O\u2019Hara said, \u201che can make it happen.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on her qualifier by Republican state Sen. Beth Martinez Humenik, the chairwoman admitted that she\u2019s not sure of the exchange\u2019s viability.\n\n\u201cI have my doubts on good days,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. \u201cToday is not one of my good days.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara walked back her comments after the meeting in a letter to state lawmakers, saying she wanted to \u201cadd to\u201d her response.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about this candidate\u2019s business experience and his qualifications for meeting challenges currently facing Connect for Health Colorado, and my remarks may have left open to question my view as to whether those issues can be properly addressed,\u201d O\u2019Hara wrote. \u201cI want to assure the committee members that we are bringing forward a finalist whose experience, talent and intelligence are a match to the challenges we face and who possesses the skills needed to help us deliver on our mission to increase healthcare access, affordability and choice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that a member of the Colorado exchange\u2019s board has questioned its ability to survive, however. A former board member, Ellen Daehnik, previously told 9 News that the state may need to \u201cbail out\u201d the Obamacare exchange.\n\nColorado\u2019s one of only 14 state-run Obamacare exchanges this year \u2014 and a number of them are facing similar financial problems. Initial grant funding from the federal government has run out and the exchanges are supposed to be self-sustaining, but many are struggling to find a viable source.\n\nLike other states and HealthCare.gov, the Colorado exchange currently taxes insurance plans monthly to fund its ongoing operations. While some states tax only health insurance plans sold on their Obamacare exchanges, however, Colorado taxes all insurance plans in the state.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Yet another state in trouble?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The board chair of Colorado's\u00a0Obamacare exchange said in off-the-cuff remarks Wednesday that the state-run operation may not be able to cut it financially.
