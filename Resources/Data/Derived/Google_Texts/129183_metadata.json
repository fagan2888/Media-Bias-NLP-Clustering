He said the man was about 5'10\" with facial hair and possibly in his 30s. He was wearing a tan jacket.\n\nThe burglar jumped into the driver's side of the Kia and began ramming the Ledford vehicle, which had him hemmed in. The Kia was finally able to get out by knocking over a brick wall and tearing up the garage door. Both vehicles had significant damage.\n\nMr. Ledford gave chase as the Kia went down N. Concord Road and struck another vehicle. The Kia continued on, and got away after apparently turning onto North Hickory Valley Road.\n\nThe victim said he could not see the tag of the Kia, but there was writing on the windshield.\n\nPolice said on the same day there was a burglary on Meadow Trace Lane in which a woman at the residence said the burglar was in a gold Kia with \"Frankenstein\" written on the windshield. She was able to get the tag number.\n\nIn that case, the man left after he could not get either the front door or the back door open.\n\nPolice said the Kia tag was registered to Andrea Seimer of Hickory Trace Lane, which is near Hickory Valley Road. A man at the Hickory Trace Lane address asked, \"You're not looking for Andrew, are you?\"\n\nHe said Andrew was his grandson and Andrea Seimer was his girlfriend. He said they drove a gold Kia with Frankenstein on the windshield.\n\nWhen police interviewed Ms. Seimer, she said her Kia was gone.\n\nGarren denied having the car or being involved in the burglary.\n\nMr. Ledford was shown a lineup and immediately picked Timothy Andrew Garren.\n\nIn 2011, Garren was charged in a $30,000 Brainerd burglary. He got a five-year suspended sentence.\n\nGarren, who was then living in Chickamauga, Ga., was charged with stealing the items from the James Hicks residence on Marlboro Avenue in Brainerd.\n\nPolice said some of the items taken in the burglary were sold at Rick Davis Gold on Brainerd Road. Store officials notified the owner that his items had been pawned.\n\nPolice sought to track down Kathleen Cole, who sold the items. She was found at her apartment on Vance Avenue along with Garren.\n\nShe said Garren was a former friend she had not seen in a long time until he came by asking her to sell some items for him. She got $2,200 cash for jewelry.\n\nPolice said they found the rest of the stolen items in bags belonging to Garren at the apartment.\n\nHe had $1,600 in $100 bills in his wallet, which police said came from the sale of the jewelry.\n\nOfficers also found a needle/syringe and a plastic baggie of oxycodone on a dresser.\n\nGarren was charged with aggravated burglary, theft of property over $10,000 and possession of a controlled substance in that case.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/2/18/294332/Garren-Charged-In-Break-In-In-Which.aspx", "article": {"section": "Breaking News", "published_time": "2015-02-18T12:33:45.1287827Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T04:48:44.8617830Z"}, "type": "article", "title": "Garren Charged In Break-In In Which Burglar's Car Was Trapped By Homeowner"}}, "article_summary": "Wednesday, February 18, 2015Timothy Andrew Garren has been charged in a Feb. 3 break-in in which the burglar's car was trapped by the homeowner, who arrived back home after a brief errand.\nGarren was charged with aggravated burglary, theft of property over $10,000 and possession of a controlled substance in that case.\nHe said his garage door was open and a gold Kia was backed into the garage.\nHe said they drove a gold Kia with Frankenstein on the windshield.\nMr. Ledford was shown a lineup and immediately picked Timothy Andrew Garren."}
