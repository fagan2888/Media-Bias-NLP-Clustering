Goulet brings over 30 years of experience leading large payer organizations, most recently as president of Anthem Inc.'s Commercial and Specialty business where he provided leadership for the company's 14 Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.

A managed care veteran with deep experience in the healthcare system's transition from fee-for-service to value-based care, Goulet developed and executed Anthem Inc.'s Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation strategy and successfully positioned the company as the largest and most profitable insurance exchange health plan in the country. Before joining Anthem Inc., Goulet spent over two decades at Cigna Corporation in various management, sales and operations positions.

"Quality home health care delivery models are a much-needed solution to today's healthcare system cost and access challenges. I'm honored to join the CareCentrix team as part of the solution," said Goulet.
