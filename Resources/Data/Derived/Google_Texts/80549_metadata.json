It stopped in Wichita on Saturday.\n\nThe event originally had 1000 tickets available, but they sold out so an additional 1000 tickets were added. All 2000 tickets sold out days in advance of the event.\n\n\"I think it is great. I saw it advertised a long time ago, so I was excited because I love water parks and I thought this was the next best thing to having a water park,\" said Jody Klien, who's family attended the slide, \"I think it is great that Wichita has an opportunity to come together and have a block party and I just think it is awesome when you have something like this in Wichita.\"\n\nThere were some issues with the slide. The terrain in Wichita is mostly flat, which did not help sliders move fast.\n\nMany of the participants were pushed at some point along the slide by volunteer staff.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The nearly 1/4-mile long slip-and-slide was only part of the celebrations in Wichita.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "The nearly 1/4-mile long slip-and-slide was only part of the celebrations in Wichita.", "title": "Slide the City big hit in downtown Wichita", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Slide-The-City-big-hit-in-downtown-Wichita-311648651.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/917/B00/917B00D801A546ACAFD9FBC7F601B1F1", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/00E/A9B/00EA9B853BD848BAABBB05D45D34B87E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The nearly 1/4-mile long slip-and-slide was only part of the celebrations in Wichita.", "title": "Slide the City big hit in downtown Wichita", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Slide-The-City-big-hit-in-downtown-Wichita-311648651.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_04802.JPG", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Slide the City big hit in downtown Wichita", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Slide the City big hit"}, "article_summary": "Slide the City is a 1000-foot-long slip and slide that travels from city to city.\nThe event originally had 1000 tickets available, but they sold out so an additional 1000 tickets were added.\nMore Video...Thousands attended Slide The City to celebrate the Fourth of July.\nAll 2000 tickets sold out days in advance of the event.\nMany of the participants were pushed at some point along the slide by volunteer staff."}
