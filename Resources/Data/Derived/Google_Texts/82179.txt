SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Baseball talk and breakfast on opening day. And a chance to chat with “Spilly” and “Sully.” Not a bad way to start off the Rockies’ 2014 home season.

So here is an invitation to join myself, Troy Renck and a cast of thousands (slight exaggeration) to discuss the Rockies and the MLB scene.

Former Rockies outfielders Ryan Spilborghs and Cory Sullivan — making their debuts this season as analysts for Roots Sports — will also be there.

The event takes place on Friday, April 4 from 8-10 a.m. at the Wynkoop Brewing Company, 1634 18th Street, in the heart of LoDo.

Here’s more info from our official invite:

Join members of The Denver Post’s sports department for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look and discussion about the Colorado Rockies — and some opening-day eats as well! The Post is joining with the Wynkoop Brewery to offer a breakfast discussion on the Rockies season, the outlook for the 2014 MLB season, or anything else you might want to discuss. Meet writers and editors and be the backdrop for “The Press Box,” a joint radio/online program produced by The Denver Post and Mile High Sports!

Here is an online invitation to the event if you’re interested.
