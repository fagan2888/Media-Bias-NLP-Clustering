There are many perks to working for a Silicon Valley tech firm. In this competitive field, retaining skilled workers can be a challenge, leading companies to offer everything from free meals to game rooms and gym memberships. But in recent releases, Apple and Facebook announced theyâ€™re offering a new plus to female workers: free egg freezing. In hopes of keeping experienced female employees on the job longer, these two tech giants will be picking up the tab (up to $10,000) for women hoping to maintain a successful career and still have a family. Facebook will even offer an additional $10,000 for workers who plan on using a surrogate.

Could egg freezing become the new norm in fast-paced workplaces? Does this put excess pressure on women to stay competitive? Would you take advantage of this perk if it was offered by your employer?
