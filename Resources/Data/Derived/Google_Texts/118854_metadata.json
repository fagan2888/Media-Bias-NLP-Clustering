But with the once-triumphant Muslim Brotherhood now banned from public life and a new military-backed government suppressing public expression, analysts and activists say the next legislature is likely to be a rubber-stamp body that further solidifies the power of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.\n\nPolitical parties \u2014 those that are eligible to run \u2014 are weak with little popular following. They are hurt even more by the law governing how the election will be run. And there is a general atmosphere against any politician raising criticism, with many Egyptians seeking stability after nearly four years of turmoil that has devastated the economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s hostility to the idea of a politically active society in general. All forms of political collective action have been either made illegal or have been simply dubbed unpatriotic,\u201d said Ziad Akl, an analyst at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.\n\nAll the country\u2019s media, he said, demonizes the idea of opposition \u201cas a form of disunity.\u201d\n\nA date for elections has not been set after repeated delays, though the Presidency on Monday said they would be in the first quarter of next year. Egypt\u2019s government on Wednesday is discussing a political districting law, which is needed for preparations to start.\n\nThe vote will mark the final step in what was billed as a transition to democracy, but what critics see as the rapid retrenchment of authoritarian rule less than four years after President Hosni Mubarak was toppled by a pro-democracy uprising.\n\nThe 2011 election saw candidates from across the political spectrum, from ultra-conservative Islamists to leftwing youths, vying for seats. Egyptians stood in line for hours to cast their votes \u2014 many for the first time in their lives \u2014 and the Muslim Brotherhood won the legislature\u2019s largest bloc.\n\nThis time around, the Brotherhood is banned as a terrorist group \u2014 a designation it denies \u2014 and many of its top leaders are in jail. A new law that requires prior permits for demonstrations has all but crushed street politics and civil society fears increasing restrictions.\n\nThe restrictions prompted the Carter Center \u2014 an international democracy promotion group led by former President Jimmy Carter \u2014 to close its Cairo office, saying the upcoming vote is \u201cunlikely to advance a genuine democratic transition.\u201d\n\nEgypt has not had a parliament since a court decision dissolved the legislating lower house in 2012 on a technicality, just days before the Brotherhood\u2019s candidate, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president.\n\nAfter massive protests against his yearlong presidency, Morsi was ousted by el-Sissi, then military chief, who vowed to right Egypt\u2019s troubled democratic transition. Since then, authorities have cracked down on Morsi\u2019s supporters, killing hundreds in street clashes and arresting nearly 20,000 people. The wave of arrests has also netted non-Islamist activists who were at the forefront of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak.\n\nSince el-Sissi was elected in May in a vote boycotted by the Brotherhood, he has passed laws by executive decree, while solidifying his influence over state institutions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubber-stamp assembly expected from Egypt vote", "title": "Rubber-stamp assembly expected from Egypt vote", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rubber-stamp assembly expected from Egypt vote", "title": "Rubber-stamp assembly expected from Egypt vote", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/12/rubber_stamp_assembly_expected_from_egypt_vote/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/mideast-egypt-election-ennui.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubber-stamp assembly expected from Egypt vote", "title": "Rubber-stamp assembly expected from Egypt vote", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/mideast-egypt-election-ennui.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Merrit Kennedy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe215b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsCAIRO (AP) \u2014 Egypt is gearing up for parliamentary elections, the second since the 2011 uprising.\nThe wave of arrests has also netted non-Islamist activists who were at the forefront of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak.\nEgypt\u2019s government on Wednesday is discussing a political districting law, which is needed for preparations to start.\nSince el-Sissi was elected in May in a vote boycotted by the Brotherhood, he has passed laws by executive decree, while solidifying his influence over state institutions.\nA new law that requires prior permits for demonstrations has all but crushed street politics and civil society fears increasing restrictions."}
