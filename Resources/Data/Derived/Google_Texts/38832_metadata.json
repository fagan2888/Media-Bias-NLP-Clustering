We want to hear from you.\n\nKPCC health care Correspondent Stephanie O\u2019Neill reports that a consumer group has filed a class action lawsuit accusing Anthem Blue Cross of fraud and unfair business practices, \"allegedly intended to lure customers into buying its health insurance plans.\"\n\nThe details\n\nO\u2019Neill writes:\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Consumer Watchdog and Anthem customers, accuses the insurer of \"deceptive 'bait and switch' misrepresentations,\" among other things. (Another consumer's lawsuit filed in June makes similar accusations.)\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Anthem:\n\nMisrepresented to consumers that their physicians and hospitals were participating in Anthem health service plans;\n\nMisrepresented Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO) health service plans, with no out-of-network coverage and benefits, as Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) health service plans, which provide out-of-network coverage and benefits;\n\nOffered inadequate networks of physicians and hospitals, delaying and interrupting care;\n\nDelayed customers' enrollment in new health service plans for months, effectively blocking access to physician and hospital services;\n\nSubjected consumers to exceedingly long wait times, regularly lasting several hours, on customer service telephone lines.\n\nOne patient's story\n\nDoes any of that sound familiar to you? It does to Patricia Griffin, a retired Orange County lawyer and plaintiff in the case.\n\nGriffin says Anthem sent her several letters, informing her that her existing PPO plan would be cancelled by March 31 \u2013 the end of open enrollment \u2013 and that she needed to move to a plan compliant with the Affordable Care Act by April 1.\n\nShe says that Anthem offered her a new plan, and she called the company several times to confirm that it was a PPO, and that it covered her doctors, including her cardiologist and other specialists.\n\n\"I told them what doctors I treated with, they had my computer screen up, they knew my history,\" she says. \"They assured me I was getting into a PPO. They sent me a card that said I was in a PPO.\"\n\nBut when she fell and hurt her knee and went in for her surgical pre-op appointment, she was told she'd have to pay out of pocket because her surgeon was no longer in the network. She says she later discovered her plan wasn't a PPO, but was actually a limited EPO that would not cover any treatment except from those doctors who were listed as participants in her area.\n\nNone of her doctors, Griffin says, are included in the company's Orange County plan, which, she says, costs her $917 a month \"to be basically uninsured.\"\n\nInsurer responds\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, an Anthem Blue Cross spokesman provided this statement to KPCC:\n\n\"Anthem Blue Cross continually works to improve the accuracy of our provider directory. In the process of updating our provider database earlier in the year, we found that while the vast majority of the listings were correct, there were some providers inadvertently listed. Many of the doctors inadvertently listed decided to join Anthem's network for individual members. Overall, Anthem has added more than 3,800 doctors to our statewide exchange network since Jan. 1. 2014.\" \"Members having an issue finding a provider should call the customer service number on the back of their ID card, and our customer service team will assist in finding an available provider.\"\n\nWidespread concerns?\n\nState health regulators are investigating whether Anthem -- and Blue Shield of California -- violated state law by publishing inaccurate provider lists and failing to offer timely access to treatment.\n\nWe really want to hear from you.
