(AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Marathon didn\u2019t even wait for the sun to rise.\n\nWith a hot day expected, the women\u2019s race started at 6:45 a.m. local time and the men\u2019s race 10 minutes later. Hours later, Kenyan runners Daniel Limo and Ogla Kimaiyo won the races, while Jared Ward and Blake Russell captured the USA Track & Field National Championships that were run concurrently.\n\nLimo fell behind countryman Edwin Koech around mile 20 but caught him two miles later and won going away in 2 hours, 10 minutes, 36 seconds to claim the $25,000 first prize. Lani Rutto of Kenya also caught Koech and finished second for the second straight year, this time in 2:12:43. Koech finished fourth.\n\nWard took the lead in Mile 16 and never faltered, finishing third overall in a personal best 2:12:56, bringing a $150,000 first prize. Matt Llano was second (sixth overall) in 2:16:13 and Mike Morgan was third in 2:16:55.\n\nKimaiyo led the women\u2019s race from Mile 19 onward, leaving Russian Natalya Puchkova in Mile 23 and winning in 2:34:10. Puchkova was second in 2:34:33 and Russell was third overall in 2:34:57.\n\nThe race began in 71-degree heat at Dodger Stadium and finished in 75-degree temperatures near the Santa Monica Pier. But in between, the runners said, they felt the heat, which crept into the 80s as the race wound through Hollywood, West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.\n\n\u201cAt eight (kilometers), there was still a lot of humidity,\u201d Rutto said. \u201cI tried to resist my best, but I not make it. I want to say it was tough.\u201d\n\nThe race caused several runners to change strategy. Ward said he felt dehydrated at the 20-mile mark, \u201cbut at that point, you trust the fitness.\u201d Kimaiyo carried a bottle of fluids the final 3.1 miles, adding her legs hurt. Russell suffered cramped hamstrings around Mile 11.\n\nThe race also served as a qualifier for next February\u2019s Olympic trials, also in Los Angeles. All American male runners who finished at least 2:18 qualified, as did all women who finished in at least 2:43.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kenyans Daniel Limo, Ogla Kimaiyo win Los Angeles Marathon", "title": "Kenyans Daniel Limo, Ogla Kimaiyo win Los Angeles Marathon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Kenyans Daniel Limo, Ogla Kimaiyo win Los Angeles Marathon", "title": "Kenyans Daniel Limo, Ogla Kimaiyo win Los Angeles Marathon", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/15/kenyans_daniel_limo_ogla_kimaiyo_win_los_angeles_marathon/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/los-angeles-marathon.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kenyans Daniel Limo, Ogla Kimaiyo win Los Angeles Marathon", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/los-angeles-marathon.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Kenyans Daniel Limo, Ogla Kimaiyo win Los Angeles Marathon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lani Rutto of Kenya also caught Koech and finished second for the second straight year, this time in 2:12:43.\nKoech finished fourth.\nHours later, Kenyan runners Daniel Limo and Ogla Kimaiyo won the races, while Jared Ward and Blake Russell captured the USA Track & Field National Championships that were run concurrently.\nKimaiyo led the women\u2019s race from Mile 19 onward, leaving Russian Natalya Puchkova in Mile 23 and winning in 2:34:10.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsSANTA MONICA, Calif.
