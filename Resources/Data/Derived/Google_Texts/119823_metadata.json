I feel there are as many questions as exclamation points surrounding the Broncos. I\u2019ve had a hard time buying John Elway\u2019s mantra of Super Bowl or bust when it took a rash of injuries for C.J. Anderson to supplant Ronnie Hillman at running back. Can coach John Fox prepare his team to play well under the immense pressure of a big game? Can offensive coordinator Adam Gase and Peyton Manning seamlessly switch gears between the passing and running games, depending on the situation? With all these questions, is it reasonable for Broncos Country to expect a championship this year? I\u2019ve decided to temper my expectations, sit back and enjoy the ride. There were doubts in 1997 after the Broncos stumbled down the stretch and the rest, as they say, ended up being history!\n\nWaylon, Marshall, Mo.\n\nKiz: With seats for the Colts game listed online Saturday for as little as $98, it seems Broncos Country isn\u2019t entirely bullish on a Super Bowl run. But I seem to recall some knucklehead columnist late in the \u201997 NFL season lamenting the fact Elway would never win a Super Bowl ring.\n\nManning must step up. The playoff game between the Broncos and Colts will be the usual show between an up-and-coming, talented quarterback and the established veteran on his way out. Manning will have to dig deep and muster some quality play in his last days on the stage. Andrew Luck is the real deal and has a lot of things in his favor.\n\nLarry, representing the 303\n\nKiz: Last days on the stage? Here\u2019s hoping Manning has to lead a late TD drive to beat Luck. A tense situation for Broncos Country? Yes. But wouldn\u2019t it be great drama to see how much the old QB has left in him?\n\nOnly one Thomas needed. This time you\u2019ve gone too far, Kiz. Apparently you haven\u2019t seen the last few Broncos games without the \u201cgreat\u201d Julius Thomas. Or maybe you didn\u2019t see Virgil Green. The Broncos are far better off with a tight end who can block. Let Julius go. The only Thomas we need is Demaryius.\n\nBill, carries hammer 24/7\n\nKiz: OK, we here at Kickin\u2019 It Headquarters readily concede the worth of Green to a new-found emphasis on Denver\u2019s running attack. But riddle me this: If the Broncos trail 21-17 with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter of any playoff game, on which tight end will Manning rely? The grunt that can deliver the big block? Or the tight end who caught 12 TD passes in little more than half a season of good health?\n\nTimofey believer. And today\u2019s parting shot is aimed at anybody who doubts former Nuggets center Timofey Mozgov is bound for NBA stardom.\n\nYou watch you clueless (idiot), Kiz. Timofey Mozgov will be a star in Cleveland, because he finally has a coach who knows his game and believes in him. Mozgov will play 35 minutes per game, score 18-plus and grab 12 rebounds per game.\n\nV.K., in Mozgov he trusts", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Questions abound in Broncos Country", "title": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Questions abound in Broncos Country", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/10/kickin-it-with-kiz-questions-abound-in-broncos-country/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150108_021649_broncos-defense.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150108_021649_broncos-defense.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-10T17:49:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:15:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3967\"", "article_summary": "Or the tight end who caught 12 TD passes in little more than half a season of good health?\nWith all these questions, is it reasonable for Broncos Country to expect a championship this year?\nThe Broncos are far better off with a tight end who can block.\nKiz: With seats for the Colts game listed online Saturday for as little as $98, it seems Broncos Country isn\u2019t entirely bullish on a Super Bowl run.\nBut riddle me this: If the Broncos trail 21-17 with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter of any playoff game, on which tight end will Manning rely?"}
