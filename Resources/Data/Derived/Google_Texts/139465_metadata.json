He elaborated on the immediate success of October\u2019s merger and reminded attendees of his hopeful outlook about healthcare reform\u2019s impact on the hospital industry.\n\nBefore acquiring Vanguard, Tenet\u2019s properties were hardly concentrated, Fetter said. The company had two out of three hospitals in a pair of California markets\u2014Palm Springs and San Luis Obispo\u2014and a 50 percent market share in El Paso. The company\u2019s other locations dotted the U.S. map. Vanguard, meanwhile, employed a different strategy: Concentration in attractive urban markets, namely San Antonio, Phoenix, and Detroit.\n\n\u201cIt literally doubled our revenues in the state of Texas and took Texas to the No. 1 position in terms of our largest state market for Tenet,\u201d Fetter said of the merger. \u201cIt took California and Florida, which historically have been No. 1 and No. 2 for Tenet, and made them No. 2 and No. 3 and put Michigan in the mix in almost a similar range of size to California.\u201d\n\nFetter said Tenet has seen a 3.3 percent increase in outpatient services in the last quarter of 2013 and a 2.3 percent decrease in inpatient services.\n\nAnd remember, Fetter embraced the Affordable Care Act early, speaking on its behalf on CNBC, Bloomberg TV, and other cable outlets. Now, he says, 97 percent of the company\u2019s hospitals are in network with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s silver plans.\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s where action is,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should lead to market share capture.\u201d\n\nWhen talking about Obamacare, Fetter stuck to those sorts of phrases: \u201cWe think;\u201d \u201cthat should.\u201d He then passed the question to Chief Financial Officer Dan Cancelmi, who had a more defined standing on the impact of reform.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing some visible signs of progress, particularly in California, which probably doesn\u2019t surprise anyone,\u201d Cancelmi said. \u201cThe state of California got in front of this more so than any other state.\u201d\n\nUnlike Texas and 35 other states, the California Legislature voted in June to expand Medicaid to 1.4 million low-income residents. It also maintains a state-run insurance marketplace\u2014unlike Texas, which opted out from creating its own exchange. To Tenet, California is a model for the country; it expects more states to begin expanding Medicaid.\n\nIn 2012 in Modesto, Tenet set up an affordable care organization, which is a government-led program that pays providers depending on how effective it is at preventing health problems among its customers. Tenet says enrollment in that program has jumped 20 percent compared to this point last year.\n\n\u201cI think as it becomes more ingrained and people become more comfortable with the enrollment process, other states will expand their Medicaid program as we move into 2015,\u201d Fetter said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see continued growth in providers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Five months after closing on a merger with Nashville-based Vanguard Health Systems, the CEO of Tenet Healthcare Corp. says the move has already doubled revenue at its Texas hospitals and he anticipates the company's open-armed strategy toward Obamacare will capture even more market share.
