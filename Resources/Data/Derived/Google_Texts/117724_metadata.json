Arguments were heard in October, but the case has been stayed since then pending Thursday\u2019s ruling in Washington.\n\nThe Attorney General's Office plans to ask the Court to schedule additional proceedings, in light of the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nAttorney General Greg Zoeller\u2019s statement on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana's lawsuit against the IRS argues that imposing the Affordable Care Act's employer-mandate tax penalties on government employers is a violation of intergovernmental tax immunity.", "pubdate": "2015-06-25", "author": "WFYI News", "og": {"site_name": "WFYI Public Media", "description": "Indiana's lawsuit against the IRS argues that imposing the Affordable Care Act's employer-mandate tax penalties on government employers is a violation of intergovernmental tax immunity.", "title": "Indiana's Affordable Care Act Lawsuit Against IRS Still Unresolved", "url": "http://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/indianas-affordable-care-act-lawsuit-against-irs-still-unresolved", "image": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/zoeller-statement.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The State's lawsuit contends that imposing the Affordable Care Act's employer-mandate tax penalties on government employers is a violation of intergovernmental tax immunity.", "creator": "@WFYINews", "image": {"src": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/zoeller-statement.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/zoeller-statement.jpg"}, "title": "Indiana's Affordable Care Act Lawsuit Against IRS Still Unresolved", "site": "@WFYINews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "WFYI", "date": "2015-06-25", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-25T00:00:00-04:00"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/medium/zoeller-statement.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb14\"", "article_summary": "The Attorney General's Office plans to ask the Court to schedule additional proceedings, in light of the Supreme Court ruling.\nIndiana Attorney General's Office via YouTube Indiana Attorney General's Office via YouTubeINDIANAPOLIS \u2013 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow IRS tax credits for insurance enrollees under the Affordable Care Act may shape the outcome of a lawsuit filed by the State of Indiana and 39 public school corporations against the IRS.\nIndiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said Thursday's Supreme Court decision on health insurance subsidies answers some, but not all, of the questions raised in a pending lawsuit filed the the State and 39 Hoosier school districts against the IRS.\nAttorney General Greg Zoeller\u2019s statement on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision:\nArguments were heard in October, but the case has been stayed since then pending Thursday\u2019s ruling in Washington."}
