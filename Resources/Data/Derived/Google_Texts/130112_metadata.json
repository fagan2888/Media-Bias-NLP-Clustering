He took an early retirement buyout from Hewlett-Packard after 32 years and started considering what\u2019s truly most important to him: the well-being of local children and the whole east county community.\n\nPinkernell quickly fell victim to the same hazard that snags many eager and good-hearted volunteers: The board he\u2019d gotten onto started looking for a new president, and Pinkernell\u2019s hand was the only one that went up.\n\nThat board guides the Camas-Washougal Community Chest, an umbrella charity that does a lot with too little, said its now-President Pinkernell. The homegrown nonprofit agency\u2019s mission is to fund grant requests from other nonprofits in Camas and Washougal, and Pinkernell is determined to raise its profile and its income, so it can increase the amount it distributes in grants every year.\n\nThe Community Chest this month announced 15 grants to 14 local organizations totalling just over $69,000. Those grants are estimated to ultimately touch as many as 15,000 people. But $69,000 is a big decline over previous years. In 2014, the Community Chest distributed nearly $83,000 in grants. Pinkernell said he\u2019s not exactly sure why individual and corporate charitable donations in east county have slumped even while the economy is improving. East county\u2019s need for charity certainly keeps growing regardless, he said.\n\nThe combined population of Camas and Washougal is approximately 36,000, according to the state of Washington, and according to the U.S. Census Bureau, just under 12 percent of Washougal\u2019s population and exactly 6 percent of Camas\u2019 population live below the poverty line. Those figures don\u2019t include the nearby populations outside those cities\u2019 boundaries. According to the Office of Public Instruction, 21 percent of students in the Camas school district and 40 percent in the Washougal school district qualify for free or reduced-price school lunches.\n\n\u201cThe economy may be growing, but there is a lot of hidden need in Camas and Washougal,\u201d Pinkernell said. \u201cWe\u2019re a little alarmed that we fell short this year.\u201d\n\n\u2018This place is awesome\u2019\n\nCamas has enjoyed a huge technology manufacturing boom in recent decades, and Washougal has limped along after it \u2014 but if you\u2019re not a high-tech professional, \u201cthere\u2019s just so little out here\u201d in terms of employment and affordable housing, said longtime resident Jessica Tuttle.\n\n\u201cI have looked really hard, and there\u2019s nothing,\u201d said Tuttle. She lives with her grandparents and four children \u2014 and without a car \u2014 up on what she calls \u201cMotocross Mountain,\u201d north of town.\n\nOn a recent Monday, though, Tuttle and a church friend came down to the Children\u2019s Home Society\u2019s East County Family Resource Center on C Street in Washougal to help organize a basement full of donated food, clothing, housewares and baby supplies that came from a local school\u2019s Stuff the Bus effort. Tuttle said she has appreciated the center\u2019s food and maternity support in the past, and she\u2019s happy to help out now. \u201cThis place is awesome,\u201d she said.\n\nSuch awesomeness is why the Resource Center and the Interfaith Treasure House are the Community Chest\u2019s major beneficiaries by far. \u201cBiggest bang for our buck\u201d is the phrase that keeps coming up as Pinkernell describes these multifaceted social safety-net agencies, which leverage massive amounts of volunteer labor as well as the personal connections that remain crucial in a corner of the county that\u2019s growing but still markedly close-knit.\n\n\u201cThis is how we operate,\u201d Family Resource Center coordinator Renee Law said admiringly while her basement volunteers attacked the pile.\n\nIn fact, the Community Chest broke with one generally accepted principle of charitable giving to bump up Law\u2019s hours at the office in 2014 \u2014 so that she could put to full-time use the expertise she\u2019s developed across seven years of working there part-time. Grantors don\u2019t usually want to pay for ongoing operating expenses and salaries, but Law proved too valuable not to have there full time, Pinkernell said.\n\n\u201cRenee is our community expert,\u201d said Pinkernell. \u201cShe is the expert on plugging into different agencies.\u201d Since then, the Children\u2019s Home Society has taken on the financial responsibility for Law\u2019s position, and the 2015 Community Chest grant will pay instead to continue her training and skills development.\n\nForty hours a week of Law means vastly more opportunities for clients to make connections. Numerous social service agencies based in Vancouver \u2014 Columbia River Mental Health, Community Services NW, WIC, Sea Mar Community Health Centers \u2014 have set up regular offices or regular hours at the East County Family Resource Center recently, she said.\n\n\u201cAll these services are combined in our one building,\u201d Law said. \u201cWe promote our services and theirs, too. They refer to us, we refer to them. We\u2019re trying to find all the local services and bring them together here.\u201d\n\nA computer and phone in the lobby of the building have turned out to be a godsend for many, she added. Visitors regularly use them to hunt for benefits, medical care and jobs; there\u2019s one college student who does her homework there while her children play. Having one consistent and friendly face there helps, Pinkernell said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard at first, but people get comfortable,\u201d Law said. \u201cSometimes, they just come in and say, \u2018I need help. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019 No matter what it is, we\u2019ll help them. We\u2019ll find the resources people need.\u201d\n\nSeven years ago, when Law started here as a part-timer, she said, the place used to give away 40 emergency food bags per month. Now, she said, it distributes that much food in two days. Overall, according to a report covering six months of 2014, the East County Family Resource Center distributed 537 weekend food backpacks to local children, as well as 1,632 emergency food bags, logged 187 volunteer hours and actively served 384 families each month.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the need go down,\u201d Law said. \u201cI just see it go up and up.\u201d\n\nHelp for runaways\n\nPinkernell said he has been astonished to learn about the level of need in east county. He mentioned that a Vancouver youth shelter operated by Janus Youth Programs and supported by the Community Chest boasts a full nightly complement on its 100 bed nights per year of east county runaways escaping family violence, homelessness and other painful problems. Janus has the expertise to figure out how to help those kids \u2014 What\u2019s their next step? Can they return home? Is there any home to return to? Or is it too dangerous? \u2014 while sheltering them for a few days, Pinkernell said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the emergency room for them. There\u2019s a reason why they ran away \u2014 they are in crisis situations,\u201d he said. A short stretch of help and stability can make a world of difference, Pinkernell said, for a kid who might otherwise tip into a life on the streets and never return.\n\nOther Community Chest beneficiaries go beyond lifesaving essentials and into enrichment. A grant to the Friends of the Camas Library will support summer reading for kids and teens; a grant to TOPSoccer, which brings soccer to kids with disabilities, will provide the same souvenirs \u2014 trophies and T-shirts \u2014 that other soccer-playing kids get.\n\nPinkernell has a particular soft spot in his heart for the Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership, which has hosted thousands of student visits and service trips to the Steigerwald National Wildlife Refuge, and for Friends of the Columbia River Gorge, which brings an outdoor education program to sixth graders at Jemtegaard and Canyon Creek middle schools.\n\n\u201cThe kids get to experience what they never might have otherwise \u2014 touching, handling, working with the natural world,\u201d Pinkernell said. \u201cWe have always had natural resources as one of our goals. The kids learn they are not just stewards of the refuge but of our whole town.\n\n\u201cThe conditions are always miserable, they\u2019re always covered in rain and mud. And they love it. You can see it in their eyes.\u201d\n\nThen and now\n\nAccording to a history by board member LaDene Mattson, the roots of the Camas-Washougal Community Chest are in the service clubs and community projects that helped on the home front during World War II. When troops started coming home, both the infrastructure and the spirit were still in place, ready to help make east county a better place to live, Mattson wrote.\n\nYouth activities and recreation were uppermost on the minds of early organizers J.D. Currie and Doc Harris, now the namesakes, respectively, of the camp at the north end of Lacamas Lake and the Doc Harris Stadium that the Camas High School Papermakers call home. Currie and Harris worked closely with Camas educator and coach Fred Howe; Howe\u2019s son, Bob, a retired educator and current member of the Community Chest board, said he recalls his dad\u2019s dining room meetings with Currie and Harris as they \u201csat around discussing what the needs were and what the paper mill might provide. My parents were very much interested in social services and equity issues in town.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Howe added, the wealthy and the poor \u201cweren\u2019t as separated as we are now.\u201d And these two towns were sufficiently small so everybody really did know everybody, he said \u2014 and everybody knew that the local paper mill, then owned by Crown Zellerbach, was the whole area\u2019s anchor.\n\n\u201cThere were many close relationships and Crown Zellerbach was involved in everything,\u201d Howe said.\n\nThe paper mill, now Georgia-Pacific, remains the Community Chest\u2019s biggest supporter, Howe said, but \u201cit\u2019s smaller now. It doesn\u2019t have quite the same role it used to have.\u201d The employees themselves do a yeoman\u2019s job of donating, he added, but the Community Chest must work nonetheless to broaden its outreach.\n\n\u201cWe need to expand, and I\u2019m finding it a little hard to get your foot in the door\u201d of local corporations that might be willing to host in-house \u201cFriends of the Community Chest\u201d teams, Pinkernell said. Right now, about a dozen east county companies host these special corporate go-betweens \u2014 but there need to be many more, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople are responsive and generous when they learn about us. \u2018I just didn\u2019t know\u2019 is what we hear all the time. We don\u2019t spend any money on direct advertising, though we\u2019re trying to use social media more,\u201d Pinkernell said.\n\nThere\u2019s been intense discussion on the board about growing into something resembling the Community Foundation of Southwest Washington, based in Vancouver, which doles out millions every year to local charities and programs via managed investments.\n\nThe Community Chest has taken its first baby step in that direction, Pinkernell noted, with a bequest of $65,000 from The Glen and Katherine Sinclair Estate of Camas. \u201cI am investing it conservatively. It\u2019s a tiny little endowment but it is the very beginning of a foundation like the Community Foundation.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a hallmark of this board, he added. \u201cIt is not a board of deep-pocketed individuals. It\u2019s a board of volunteers who have passion and connections and skills. I enjoy investing.\u201d\n\nA world away\n\nBack in Bob Howe\u2019s dad\u2019s day, there were swimming pools and community clubs in Vancouver and Portland but nothing in east county. If you had the means, you could go enjoy the fun. If you didn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t. Access to recreation was, and is, just as much a \u201cfundamental equity issue\u201d as access to food and shelter and income, he said.\n\nFor too many, east county remains unequal just because of where and what it is.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like a long way, but it takes two buses with a 40-minute wait in between to get out to DSHS\u201d in Vancouver, said Brian Simms, who grew up in Washougal and truly loves the place. But his hunt for both work and affordable housing in east county has been depressing, he said.\n\n\u201cAll that housing they built up on the hill, that\u2019s high-end stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rent is astronomical.\u201d So Simms is doubled up with others, he said. \u201d \u2018Couch surfing\u2019 isn\u2019t as much fun as it sounds,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was at the East County Family Resource Center on a recent Monday morning to pick up a bus pass and an emergency food bag. He grumbled that he could ride his bike to his destination in Vancouver quicker than the bus would get him there.\n\n\u201cTransportation is a big issue for a lot of our clients,\u201d said Law. \u201cIt is hard for folks to reach services in Vancouver. People love being able to come here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "WASHOUGAL -- There must be more to life than designing printers, Dave Pinkernell decided.
