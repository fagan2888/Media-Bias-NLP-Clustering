Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) argued Friday that the U.S. is the only country pushing the \u201cBig Pharma\u201d agenda in the ongoing talks for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is the U.S. representatives that have sided over and over again with the big pharmaceutical companies, in the face of opposition from other TPP countries,\u201d DeLauro told reporters.\n\n\u201cHaving looked at the document, it really is just filled with parentheses with the names of countries objecting to the US position,\u201d Schakowsky added.\n\nBoth members were among the 144 House Democrats who almost derailed Obama\u2019s attempt to fast-track the deal last month. The effort was ultimately rescued by the Senate, giving the White House authority to negotiate a deal that will then receive an up-or-down approval from Congress.\n\nWhile members have been able to read the text of the deal, they must do so in a secured, soundproof room in the Capitol. They cannot take notes, they cannot bring staff, and are \u201csworn to silence,\u201d Schakowsky said.\n\nDespite the tight security, a draft of the deal was recently leaked to Politico that unveiled new protections for pharmaceutical companies \u2014 making it possible for the lawmakers to voice their concerns publicly.\n\nThe White House has stressed that the document is a draft and is subject to change during the discussions.\n\n\u201cWe can see some of the stuff, but we can\u2019t talk about it, but we can make references to the leaked text,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the leaked chapter, and that confirms some of the worst fears as healthcare advocates.\u201d\n\nAccording to the leaked text, the deal would make it far tougher for cheaper generic drugs to enter the market.\n\nPatent holders would be allowed to keep their research data private for more time, and would be given more legal power to fight off generics they claim are infringing upon their intellectual property.\n\nThose provisions, among others, have come under heavy attack from groups such as the AARP, Doctors Without Borders and amfAR, the global HIV/AIDS group.\n\nRohit Malpani, a policy director for Doctors Without Borders, warned Friday that the deal \u201cwill dramatically restrict medicines for patients around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has the potential to become the most harmful trade agreement ever,\u201d Malpani added.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "According to leaked text, the deal would make it tough for generic drugs to enter the market.", "description": "According to leaked text, the deal would make it tough for generic drugs to enter the market.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "According to leaked text, the deal would make it tough for generic drugs to enter the market.", "title": "House Dems: White House pushing Big Pharma agenda in trade deal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/248322-house-dems-white-house-is-pushing-big-pharma-agenda-in-trade-deal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/pharmacy03312015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/248322-house-dems-white-house-is-pushing-big-pharma-agenda-in-trade-deal", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-17T12:05-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T12:05:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/248322-house-dems-white-house-is-pushing-big-pharma-agenda-in-trade-deal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "According to leaked text, the deal would make it tough for generic drugs to enter the market.", "card": "summary", "title": "House Dems: White House pushing Big Pharma agenda in trade deal"}, "dcterms.title": "House Dems: White House pushing Big Pharma agenda in trade deal"}, "article_summary": "The White House has stressed that the document is a draft and is subject to change during the discussions.\n\u201cWe can see some of the stuff, but we can\u2019t talk about it, but we can make references to the leaked text,\u201d DeLauro said.\nThe effort was ultimately rescued by the Senate, giving the White House authority to negotiate a deal that will then receive an up-or-down approval from Congress.\nReps.
