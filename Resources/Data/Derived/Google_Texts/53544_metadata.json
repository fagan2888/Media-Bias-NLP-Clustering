The rule of law in the United States of America is becoming as wishy-washy as it is in some of these Third World countries.\"I don't know of any other president in the history of the United States of America who has disregarded the constitutional structure more than this president. And, as a result, that is why these state attorneys general, including myself, are now pushing back.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "states,government,constitution,obamacare", "pubdate": "2014-01-06T15:40:13", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A letter written by 11 state attorneys general warning President Barack Obama that his numerous tweaks to the Affordable Care Act are illegal is just the beginning of a long legal battle to restore the backbone of the Constitution, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott says.", "title": "Texas AG Abbott: Legal War Against Obamacare Has Just Begun", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/states-government-constitution-obamacare/2014/01/06/id/545492/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/states-government-constitution-obamacare/2014/01/06/id/545492/", "title": "Texas AG Abbott: Legal War Against Obamacare Has Just Begun", "description": "A letter written by 11 state attorneys general warning President Barack Obama that his numerous tweaks to the Affordable Care Act are illegal is just the beginning of a long legal battle to restore the backbone of the Constitution, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott says.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1389022813, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "states,government,constitution,obamacare", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-01-06T15:40:13"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/states-government-constitution-obamacare/2014/01/06/id/545492/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A letter written by 11 state attorneys general warning President Barack Obama that his numerous tweaks to the Affordable Care Act are illegal is just the beginning of a long legal battle to restore the backbone of the Constitution, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott says."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc418\"", "article_summary": "And, as a result, that is why these state attorneys general, including myself, are now pushing back.\"\n\"I don't know of any other president in the history of the United States of America who has disregarded the constitutional structure more than this president.\nThe rule of law in the United States of America is becoming as wishy-washy as it is in some of these Third World countries.\nare incredibly frustrated by how the president keeps changing and altering the goal post and the Obamacare law.\nSee the \u201cSteve Malzberg Show\u201d on Newsmax TV each weekday live by clicking here now."}
