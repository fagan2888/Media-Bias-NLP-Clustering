The text contained only two words, but I\u2019ll never forget them: Not Guilty. At first, it didn\u2019t make sense to me. And then I slowly understood them. When the meaning finally hit me, my blood froze and I could barely breathe.\n\nMy son had just delivered the news that George Zimmerman, a white man who murdered an unarmed Black teenager named Trayvon Martin the previous winter, had been found not guilty by a jury of his peers. Part of me wished I\u2019d heard first and had told him about the verdict. But the fact that my son instinctively knew that I needed to hear this news directly from him proves that our ongoing conversations about this issue have penetrated that stubborn, wacky, teenaged brain of his.\n\nI\u2019m a single, Black mother with a son who\u2019s in that strange and exciting space between childhood and adulthood. But I know the deal. People won\u2019t look at him and see that he barely needs to shave and still leaves his underwear on the bathroom floor. They won\u2019t see that I sometimes have to remind him to brush his teeth and do his homework, and that he still has a curfew. Instead, people will take one look at his husky size, dreadlocks, and huge feet and see a man \u2026 a Black man. And for many, that\u2019s a very threatening image.\n\nMore from Dame: Is Failure the Secret to Success?\n\nAnyone raising a Black child in America has to have The Talk, especially if that child is male. I\u2019m not talking about the requisite birds and bees talk. I mean The Talk about how to survive being Black in this country.\n\nWe have to teach our children that not only do they have to follow the general rules of society, but they also have to abide by a special set of rules set up specifically for them because of their race. And we have to walk a thin line between teaching them how NOT to be killed by the people bound by law to protect them, and at the same time how to maintain their dignity and command the respect they deserve. It\u2019s a very delicate balance.\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly when I began having these talks with my son. I do know that it wasn\u2019t too long after he\u2019d seen a documentary on PBS about American slavery. I still remember his shocked expression when he turned from the TV and asked me, \u201cYou mean kids were slaves, too?\u201d He just couldn\u2019t fathom that people as young as him were subjected to such horrors. I believe that\u2019s the moment I realized that he was ready to learn even more about the reality of being Black in a nation founded on the notion of freedom and equality.\n\nMy son still believed in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy when I began to chip away at his innocence. Of course, I kept the conversations age-appropriate, but still, it\u2019s heartbreaking to know that in order to keep your child alive, you have to be the bearer of the harsh truths that will end their childhood way too soon. There\u2019s something inherently wrong with that.\n\nMore from Dame: You Can\u2019t Fight Rape With Nail Polish\n\nI remember reading a bedtime story to my son when he was still very young. I can\u2019t remember what books we were into back then, but one story involved the police. At the end of the chapter I\u2019d designated for that night, I remember cautioning my son about the police. He was confused: Aren\u2019t the police the good guys?
