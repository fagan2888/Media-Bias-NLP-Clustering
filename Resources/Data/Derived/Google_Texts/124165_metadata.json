No one is coming for your fireworks, unless your fireworks are illegal. But maybe they should.\n\nLook, I\u2019m an environmental reporter, and as such it is practically in my job description to be a killjoy. For this I am sorry. It\u2019s not like I won\u2019t personally be enjoying the fireworks over the East River \u2014 which at least can\u2019t get any more polluted than it already is \u2014 but I won\u2019t be able to do so without nagging self-admonishments about how fireworks are actually kind of stupid.\n\nThe (albeit dazzling, spectacular and wonderfully patriotic) shows cost a ton of money to produce, not to mention a ton of money in property damage (a total of $32 million in 2011); and they are, if not an environmental hazard, at least an environmental nuisance. There\u2019s got to be a less damaging way to celebrate the birth of our nation, right?\n\nNow, as is my professional duty, I pass these nagging thoughts on to you:\n\nThey\u2019re air pollutants\n\nDischarged from fireworks after they explode overhead are carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter \u2014 all those things that we characterize as \u201cair pollution\u201d and generally try to avoid breathing in. One recent study in China measured significantly high concentrations of PM2.5 \u2014 the particulate matter most dangerous to human health \u2014 linked to the fireworks-heavy New Year\u2019s celebrations. \u201cWe have found that air quality is seriously affected by this human activity and the effects are much greater than we previously thought,\u201d commented Wei Gong, the study\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cIt is time to alert the public to the negative effects of our cultural customs,\u201d he added\n\nIn China, of course, air quality is always a pressing issue, so adding any extra pollutants to the mix seems like a bad idea. This year, the China Meteorological Administration urged local governments to ban fireworks shows for the sake of public health. In the U.S., some counties are issuing health advisories for \u201csensitive groups,\u201d such as people with asthma or heart disease, due to the high levels of smoke.\n\nAnd that heavy smoke has the potential to cause more immediate consequences. In the U.K. last year, seven people died and 51 others were injured in a major pile-up blamed on dense firework smoke from a nearby rugby club. Manslaughter charges against the guy who set them off were ultimately dropped, but not until after a long, drawn-out trial that probably left him wishing he\u2019d stuck to a different form of celebration.\n\nThey pollute the ground, too\n\nAfter fireworks do their thing, their spent carcasses return to earth, where they remain until someone gets around to picking them up. The litter problem can get bad enough that some communities have considered banning fireworks to spare the tax dollars (or the \u201c16 hours of clean-up imposed on local non-profit groups\u201d) needed to deal with it.\n\nThey contain toxic chemicals\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing about fireworks: They get their brilliant colors via heavy metals like barium (green) and strontium (red). At least one study found that, thanks to those contaminants, it\u2019s really not a good idea to get so close to the smoke that you\u2019re inhaling it. They also contain perchlorate, a naturally occurring and man-made chemical (it\u2019s found in some bleach and fertilizer) that can act as a hormone disruptor if ingested \u2014 the EPA recently decided to regulate it under the Safe Water Drinking Act.\n\nThere\u2019s scant research on the fallout, but some studies have been able to link fireworks shows to increased concentrations of perchlorate and heavy metals on the surface of nearby water or, in the case of the latter study, snow. The question of whether that\u2019s doing enough to affect water quality or otherwise harm the environment is still up for debate: Andrew Jackson, a perchlorate expert at Texas Tech, pointed out to Salon that the health effects of perchlorate are chronic, not acute, \u201cso it would take long-term exposure for it to really be a problem\u201d \u2014 in other words, more than can be accomplished during a one-night celebration. Neal Langerman, with the American Chemical Society\u2019s Division of Chemical Health & Safety, said the same about heavy metals: He doesn\u2019t get too upset about the occasional show, he told Salon, because \u201cin the grand scheme of everything that gets washed down the storm drain, it just does not matter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're a threat to the environment and dangerous as hell.
