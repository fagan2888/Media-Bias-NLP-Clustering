Can\u2019t Americans learn to live together in our increasing diversity?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer looked much beyond the vociferous objections of the business community when she vetoed a law that would have permitted commercial enterprises to scorn gay and lesbian customers on the basis of their owners\u2019 professed religious convictions. It was a prudent veto, endorsed by the state\u2019s Republican establishment\u2014by Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, and even by several legislators who suddenly urged Brewer to block the very law they had just voted for. Marriott Hotels joined the opposition\u2014and so did a once and again member of its board named Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nIn fact, far more was at stake here than whether Apple would continue to build its new sapphire glass plant in Mesa or whether the next Super Bowl would be played as scheduled in Arizona. The dangers were real: The NFL had shifted the 1993 Super Bowl to the Rose Bowl when the state refused to observe the Martin Luther King Holiday. The reaction of the league, major corporations, and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce was commendable as well as understandable: Their position was good for business, and companies like Apple have been in the forefront of equal treatment for gay and lesbian employees.\n\nBut the Arizona bill represented something more\u2014the continuation of an overreaching campaign waged in the name of \u201creligious freedom\u201d that has profound implications for the future and fate of a pluralistic America. As E.J. Dionne observed in Commonweal, \u201cthe promiscuous resort to conscience objections\u201d threatens \u201cthe ongoing effort to balance robust protections for faith groups on the one hand with the need for laws of general application on the other.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s also exactly what\u2019s happened with the Catholic bishops\u2019 misguided assault on Obamacare. As applied, the new health law lets entities like the New York Archdiocese deny contraceptive coverage to employees, who are all but entirely Catholic. And in a finely tuned compromise, other church-affiliated institutions, such as universities and health providers with many non-Catholic employees, can refuse to pay for such coverage, which will then be provided by insurance companies at their own expense. (Expense is a euphemism here; for insurers, birth control saves more in medical bills that it costs.) The Catholic Hospital Association, which includes 620 hospitals and 1,400 nursing homes, accepted the compromise. But not the Catholic hierarchy, which has pressed Catholic universities, for example, to challenge the arrangement in federal court.\n\nWhen Notre Dame took its case to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, its attenuated, often-confusing argument was shredded by Judge Richard Posner, a first-rank conservative legal scholar and a Reagan appointee to the bench. Posner told Notre Dame\u2019s lawyer to \u201cstop fencing with me\u201d as the lawyer refused to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to the judge\u2019s questions. Finally came an answer that exposed the essence of the university\u2019s all-but-sham case: Writing a letter to the federal government saying \u201cno\u201d to contraceptive coverage would make Notre Dame \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the alternative provision of such services by \u201ca third party.\u201d This is Orwellian\u2014no somehow means yes. Posner called the reasoning \u201ctrivial\u201d\u2014and rebuked the university\u2019s counsel for \u201cbabbling.\u201d\n\nAnd this seems to go beyond babbling in a legal sense: \u201cNinety-eight percent of sexually active American Catholic women practice birth control and 78 percent of Catholics think a \u2018good Catholic\u2019 can reject the bishops\u2019 teaching\u2026\u201d Thus the official church\u2014except for those pesky nuns at the Catholic Hospital Association\u2014insists on imposing a doctrine on countless non-Catholic employees that most of its own members disdain, and even though the church-affiliated institutions in question don\u2019t have to finance a scintilla of coverage for birth-control services.\n\nThis \u201cpromiscuous\u201d invocation of religious freedom would deny equal rights to those with different religious convictions\u2014or none. The Arizona law, and similar statutes proposed in other states, would extend the claim to an extreme that logically could sanction discrimination far beyond the LGBT community.\n\nShould a hard-line Catholic whose business sells goods and services to the general public be licensed to cite religious conviction in order to turn away a Catholic couple being married outside the church, or one of whose members has been previously married and divorced\u2014both violations of Catholic teaching?\n\nOr should a fundamentalist hotelkeeper be able to refuse a room to an unmarried couple? And what if the couple is mixed-race? A conscience exemption could offer cover for the oldest and most odious form of discrimination in America.\n\nThere are believers who could hold, and have insisted, in the words of the Wake Forest Law Review, that women are confined to a \u201cspecial (wife and mother) sphere\u2026 to be ruled by their husbands.\u201d If you profess that, a religious exemption to antidiscrimination laws could conceivably give you the right to do wrong\u2014neither to hire nor to promote women.\n\nIn addition, there is the long history of \u201ca religious and biblical case for segregation.\u201d Indeed the trial judge who ruled in favor of Virginia\u2019s antimiscegenation law in 1967 called on God as his validator: The Almighty had put distinct races on different continents because \u201che did not intend the races to mix.\u201d The Supreme Court reversed the ruling and invalidated the Virginia law\u2014and federal law generally prohibits racial discrimination.\n\nState statutes can\u2019t alter that, even if cloaked in sacerdotal rationalization. But if the Arizona law had been signed, or if its ilk proliferates, there will be predictable calls for the same kind of conscience exemption at the federal level. Wary advocates could settle for just going after gays; but that would run afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s DOMA decision by singling out a suspect class in the absence of any compelling governmental interest. To have any chance to survive a court challenge, the exemption would have to be general.\n\nToday, there is no federal law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT Americans. The craven John Boehner won\u2019t even let the House of Representatives vote on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act lest he alienate his Tea Party-dominated caucus and jeopardize his nearly powerless sinecure as speaker.\n\nIn some states and cities, there are antidiscrimination statutes that apply to gays and lesbians; in many, there are none. And in both, gays and lesbians can become convenient targets for the fury of the religious right. Conscience clauses have their place: Ministers, rabbis, and priests should not be required to officiate at a same-sex marriage in violation of their faith. Miscarrying this into the commercial sector is another matter altogether. A commercial transaction does not confer ethical approbation on a customer. And nondiscrimination is, or should be, a seamless garment\u2014and discrimination a seamless evil. The Wake Forest Law Review concludes: \u201cThe best way to think about the claim that gay marriage requires expanded exemptions from existing [state] laws for religious discriminators is in the larger context of both race and gender\u2026\u201d\n\nThe great question here is whether we can learn to live together as a country in all our increasing diversity. A clear majority of Americans already favor marriage equality\u2014or soon will. Churches don\u2019t have to. They can teach and preach their doctrines without trying to write them into law\u2014as the Catholic Church has by declining, at least in this country, any attempt to turn the \u201csin\u201d of divorce into an illegal act. The Catholic bishops can make their contribution now by agreeing to the Obamacare compromise on contraception that does not compromise their lonely, little-observed strictures against birth control. With courage or common sense, or both, governors and state legislatures can adjure measures like the Arizona bill.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Kennedy in 1960 as he was speaking for both freedom of religion and freedom from the imposition of religious dogma in the public sphere. Referring to the religious hostility aroused by his campaign, he said: \u201cToday I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you\u2014until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure 1960 was that harmonious\u2014with its bigoted suspicion of Catholics and its entrenched racism. And in 2014, America is polarized, not harmonious. Nonetheless, there is a relevant lesson that reaches across all our history: Change, the fulfillment of our national ideals, has never been quiet or easy; every step forward has spurred resistance and backlash.\n\nStill, Kennedy was essentially right, then and now. Yes, he could have referred more accurately to \u201cour pluralistic society.\u201d That pluralism, respect for one another, a will even against the will of many and settled patterns of prejudice to bring down barriers and open up freedom are the only ways America can work and live up to its defining principles.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bobshrum"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201403051800, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "How Religious Freedom Is Hurting Everyones Freedom", "tags": "topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The misuse of conscience exemptions is threatening our hard-won plurality.
