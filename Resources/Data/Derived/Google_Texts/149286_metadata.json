He was allowed to keep it six months later after no one claimed it during a mandated waiting period.\n\nBut the Hackensack Human Services Department denied him General Assistance and Medicaid benefits through Dec. 31 because he failed to report the cash as new income. The director of human services said the agency was just following the rules.\n\nThe 59 year-old Brady is a former photographer and market data analyst who has suffered from depression since losing his job a decade ago, according to The Record of Woodland Park.\n\nBrady told The Record that he hadn't realized he was required to report the money. Formerly homeless, he had recently found housing and was seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and taking medication, but was unsure he'd be able to afford continuing care after his benefits were cut off.\n\nThe newspaper says offers of support for Brady have been pouring in from readers.\n\nBergen County's United Way has also set up an account specifically for Brady through its Compassion Fund.\n\nThe chapter's head, Tom Toronto, told the newspaper that the offers of help stem from a feeling that Brady did a good deed when it would have been easier not to.\n\n\"Here's a fellow who behaved admirably, who clearly could have used the money himself, but he showed a tremendous amount of pride and honesty,\" Toronto said.\n\nMindful that cash assistance could affect Brady's benefits going forward, Toronto said The United Way planned to work with Brady to develop a program of goods and services tailored to his needs.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "regions",
