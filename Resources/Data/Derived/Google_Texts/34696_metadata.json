And don't forget the three million or so young adults who are able to stay on their parents' insurance until they're 26.\n\nSo ... how much freedom did that cost us?\n\nYou see, conservatives keep talking about the \"death of freedom\" and the jackbooted Obamacare Nazi Alinsky thugs who will [fill in the blank and make it really horrible]. So now that the Affordable Care Act has been (mostly) implemented and millions of people now have insurance when they didn't before, or are paying less for better insurance than they had before, it's time for a proper accounting.\n\nAnyone know how much freedom was lost?
