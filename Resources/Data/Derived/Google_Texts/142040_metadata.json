But people are welcoming and recognize her from the November West Hawaii Today story about the fundraising drive to bring her back here for school, something she said helps.\n\nLiving in the United States has been a major shift from the post-Soviet, largely mono-cultural, and patriarchal culture of her homeland, Tajikistan.\n\nThe changes in classes were huge, she said. While in Tajikistan she had enrolled in an economics program dominated by 19 male students. She and the other two female students were confined to writing papers while they were largely ignored by the professor in class, in favor of the male students.\n\nHere, the students are open, happy and willing to express opinions.\n\nOne other adjustment has been the more open connection between professor and student. One of her instructors is Lucy Jones, who holds a doctorate. She\u2019s more than 60 years Rahmatova\u2019s senior and prefers to be called Lucy.\n\nBut Rahmatova can\u2019t manage to call her by her first name. She\u2019s trying, but the rules of unthinking respect for elders and professors has left her always calling her, \u201cMrs. Jones.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople think I\u2019m telling a story,\u201d she said of what\u2019s happened so far. \u201cBut it\u2019s my life.\u201d\n\nThere was obvious relief in Wang\u2019s face as they talked about getting Rahmatova to Hawaii.\n\nWhile in Tajikistan, her international travel work had to be done in the capital, an eight or nine hour drive from her village. All of those trips were taken on mountainous roads with minimal shoulders, where she could see the rusting hulks of vehicles in the valley below.\n\nFor the United States Visa, she had a short meeting with an official who asked her a few questions in English. In part because of her earlier attendance in the FLEX program, the visa was granted without difficulty.\n\nThat was not true for the local officials. It took two days of standing in line to even meet a man to renew her passport. Even though he was working off her previous passports and she was sitting next to him, he misspelled her name. She didn\u2019t discover this until the new passport arrived weeks later.\n\nShe tried again, and found that a bureaucrat now wanted her to update both passports and pay the \u201cexpedited processing fee,\u201d again.\n\nWhen Wang heard about the problems she thought \u201chaven\u2019t we gone over enough hurdles?\u201d\n\nBut Rahmatova made it through that and began her trip.\n\n\u201cWe had tried to anticipate everything,\u201d Wang said, but there was one paperwork scare in the U.S.\n\nRahmatova\u2019s medical records were required and Wang was stunned. It had never occurred to her that they would need the records. But Rahmatova reminded her about the immunizations she needed when she arrived in 2012. Those records were at a nearby clinic.\n\nIt took about 10 minutes for the clinic to produce the records, stamped and signed, Wang said.\n\nAt home, they\u2019d still be waiting in line, Rahmatova said.\n\nRight now, she is still developing her life course.\n\nShe volunteered with the Special Olympics, a sort of program that doesn\u2019t exist for people with disabilities in her home country.\n\nIt turned her firmly in the path of health care, she said, and she\u2019s studying to be a nurse. Right now she\u2019s leaning toward being a health educator or assisting in improving life for the disabled.\n\nIt connects back to what her father had hoped she could be, but faded away due to costs and the long-term training. When it\u2019s all said and done, she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll go back to Tajikistan, stay in the United States or go elsewhere.\n\nNow that she\u2019s back, she\u2019s ready to get back into many of her old activities. She\u2019s gotten back into the water after three years in landlocked Tajikistan. She\u2019d also like to continue her studies in judo, which she had done as a student and as a club.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: West Hawaii Today, http://www.westhawaiitoday.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Culture shock, sure.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Culture shock, sure.", "title": "Community effort brings Tajik student here for studies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/community-effort-brings-tajik-student-here-for-stu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/22/tajik_student.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/22/tajik_student.jpeg", "description": "Culture shock, sure.", "card": "summary", "title": "Community effort brings Tajik student here for studies"}, "Author": "GRAHAM MILLDRUM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "She\u2019d also like to continue her studies in judo, which she had done as a student and as a club.\nNow that she\u2019s back, she\u2019s ready to get back into many of her old activities.\nSo her host mother, Pamela Wang, began an effort to raise enough money to bring Rahmatova back to the Aloha State and enroll her in Hawaii Community College - Palamanui.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s my life.\u201dThere was obvious relief in Wang\u2019s face as they talked about getting Rahmatova to Hawaii.\nShe\u2019s been busy signing up for courses, getting her books, learning the bus schedule, and other parts of her life here."}
