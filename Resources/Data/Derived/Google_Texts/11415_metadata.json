Davis brought facts and the vision for the future, while Greg Abbott was left with Republican talking points and lies.\n\nVideo of the debate:\n\nDavis got the first question about balancing border security and local development. She answered that she would listen to local leaders, and hammered Greg Abbott for calling this part of the area Third World. Abbott rebutted by saying that secure communities promote economic development. Abbott tied economic development in the Rio Grande Valley to economic development. Abbott\u2019s first question was about the state Supreme Court ruling the school funding system unconstitutional. Abbott answered with no education plan, but with Republican platitudes on education. Davis pointed out that she protested the education cuts that Abbott is defending. She called the education cuts he supports \u201cdumb,\u201d and vowed to fight for more regulation for schools.\n\nDavis was asked about what she sees as fair regulations for abortion. She called out Abbott for campaigning with a known sexual predator (Ted Nugent). She said, \u201cMr. Abbott that is not protecting Texas women.\u201d Abbott rebutted with more Republican talking points about establishing a culture of life. (Abbott\u2019s answers have been straight off the national Republican talking points sheet.)\n\nGreg Abbott started to squirm when he was asked about his comments calling the Rio Grande Valley to a third world country. Abbott tried to rewrite history and claim that he was talking about the entire state, when media reports contradict his claims. At the quarter point of the debate, it is easy to see why Abbott is not performing as well of other Republicans in the polls. He is a very underwhelming candidate.\n\nWendy Davis ripped Abbott for not expanding Medicaid. She said, \u201cMr. Abbott is California\u2019s best friend in Texas because he wants to keep sending our tax dollars to them.\u201d Abbott accused Davis of wanting to expand Obamacare in Texas and called Obamacare an abject failure. Abbott said you had seen the future of Obamacare in veteran\u2019s care, which was a total lie, because Obamacare is not government run healthcare.\n\nAbbott said that Texas needed even less government and rejected raising the minimum wage, even though the increase would help 2.8 million Texans. Abbott tried to say that there aren\u2019t many minimum wage workers in the state, when the truth is that Texas ranks near the top of the country in the number of minimum wage workers. Davis rebutted, \u201cRaising the minimum wage is not only good for Texas families, it\u2019s good for our economy.\u201d She said Abbott is looking out for his insider friends, not Texas families.\n\nDavis scored effective points on almost every question, but will it be enough to overcome a generic Republican opponent in deeply red Texas?\n\nIn the portion of the debate where the candidates could question each other, Greg Abbott asked Davis if she regretted voting for Obama. Davis answered that she is busy running for governor. She ignored his question and used it to discuss her vision of what the governor should be doing. (She didn\u2019t answer the question.)\n\nDavis asked Abbott about the state funding system being ruled unconstitutional. Davis asked Abbott if he will drop his appeals and appropriately fund the schools. Abbott tried to blame Davis for his unwillingness to settle the lawsuit. Davis got fired up and told Abbott that what he is doing is wrong.\n\nSen. Davis was asked about the decision to indict Rick Perry. She said that she believed that these are serious charges that deserve serious consideration. Abbott said the charges were bizarre for Perry to be indicted for exercising a veto. (This was a complete distortion of what Gov. Perry did.) Davis criticized Abbott for accepting a $100,000 donation from Koch Industries and blocking residents from having the right to know what kinds of dangerous chemicals are stored in the communities. Abbott said that residents can\u2019t know about potential dangers like the explosion that happened in West, TX because of terrorism.\n\nAbbott defended voter ID laws by claiming that voter fraud is real, despite the fact that there is no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nWendy Davis had a dominant performance in the first of two Texas gubernatorial debates. Watching this debate it is easy to see why Texas Republicans are working so hard to derail Davis\u2019 political star. If he wins, Greg Abbott has the look of a candidate that voters will regret electing.\n\nAbbott alternated between lying and blaming the federal government for his failures. He also showed no leadership and vision for the future. Attorney General Abbott is a Koch Republican, who could have been interchanged with thousands of other generic Republican candidates around the country.\n\nWendy Davis had a fantastic debate. She is a Democrat on the rise, and her strong debate showing should continue to help her close the gap on Greg Abbott.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wendy Davis had a dominant night at the first gubernatorial debate.
