That\u2019s especially evident during Masters week.\n\n\u201cTiger is always going to be the story leading into every major as long as he plays the game,\u201d said ESPN golf analyst Paul Azinger, the 1993 PGA Championship winner.\n\nThat\u2019s even true this week, with Woods coming off his self-imposed exile while he tried to rehab his game and his body.\n\nA major championship is golf\u2019s Super Bowl. Only there are four of them. Whereas Joe Montana and Tom Brady can be placed atop the NFL\u2019s pedestal with that sparkle from their Super Bowl title rings, Nicklaus and Woods stand alone atop the golf world.\n\nThe score for victories in professional majors is Nicklaus 18, Woods 14.That\u2019s the scorecard to determine golf\u2019s greatest player. Otherwise, the comparisons become too muddled, or at least too close to call.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 After becoming a full-time member of the PGA Tour, Woods won eight of his next 22 majors. Nicklaus won seven of his first 22.\n\n\u2022 At the top of his game, Woods won seven major championships in 11 tries beginning with the 1999 PGA Championship.\n\n\u2022 But is that Woods streak substantially more impressive than the Nicklaus domination from 1970-80? Nicklaus played in all 44 major championships during that 11-year span, winning 10 and placing in the top 10 in 28 others, including eight runner-up finishes.\n\n\u2022 Woods completed a career Grand Slam \u2014 winning all four majors at least once \u2014 at age 24; Nicklaus did so at age 26.\n\nThen there are the countless arguments about the differences in golf, in their game and about the quality of competition in the PGA Tour when each was in his heyday.\n\nNicklaus and Woods were long hitters for their eras. And each may be regarded as the best clutch putter of his generation. Their steely-eyed competitiveness had no equals.\n\nBoth also faced issues with their game. Woods has struggled with distance control on his approach shots throughout his career, and in recent years with keeping drives in the fairway. Nicklaus was never included among the best chippers of his era.\n\nNicklaus won when woods were made of wood, and still managed to mash tee shots a country mile with his persimmon driver. Those balata-covered golf balls used by Nicklaus back in the day not only lacked the distance of today\u2019s solid-core balls, the wound balls also were more erratic and less dependable.\n\nCourse conditions have improved since Nicklaus was in his prime, with advances in grasses, mowing techniques and irrigation. But Woods faces longer courses, and sometimes pristine fairways turn sinister when drives scoot off into rough that is often thicker and deeper than when Nicklaus played.\n\nNicklaus supporters are quick to point out that he had to battle each week against a greater number of future Hall of Famers than has Woods.\n\nWoods enthusiasts counter by saying the talent in golf is much deeper today, with perhaps 50 players having a chance to win any given week instead of the dozen or so contenders during the Nicklaus era.\n\nAs of 2008, there appeared to be little doubt that Woods would surpass Nicklaus and win the requisite 19 major championships to stake his claim as the best ever. Woods earned his 14th major by winning the 2008 U.S. Open.\n\nIn December 2009, Woods left golf for several months after admitting to infidelity that caused his marriage to end. Since August 2007, he has undergone two separate knee surgeries (cartilage, ACL), dealt with issues in his neck and Achilles tendon, underwent back surgery in March 2014 and missed most of the early 2015 schedule because of a different back problem.\n\nDespite all of his success, Woods has changed swing coaches several times during his career. And in the past year he made further changes to his golf swing with alarmingly poor results.\n\nReasons and explanations vary, but the bottom line is: Woods has missed more cuts (three) since the beginning of 2014 than he did (two) during his first eight full years as a tour regular.\n\nWoods turns 40 on Dec. 30.\n\n\u201cWe all know the plight of Tiger Woods,\u201d Azinger said recently. \u201cSadly, for whatever reason, Tiger sacrificed a winning swing at the altar of a perfect swing. And he may have sacrificed a winning body at the altar of a perfect body. It\u2019s been hard to watch that un- doing.\u201d\n\nStill, Nicklaus said recently that he expects Woods to win at least five more majors and break his record.\n\n\u201cI still do. Why would I not?\u201d Nicklaus said. \u201cTiger has a lot of golf in front of him. Obviously, his chances (of breaking the record) are harder for him now than five years ago. But I still think he has time on his side. I think Tiger will turn it around. He\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nCan Woods win this year\u2019s Masters and move closer to Nicklaus\u2019 Ruthian record? Nobody can make even an educated guess. Only Woods\u2019 closest friends must know where his game stands and how much confidence he has. Woods has not teed it up in a tour event since withdrawing from the Feb. 8 Farmers Insurance Open when another back issue flared up.\n\nWoods has not completed all four rounds of a tournament in 2015. His swing looked almost mechanical at the beginning of the year.\n\nCurtis Strange, another ESPN golf analyst and a two-time U.S. Open champion, said one must assume that Woods is healthy because he\u2019s entered the Masters.\n\nBut what will his game look like? He practices in private and keeps his progress close to the vest.\n\n\u201cAll we see with Tiger is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Azinger said. \u201cWe only see Tiger show up (for an event). We can only know what the state of his game was the last time we saw him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know if he is continuing the path of over-engineering (his swing) or if he wants to be the best player again. \u2026 How hard has he worked on being the best player, not the best swinger? That\u2019s what we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Can Tiger Woods surpass Jack Nicklaus, golf\u2019s greatest?", "title": "Can Tiger Woods surpass Jack Nicklaus, golf\u2019s greatest?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/04/can-tiger-woods-surpass-jack-nicklaus-golfs-greatest/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__tiger-woods-golf-returnp1-1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__tiger-woods-golf-returnp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T19:02:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T05:01:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb548\"", "article_summary": "For example:\u2022 After becoming a full-time member of the PGA Tour, Woods won eight of his next 22 majors.\n\u2022 At the top of his game, Woods won seven major championships in 11 tries beginning with the 1999 PGA Championship.\nThe score for victories in professional majors is Nicklaus 18, Woods 14.That\u2019s the scorecard to determine golf\u2019s greatest player.\nBut there is no denying that any argument regarding whether Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus will go down in history as golf\u2019s greatest player becomes amplified in advance of major championships.\nNicklaus won when woods were made of wood, and still managed to mash tee shots a country mile with his persimmon driver."}
