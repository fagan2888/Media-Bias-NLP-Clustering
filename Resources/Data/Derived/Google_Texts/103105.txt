Denver police are investigating a possible link between a robbery on Friday by men s pretending to be police officers and another possible attempted police impersonation traffic stop the following night.

Two men in a dark blue sedan attempted to stop a motorist at Ogden Street and Kentucky Avenue on Saturday near midnight, said Eranda Piyasena, a Denver police spokesman.

The men turned on red and blue lights on their dashboard.

The incident followed a widely reported robbery by two suspects driving a Crown Victoria equipped with red and blue lights.

On Saturday, the motorist was suspicious of the approaching vehicle and called 911.

“He started to pull over when the car pulled alongside, with the emergency lights flashing,” said Piyasena.

The motorist pulled away and left the scene.

On Friday night, two suspects driving a maroon Crown Victoria equipped with red and blue lights and a Colorado license plate pulled over a man in the 3800 block of North Sheridan Boulevard. The man said the the men pulled him from his car and placed him in handcuffs.

The victim was injured when the suspects pushed him back inside his car, and he hit his head on the windshield, causing the glass to break.

One of the suspects took $180 from the victim’s wallet.

The crime occurred about 10:05 p.m. Friday. The victim reported the incident to police about 1:15 a.m.
