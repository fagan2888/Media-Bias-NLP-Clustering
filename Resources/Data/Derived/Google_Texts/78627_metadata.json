It provides a coherent plan to restore our constitutional republic, reversing the damage inflicted by the Progressive movement over the past 100 years, and preventing us from sliding into financial and economic ruin because of a profligate political class unable to curb its spending.\n\nLevin sounds the warning about the \u201cnecessity and urgency of restoring constitutional republicanism and preserving the civil society from the growing authoritarianism of a federal Leviathan.\u201d Using original sources, such as James Madison\u2019s notes from the Constitutional Convention, as well as the extensive discussions in the Federalist Papers, Levin explains the intent of the Framers to establish a federal system with a central government of limited powers balanced by sovereign state governments.\n\nLevin reviews the history of constitutional changes, such as the 16th and 17th Amendments, which greatly increased the power of the federal government. The 16th Amendment\u2019s legalization of a national income tax gave the federal government the financial capacity to vastly expand its size and spending, leading to the dire fiscal mess that so perplexes Washington today. And the 17th Amendment\u2019s requirement of popular election of senators eliminated an important check the Framers had placed on the federal government \u2014 the representation of state governments in the U.S. Senate. While basic civics classes teach about the horizontal checks and balances of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, they ignore the fact that state control of the U.S. Senate was seen as an essential, second vertical check on the power of the federal government.\n\nIt is unlikely that the Constitution would have been ratified without this essential feature preserving the \u201cbalance of power\u201d between the states and the federal government. Levin eloquently describes the \u201ccritical blow\u201d the 17th Amendment struck to our federalist structure:\n\nThe long silence of the states had begun. The states no longer had a legislative venue, or any venue, to influence directly the course of the federal government. This contributed significantly to the dismantlement of the states\u2019 traditional and exclusive areas of governing responsibility. As a result, today the federal government fills whatever areas of governance and even society it chooses. State sovereignty exists mostly at the will of the federal government. The federal government\u2019s limited nature under the Constitution was transmuted into the kind of decentralized power structure the Framers worked so diligently to thwart.\n\nLevin also describes the effects of key Supreme Court decisions, including Wickard v. Filburn (1942) and the recent approval of Obamacare in NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), outlining how the Court has vastly expanded the power of both the judiciary and Congress far beyond what was intended. His account of how the Supreme Court surrendered to President Roosevelt\u2019s threats in the 1930s and relaxed its strict adherence to the Commerce Clause, destroying the limits on the power of the federal government in the Constitution, is depressing. But it makes a key point undergirding Levin\u2019s argument that we need structural changes to restore constitutional governance: People are fallible; hence we cannot depend on judges, politicians, or government bureaucrats to always act in a principled manner.\n\nLevin also explains how Congress has fueled the massive increase in power of the executive branch by delegating \u201cunconstitutionally lawmaking power to a gigantic yet ever-growing administrative state.\u201d Levin\u2019s description of a constantly expanding bureaucracy staffed by unaccountable federal civil servants is chilling. In 2011 alone, bureaucrats issued 3,807 new regulations when Congress passed only 81 laws signed by the president. In 2012, the Obama administration imposed $236 billion in new regulatory costs on our economy.\n\nHaving worked in two different federal agencies, I know from personal experience that Levin\u2019s warnings about the dangers \u201cunleashe[d] on society\u201d by all these rules and regulations promulgated by faceless bureaucrats are right on target. The incontestable result of this aggregation of power in the central government is the imposition of \u201csocial engineering and central planning . . . in search of the ever-elusive utopian paradise.\u201d\n\nLevin proposes a series of constitutional amendments designed to curb the almost unlimited power of the federal government and return us to a federal system in which state governments have an actual voice in the governance of our country as originally intended; where nine \u201cimperfect\u201d lawyers in black robes cannot make \u201cpolitical and public policy decisions and impos[e] them on every corner of the nation and every part of society\u201d with no accountability; and the power and authority of the legislative and executive branches are restrained in a way that curbs their ability to limit our liberty.\n\nThe key to Levin\u2019s plan is Article V, which sets out the two ways in which the Constitution can be amended. The only method ever used in our history is the first: passage of an amendment by two thirds of both houses of Congress and approval by three quarters of the states. Levin proposes employing the second method: having Congress call a constitutional convention upon application of the legislatures of two thirds of the states.\n\nLevin admits that he \u201cwas originally skeptical\u201d because he feared \u201cit could turn into a runaway caucus\u201d and \u201cwould play disastrously into the hands of the Statists.\u201d But he changed his mind when he realized that the language of Article V does not allow a constitutional convention whose delegates can directly change the Constitution. It says specifically that two thirds of the states can call for \u201ca Convention for proposing Amendments\u201d that shall only become \u201cPart of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States.\u201d Thus it would be a \u201climited-purpose convention\u201d that could not be used to draw up an \u201centirely new constitution or a new form of government.\u201d\n\nLevin proposes eleven amendments that would:\n\nEstablish twelve-year term limits for members of Congress and the Supreme Court;\n\nRepeal the 17th Amendment;\n\nAllow either Congress or the states to overturn a Supreme Court decision within 24 months with a three fifths vote of the members of both houses or the states;\n\nRequire a federal budget to be enacted by May or impose an automatic across-the-board 5 percent cut, and the budget may not exceed total tax receipts or 17.5 percent of GDP;\n\nPlace a 15 percent limit on the amount of income taxes collected from natural and legal persons, change the tax-return filing date to the day before federal elections, and ban federal estate, value-added, or sales taxes;\n\nRequire every federal agency to be reauthorized every three years in a stand-alone bill or else expire, and require a seven-member House committee to approve all regulations with an economic burden greater than $100 million within six months or cancel implementation of the regulation;\n\nLimit the Commerce Clause to preventing states from impeding commerce and trade between the states, and specify that it does not extend to activity within states (whether or not it affects interstate commerce) or to compelling an individual to participate in commerce;\n\nExtend the protection against seizure of private property to require compensation for regulations that reduce market value or interfere with the use of property in an amount exceeding $10,000;\n\nChange Article V so that any constitutional amendment, proposed by anyone, will be adopted if it is ratified by two thirds of the states;\n\nRequire a 30-day waiting period between agreement upon the final version of any congressional bill (engrossment) and the final vote to approve it, and allow three fifths of the states to override any federal statute or any federal regulation with a cost exceeding $100 million within 24 months of passage or approval; and\n\nRequire valid photo ID and proof of citizenship to register and vote in all federal elections, in person or by mail, and limit early voting to 30 days before the election (except for active-duty military personnel).\n\nThese amendments all deserve serious consideration by policymakers and the American people. None of Levin\u2019s proposed amendments will put what he calls the \u201cpost-constitutional soft tyranny\u201d genie completely back in the bottle, but they are designed to substantially curb the abuse of power and taxpayer funds that has become routine in Washington. They could also restore the role of the states in our federal system \u2014 a key ingredient in any such repair.\n\nOver more than a decade in Washington, I have at times despaired at the dangerous accumulation of power here, the downhill financial spiral we are on, and the inability, unwillingness, and lack of political will to do anything about it. Levin\u2019s proposals give me hope that there might actually be a way out of the morass in which we find ourselves.\n\nLevin recognizes the \u201cdaunting task before us,\u201d but as he passionately argues, \u201cthere is no reason to be passive witnesses to societal dissolution, at the command of governing masterminds in the federal government and their disciples.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u2014 Hans A. von Spakovsky is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a former member of the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department lawyer.

His account of how the Supreme Court surrendered to President Roosevelt\u2019s threats in the 1930s and relaxed its strict adherence to the Commerce Clause, destroying the limits on the power of the federal government in the Constitution, is depressing. But it makes a key point undergirding Levin\u2019s argument that we need structural changes to restore constitutional governance: People are fallible; hence we cannot depend on judges, politicians, or government bureaucrats to always act in a principled manner.\n\nLevin also explains how Congress has fueled the massive increase in power of the executive branch by delegating \u201cunconstitutionally lawmaking power to a gigantic yet ever-growing administrative state.\u201d Levin\u2019s description of a constantly expanding bureaucracy staffed by unaccountable federal civil servants is chilling. In 2011 alone, bureaucrats issued 3,807 new regulations when Congress passed\u00a0only 81 laws signed by the president. In 2012, the Obama administration imposed $236 billion in new regulatory costs on our economy.\n\nHaving worked in two different federal agencies, I know from personal experience that Levin\u2019s warnings about the dangers \u201cunleashe[d] on society\u201d by all these rules and regulations promulgated by faceless bureaucrats are right on target. The incontestable result of this aggregation of power in the central government is the imposition of \u201csocial engineering and central planning\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0in search of the ever-elusive utopian paradise.\u201d\n\n#page#\n\nLevin proposes a series of constitutional amendments designed to curb the almost unlimited power of the federal government and return us to a federal system in which state governments have an actual voice in the governance of our country as originally intended; where nine \u201cimperfect\u201d lawyers in black robes cannot make \u201cpolitical and public policy decisions and impos[e] them on every corner of the nation and every part of society\u201d with no accountability; and the power and authority of the legislative and executive branches are restrained in a way that curbs their ability to limit our liberty.\n\nThe key to Levin\u2019s plan is Article V, which sets out the two ways in which the Constitution can be amended. The only method ever used in our history is the first: passage of an amendment by two thirds of both houses of Congress and approval by three quarters of the states. Levin proposes employing the second method: having Congress call a constitutional convention upon application of the legislatures of two thirds of the states.\n\n#ad#Levin admits that he \u201cwas originally skeptical\u201d because he feared \u201cit could turn into a runaway caucus\u201d and \u201cwould play disastrously into the hands of the Statists.\u201d But he changed his mind when he realized that the language of Article V does not allow a constitutional convention whose delegates can directly change the Constitution. It says specifically that two thirds of the states can call for \u201ca Convention for proposing Amendments\u201d that shall only become \u201cPart of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States.\u201d Thus it would be a \u201climited-purpose convention\u201d that could not be used to draw up an \u201centirely new constitution or a new form of government.\u201d\n\nLevin proposes eleven amendments that would:\n\nEstablish twelve-year term limits for members of Congress and the Supreme Court;\n\tRepeal the 17th Amendment;\n\tAllow either Congress or the states to overturn a Supreme Court decision within 24 months with a three fifths vote of the members of both houses or the states;\n\tRequire a federal budget to be enacted by May or impose an automatic across-the-board 5 percent cut, and the budget may not exceed total tax receipts or 17.5 percent of GDP;\n\tPlace a 15 percent limit on the amount of income taxes collected from natural and legal persons, change the tax-return filing date to the day before federal elections, and ban federal estate, value-added, or sales taxes;\n\tRequire every federal agency to be reauthorized every three years in a stand-alone bill or else expire, and require a seven-member House committee to approve all regulations with an economic burden greater than $100 million within six months or cancel implementation of the regulation;\n\tLimit the Commerce Clause to preventing states from impeding commerce and trade between the states, and specify that it does not extend to activity within states (whether or not it affects interstate commerce) or to compelling an individual to participate in commerce;\n\tExtend the protection against seizure of private property to require compensation for regulations that reduce market value or interfere with the use of property in an amount exceeding $10,000;\n\tChange Article V so that any constitutional amendment, proposed by anyone, will be adopted if it is ratified by two thirds of the states;\n\tRequire a 30-day waiting period between agreement upon the final version of any congressional bill (engrossment) and the final vote to approve it, and allow three fifths of the states to override any federal statute or any federal regulation with a cost exceeding $100 million within 24 months of passage or approval; and\n\tRequire valid photo ID and proof of citizenship to register and vote in all federal elections, in person or by mail, and limit early voting to 30 days before the election (except for active-duty military personnel).\nThese amendments all deserve serious consideration by policymakers and the American people. None of Levin\u2019s proposed amendments will put what he calls the \u201cpost-constitutional soft tyranny\u201d genie completely back in the bottle, but they are designed to substantially curb the abuse of power and taxpayer funds that has become routine in Washington. They could also restore the role of the states in our federal system \u2014 a key ingredient in any such repair.\n\nOver more than a decade in Washington, I have at times despaired at the dangerous accumulation of power here, the downhill financial spiral we are on, and the inability, unwillingness, and lack of political will to do anything about it. Levin\u2019s proposals give me hope that there might actually be a way out of the morass in which we find ourselves.\n\nLevin recognizes the \u201cdaunting task before us,\u201d but as he passionately argues, \u201cthere is no reason to be passive witnesses to societal dissolution, at the command of governing masterminds in the federal government and their disciples.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u2014 Hans A. von Spakovsky is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a former member of the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department lawyer.
