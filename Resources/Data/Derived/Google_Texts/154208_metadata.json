Inc. (NYSE: PNX) for $217.2 million.\n\nAside from life insurance, Hartford, Connecticut-based Phoenix provides income strategies and insurance protection related to retirement.\n\nThe purchase price works out to $37.50 per share, well over Phoenix's closing share price of $13.03 on Sept. 28, before the deal was announced.

The company focuses on acquiring and operating life, annuity, and long-term care insurance businesses.\n\nGolden Gate has more than $15 billion in committed capital, and invested in Nassau in May. The PE firm made the commitment through its Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, which provides equity seed capital of up to $750 million. This is Nassau's first acquisition.\n\nSandler O'Neill & Partners LP and Goldman Sachs & Co. (NYSE: GS) are acting as Phoenix's financial adviser, while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP provides legal advice. Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. is Nassau's financial adviser, and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP is legal counsel.\n\nInsurance M&A has been constant for years. Recent transactions include Confie Seguros' acquisition of three more insurance agencies, and ExorSpA's deal for Partner RE Ltd.
