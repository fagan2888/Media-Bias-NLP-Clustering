Stacey Dash is at it again with her public verbal assaults aimed at President Obama and his policies.

This week, during an appearance on Fox News’ “Hannity,” the “Clueless” star-turned-political contributor shared her thoughts on why voting for Obama and Obamacare hasn’t benefited the minority community.

“No [it hasn't benefited minorities]. Not at all,” she said. “It still keeps them stuck. They’re getting money for free. They feel worthless. They’re uneducated. I mean, as long as you are that way, [Democrats] can keep you under their control…”

“They have a plantation mentality. As long as they give you this much money, you’ll stay right there. You don’t need to know too much because if you do, you might start thinking for yourself.”

In addition to coming for Obama, Dash has also been outspoken — and created controversy — in the past about other issues, including her response to Kanye West’s remarks during a July 2014 concert in London where he compared the paparazzi taking photos of himself and wife, Kim Kardashian, to “rape.”

"For Kanye to say 'rape,' maybe he needs to spend some time on Rikers Island, go to Rikers for a little while, and then he'll know what rape is," she said during an interview on Fox News' "Outnumbered." “I don't get celebrities not understanding that the paparazzi are doing their job ... I don't think [celebrities are] out of touch, I just don't think they're understanding what the business is."
