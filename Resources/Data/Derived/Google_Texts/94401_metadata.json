Ford is the lead ship in the Navy\u2019s next class of aircraft carriers. It was christened Saturday at the Newport News shipyard where it was built.\n\nThe Ford class represents the first new aircraft carrier design in more than 40 years. Among other things, it will be able to launch jets faster than previous aircraft carriers and will require fewer crew members. The Navy anticipates that having fewer crew members on board will save $4 billion over the ship\u2019s 50-year life span.\n\nPHOTOS: The real Top Gun: Blue Angels and Thunderbirds\n\nFormer president Ford\u2019s daughter, Susan Bales Bord, is the ship\u2019s sponsor.
