In between were extended meditations on public housing, crime, and health care policy.\n\nOn every subject, the Mayor had a team on the job, the money in the bank, and the energy to get things done. If you want to know what a \u201cprogressive city\u201d looks like, look no further than Mayor de Blasio\u2019s New York, New York, a universal call center where help\u2013on every front\u2013is just a (subsidized) phone call away.\n\nTo understand the Mayor\u2019s vision of political life aright, one must note his constant emphasis on the efforts of city public employees. From police officers and firefighters to teachers and sanitation workers, de Blasio praised a \u201cgrassroots, people-powered government\u201d\u2014that is, rightly employed, the administrative extension of the progressive political movement.\n\nAnd how could any resident complain? Anyone who spends a significant amount of time in NYC wants police officers and firefighters who protect and serve, teachers who educate, and sanitation workers who pick up trash\u2013and appreciates the efforts of the many who do their job well. The problem with the mayor\u2019s vision is that it leaves little for the rest of us to do. Just as the Progressive politician plays the hero of the political campaign, it is the Progressive mayor and public employees who play the heroes of everyday life.\n\nAs always, there\u2019s more heroic work to be done. Create jobs. Build housing. Fix things. Engage parents in their children\u2019s education. Hire more talented public employees. Be inclusive. And secure more state and federal funding to help pay for it all.\n\nIf you wonder what drives those engaged in this unending labor, you\u2019re not alone. Playing the political psychologist, the Mayor asked, \u201cWhy do we do this work? Why are we so involved in our communities? Why do we engage the political process?\u201d\n\nHere the Mayor turned to Democratic icon Robert F. Kennedy for an answer. In making the case for universal human rights, then-Senator Kennedy argued before a South African audience:\n\nEverything that makes man\u2019s life worthwhile-family, work, education, a place to rear one\u2019s children and a place to rest one\u2019s head -all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer-not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people. (emphasis added)\n\nIn Kennedy\u2019s construction, government must be accountable to\u2013\u201cmust answer\u201d to\u2013the whole people because of the power it wields over the most fundamental elements of the good life.\n\nIt turns out, though, that the old-fashioned liberal Senator Kennedy was not Progressive enough. Mayor de Blasio\u2019s understanding of what it means for a government to \u201canswer . . . to all its people\u201d is fundamentally different from the original. First, he left out the clause in bold. We are not to be distracted by meditations on the dangers of despotic government. This striking (unnoted) omission is a clear window into the contemporary Progressive mind.\n\nMoreover he reinterprets Kennedy, equating the duty to \u201canswer\u201d with the duty to \u201crespond\u201d: \u201cThat simple concept\u2013that we must answer, we must respond, that it\u2019s our obligation to see clearly what people are experiencing and to do something to make their lives better. That\u2019s what we believe in.\u201d Government, according to the Mayor, is not responsible to the people unless it is responding to the people, abuzz with efforts \u201cto make their lives better\u201d\u2013that it, unless it is a universal call center ready to turn every inquiry into a governmental requisition.\n\nMayor de Blasio\u2019s idea of a responsive government is very different from the founders\u2019 original. Building upon the Declaration of Independence\u2019s understanding of the proper scope of government (\u201cThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed\u201d), James Madison defends the Constitution in Federalist 39 against what he acknowledges to be a potentially decisive charge: that it is not \u201cstrictly republican.\u201d\n\nMadison readily admits that if this were true, \u201cits advocates must abandon it [the Constitution] as no longer defensible.\u201d Why? In the place where one might expect him to claim that a republic is the best form of government, he instead meditates upon the character of the American people:\n\nIt is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government.\n\nAmericans, Madison argues, are natural republicans\u2013republicans in their heads and in their hearts, determined to show the world that \u201cself-government\u201d is possible. The republican principle, as Madison defines it later in the essay, requires \u201ca government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior.\u201d That is to say, republican government is responsible to the people, from whom it ultimately \u201cderives all its power\u201d and to whom it must directly or indirectly give an account of its stewardship of those powers.\n\nOn this point, at least, there is no daylight between the positions of the 1960s-style liberal Robert Kennedy and the 1780s-style liberal James Madison. In both accounts, the people are primary; the government is secondary\u2013a necessary help supporting self-governing citizens, in both the political and moral senses of the term.\n\nToday, the Progressives leap from responsible government to a responsive government in which government is the main actor in the American play. Their efforts obstruct if not eliminate opportunities for moral self-government, leaving the citizenry playing the role of a supporting cast at best, and a prop at worst. Or rather leaving some citizens\u2013the allies of the Progressive city managers\u2013to be the nursemaids and taskmasters of their less enlightened neighbors, while others, feeding at the crony capitalist trough, can afford to be above it all.\n\nThus Mayor\u2019s de Blasio\u2019s charge to NYC residents at the end of his speech was predictable:\n\nAnd to continue this mission, we need your help. Now, more than ever, we need your help. We need you to go out in your communities and make sure families sign up for pre-K and after school. We need you to keep leading the way, keep showing the leaders the path, holding your elected officials accountable. We need you to keep this momentum of these last 100 days growing all the time.\n\nThe people are to show \u201cthe leaders the path.\u201d But, it turns out, there is only one, progressive path, already marked out with thick hedges on each side. All we\u2019ve really got to do is make sure everybody\u2019s in the lane\u2013get\u2019em all signed up. The means has become the end\u2013\u201cuniversal\u201d enrollment, not universal achievement\u2013and the work of the good neighbor a matter of paperwork, not particular care or love.\n\nSo cue the band!\n\nStart spreading the news. . .\n\nwe\u2019re offering pre-K.\n\nLet\u2019s make your neighbor part of it\u2014\n\nNew York, New York. . . .\n\nOf course, Frank Sinatra sang of becoming \u201cking of the hill, top of the list, head of the heap\u201d\u2013a troubling ambition in a progressive city.
