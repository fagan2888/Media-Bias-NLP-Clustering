She was part of the group for 13 years before leaving in 2010 to launch a solo career.\n\n\u201c[Opening up about bulimia] was hard for me to speak about. It still is hard, and thinking about it I try not to well up ... It is such a horrible paralyzing disease and it was such a dark time for me. That\u2019s why I can empathize so much with people who have demons and voices in their heads, who aren\u2019t nice to themselves. It robs you of living your life,\u201d Scherzinger told British Cosmopolitan.\n\nScherzinger hid her battle with the life-threatening eating disorder from her family and friends for eight years. In a 2012 interview on VH1\u2019s Behind the Music, Scherzinger says it was her first photo-shoot with the Pussycat Dolls, known for their skimpy outfits, that started her road to bulimia.\n\nThe 36-year-old pop star told Cosmo that at one point she began to lose her voice and couldn\u2019t sing at shows. It wasn\u2019t until her manager found her passed out on the floor in the south of France that she realized she had to get help.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to lose everything I love if I don\u2019t love myself.\u2019 One day when you feel like you\u2019ve reached the end, you just say, \u2018I\u2019m not doing this anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s sad to see how I wasted my life. I had such a great life on the outside, the Dolls were on top of the world, but I was miserable on the inside,\u201d Scherzinger said.\n\nScherzinger is now healthy, happy, and living a much more vibrant life. \u201cI\u2019m never letting that happen again; you only get one life \u2014 I was 27 only once.\u201d Scherzinger assures though that bulimia does not have to be and shouldn\u2019t be a life-long struggle.\n\n\u201cYou can recover and you can get rid of it forever. I did it and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for me to share my story. I felt so alone ... but I made myself so alone. You hide it from the world, you isolate yourself. But you can beat it \u2014 do not give up because you\u2019re so special and you\u2019re meant for such great things,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the full interview, pick up this month\u2019s Cosmopolitan UK or search Cosmopolitan UK on the Apple Newsstand.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nicole scherzinger bulimia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In an interview with Cosmopolitan UK, former Pussycat Doll, Nicole Scherzinger, discusses the horrors of her life-threatening eating disorder she kept hidden from her family and friends for eight years.", "title": "Singer Nicole Scherzinger Battled Bulimia For 8 Years: 'I Felt So Alone'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nicole-scherzinger-opens-about-her-hidden-battle-bulimia-cosmo-i-felt-so-alone-291062", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/02/nicole-scherzinger_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an interview with Cosmopolitan UK, former Pussycat Doll, Nicole Scherzinger, discusses the horrors of her life-threatening eating disorder she kept hidden from her family and friends for eight years.", "title": "Singer Nicole Scherzinger Battled Bulimia For 8 Years: 'I Felt So Alone'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nicole-scherzinger-opens-about-her-hidden-battle-bulimia-cosmo-i-felt-so-alone-291062", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/02/nicole-scherzinger_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/02/nicole-scherzinger_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-02T11:52:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T12:43:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In an interview with Cosmopolitan UK, former Pussycat Doll, Nicole Scherzinger, discusses the horrors of her life-threatening eating disorder she kept hidden from her family and friends for eight years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad98\"", "article_summary": "For the full interview, pick up this month\u2019s Cosmopolitan UK or search Cosmopolitan UK on the Apple Newsstand.\nIn an interview in the August issue of Cosmopolitan UK, Scherzinger opens up about her struggles with bulimia while a member of the popular girl group, the Pussycat Dolls.\nIt robs you of living your life,\u201d Scherzinger told British Cosmopolitan.\nScherzinger hid her battle with the life-threatening eating disorder from her family and friends for eight years.\nThe 36-year-old pop star told Cosmo that at one point she began to lose her voice and couldn\u2019t sing at shows."}
