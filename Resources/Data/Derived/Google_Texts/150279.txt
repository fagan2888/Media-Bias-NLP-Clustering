The carmaker has not yet gotten approval from the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) for proposed technical fixes for the Passat model, the newspaper said, citing a KBA spokesman.

The KBA was still examining the technical solutions submitted by VW and it's unclear whether the engine will comply with Euro 5 emission standards after the refitting, Bild quoted the KBA spokesman as saying.

Volkswagen (VW), which started recalling the 2.0 liter diesel Amarok pick-up in late January, had originally planned to start refitting more than 500,000 Passat models on Feb. 29, Bild said.

VW did not return calls seeking comment.
