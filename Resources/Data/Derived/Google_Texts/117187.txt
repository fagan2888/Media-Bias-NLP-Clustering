PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - A Portland Public Schools employee who was harassed by a co-worker seeks $650,000 in a lawsuit against the district.

Rory Thompson alleges district officials had previous complaints about Mitchell Whitehurst and failed to take action.

Multnomah County court records show Whitehurst pleaded guilty in December to misdemeanor harassment of Thompson, and was given 18 months of probation.

Thompson is a student management specialist at the Faubion School in northeast Portland. His lawsuit filed Thursday claims battery, sexual harassment and the intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The suit says the 57-year-old Whitehurst was placed on administrative leave and then allowed to retire.

Portland Public Schools spokesman Jon Isaacs said Friday that district officials just received the complaint and must review it before making any comment.
