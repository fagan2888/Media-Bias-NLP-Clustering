Embed SCOTUS Chat: Sebelius Vs. Hobby Lobby Replay 19:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the most scrutinized case of its term. The issue: Does Obamacare violate the religious freedom of private employers by requiring them to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives?

The case raises several fascinating questions. Are for-profit corporations capable of holding and expressing religious beliefs? Or do those rights belong only to individuals?

It’s the first Supreme Court test for the health care law since 2012, when the justices narrowly upheld its constitutionality.

Starting at 1:15 p.m. ET, NBC News’ Chris Jansing (@JansingCo) anchored a live interactive webcast with NBC News Justice Correspondent Pete Williams (@PeteWilliamsNBC) and Amy Howe, an editor/reporter at SCOTUSBlog, to discuss the details of the case and answer your questions.

Viewers submitted questions on Twitter and Facebook. Video of the full webcast will be available on-demand later this afternoon.
