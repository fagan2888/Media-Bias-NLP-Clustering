Arrogant youngsters are forcing helpless diners to consume weird wines! Save us from this horrible trend! This is one of the top memes for ancient wine writers this summer.\n\nIt\u2019s also complete bullshit.\n\nLet me name some names here: Wine Spectator\u2018s James Laube. Steve Heimoff, who once wrote for Wine Enthusiast and now sells Kendall-Jackson. Charlie Olken from the Connoisseurs\u2019 Guide to California Wine. I\u2019m calling you on your bullshit.\n\nI\u2019m naming names because I\u2019m tired of the anonymous straw men in the \u201cdim somm\u201d articles.\n\nLaube can pen a screed against In Pursuit of Balance, and if he wants to say Raj Parr has no taste, fine. People disagree. But these old men always go too far and attack this supposed nationwide trend of hipster somms and their consumer-unfriendly wine lists. For God\u2019s sake, Heimoff compared sommeliers to ISIS.\n\nThese arrogant \u201chipster somms\u201d \u2014 terrorists with corkscrews \u2014 don\u2019t exist.\n\nEarlier this summer on my blog, I asked readers to name restaurants where they encountered such hipster sommeliers. The title of my post was \u201cLet\u2019s Name Names: Restaurants where sommeliers recommend bad wines.\u201d I wrote NAME THEM BELOW in large, bold capital letters. So it wasn\u2019t vague. The post was reasonably well-read, with more visitors than when I posted a naked photo of a porn star, but fewer than when I last wrote something mean about Robert Parker. (What\u2019s the real porn, eh?)\n\nI got one (1) incidence of a sommelier pouring a wine that the commenter didn\u2019t like AND refusing to take it back. One. From thousands of readers. I got a few other incidents of sommeliers being rude or ignorant. This happens. Some servers are bad too; so are some chefs. But just because the somm is rude doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s making you drink swill.\n\nHeimoff blogged about this issue last month and the comments quickly deteriorated into some people complaining about some restaurants that don\u2019t carry California sparkling wine. I like California sparkling wine as much as anybody. And I\u2019m a huge proponent of restaurants carrying local wines, especially if they brag about local food sources. But if a restaurant doesn\u2019t have one type of local wine, that hardly makes them dictatorial hipsters. It\u2019s a straw man.\n\nI\u2019m a diner. I don\u2019t have the right to tell a restaurant they must carry some specific wine, or they can\u2019t carry some other wine. My right is to eat somewhere else.\n\nConsider the restaurants where these old guy writers (and they are ALL guys) don\u2019t like the wine lists. Charlie Olken wrote this comment about Commonwealth, a restaurant in my neighborhood, on Heimoff\u2019s blog: \u201cCommonwealth restaurant, an otherwise interesting place to eat, has just such a list of unknowns. When asked about it, the somm responded, \u2018What the customers want is not important.'\u201d\n\nI ate at Commonwealth last week, and its list is obscure, especially by the glass. And it\u2019s not perfect. I didn\u2019t consider the California Riesling/Pinot Noir white blend as delicious as it was interesting. The Austrian Gelber Muskateller was too herbaceous for me. But I didn\u2019t go there for a burger and fries. My favorite dish was \u201csea urchin, trout roe, potato, little gem lettuce, sea bean, lime cream, pickled wasabi.\u201d We also really liked \u201csquid and pork belly, soft cooked egg, hay smoked potato, fine herbs, yuzu aioli.\u201d\n\nYou know what I first drank, by the glass? Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9. Then I had a Canary Islands red. Nobody offered me a Rodney Strong Chardonnay or Robert Mondavi Cabernet. But nobody forced me to drink swill either. I told Commonwealth\u2019s beverage director about Olken\u2019s comment and she hit me on the arm, she was so furious. She went into the office and searched it on the Internet. Then she came back, equally furious. She says she would never say such a thing, and I believe her. Just don\u2019t hit me again.\n\nThis is one problem with the old guys\u2019 complaints. It\u2019s exaggeration. It\u2019s bullshit. But even then, it\u2019s not the main problem.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into the polemics of wine styles because like the old guys, I am a fan of well-balanced, barrel-fermented Chardonnay, something more California winemakers have mastered. I love La Follette Chardonnay, and Ramey, and Grigch Hills. They\u2019re delicious wines. I don\u2019t need to drink them every night. I don\u2019t need to drink anything every night, any more than I need to eat the same meal. And I certainly don\u2019t need to drink from the well of ordinariness at a restaurant where I go for daring cuisine I hadn\u2019t imagined before it appeared on my plate.\n\nThis is the main problem with this bullshit about whether or not polemical sommeliers are telling diners what to drink. Whether these somms are unicorns (non-existent) or platypuses (exceedingly rare), they don\u2019t work at House of Prime Rib. They\u2019re not getting in the way of a steak-loving diner who\u2019s looking for a big-ass Napa Cab. I\u2019ve never yet heard of a complaint about too many weird wines at a classic French-style bistro.\n\nIf you are the kind of diner who enjoys restaurants that serve squid and pork belly with hay smoked potato and yuzu aioli, it\u2019s not unreasonable for that restaurant\u2019s wine director to assume you might want to try some wine you haven\u2019t seen before. If you don\u2019t want a creative wine, why are you eating creative food? Go to a steakhouse. Or that solid place downtown that\u2019s been good for 20 years. Or bring your own bottle of wine and pay corkage; I\u2019ve done that at Commonwealth. Geez, just be happy.\n\nOr not. Frank Bruni did a brilliant piece for the New York Times a few years ago in which he spent a week as a server. A fellow server told him, \u201cSome people are interested in having the experience of being disappointed.\u201d That does sound like someone who goes to a trendy restaurant and complains that he can\u2019t get Cakebread Chardonnay.\n\nWhat should matter is if the wines are good. That\u2019s a subjective opinion, but so is food. With food, it\u2019s one we make every day, and we don\u2019t over-reach it into a political issue. I go to new restaurants sometimes and think the noodles are too bland or the fish is overcooked. I don\u2019t then write a column saying, \u201cThese hipster kids today, all across America, they can\u2019t cook a fish.\u201d I simply go to a better restaurant. Why is wine any different?\n\nThirty years ago, top restaurants had Bordeaux and Burgundy and Champagne and not much else because not much else in the wine world was really good. Now there are great wines from Turkey and Slovenia and Uruguay. Some people don\u2019t want to try new things, and that\u2019s fine; steakhouses are still more popular than pho shops. But old men can\u2019t tell the rest of us not to eat pho.\n\nI\u2019m going to frame this argument as simply as I can:\n\nIf you think a restaurant\u2019s wine list is too weird for you, you are too old to eat there.
