Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who\u2019s on the rise in the presidential campaign, said those events show the Islamic State, also known by the acronym ISIS, views itself at war with the U.S., and the Syrian refugee program Mr. Obama announced is a risk.\n\n\u201cWe need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means.\u201d\n\nFellow candidate Mike Huckabee went further, calling for a halt in all admissions of those coming from countries where the Islamic State or al Qaeda have a \u201cstrong presence.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Bobby Jindal demands more information on Syrian refugees placed in Louisiana\n\n\u201cDuring the debate last week, I stated that we should not admit those claiming to be Syrian refugees and was condemned by the left for that position. I was right, and the events in Paris affirm that,\u201d Mr. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, said in a statement. \u201cEven the far left and politically correct government of France has closed its borders. It\u2019s time for a president who will act to protect Americans, not just talk and protect the image of Islam.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has ordered the U.S. to prepare to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016, with more expected in 2017, as he said Americans must do their part to help give a safety valve to the hundreds of thousands fleeing the war-torn region.\n\nBut officials have acknowledged vetting Syrians will be difficult because the U.S. does not have access to Syrian records, and it\u2019s tougher to verify would-be refugees\u2019 stories and backgrounds.\n\nMuch will depend on the in-person interviews conducted by Homeland Security officers \u2014 an area where officials insist they\u2019ve become expert, thanks to experience vetting Iraqi refugees.\n\nEarly news reports out of Paris said a Syrian passport was found at the site of one of the attacks. And reports said Poland has already decided to suspend its participation in the European Union refugee program in the wake of the attack.\n\nBut refugee program defenders took to social media to urge that countries not stray from their commitments to taking in Syrians.\n\nSome of the defenders said the violence in Paris is what the refugees are fleeing, and makes it all the more imperative to keep the programs going.\n\nIn the U.S., however, Mr. Obama was already having a tough sell. Some Republican members of Congress have proposed place restrictions on the refugee program as a condition in the major spending bill that\u2019s expected to advance through Congress over the next month.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Congress should require the FBI and other counterterrorism officials certify their ability to vet refugees before the program goes into effect.\n\nSpokespersons for Mr. Grassley and several other high-profile critics of the Syrian refugee program said Saturday it was too early to tell what effect the Paris attack would have on the debate.\n\n\u2022 Seth McLaughlin contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees is under fire after Friday's terrorist attack in Paris, with one GOP presidential candidate saying the U.S. should halt its plans as long as it's not able to assure Americans it can weed out potential terrorists.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees is under fire after Friday\u2019s terrorist attack in Paris, with one GOP presidential candidate saying the U.S. should halt its plans as long as it\u2019s not able to assure Americans it can weed out potential terrorists.", "title": "Obama vow to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees under fire after Paris attack", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/14/obama-vow-take-10000-syrian-refugees-under-fire-af/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/APTOPIX_Serbia_Migrants.JPEG-0d650.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/APTOPIX_Serbia_Migrants.JPEG-0d650.jpg", "description": "President Obama's plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees is under fire after Friday's terrorist attack in Paris, with one GOP presidential candidate saying the U.S. should halt its plans as long as it'", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama vow to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees under fire after Paris att"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, War Conflict, Politics, Paris"}, "article_summary": "And reports said Poland has already decided to suspend its participation in the European Union refugee program in the wake of the attack.\nBut refugee program defenders took to social media to urge that countries not stray from their commitments to taking in Syrians.\nIn the U.S., however, Mr. Obama was already having a tough sell.\nSpokespersons for Mr. Grassley and several other high-profile critics of the Syrian refugee program said Saturday it was too early to tell what effect the Paris attack would have on the debate.\nEarly news reports out of Paris said a Syrian passport was found at the site of one of the attacks."}
