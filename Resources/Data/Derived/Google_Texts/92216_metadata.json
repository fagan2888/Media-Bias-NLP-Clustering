A sign above the visiting team\u2019s locker room in Denver reads: \u201cElevation 5,280 Welcome to Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\u201d The Steelers know the challenges of altitude after safety Ryan Clark suffered a splenic infarction in Denver in 2007 related to his sickle cell trait. Clark, now with the Washington Redskins, had his spleen and gall bladder removed. Despite being medically cleared, he has not played in Denver since.\n\n\u201cOf course we knew that. But I never realized how big of a difference it is until I came out here,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSwitching up to a no-huddle, and going to a fast-paced offense, it\u2019s brilliant. When teams come here, they can train all they want, but you\u2019re going to be tired, and we are going to be in tiptop shape.\u201d\n\nWish list. During the offseason, defensive coordinators are like kids at Christmas. They want everything, but expect reality to clobber them over the head.\n\nDenver\u2019s Jack Del Rio couldn\u2019t believe his gifts this spring.\n\n\u201cI said, you know, if I could make it happen, it would be a dominant rush end, a strong safety that will come up and really strike fear in an offense and really be a tone-setter, and a premium corner. There\u2019s no way we\u2019ll get that done, but I\u2019d love to see that. Any way you can make that happen, Mr. Elway?\u201d Del Rio said at \u201cA Night with Coaches\u201d on Tuesday for suite holders and sponsors. \u201cBut John pulled it off! You\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d\n\nHigh praise. Dallas Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said Wednesday that cutting ties with DeMarcus Ware was one of the most difficult decisions he\u2019s been involved in.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Hall of Famer,\u201d Jones said on Sirius radio. \u201cI would never bet against him.\u201d\n\nThe pass rusher became a salary cap casualty because the Cowboys are attempting to become younger.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders forced to elevate his wide receiver game with Broncos", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders forced to elevate his wide receiver game with Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/14/emmanuel-sanders-forced-to-elevate-his-wide-receiver-game-with-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140514__Emmanuel-Sandersp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140514__Emmanuel-Sandersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-14T23:28:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:40:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b04\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe biggest difference is the altitude,\u201d Sanders said Wednesday.\nSanders considers Denver \u201cwide receiver heaven.\u201d His lungs have a different opinion.\nTwo months after signing with the Broncos, Emmanuel Sanders continues to undergo an altitude adjustment.\nBut I never realized how big of a difference it is until I came out here,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cI would never bet against him.\u201dThe pass rusher became a salary cap casualty because the Cowboys are attempting to become younger."}
