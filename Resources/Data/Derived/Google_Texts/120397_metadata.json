Congress, they say, offered the subsidies as a way to induce states to set up exchanges.\n\nBut Virginia and 21 other states reject that argument. To succeed with such an inducement, they say, Congress would have needed to inform the states that the law included the enticement of subsidies only for those that built their own exchanges. It never did so.\n\n\u201cStates selected among exchange options without clear notice that the choice could harm their citizens and disrupt their insurance markets,\u201d the states said in their brief. Indeed, they said, states as diverse as Delaware, Illinois, New Hampshire and Virginia assumed that premium tax credits would be available to their citizens through the federal exchange. To deny those credits now, those states added, \u201cwould destroy state insurance markets and render the Affordable Care Act unworkable.\u201d\n\nA set of states dominated by Republicans \u2014 Alabama, Georgia, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia \u2014 argue just as vociferously that they were well aware of the inducement.\n\nThe arrangement, they said, \u201ccame as no surprise to the states\u201d because Congress had pursued a similar approach in many social welfare programs, using money as an incentive for states to carry out federal policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe briefs address virtually every conceivable argument that has come up in King v. Burwell.\n\nThe chief lobby for the insurance industry, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, described the subsidies as one of \u201cthree interconnected provisions\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. The other provisions require most Americans to have insurance and prohibit insurers from denying coverage to sick people or charging them more.\n\nIf the Supreme Court eliminates the subsidies in states using the federal exchange, the group said, \u201cit would leave consumers in those states with a more unstable market and far higher costs than if the Affordable Care Act had not been enacted.\u201d\n\nWithout subsidies, the insurers said, \u201cyoung and healthy individuals would opt out of the exchanges,\u201d driving up premiums for the remaining consumers, including those who do not receive subsidies.\n\nWhile most of the insurers\u2019 brief is helpful to the Obama administration, they made one argument that may irk the White House: that consumers need the subsidies because other provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including benefit mandates and premium taxes, have raised the cost of insurance.\n\nAnother important brief supporting the administration was filed by one of the nation\u2019s largest hospital chains, HCA, also known as the Hospital Corporation of America.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is functioning as intended,\u201d HCA said, and the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the law would produce consequences \u201cso absurd that Congress could not possibly have intended them.\u201d\n\nCiting its own experience, HCA said that after patients obtained insurance through the exchanges, they were less likely to use emergency rooms, more likely to receive proper care in outpatient clinics, and more likely to pay their share of hospital bills.\n\nProf. William N. Eskridge Jr. of Yale Law School, an expert on statutory interpretation, offered an argument calculated to appeal to conservatives like Justice Antonin Scalia who focus on the text of the law and scorn the use of legislative history as a guide to its meaning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven judges who exalt the text must not read one short phrase, \u201cestablished by the state,\u201d in a vacuum, Mr. Eskridge wrote in a brief joined by four other scholars.\n\n\u201cA statutory phrase that has one apparent meaning when read in isolation may have a different meaning when read in the context of the statute as a whole,\u201d Mr. Eskridge said, noting that the law declared its purpose to be providing affordable coverage \u201cfor all Americans,\u201d with the emphasis on \u201call.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Republican members of Congress, led by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, argue that the text of the health care law is \u201cperfectly clear.\u201d Congress, they say, deliberately chose to make subsidies available only for insurance bought through state exchanges.\n\nIn providing tax credits through the federal exchange, they say, the Obama administration has usurped the authority of Congress and tried to accomplish through an aggressive interpretation of the law \u201cwhat it could not accomplish in the halls of Congress.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who helped write the law, including Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate minority leader, told the court that they were much better qualified to explain its meaning.\n\n\u201cCongress never intended, or suggested to the states, that tax credits would only be available to individuals who purchased insurance on state-run exchanges,\u201d the Democrats\u2019 brief said.\n\nThe brief, filed also on behalf of more than 100 state legislators, added that state officials \u201cnever understood the tax credits to be limited to state-run exchanges.\u201d\n\nThus, it concluded, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201cmakes no sense in light of the text, history and purpose of the statute.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone":
