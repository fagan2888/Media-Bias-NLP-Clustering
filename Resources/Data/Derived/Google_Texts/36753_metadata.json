Donald Trump will be the featured guest on both NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press with Chuck Todd\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopolous\u201d to have his say on the upcoming GOP candidate debate, and much more.\n\n\u201cThe center of the debate stage: Chuck will talk to the GOP frontrunner as he prepares for his first debate,\u201d NBC advises in their lead-up to the broadcast, billing Mr. Trump as chairman and president, The Trump Organization.\n\nThe appearance follows weeks of media headlines about \u201cTrump talk\u201d dominating the weekly conversations which are must-see viewing among political insiders. There is some history here as well. In January, Mr. Todd told his audience, \u201cNobody\u2019s going to mistake Donald Trump for a presidential candidate, I don\u2019t think, other than Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire responded in a tweet, \u201cWord is that @NBCNews is firing sleepy eyes Chuck Todd in that his ratings on Meet the Press are setting record lows. He\u2019s a real loser!\u201d\n\nBoth Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee will also appear, along with Ben Carson, also a Republican presidential hopeful.\n\nPresidential hopeful Rick Perry called on Donald Trump to end his presidential ... more >\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting watching the rise of Donald Trump. Do you think that his rise has helped the idea of outsiders? Or does it hurt you right now as a candidate?\u201d Mr. Todd asks Mr. Carson during the Sunday broadcast.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a tremendous help. It\u2019s a tremendous aid because fewer people are talking about my lack of political experience now. And that\u2019s good because, you know, experience can come from a variety of different places. And certainly the life that [I] have led in my case - solving complex problems, being involved in corporate America, starting a national nonprofit - you get an enormous amount of experience doing these things, particularly in solving problems. It\u2019s an erroneous thought that only political experience is expedient,\u201d Mr. Carson replies.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Priebus will also be featured on ABC, along with GOP candidate Rick Santorum and Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Sunday morning talk shows could be a little more spirited than usual.
