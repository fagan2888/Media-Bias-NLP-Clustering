The facilities will be added to HCA's Sunrise Health System, which already includes four hospitals and four surgery centers.

According to HCA, the deal also includes six new urgent care centers that Urgent Care Extra was developing in the region.

HCA, one of the largest for-profit healthcare providers in the country, already runs 65 urgent care centers, including 24 it bought last year from CareNow in the Dallas market.

The company runs 168 hospitals and 114 surgery centers in the United States, with a few operating in the United Kingdom.
