Now, the attorney general\u2019s office says those allegations are unsupported, and an eyewitness says Hearns was actually unarmed and trying to pull up his pants as he ran.\n\nAccording to the attorney general\u2019s office, Hearns was one of three teenage boys questioned by three Targeted Integrated Deployment Effort (TIDE) officers near an apartment complex, after a shooting was reported nearby. An anonymous police source alleged Hearns ran away from the cops and reached for what the officers thought was a gun. At one point, they say, Hearns turned around while running and attempted to shoot at them. The three officers opened fire, hitting Hearns seven times in the legs and butt.\n\nEyewitness Rhonda Tirado, who watched the chase and shooting from her home, paints a different picture of what happened. Tirado alleges the boys were laughing and joking for 15 minutes before the cops arrived near her house, and agrees that the three males were confronted by the officers. She also contends Hearns tried to flee. But Tirado says the teenager looked like he was trying to pull his pants up \u2014 not grabbing a weapon.\n\n\u201cThose police were amped and they didn\u2019t give that little boy a chance,\u201d she explained to NJ.com. \u201cThere was no room for no chase. They just shot that little boy right there.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office has since conducted a preliminary investigation and concluded that the anonymous police source\u2019s claims are inconsistent with its findings. The family attorney representing the 14-year-old\u2019s family, Samuel Anyan Jr, maintains Hearns was unarmed. A .22-caliber handgun was discovered at the scene later, but investigators have not connected the weapon to the boy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think those little boys had no clue what was going on,\u201d Tirado continued. \u201cI think they was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d\n\nAll three officers are on administrative leave, and Hearns was released from the hospital on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I think they was at the wrong place at the wrong time.''", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"I think they was at the wrong place at the wrong time.''", "title": "Official Police Story About Shooting Of 14-Year-Old Begins To Unravel", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/08/17/3692333/investigation-pokes-holes-in-official-police-story-for-why-they-shot-a-14-year-old-boy/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17142932/AP_904587395578.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I think they was at the wrong place at the wrong time.''", "title": "Official Police Story About Shooting Of 14-Year-Old Begins To Unravel", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17142932/AP_904587395578-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@CarimahWheat", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17142932/AP_904587395578.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17142932/AP_904587395578.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-17T14:35:09+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carimahwritesstuff/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Now, the attorney general\u2019s office says those allegations are unsupported, and an eyewitness says Hearns was actually unarmed and trying to pull up his pants as he ran.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think those little boys had no clue what was going on,\u201d Tirado continued.\nAccording to the attorney general\u2019s office, Hearns was one of three teenage boys questioned by three Targeted Integrated Deployment Effort (TIDE) officers near an apartment complex, after a shooting was reported nearby.\nEyewitness Rhonda Tirado, who watched the chase and shooting from her home, paints a different picture of what happened.\nThey just shot that little boy right there.\u201dThe attorney general\u2019s office has since conducted a preliminary investigation and concluded that the anonymous police source\u2019s claims are inconsistent with its findings."}
