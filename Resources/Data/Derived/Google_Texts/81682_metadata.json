In a scathing editorial published by the Chicago Sun-Times, McCarthy denies the label \u201canti-vaccine\u201d in describing the case-by-case consideration many choosy moms undertake for every inoculation, large or small.\n\nHowever, McCarthy\u2019s Wikipedia page begs to differ. The biography continues to describe the co-host of ABC\u2019s The View as an \u201canti-vaccine advocate.\u201d\n\nIn the editorial, McCarthy wrote she\u2019d been \u201cwrongly branded\u201d as an anti-vaccine activist. \u201cI am not \u2018anti-vaccine,'\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is not a change in my stance, nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted.\u201d McCarthy says Americans should question the \u201cone size fits all\u201d ethos of childhood immunizations, arguing that \u201cvaccine injuries\u201d are affecting a growing number of children in the developed world.\n\n\"What happened to critical thinking? What happened to asking questions because every child is different?\" McCarthy wrote.\n\nMcCarthy first claimed her \u201cbeautiful son Evan\u201d \u2014 perhaps the most wussified adolescent boy in America \u2014 had developed ASD after receiving childhood immunization shots. In 2008, she told CNN that although she wasn\u2019t \u201canti-vaccine\u201d she supported alternative vaccine schedules.\n\n\"For my child, I asked for a schedule that would allow one shot per visit instead of the multiple shots they were and still are giving infants,\u201d she told CNN in 2008. \"I believe in the importance of a vaccine program and I believe parents have the right to choose one poke per visit. I\u2019ve never told anyone to not vaccinate, she said. \"I will continue to say what I have always said: One size does not fit all.\u201d God help us all if gray is no longer an option.\"\n\nYet \u201cgray\u201d is an option that continues to alarm epidemiologists who say the anti-vaccine movement has led to recent outbreaks in measles, an infectious disease eradicated from the United States and most of Western Europe. In 2011, a 22-year-old theater employee transmitted measles to at least four other people in New York City, two of whom had not been immunized against the disease.\n\nSimilar outbreaks in the U.S. and United Kingdom have occurred sporadically as global travelers return home with the infectious disease, among others. Though most of the population is vaccinated, small holes in \u201cherd immunity\u201d provide a disease reservoir threatening a significant portion of the human herd, as evidenced by a 2011 study. Even a relatively small vaccine failure rate of three to five percent would devastate a large American high school, says Robert Jacobson, director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group. As people age, they naturally lose immunity developed through childhood vaccinations, leaving an opening for disease. But \u201cthe most important \u2018vaccine failure\u2019 with measles happens when people refuse the vaccine in the first place,\u201d he told Science magazine this month.\n\nThe \u201canti-vaccine\u201d movement, promulgated by McCarthy and others, began with a now debunked article published in 1998 by The Lancet, whose author Tim Wakefield used faulty data to establish the supposed connection between ASD and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine known as the MMR. Still, scientists cannot fully explain the rising prevalence of ASD in America, with as many as one in 88 children falling along the spectrum.\n\nSource: Rosen JB, Rota JS, Hickman CJ, Sowers S, Mercader S.
