Police estimate 24,000 street children live nationwide. Many turn to crime, particularly theft, to survive, and a great number become involved in drugs themselves. A report in the International Business Times cites human rights groups working to help these children saying that the number of cases of arbitrary arrests of these children appear to be increasing as the Olympics draw near.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cMany smoke crack or sniff glue. Some live on the streets full time; others spend nights in the favelas, or nearby shantytowns,\u201d the report notes. Advocates for the children say they are increasingly spending their nights in jails. \u201cThe government will make a plan \u2014 a huge plan for the Olympic games \u2014 with the police, with the army, to clean the area, to let no poor person come in, to make sure no child is on the streets, to make everything beautiful,\u201d Daniel Medeiros, an advocate for street children affiliated with the group Happy Child International, tells the International Business Times. The positive image the government of leftist President Dilma Rousseff is selling to the world, he adds, is \u201cjust a big lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cStreet children\u201d are considered an eyesore as well as a threat. As many live on the streets and have little access to food, they resort to theft and drug smuggling to feed themselves.\n\nHappy Child International typically operates out of Recife and Belo Horizonte, Brazil. While some of its volunteers are working with street children in Rio de Janeiro, the group places much of its resources in Recife to help young children and pregnant teens. Recife is one of the cities hardest hit by the Zika virus, which has caused severe brain deformations in upwards of 4,000 newborns in Brazil alone. Scientists\u2019 most recent estimates suggest that over two billion people worldwide are at risk for contracting Zika, which often does not cause symptoms in its carriers, only to affect unborn children carried by mothers who do not know they have Zika. Zika is transmitted sexually and through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, common throughout the Western Hemisphere.\n\nEven before Zika became an international news story, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poor have sternly objected to hosting the Olympics there because it forces the government to divert funds out of essential services to pay for sports facilities. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the athletes but it\u2019s worse for my people, for the poor. There\u2019s no doctors, there\u2019s no hospitals, there\u2019s no schools, there\u2019s no teachers, there\u2019s nothing,\u201d Dinara de Almeida, a 17-year-old mother, told Vice earlier this month. Teachers and doctors are hardest hit by the lack of funding for state workers, forced to work unpaid for months or abandon a job necessary for the progress of their city.\n\nThe lack of necessary resources for the country\u2019s poor has triggered an especially acute backlash in the context of the sprawling embezzlement scandal known as \u201cOperation Car Wash.\u201d Prosecutors have accused dozens of politicians, including former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, of pocking government funds from the nation\u2019s oil conglomerate, Petrobras. President Rousseff is facing impeachment for misrepresenting the nation\u2019s economy, but many are calling for her resignation due to her support for da Silva, under which she served as Minister of Energy while the Petrobras scheme was ongoing.\n\nVice notes that some observers argue that bringing large-scale sports events to Brazil has triggered more violence and poverty among street children. According to UNICEF statistics, the number of minors killed doubled between 1993 and 2013, but spiked even more significantly following the 2014 World Cup. Vice also cites statistics showing the increase in police killings began with the year Rio de Janeiro hosted the Pan-American Games in 2007.\n\nThe World Cup, unlike the Olympics, spread the burden of hosting throughout the nation, from Rio de Janeiro and Recife to more inland locations like Belo Horizonte and Manaus. The strategy was controversial, with the Manaus venue especially troubling, as the city is located deep in the Amazon Rain Forest and heat and humidity posed a health threat to the athletes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Rio de Janeiro prepares for the Olympics, human rights activists warn that Brazilian authorities are detaining poor children.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "As Rio de Janeiro prepares for the Olympics, human rights activists warn that Brazilian authorities are detaining poor children.", "title": "Human Rights Groups Condemn Brazil for Hiding 'Street Children' in Jails Before Olympics - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/ap_ap-photo366-wi-e1454953610288.jpg", "height": 479}, "updated_time": "2016-04-26T16:08:33-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/04/26/rio-police-sweep-away-street-children-olympics/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Rio de Janeiro prepares for the Olympics, human rights activists warn that Brazilian authorities are detaining poor children.", "creator": "@francesmartel", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/ap_ap-photo366-wi-e1454953610288.jpg", "title": "Human Rights Groups Condemn Brazil for Hiding 'Street Children' in Jails Before Olympics - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Brazil, Olympics, Rio de Janeiro, street children, Summer Olympics,Breitbart Sports, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-04-26T09:38:39-07:00", "section": "Breitbart Sports", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:08:33-07:00", "tag": "Summer Olympics", "categories": "National Security,Breitbart Sports"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Vice notes that some observers argue that bringing large-scale sports events to Brazil has triggered more violence and poverty among street children.\nPolice estimate 24,000 street children live nationwide.\nRio de Janeiro and its outskirts are home to an estimated thousands of \u201cstreet children,\u201d many the children of gang members or drug abusers, left to fend for themselves.\nThere\u2019s no doctors, there\u2019s no hospitals, there\u2019s no schools, there\u2019s no teachers, there\u2019s nothing,\u201d Dinara de Almeida, a 17-year-old mother, told Vice earlier this month.\nWhile some of its volunteers are working with street children in Rio de Janeiro, the group places much of its resources in Recife to help young children and pregnant teens."}
