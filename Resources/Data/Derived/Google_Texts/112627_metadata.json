Paul Ryan (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nFor as long as Republicans preached the gospel of \u201crepeal and replace\u201d and then just \u201crepeal\u201d Obamacare, they also assured everyone that the popular parts of the Affordable Care Act would remain. Keeping your kids on your insurance policy until they are 26 would stay. So, too, would the ban on denying coverage due to a preexisting condition. But in an interview with Al Hunt of Bloomberg News, Ryan let the cat out of the bag. Repeal of Obamacare would mean repeal of everything.\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange between Ryan and Hunt. Read it carefully, and I\u2019ll meet you on the other side.\n\nHUNT: You think it will be repealed? RYAN: I don\u2019t think it can last. Yes. I think the architecture of this law is so fundamentally flawed that I think it\u2019s going to collapse under its own weight. And the sooner those of us who want true, real reform can show a better way forward, the faster we can repeal. And, yes, I really do believe in the next administration with a better Congress that we will replace this law and save the health care system from this really ugly moment that\u2019s \u2014 HUNT: Let me ask you then about what you \u2014 some of the things you might replace or not replace, just a couple provisions that are popular. There\u2019s some of Obamacare that \u2014 it bans insurance companies from discriminating for preexisting conditions. It lets you keep kids on your insurance until you\u2019re 26. It bars insurance companies from creating different rates for people with \u2014 who engage in physical labor, like roofers and waitresses. It closes the donut hole, $10 billion more for senior, for prescription drugs. Will those all survive? Will they be changed? RYAN: So we can go through each one of those? And I have an answer specifically for each one of those, but if you look at these kinds of reforms, where they\u2019ve been tried before, say the state of Kentucky, for example, you basically make it impossible to underwrite insurance. You dramatically crank up the cost. And you make it hard for people to get affordable health care. Here\u2019s the argument I would make. We can have in this country universal access to affordable health insurance for everybody, including people with preexisting conditions without a costly government takeover of one-sixth of our economy. HUNT: And you think \u2014 RYAN: We can do that. And I think there are better ideas and better reforms for getting at these very serious issues without these kinds of things that needlessly jeopardize the health care for people who\u2013 HUNT: To keep all those protections, kids on \u2014 RYAN: Yes, that was \u2014 that particular one was in the Republican alternative \u2014 HUNT: \u2014 and not discriminate against people who do physical labor, like roofers and \u2014 RYAN: There are better ways of dealing with those particular issues. HUNT: But still be covered? RYAN: Yes, and I think there are better ways of dealing with those very serious and legitimate issues without doing it this way, because I think this is the wrong approach. HUNT: And the same thing with filling the donut hole, so-called donut hole? RYAN: Look, how long do you have? Do you want to get into it all? HUNT: No.\n\nAccording to Ryan, Obamacare will collapse under its own weight. Not only must the law be repealed, but the provisions that are more popular than the law that makes them possible must go, too. He says they must be replaced by \u201cbetter ways of dealing with those very serious and legitimate issues\u201d without ever articulating what those \u201cbetter ways\u201d are.\n\n\u201cIn the interview, Congressman Ryan did not substantively respond to the question of how he would provide consumer protections for individuals with health issues in a more effective way than the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Linda Blumberg of the Urban Institute. \u201cFor a while, Republicans were saying they would keep the popular parts. But that was folly from my perspective.\u201d That\u2019s because you have to think of the ACA as a machine with a series of interlocking gears needed for proper and effective operation. Remove one and the whole thing falls apart.\n\nLet\u2019s take the provision that requires insurers to provide health coverage to those with preexisting conditions. As Blumberg explained to me yesterday, \u201cIf you have the preexisting condition provision but don\u2019t require insurers to issue a policy to all applicants, it won\u2019t help anyone who needs it. If you have guaranteed issue but don\u2019t require the same premiums regardless of health status, the sick won\u2019t be helped\u201d because then insurance companies could charge astronomical rates for policies that would make it difficult if not impossible for those with preexisting conditions to afford them. And \u201cif the other protections are in place but there is no individual mandate, then people will get coverage only after they get sick and that would collapse the entire private insurance market.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t have that happen. Not when the number of uninsured is falling fast. According to the latest Gallup poll, \u201cthe uninsured rate dipped to 15.6% in the first quarter of 2014, a 1.5-percentage-point decline from the fourth quarter of 2013. The uninsured rate is now at the lowest level recorded since late 2008.\u201d Gallup also said it was \u201ca sign that the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nBecause repealing Obamacare would strip millions of people of health insurance, Ryan\u2019s \u201cbetter ways\u201d word salad and its dearth of details are beyond inadequate. The ACA has been the law of the land for four years and was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court two years ago. That House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) today is saying his members are working on an alternative to Obamacare and need to \u201ccoalesce around a plan\u201d is ridiculous.\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "article_metadata": {"description": "Repeal of Obamacare would mean repeal of everything.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Repeal of Obamacare would mean repeal of everything.", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare repeal admission", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/04/08/paul-ryans-obamacare-repeal-admission/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/files/2014/04/ChairmanRyan-300x200.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@capehartj"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/04/08/paul-ryans-obamacare-repeal-admission/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, obamacare repeal, paul ryan obamacare, al hunt, al hunt paul ryan, bloomberg, al hunt bloomberg, affordable care act, Linda Blumberg, Urban Institute, individual mandate, pre-existing conditions, gallup health care, uninsured lowest since 2008,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, obamacare repeal, paul ryan obamacare, al hunt, al hunt paul ryan, bloomberg, al hunt bloomberg, affordable care act, Linda Blumberg, Urban Institute, individual mandate, pre-existing conditions, gallup health care, uninsured lowest since 2008,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1672\"", "article_summary": "He says they must be replaced by \u201cbetter ways of dealing with those very serious and legitimate issues\u201d without ever articulating what those \u201cbetter ways\u201d are.\nAccording to Ryan, Obamacare will collapse under its own weight.\nAnd you make it hard for people to get affordable health care.\nRepeal of Obamacare would mean repeal of everything.\nRep.
