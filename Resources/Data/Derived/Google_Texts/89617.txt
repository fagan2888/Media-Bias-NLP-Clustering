North Dakota Democrat Earl Pomeroy was one of a few dozen congressmen who lost their House seats in 2010 because they voted for Obamacare. Pomeroy even kind of apologized for his vote in one sort of sad TV ad.

For Aetna, Pomeroy lobbies only on “Health reform implementation,” according to his lobbying disclosures.

Pomeroy lobbies alongside that vaunted pro-Obamacare Kansas Republican Bob Dole for drugmaker Celgene. Pomeroy and team lobby on Obamacare for the Kidney Care Council, and other clients.

Health Republic Insurance of New York is an insurance co-op created under Obamacare. These plans were supposed to provide extra competition to the big insurers — a poor-man's public option.
