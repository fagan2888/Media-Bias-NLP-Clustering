Tom Dowd said Allen told police he remained on campus and was not a victim of criminal activity. Dowd said he couldn't elaborate, but added that police \"are still verifying information that we received.\"\n\nHe returned to his off-campus Boulder home, Dowd said.\n\n\"What's most important is he returned home and is safe,\" Dowd said.\n\nIn a statement from Allen's family posted on Facebook, they thanked \"everyone in Boulder, the fantastic detective's office, the university community, the students, the media in Colorado and Chicago and friends and strangers far and wide who have joined together with us in this effort to find our son.\"\n\n\"We couldn't have faced this crisis without you and we are without words to express to you the depths of our gratitude,\" they wrote.\n\nHis parents also wrote that Allen's roommates told them early this morning that Tyler had returned to his Boulder apartment on his own after seeing one of the missing posters -- and said he had been unaware of the search efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is currently in the hospital in Boulder and recuperating well,\" according to the family statement.\n\nSunday morning, a family representative wrote on the Find Tyler page on Facebook, which has been used to coordinate search efforts, \"TYLER HAS BEEN FOUND!!!!!

He was officially reported missing on April 18.\n\nHis mother, Sheryl Allen, previously told the Camera that it appeared most of her son's clothes were still in his room, but that he took his guitar and black case with him, along with a laptop, his wallet and his cellphone \u2014 which has been turned off.\n\nAllen's family organized a search of the Chautauqua trails on Wednesday, saying he was known to hike there, but found no sign of the missing student.\n\nThis weekend, the family had expanded their search efforts, turning their attention to the rest of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, Seattle and Austin, Texas.\n\nPolice had suggested those involved in the search contact bus and train stations, youth hostels, Salvation Army posts, hospital, mental health centers and homeless shelters.\n\nAllen, a communications major, transferred to CU from Clemson University in January.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27990977/family-tyler-allen-missing-cu-student-is-safe", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27990977:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-26T09:03:23-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder police and the family of Berry \"Tyler\" Allen, the University of Colorado student missing since April 11, announced today that the 20-year-old is safe, but raised more questions with the news that he was on the CU campus the entire time he was missing.", "title": "Boulder police: Tyler Allen, missing CU student, is safe, says he was on campus", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27990977/family-tyler-allen-missing-cu-student-is-safe", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0425/20150425__26DCATYLw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0425/20150425__26DCATYLw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-04-26T23:37:03-0600", "endDate": "2016-04-25T09:03:23-0600", "description": "Boulder police and the family of Berry \"Tyler\" Allen, the University of Colorado student missing since April 11, announced today that the 20-year-old is safe, but raised more questions with the news that he was on the CU campus the entire time he was missing.", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-04-26T09:06:26-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-26T09:03:23-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder police: Tyler Allen, missing CU student, is safe, says he was on campus", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27990977/family-tyler-allen-missing-cu-student-is-safe", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder police and the family of Berry \"Tyler\" Allen, the University of Colorado student missing since April 11, announced today that the 20-year-old is safe, but raised more questions with the news that he was on the CU campus the entire time he was missing.", "title": "Boulder police: Tyler Allen, missing CU student, is safe, says he was on campus"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0425/20150425__26DCATYLw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebed\"", "article_summary": "Tyler AllenBoulder police and the family of Berry \"Tyler\" Allen, the University of Colorado student missing since April 11, announced today that the 20-year-old is safe, but raised more questions with the news that he was on the CU campus the entire time he was missing.\nTom Dowd said Allen told police he remained on campus and was not a victim of criminal activity.\nAllen's family organized a search of the Chautauqua trails on Wednesday, saying he was known to hike there, but found no sign of the missing student.\nSunday morning, a family representative wrote on the Find Tyler page on Facebook, which has been used to coordinate search efforts, \"TYLER HAS BEEN FOUND!!!!!\nAllen, a communications major, transferred to CU from Clemson University in January."}
