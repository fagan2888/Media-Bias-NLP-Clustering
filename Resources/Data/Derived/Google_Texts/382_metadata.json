According to a new study published in Environmental Research Letters, the U.S., China, Russia, Brazil, India, Germany and the UK top the list.\n\nThe research, as digested by New Scientist:\n\nDamon Matthews of Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, and his colleagues calculated national contributions to warming by weighting each type of emission according to the atmospheric lifetime of the temperature change it causes. Using historical data, they included carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and changes in land use \u2013 such as deforestation. They also accounted for methane, nitrous oxide and sulphate aerosols. These together account for 0.7 \u00b0C of the world\u2019s 0.74 \u00b0C warming between 1906 and 2005. The US is the clear leader, responsible for 0.15 \u00b0C, or 22 percent of the 0.7 \u00b0C warming. China accounts for 9 percent, Russia for 8 percent, Brazil and India 7 per centeach, and Germany and the UK for 5 percent each.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. is by far the worst offender VIDEO", "title": "These 7 countries are responsible for over 60 percent of global warming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The U.S. is by far the worst offender VIDEO", "title": "These 7 countries are responsible for over 60 percent of global warming", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/17/these_7_countries_are_responsible_for_over_60_percent_of_global_warming/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-17-at-12.08.31-PM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. is by far the worst offender VIDEO", "title": "These 7 countries are responsible for over 60 percent of global warming", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-17-at-12.08.31-PM.png", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, Global Warming, greenhouse-gas emissions, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c28\"", "article_summary": "The US is the clear leader, responsible for 0.15 \u00b0C, or 22 percent of the 0.7 \u00b0C warming.\nTopics: Climate Change, Global Warming, greenhouse-gas emissions, Video, Sustainability NewsThroughout a century of climate-damaging activity, seven countries have emerged as the worst offenders.\nThese together account for 0.7 \u00b0C of the world\u2019s 0.74 \u00b0C warming between 1906 and 2005.\nAccording to a new study published in Environmental Research Letters, the U.S., China, Russia, Brazil, India, Germany and the UK top the list.\nChina accounts for 9 percent, Russia for 8 percent, Brazil and India 7 per centeach, and Germany and the UK for 5 percent each."}
