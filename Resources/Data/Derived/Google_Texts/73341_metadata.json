It was \u201ca lot like Mayberry,\u201d Huckabee told us. We saw where he played baseball and rode his bike. We learned that \u201cby the age of 16,\u201d Huckabee was already \u201ca successful statewide politician\u201d \u2013 because he was governor of Arkansas Boys State, \u201ca mock government program for kids that has shaped the lives of many leaders.\u201d\n\nAfterward, there was a chummy interview with the candidate. Kelly threw in a few semi-tough questions somewhere in the middle: \"This time around, the pundits say you have more competition\u2026 Some of the knocks on you have been that you are not conservative enough.\"\n\nBut before long, Kelly was slobbering: \"It\u2019s a miracle you got elected (governor of Arkansas). \u2026You were only the third Republican governor since Reconstruction in the state of Arkansas, it\u2019s not like this was a red state and yet you got to the top of it.\"\n\nIn the second part, Huckabee spent another 12+ minutes \u201cfacing America\u2019s voters.\u201d But it was only some of \u201cAmerica\u2019s voters.\" \u201cWe have gathered with us here a group of real, live Republicans,\u201d Kelly explained. If Huckabee wins the nomination, she\u2019ll do a group of Democrats and Republicans, she promised.\n\nThe \u201creal\u201d Republicans included Fox News contributor Deneen Borelli; Adam Green, CEO of a media company that works for Republicans; Pete Snyder, who bills himself as \u201ca conservative on the Fox News team;\u201d Republican strategist Brian Morgenstern; and Yevegeniy Feyman, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and whose ObamaCare Impact Map was deemed an \u201cindispensable tool\u201d by Karl Rove.\n\nTo be fair, the group asked substantive and insightful questions \u2013 with the possible exception of Rev. Jennifer Crumpton who wanted to know, \u201cWhat female character in the Bible best helps you to understand the struggles of women and why equal pay is so crucial for the social and economic stability of families?\u201d For the record, it\u2019s \u201cprobably Ruth.\u201d You can watch the clip below to get the rest of the answer.\n\nHowever, it was hardly the group of \u201cregular\u201d people that Kelly suggested.\n\nMeanwhile, near the end, Huckabee insisted that those who believe in \u201cnatural marriage\u201d are being criminalized. Nobody challenged him.\n\nInstead, Kelly closed by inviting Huckabee to take a gratuitous swing at Hillary Clinton. Does she need to hold a press conference or give an interview, Kelly asked, \u201cat some point soon to respond to what we\u2019ve seen in the Clinton Cash controversy?\u201d\n\nAs if there was anyone who couldn\u2019t guess what Huckabee would say.\n\nWatch the infomercial below, from last night\u2019s The Kelly File.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "b/wTHk0OE9ICKGoUfezjY/X5n+LuyByXPclvUsh7z28=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/megyn_kelly_hosts_a_fox_news_meet_and_greet_for_mike_huckabee_050615", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Megyn Kelly Hosts A Fox News Meet And Greet For Mike Huckabee"}, "Title": "Megyn Kelly Hosts A Fox News Meet And Greet For Mike Huckabee"}, "article_summary": "Megyn Kelly spent half her show last night giving her former colleague and newly-announced presidential candidate a warm introduction to Fox viewers.\n\u201cWe have gathered with us here a group of real, live Republicans,\u201d Kelly explained.\nKelly began with a 14-minute segment that included a lengthy biographical sketch and a palsy visit with Huckabee to his hometown of Hope, Arkansas.\nInstead, Kelly closed by inviting Huckabee to take a gratuitous swing at Hillary Clinton.\nIn the second part, Huckabee spent another 12+ minutes \u201cfacing America\u2019s voters.\u201d But it was only some of \u201cAmerica\u2019s voters.\""}
