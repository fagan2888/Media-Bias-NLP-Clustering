"The Shocking Secret Government Watchlisting Guide: The Intercept's Ryan Devereaux," produced by Anthony Fisher and Nick Gillespie.

Original release date was Aug. 1, 2014. Original writeup is below.

"It's been more than a decade since the September 11th attacks. The question is whether we're on this pendulum and we're going to swing back to some semblance of sanity when it comes to civil liberties," says The Intercept's Ryan Devereaux, who along with Jeremy Scahill, co-authored a shocking expose on the secret government guide to placing people on terrorist watchlists.

Devereaux spoke with Reason TV's Nick Gillespie about the 166 page document, approved by the Obama administration in March 2013 and developed by no less than 19 government agencies, which greatly expands the scope of the national terror watchlist.

It also substantially lowers the bar for placing a person on the list, definitively stating that "concrete facts are not necessary" for someone to be deemed reasonably suspicious and worthy of government surveillance.

About 7 minutes.

Produced by Anthony L. Fisher, with assistance from Brett Crudgington.
