Still, the latest national surveys suggest that Sanders has gained extraordinary momentum across the country by railing about the success of the wealthy and the plight of the working and middle classes.\n\nSanders\u2019 economic message is resonating both because it the right message for the moment and his passion is real. Who cares that he is ill-prepared for the White House? In the end, voters must.\n\nClinton faces a critical challenge in erecting a fire wall in South Carolina, with the support of the state\u2019s once-loyal African-Americans. Simply put, she will have to stop being her own worst enemy.\n\nWhile Sanders speaks authentically \u2014 and repetitively to a fault \u2014 Clinton often appears to calculate.\n\nWhile Sanders is people-powered, Clinton has collected large checks, and speaking fees, from big banks \u2014 poison in a populist political climate.\n\nWhile Sanders, lacking a record to speak of, is scandal-free, Clinton is dogged by sending and receiving State Department email on an unsecured home-brew server.\n\nAll of that said, Clinton would be a far stronger general election candidate than Sanders, and she far outpaces him in the ability to make strides once in office.\n\nFor her, politics is the art of the possible; for him, it\u2019s the art of yelling that fantasies will come true because they must come true.\n\nHe imagines free public college for all \u2014 the wealthy, the middle class and the poor alike \u2014 plus single-payer health care. His policies would expand the federal government by more than 40%, devour taxes and, inevitably, weigh down the economy.\n\nIn a blistering open letter, four former chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 liberals all \u2014 exposed the impossibility of Sanders\u2019 commitments.\n\n\u201cMaking such promises runs against our party\u2019s best traditions of evidence-based policy-making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIndeed, even Gerald Friedman, a liberal University of Massachusetts economist who outlandishly asserted that Sanders would grow the economy by leaps and bounds, has said that he\u2019ll vote for Clinton.\n\nMeantime, Sanders knows next to nothing about the world; he is plainly uncomfortable when asked to explain how he would answer threats to national security, and has yet to name foreign policy advisers.\n\nClinton, a strong center-left legislator and tough-minded secretary of state, has put forward pragmatic ideas that stand a chance in a divided Congress.\n\nShe would aim to raise wages through tax credits for the middle class and small businesses, as well as through major investments in infrastructure, basic science and energy.\n\nShe would work to fix Obamacare\u2019s weaknesses without throwing the nation back into an all-consuming debate over transforming its health care system.\n\nShe would bring down the cost of college \u2014 not via haphazard Sandersian spending, but by facilitating the refinancing of loans and help middle- and lower-income strivers meet expenses.\n\nShe has been a strong voice for gun safety regulations; Sanders has not.\n\nShe would face America\u2019s friends and enemies alike with unmatched experience.\n\nUnlike the Sanders sloganeering, the Clinton agenda doesn\u2019t fit on a postage stamp. She is arguing logic against passion. It\u2019s a tough sell. Now is the time, and South Carolina is the place, for her to make it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders has given Hillary Clinton more than a run for her money.", "title": "Waiting for Clinton: Time for Hillary to break through", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/waiting-clinton-time-hillary-break-article-1.2539680", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2539679.1456151153!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clinton.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "hillary clinton, bernie sanders, 2016 election, obamacare", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-22T14:28:04", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/waiting-clinton-time-hillary-break-article-1.2539680", "parsely-title": "Waiting for Clinton: Time for Hillary to break through", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-22T09:28:04-0500", "sailthru.title": "Waiting for Clinton: Time for Hillary to break through", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2539679.1456151153!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clinton.jpg", "description": "Bernie Sanders has given Hillary Clinton more than a run for her money.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Bernie Sanders has given Hillary Clinton more than a run for her money.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Bernie Sanders has given Hillary Clinton more than a run for her money.", "title": "Waiting for Clinton: Time for Hillary to break through", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/waiting-clinton-time-hillary-break-article-1.2539680", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2539679.1456151153!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "hillary clinton, bernie sanders, 2016 election, obamacare", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2539679.1456151153!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clinton.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Clinton faces a critical challenge in erecting a fire wall in South Carolina, with the support of the state\u2019s once-loyal African-Americans.\nHe now takes the fight to Clinton next Saturday in South Carolina, where he stands well behind her in state polls.\nSenator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton more than a run for her money.\nNow is the time, and South Carolina is the place, for her to make it.\nClinton, a strong center-left legislator and tough-minded secretary of state, has put forward pragmatic ideas that stand a chance in a divided Congress."}
