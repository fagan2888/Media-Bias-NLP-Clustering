Only one of the 18 insurers evaluated by the GAO complied.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to separately itemize and charge for abortion coverage, a compromise designed to prevent taxpayer funding of abortions. The compromise drew support from pro-life Democrats in 2010, and was crucial to overcoming Republican opposition. Federal law under the Hyde Amendment prohibits taxpayer funding of abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or threats to the life of the mother. President Barack Obama promised in March 2010 that the Affordable Care Act policies would adhere to the Hyde Amendment.\n\nBut the GAO report revealed taxpayer funding is likely subsidizing elective abortions. The report evaluated the 27 states and Washington, D.C., that do not restrict elective abortion coverage in their insurance markets. It found that 1,036 of the 2,098 subsidized plans in those states cover elective abortions. The 18 evaluated insurers offered a quarter of those policies. Although the GAO report didn\u2019t specify that taxpayer money funded abortions under Obamacare, it raised serious concerns.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

But without the separate charge, the information is difficult to obtain, the report found. Even abortion supporters have asked for clearer information on the coverage offered under insurance policies.\n\nLast year, Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., discovered the difficulty of determining the coverage offered in healthcare policies after congressmen were required to join Obamacare last year. After several months, Smith found that of the 112 health insurance plans available, 103 covered elective abortions, according to a news release.\n\n\u201cAmericans throughout the country have raised serious concerns that they find it nearly impossible to determine whether the plan they purchase finances the killing of unborn children\u2014there is little or no transparency\u2014hence the request by several members of Congress including [House Speaker John] Boehner that GAO investigate,\u201d said Smith, who also co-chairs the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department acknowledged in a written response that \u201cadditional clarification may be needed\u201d regarding the healthcare law\u2019s abortion coverage.\n\nIn response, pro-lifers have called for the passage of the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d authored by Smith. The House of Representatives passed the bill in January, but it met opposition in the Senate.\n\n\u201cNearly 60 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion,\u201d Nance said. \u201cThe House has acted by passing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act; it is time for Sen. [Harry] Reid and President Obama to rectify this broken promise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "Several insurance providers participating in Obamacare have violated a provision requiring separate itemization of abortion coverage, according to a Government", "title": "WORLD | GAO: Taxpayer funds likely paying for abortion under Obamacare | Courtney Crandell | Sept. 18, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2014/09/gao_taxpayer_funds_likely_paying_for_abortion_under_obamacare", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/ap439848217048.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "Several insurance providers participating in Obamacare have violated a provision requiring separate itemization of abortion coverage, according to a Government"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce495\"", "article_summary": "But the GAO report revealed taxpayer funding is likely subsidizing elective abortions.\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to separately itemize and charge for abortion coverage, a compromise designed to prevent taxpayer funding of abortions.\nAlthough the GAO report didn\u2019t specify that taxpayer money funded abortions under Obamacare, it raised serious concerns.\nSeveral insurance providers participating in Obamacare have violated a provision requiring separate itemization of abortion coverage, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released Monday.\nIn response, pro-lifers have called for the passage of the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d authored by Smith."}
