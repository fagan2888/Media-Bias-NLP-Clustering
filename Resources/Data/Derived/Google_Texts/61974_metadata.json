He left that to Ted Cruz. But given the Florida senator\u2019s reputation in GOP circles as a foreign-policy wonk, it\u2019s worth looking in some detail at just how ridiculous his response was. \u201cThe attacks in Paris,\u201d Rubio began, \u201care a wake-up call.\u201d Forgive the pedantry, but this is among the stupidest clich\u00e9s in politics. Wake-up calls are things you plan yourself because you want to be awoken from your slumber at a set time, usually by a hotel clerk. The Paris attack was a horrific surprise orchestrated by France\u2019s enemies. It wasn\u2019t a \u201cwake-up call\u201d unless you believe its ultimate author was France itself. Related Story A Change of Strategy for ISIS? The linguistic weirdness continues a couple of lines later. \u201cThis is not a geopolitical issue where they want to conquer territory and it\u2019s two countries fighting against each other,\u201d Rubio declared. \u201cThey literally want to overthrow our society and replace it with their radical, Sunni Islamic view of the future. This is not a grievance-based conflict. This is a clash of civilizations.\u201d Notice that Rubio never explicitly defines who \u201cthey\u201d are. According to the French government, the Islamic State perpetrated Friday\u2019s attacks. Rubio, however, said what occurred in Paris is a \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d But ISIS isn\u2019t a civilization. In parts of Iraq and Syria, it\u2019s a self-declared, though unrecognized, state. Elsewhere, it\u2019s a network of terrorist groups linked by a common ideology. \u201cCivilizations\u201d are cultural groupings. In calling the Paris attack a \u201cclash of civilizations,\u201d Rubio evoked Samuel Huntington\u2019s famed 1993 Foreign Affairs essay of the same name. In that essay, Huntington defined \u201ccivilization\u201d as \u201cthe broadest level of cultural identity people have.\u201d And he suggested that the world contains \u201cseven or eight\u201d major ones: \u201cWestern, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and possibly African.\u201d\n\nThe most straightforward way to interpret Rubio\u2019s statement, therefore, is that the civilizational \u201cthey\u201d that attacked Paris is Islam. Among the grassroots conservatives Rubio is wooing in his campaign for president, that\u2019s a popular view. After all, recent polling in states like Iowa and North Carolina suggests that upwards of one-third of Republicans would like to make Islam illegal in the United States. Rubio is doing exactly what the Islamic State wants: He\u2019s equating ISIS with Islam itself. Ben Carson and Donald Trump have indulged that sentiment crudely. Rubio, typically, is doing so more subtly. But it\u2019s worth noting how fundamentally his analysis diverges from that of both of America\u2019s post-9/11 presidents. George W. Bush said America was at war with an ideology that had \u201chijacked Islam\u201d in the same way Nazism had hijacked Germany or communism had hijacked Russia. Barack Obama has argued that even this assessment gives violent jihadists a stature they don\u2019t deserve. Rubio, by contrast, is going far beyond Bush. And he\u2019s doing exactly what the Islamic State wants: He\u2019s equating ISIS with Islam itself. Then there\u2019s the end of Rubio\u2019s statement: \u201c[T]hey do not hate us because we have military assets in the Middle East. They hate us because of our values. They hate us because young girls here go to school. They hate us because women drive. They hate us because we have freedom of speech, because we have diversity in our religious beliefs. They hate us because we\u2019re a tolerant society.\u201d This is simply false. The Islamic State may hate tolerance, liberty, and women\u2019s rights. But that\u2019s not why its cadres attacked Paris. A review of the organization\u2019s history makes this point clear. The Islamic State began in 2004 as al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraq affiliate, not because its then-leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, discovered that female motorists populate America\u2019s highways, but because America had just invaded Iraq. When the United States began withdrawing troops from the country, al-Qaeda in Iraq did not follow them home. It instead went to war against Iraq\u2019s Shiite-led government. Then, after the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011, it began fighting his Alawite regime as well, changed its name to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and declared a caliphate in the territory it controlled. \u201cFor more than a decade,\u201d notes the Georgetown University and Brookings Institution terrorism expert Daniel Byman, the Islamic State \u201cfocused first and foremost on its immediate theater of operations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A primer for Marco Rubio", "author": "Peter Beinart", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A primer for Marco Rubio", "title": "ISIS Is Not Waging a War Against Western Civilization", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/11/RTS73DS/facebook.jpg?1447609259", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/isis-paris-attacks-rubio-republicans/416085/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe attacks in Paris,\u201d Rubio began, \u201care a wake-up call.\u201d Forgive the pedantry, but this is among the stupidest clich\u00e9s in politics.\nRubio is doing exactly what the Islamic State wants: He\u2019s equating ISIS with Islam itself.\nRubio, however, said what occurred in Paris is a \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d But ISIS isn\u2019t a civilization.\nAnd he\u2019s doing exactly what the Islamic State wants: He\u2019s equating ISIS with Islam itself.\nWhen the United States began withdrawing troops from the country, al-Qaeda in Iraq did not follow them home."}
