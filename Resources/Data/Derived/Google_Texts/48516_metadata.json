Ms. Perino is currently a co-host on Fox News\u2019 The Five, and was President George W. Bush\u2019s last White House Press Secretary.\n\nCongratulations Ms. Perino on your new book,And the Good News Is\u2026: Lessons and Advice From the Bright Side! Can you give us an overview of your book, and what was your inspiration in writing it?\n\nI\u2019m so grateful to have had the opportunity to write the book \u2013 it was a lifetime in coming, I suppose. I have always loved to read, and I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d actually ever get to write a book. But then all of these terrific opportunities came my way \u2013 from love at first sight on an airplane to working at the White House and then to a new career in television news with one of the best, funniest shows on cable \u2013 and then I felt like I had something worthwhile to say.\n\nIn 2009, I started a mentoring group called Minute Mentoring, and that gave me an idea to combine the best stories from my time as the White House press secretary with my favorite advice for managing a career with a joyful heart. I didn\u2019t want to write a typical book about Washington and politics \u2013 I had no gossip nor scores to settle. I have been blessed, and I\u2019ve overcome personal weaknesses (like an obsession with worrying) and have realized that civility and joy is often a choice \u2013 one we get to make several times a day. And so the book has a hopeful, you too can do this, go-for-it type of feel.\n\nWhat three takeaways would you like readers to leave with after reading your book?\n\nThat you don\u2019t have to grow up in a big city or attend an Ivy League school to end up advising the President of the United States.\n\nYou can\u2019t plan or worry your young life away. The best things that happened to me were not planned. I was just ready to take a few risks and have an open heart and mind.\n\nAnyone who is successful has an obligation to help others \u2013 in my case, I think the career and life advice I provide in the book is practical and can apply to people of both genders and of all ages.\n\nAs President George W. Bush\u2019s last press secretary, you had a window into one of the most consequential presidential administrations in US history. How do you believe history will judge President Bush, the perceived good and bad?\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026and that\u2019s the good news! I used to think about it all the time, especially after we were well into the second term. I worried, fretted, wondered. But then President Bush told me, \u201cLook, last year I read three books about George Washington, so if the historians are still analyzing the first president, than the forty-third doesn\u2019t have a lot to worry about because he\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\nI tried to follow his lead and now seven years since we left the White House, I can see that President Bush was right. A president can\u2019t worry about how history will view him or her \u2013 they just have to do their best and then let history decide.\n\nHowever, one of the reasons I wrote the book is that I felt the history was incomplete without a view into the leadership of President Bush from someone who saw it up close. I don\u2019t discuss policy or political decisions in the book, but I do tell a lot of stories from behind the scenes about him as a leader and as a man. And even people who wouldn\u2019t have voted for him or decided they disagreed with him on most policies have told me that my book opened their eyes to what a remarkable person he is.\n\nAs a co-host on Fox News\u2019, The Five, what has been some your favorite moments working on set?\n\nThe commercial breaks \u2013 seriously, they are hilarious! Except for when we\u2019re fighting \u2013 and then they\u2019re interesting! I have loved the professional challenge of speaking on my own behalf, rather than for someone else. For so many years I was someone else\u2019s spokesperson, and it didn\u2019t ever faze me in the least. I could speak for the nation and not bat an eye.\n\nBut when I started speaking for myself, expressing my own opinions, I struggled at first. I was shy, unsure, and nervous. And Fox News gave me time to come into my own. And now I relish the freedom of being able to speak my mind, and to admit when I don\u2019t have an opinion (such as on the Kardashians \u2013 I mean I have. No. Opinion).\n\nFinally, when Greg Gutfeld gets me to collapse in a fit of giggles so much that I can\u2019t even read my tease, I just love that. No one else on cable news is having as much fun as I am.\n\nTell us a little more about yourself!\n\nFavorite Movie: I don\u2019t watch movies more than once, usually, but I do enjoy the film, Love Actually. This has caused some tension with my co-host, Greg Gutfeld. He hates the movie. I love it. We have a little war about it. Favorite TV Show: I loved Justified, but it\u2019s just finished its run. Right now my favorites are VEEP and Silicon Valley. Oh, and The Five! Favorite Food: Steak (I grew up on a cattle ranch!) Favorite Drink: Red wine and diet coke\u2026not mixed, but consumed at the same time. Favorite Band: Dierks Bentley Favorite US elected official: Gov. Nikki Haley Where do you get your news from primarily? EVERYWHERE \u2013 I love it. Start with The Wall Street Journal, NY Post in the morning, The Washington Post opinion page, Real Clear Politics, Drudge Report, National Review, Commentary, Weekly Standard, and whatever good I can find on Twitter. If you could meet any person, dead or alive, who would it be? My paternal great-grandparents. They emigrated from Italy and homesteaded in Wyoming in the late 1800s. I write in And the Good News Is\u2026 that they walked into one side of the American Dream and I walked out the other. It\u2019s a remarkable story and I\u2019d love for them to know what their sacrifice and hard work led to \u2013 the first Republican woman to be the White House Press Secretary. What do you do for fun? I try to have a little fun every day, and that usually includes doing something with our dog, Jasper. He\u2019s a Vizsla with a great personality, and so we take him with us wherever we can. With social media, I love taking pictures of him and then writing silly or clever captions that go along with them. We also spend a lot of time in South Carolina, my home away from home. It is a beautiful state with lovely people, and I find the casual recreation of walking, biking, kayaking, and porching (yes, it\u2019s a verb) to be the most fun I\u2019ve had in my adult life.\n\nWhat books, authors, or conservative-themed books, influenced your political philosophy and outlook on life?\n\nWe were a Lutheran family that attended church and Sunday School every week. I also was in the bell choir and the youth group. Of all the things that helped shape me, it was that practice which led to my faith, which I call upon every day to get me through life. It also helped me so much in school \u2013 I feel for kids who don\u2019t grow up knowing the Bible because there is so much in literature that won\u2019t be meaningful or recognizable to them.\n\nAs for other books, Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s A Wrinkle In Time is a book I read over and over as a kid. I think it shaped my feelings against conformity and strengthened my belief in the individual. Later on, The Fountainhead stuck with me. And I read Les Miserables over and over \u2013 partly for the love story, but also for the fight for freedom. And when I worked on Capitol Hill, someone gave me a copy of Peggy Noonan\u2019s What I Saw at the Revolution, and I realized for the first time that it was really OK to be a conservative woman.\n\nAnd because I grew up in an avid news consumer family, we always read the big magazines and I got to know George Will, Michael Barone, and Charles Krauthammer. I\u2019d also read Eleanor Clift and think how much I disagreed with her. It was a gradual awakening \u2013 not a lightning bolt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CBC sat down with Dana Perino to discuss her new bestselling book, And the Good News Is: Lessons and Advice From the Bright Side!
