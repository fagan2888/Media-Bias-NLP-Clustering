Fed critics, primarily on Republicans, worry that cheap money and record levels of liquidity-pumping could be creating negative consequences down the road.\n\nThis week's batch of economic reports no doubt will add to the debate, with GDP ringing up an impressive 2.8 percent third-quarter gain. However, even that strong quarterly gain pushed the year-over-year growth to only a tepid 1.7 percent, and much of the quarterly rise came about through inventory rebuild.\n\n(Read more: US growth surprises while jobless falls)\n\nReports outside of the daily grind, though, may have said more about market direction.\n\nTwo papers submitted by Fed economists suggest that the central bank would be best off waiting until unemployment drops to at least 6 percent and perhaps 5.5 percent before raising rates, a substantial drop from the 6.5 percent yardstick the Fed is using.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said the GDP numbers \"at the margin may bring on faster taper fears from the Fed. We're becoming comfortable with the view that the yield market is growing slightly less bothered by the peak stock for the Fed's balance sheet,\" he said.\n\n\"Focus is instead shifting to how long short rates will remain low. And on account of latest papers from leading in-house economists at the Fed, that date is creeping out to 2017.\"\n\n(Read more: Fed could be about to make a major policy change)\n\n\n\nThe Fed, then, may win the argument now that the economy is not as close to escape velocity as Carpenter indicated, as market forces have tended to shape policy more than economic data.\n\nPatience for central bank policy, though, may be thinning both in the halls of Congress and in the financial markets.\n\n\"Overall, the pick-up in GDP growth will presumably add to the speculation that the Fed might yet begin tapering its asset purchases in December, even though the (European Central Bank) is loosening monetary policy in the euro-zone,\" Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. \"Frankly, it's hard to know exactly what precise improvement Fed officials are looking for after all the flip-flopping.\"\n\n\u2014By CNBC's Jeff Cox.
