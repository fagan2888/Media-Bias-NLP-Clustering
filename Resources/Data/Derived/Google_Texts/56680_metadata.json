Sources tell CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave special Transportation Security Administration teams are being assigned to large airline hubs, and investigators are watching potential suspects.\n\nTrain derailment\n\nAbout 5,000 residents of Maryville, Tennessee, are waiting to find out when they can go home after being evacuated more than 24 hours ago due to the derailment of a train car that caught fire. It was filled with a toxic chemical, reports CBS News Correspondent Omar Villafranca.\n\nMall threat?\n\nAn Army sergeant was in his company's custody at Fort Bragg in North Carolina this morning after being called a threat to the public.

Here's a look at what they have planned.\n\nIP address shortage\n\nBehind every laptop or tablet that goes online, behind every web address, behind every stack of servers, there's an IP address. These strings of numbers and dots act as unique identifiers for the devices and domains on the Internet and enable them to communicate with each other and send information back and forth. And we're running out of them.\n\nDoctor shortfall?\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has sparked plenty of heavy disagreement and debate, including about what its true cost might be, how the system can deliver better care while reining in costs, and even whether Congress has the right to draft such legislation in the first place. But even with all those questions, one has received little notice: Will we have enough health care professionals to handle a growing and aging population?\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nThis weekend, fans of the Grateful Dead are flocking to Chicago to see one of rock 'n' roll's most revered bands unite one last time.
