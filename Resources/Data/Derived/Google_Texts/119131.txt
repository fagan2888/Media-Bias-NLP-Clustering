When the university finally opened up after several weeks of silence on the matter, the administration did not condemn the unnecessary and spiteful attack by a member of its faculty. Instead, it attacked the “anti-abortion crusaders” and “evangelical types” who came to campus “to provoke us, to taunt us and attempt to turn us against one another.”

Michael D. Young, vice chancellor for student affairs, on Wednesday sent a campus-wide e-mail regarding “Student Free Speech at UCSB.” Young decried those “who peddle hate and intolerance with less-than-noble aims” while failing to mention the professor who attacked a peaceful demonstrator.

In the e-mail, obtained by National Review Online, Young informed students that Miller-Young’s underage victim is simply a member of “the most recent generation of true believers, self-proclaimed prophets, and provocateurs.” Young wrote that students came to him saying they felt “outrage, pain, embarrassment, fear, hurt, and feelings of harassment” because of the demonstrators.

However, the vice chancellor ultimately provided a backhanded defense of the demonstrators’ right to be on campus (within a designated free-speech zone). He wrote that “our Founding Fathers — all white men of privilege, some even slave owners — got it right when designing the First Amendment of the Constitution.”
