The Obamacare “enrollment tool” is “down,” according to a representative answering questions at Healthcare.gov’s phone number.

The representative made the comments to insurance broker and blogger Dave Petno, who posted the conversation he had with an “Obamacare supervisor” Friday morning.

“The system is not available, it’s not you, it’s not accepting information. So once it becomes available you’ll be able to log on with your current information,” the supervisor told Petno.

Another operator speaking with The Daily Caller on Obamacare’s “1-800” number Friday afternoon explained that operators have been encouraging people who call to try the online feature in a few days.

“We are diligently trying to get those systems up and running more proficiently to where our consumers can get on and navigate the system and they are giving us a timeframe of around Oct. 15,” the operator told The Daily Caller.

When pressed about whether potential applicants would be able to sign up before Oct. 15, the operator encouraged filling an application out with him.

The supervisor reached by Petno insisted that Healthcare.gov is not down completely, just the application system.

“Healthcare.gov is working, the enrollment tool is not,” she said.

When Petno asked why there is no notification on website that the application tool is down, the supervisor said “that has been suggested, so the idea has been sent to the people that would make that decision.”

“I understand. It is very frustrating to keep trying it over and over,” the supervisor said.
