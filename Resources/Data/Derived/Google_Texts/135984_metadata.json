It's usually a busy time of the year with parents bringing in children for flu season, but this year, there's some extra traffic.\n\n\"We've been receiving a lot of phone calls about measles, and measles exposure, and measles vaccination and if people need to be further vaccinated,\" Jennifer Tegethoff said.\n\nIt's because of the news that the number of cases of measles is on the rise in the area.\n\nThe nine people that are confirmed to have measles range in age from 19 months to 41 years old. All nine cases are from an extended family group, eight of them are from right here in Mitchell, and one is from out of state.\n\nPediatrician Jennifer Tegethoff says there's another big key to the nine cases - they were all unvaccinated.\n\n\"It's pretty easy from one person to another unvaccinated person. It's transmitted by respiratory droplets by close contact. It can be transmitted through the air for even up to a couple hours after somebody has been in a certain location,\" Tegethoff said.\n\nThe Avera clinic is using precautions to keep the diagnosing and treating of the disease to one location. As for what people can do to stay healthy, Tegethoff says just make sure you're vaccinated.\n\n\"I think this is a really prime example of a case where we do have a vaccine preventable disease that we're now having spread throughout our community because of some unvaccinated individuals,\" Tegethoff said.\n\nA serious virus with a simple solution.\n\nThese nine people are the first confirmed cases in South Dakota since 1997.\n\nIf you're not sure if you or your family members are up to date on your vaccinations, you should contact your doctor.\n\nHealthBeat\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
