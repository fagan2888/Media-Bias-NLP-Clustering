Mobile app usage jumped by 76 percent in 2014, according to a report released Tuesday by analytics firm Flurry, part of Yahoo. Chances are you\u2019re reading this on a mobile device, so that number won\u2019t shock you. It\u2019s actually down significantly from 115 percent growth in 2013.\n\nRelated: How Apple Won Christmas 2014 \u2014 and the Year in Mobile\n\nBut the key drivers of the 2014 surge are noteworthy: Use of lifestyle and shopping apps grew 174 percent, while use of utilities and productivity apps increased by 121 percent. The number of messaging and social media sessions more than doubled as well, building on more than 200 percent growth the previous year.\n\n\u201cAs our mobile devices become more and more a part of our everyday lives, we are increasingly using them for always-on shopping, working, and communication,\u201d Simon Khalaf, Yahoo\u2019s VP of Flurry Products, said in a blog post. \u201cWhere years past have seen massive growth in games and entertainment, 2014 was the year apps got down to serious business.\u201d\n\nOr, to be more specific: serious shopping. \u201cWhile 2013 was the year messaging apps took off, 2014 was the year retail came to mobile in a big way,\u201d Khalaf notes. While many other categories saw decelerating growth compared with 2013 \u2014 part of the maturation of mobile \u2014 the 174 percent jump in the lifestyle and shopping category represented a sharp increase from 77 percent growth the year before. On Android devices, shopping soared by 220 percent.\n\nRelated: Why Mobile Retail Still Needs Fixing\n\nFlurry found that mobile shoppers, unsurprisingly, tend to do their browsing and buying at 9 a.m., during their commutes or when they first get into work; at noon, around their lunchtime break, and then again around 8 p.m., once they\u2019re home. \u201cRetailers need to adjust to the new reality of a multitude of stores in every consumer\u2019s pocket, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,\u201d Khalaf writes.\n\nOther categories growing more quickly than they did in 2013 included Sports, up 74 percent in 2014, and News and Magazines, up 49 percent. By contrast, the growth in gaming and entertainment categories slowed significantly from 2013 to 2014. That, combined with the shopping explosion and continuing growth in the Utilities & Productivity category, shows that 2014 really was the year the mobile revolution came of age.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Our appetite for apps just keeps on growing.", "title": "The Apps Explosion Got Serious in 2014 as Usage Jumped 76%", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/06/Apps-Explosion-Got-Serious-2014-Usage-Jumped-76", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Candy_Crush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/06/Apps-Explosion-Got-Serious-2014-Usage-Jumped-76", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Candy_Crush.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Our appetite for apps just keeps on growing.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhere years past have seen massive growth in games and entertainment, 2014 was the year apps got down to serious business.\u201dOr, to be more specific: serious shopping.\nMobile app usage jumped by 76 percent in 2014, according to a report released Tuesday by analytics firm Flurry, part of Yahoo.\n\u201cWhile 2013 was the year messaging apps took off, 2014 was the year retail came to mobile in a big way,\u201d Khalaf notes.\nRelated: How Apple Won Christmas 2014 \u2014 and the Year in MobileBut the key drivers of the 2014 surge are noteworthy: Use of lifestyle and shopping apps grew 174 percent, while use of utilities and productivity apps increased by 121 percent.\nThat, combined with the shopping explosion and continuing growth in the Utilities & Productivity category, shows that 2014 really was the year the mobile revolution came of age."}
