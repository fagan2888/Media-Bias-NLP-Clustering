Bill Haslam\u2019s proposal to extend health coverage to 200,000 low-income Tennesseans, on Friday decried what he called \u201cdishonest scare tactics\u201d by a conservative group running radio ads targeting GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe Tennessee chapter of the Americans for Prosperity, the organization backed by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, this week began running a 60-second radio ad accusing Republican state Rep. Kevin Brooks of Cleveland of \u201cbetraying\u201d a promise to oppose President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nCasada said the group should spend its time opposing liberal lawmakers and \u201cnot dedicated individuals like Rep. Kevin Brooks and the other conservative members of our Republican Caucus who have chosen to seek additional input before making a decision on behalf of their constituents.\u201d\n\nHaslam has called a special legislative session to start on Feb. 2 to take up his proposal, which he calls a market-based approach to covering more people and lowering health care costs.\n\nThe Republican governor has launched a statewide tour to promote his Insure Tennessee plan, which is causing heartburn among some in his party because it would draw on money available under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cThis is not Obamacare,\u201d Haslam told reporters after the first stop of the tour in Jackson this week. \u201cThis is a different program that puts incentives in there for healthy behavior both on the user side and on the medical care provider side.\n\n\u201cAnd it won\u2019t cost Tennessee taxpayers another dime,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers last year enacted a law requiring Haslam to obtain their approval before expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Supporters called the measure the \u201cStop Obamacare Act,\u201d and the new radio ads target Brooks and other Republicans who voted for the bill for not dismissing Haslam\u2019s proposal out of hand.\n\nCasada said that while he agrees with the principles of Americans for Prosperity, he disagrees with its campaign against his colleagues.\n\nAndrew Ogles, the organization\u2019s state director, said in a statement that Americans for Prosperity \u201cwill continue to hold members accountable regardless of their political affiliation for promises they made to their constituents.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can put a pretty wrapper on it, but Insure Tennessee is still Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
