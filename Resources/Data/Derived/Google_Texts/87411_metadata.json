She married and had a second child, but later separated from her husband. While pursuing her degree, her sons attended Early Head Start, where the family benefitted from early childhood education, preventive healthcare and nutrition classes and parental instruction.\n\nWith two semesters left to earn her degree, Hagy\u2019s financial aid was exhausted. She turned to a Workforce Development program where prerequisite testing and a career assessment determined she would \u201clikely be successful in the nursing field.\u201d The program then paid for her tuition, books, uniform and stethoscope, as well as her state board exam fees.\n\nHagy graduated in May and works full-time as a cardiac nurse. She works twelve-hour rotations and \u201cnursing students [now] shadow me.\u201d She and her children no longer need government assistance, and Hagy has remarried and purchased her first home.\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine where my life would be right now if it weren\u2019t for the support and opportunities that were given to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I as a single mother of two\u2014one of whom has special needs\u2014can do it, anyone can.\u201d\n\nBut it is this very notion that \u201canyone can\u201d that is at stake in the current public policy debate, and Half in Ten explores that in a comprehensive manner in its report. It proposes that indeed people are worth investing in so that they can succeed and contribute to society; and that our country has the wealth to ensure that those who can\u2019t work, or can\u2019t find work with decent wages, can obtain the services needed to escape poverty.\n\nThe report focuses not only on the 46.5 million people living in poverty, but also on the more than one in three Americans\u2014106 million of us\u2014who live below twice the poverty line, on less than $36,600 annually for a family of three. While these families and individuals might not officially be in poverty, they are struggling to afford the basics\u2014food, housing, healthcare, education\u2014and are just a single hardship away from poverty.\n\nThe report suggests that the biggest obstacles to the kind of \u201cshared prosperity\u201d we had in the three decades following World War II\u2014where all incomes were lifted by an expanding economy\u2014are slow and inequitable economic growth and a proliferation of low-wage work, all exacerbated by the sequester and austerity policies. Ad Policy\n\nNot only does the United States have the most extreme economic inequality it\u2019s seen since the 1920s, but in the past three years the top 5 percent have had income growth of more than 5 percent, while the bottom fifth has seen its income fall by .8 percent (middle-class incomes have fallen even more over this same period).\n\nJared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said at the release event that of all the factors contributing to contemporary growth in poverty, economic inequality is the most significant.\n\n\u201cThe largest factor for increasing poverty rates over the last thirty or forty years is the increase in economic inequality,\u201d said Bernstein. \u201cEconomic inequality added [about] 5 percentage points to the growth of poverty over this period. If the economy is growing but the growth isn\u2019t reaching the bottom half, then you\u2019re going to have more poverty.\u201d\n\nOf course, the best anti-poverty program is a job that pays a decent wage. But the report notes that the economy needs to add 8.3 million jobs to reach pre-recession employment levels, and at the current rate of growth that would take until 2018. Meanwhile, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the sequester will result in \u201cthe loss of nearly 1 million more jobs by the third quarter of 2014.\u201d\n\nAs for decent wages, too many of the jobs in this recovery pay low wages. The report points out that more than 40 percent of job growth in 2012 occurred in low-wage sectors. Many of these jobs pay the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour\u2014a poverty wage that leaves a full-time worker earning approximately $15,000 per year. (The tipped minimum wage is just $2.13 an hour, which results in the people who serve us our food being twice as likely to need food stamps as the general population.) If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation it would stand at $10.75 an hour; if it had kept pace with increased productivity it would be $17.19.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work to pass an increase in the minimum wage, and you can rest assured that the president will continue to exert his leadership,\u201d said Secretary Perez, who delivered an impassioned speech that in part celebrated the historic decision to extend minimum wage and overtime protections to homecare workers.

Subscribe\n\nBut when I asked whether the president would sign an executive order to give priority to federal contractors who pay a living wage, Perez offered no such assurance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking into a range of interventions to address the issue of poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at every tool in our arsenal.\u201d\n\nIf we can\u2019t take common-sense action on the sequester and wages, it\u2019s tough to envision how we get to other smart policies recommended in the report, unless we build a broad-based movement that is visible, disruptive and ongoing\u2014as we have seen with marriage equality and immigration reform. The report recommends creating a Pathways Back to Work Fund which would include temporary, subsidized jobs\u2014supported by both Democratic and Republican governors\u2014as well as summer and year-round employment opportunities for low-income youth (14 percent of young people ages 16 to 24 are neither in school nor working); investing in jobs that will rebuild and modernize our infrastructure; passing paid leave legislation so that low-income workers don\u2019t have to choose between their paycheck\u2014and maybe keeping their job or making rent\u2014and caring for themselves or a sick child (only 34 percent of low-wage workers had access to paid sick leave in 2013); and expanding access to higher education and skills training\u2014funding for the Workforce Investment Act has declined by $500 million since 2010.\n\nBut as long as wages remain low, and job growth is slow, then the safety net is going to continue to be strained\u2014even more so if congressional (mostly, but not entirely) Republicans are successful in their efforts to cut it further. Food stamps (SNAP) kept a record 4 million people out of poverty last year, but benefits were cut last week and both the House and Senate are now deliberating further cuts in Farm Bill negotiations. The Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit lifted 9.4 million people above the poverty line in 2011, but as the report notes a budget deal only extended the expansions of these credits through 2017, while it made the Bush era tax cuts permanent for most Americans. The percentage of uninsured people fell from 15.7 percent to 15.4 percent last year, but medical out-of-pocket costs also pushed 10.6 million families into poverty in 2011, and 27 Republican governors are currently refusing Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. If all states opted into Medicaid expansion, 17 million Americans could gain health coverage. Welfare reform is still hailed by many in both parties as a success, but it resulted in cash assistance (TANF) reaching only 25 of every 100 families in poverty compared to 68 for every 100 in 1996. Ad Policy\n\n\u201cI was a food stamp recipient,\u201d said Congresswoman Lee. \u201cIf it had not been for the safety net, and my government, and an opportunity to go to college, I never would be where I am today.\u201d\n\nLee said repeatedly that there is a need for a \u201cgrassroots movement\u201d if we are to change the conversation in Washington and make the kinds of sensible investments in people that this report outlines.\n\nStegman said there is a hunger for the kind of movement Lee is calling for among Half in Ten\u2019s grassroots networks across the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I hear constantly is \u2018we are sick and tired of the debate as it is right now. We are sick and tired of the cuts, we don\u2019t even know where they are coming from,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know what sequestration is versus the last round of cuts that happened through appropriations. What they know is it\u2019s the wrong track.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis January will mark fifty years since President Johnson waged a War on Poverty. We have to build on what works, but also recognize that our economy and country have undergone dramatic shifts since then, and our laws and workplaces haven\u2019t caught up,\u201d said Melissa Boteach, director of Half in Ten. \u201cWe can\u2019t just get stuck fighting defensive battles, even though it\u2019s important to oppose austerity policies. We have to show an alternative path forward, and fight for our country to invest in people.\u201d\n\nIf you read this entire 113-page report, I guarantee that you will know more about anti-poverty policy and the necessary battles that lie ahead than most members of Congress. There is so much in the report that deserves attention that I don\u2019t have space for: the fact that the employment rate for people with disabilities is just 17 percent\u2014their poverty rate more than 28 percent\u2014and that programs like Supplemental Security Income and the Earned Income Tax Credit could be strengthened to reverse these trends; that childcare assistance policies are worsening in twenty-seven states in 2012, making it harder for single mothers\u2014who have a poverty rate of 42.5 percent\u2014to go to work; the sequestration cut of $4.2 billion in 2013 funding for children\u2014concentrated in the areas of education, early learning and housing\u2014comes at a time when more than one in five children live in poverty.\n\nBut in the end, it might all come down to this: when you consider Chelsey\u2019s story\u2014and those of other families and individuals who are profiled throughout the report\u2014do you think human capital is worth investing in, and that people are worth protecting from severe hardship? If so, how hard are you willing to fight for that?\n\nBecause don\u2019t doubt for a second that it won\u2019t require a real, sustained and hard fight to follow the kind of roadmap provided by Half in Ten in this report.\n\nEvents/Get involved\n\nWendy\u2019s Founder\u2019s Week-of-Action with Coalition of Immokalee Workers\n\nTell Congress to Protect SNAP\n\nTell the House: The time is now for Comprehensive Immigration Reform\n\nOrganizing Meeting: DC Restaurant Workers organizing around increasing tipped minimum wage and expanding paid sick days for all restaurant workers.
