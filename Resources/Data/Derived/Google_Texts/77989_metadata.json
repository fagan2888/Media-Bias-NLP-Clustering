He's published more extensive details in his blog.\n\nBonewitz says, \"Together, CIGNA and Zotec Partners' unscrupulous methods have made disputing medical bills enormously convoluted with the intent of placing an unnecessary burden on members.\"\n\nThe suit states, \"This manipulative process has resulted in artificially increasing the risk of ALL CIGNA members.\"\n\nFurther, Bonewitz reveals CIGNA's unconscionable inside practices; corrupt internal investigation, containing the employee who reports fraud, and isolating Compliance; in order to conceal wrongdoing.\n\nBonewitz also alleges that CIGNA members paid higher premiums than they would have paid had Zotec coded following 'best practices' with physician supervision and not specifically to have certain claims accepted to meet CIGNA's needs. He holds CIGNA and Zotec Partners equally responsible.\n\nBonewitz maintains that CIGNA committed consumer fraud and fraudulently induced him to purchase its health insurance services; indicating that CIGNA's gross violations of trust have immensely devalued the premium and have compromised the value of care. He claims negligence in their not investigating false claims and actively suppressing negative information including numerous lawsuits, fines and charges filed against the company. In addition he alleges that CIGNA committed wire fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nBonewitz also has wrongful termination lawsuits filed against CIGNA/HealthSpring and Zotec Partners for Violations of the False Claims Retaliation Provision (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730 (h)). He claims that both companies wrongfully terminated him after he brought concerns that they were also defrauding Medicare/CMS.\n\nIn October 2011, just after reporting his concerns to CIGNA a nationwide FBI fraud bust occurred that involved several major HealthSpring providers. Bonewitz indicated to attorneys that this was proof that CIGNA/HealthSpring was not looking for specific false claims that artificially raise risk and wanted them to occur. Days later Bonewitz's data access was removed per instruction of 'the owners' and then he was suspended.\n\nBonewitz further maintains that he suffered damages as a result of controversial testosterone treatments that he believes were wholly unnecessary and are being wrongfully accepted by CIGNA in order to artificially increase male risk.\n\nSince Bonewitz's wrongful termination he has been tracking CIGNA's actions and has reported concerns that CIGNA may be deliberately funneling revenue through third-party companies in order to conceal data and dilute profits.\n\nRevelations from these lawsuits could have serious implications on CIGNA's global business partnerships in Europe and Asia.\n\nBonewitz seeks to depose key witnesses and reveal critical evidence related to the wrongdoings. He is seeking compensation of an estimated $100 million for appropriate back pay and loss of future earnings; emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish and loss of enjoyment of life; punitive damages; attorney's fees; and costs.\n\nTo learn more about the fraud concerns and to find out if they may be relevant to you go to www.HealthFraudAlert.com.
