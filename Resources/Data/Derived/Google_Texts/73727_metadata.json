A senior FBI official told ABC News the inaction by the DOJ \u201crisks creating the perception of a cover-up.\u201d\n\nNo kidding.\n\nIt\u2019s not like this sort of corruption charge is wildly out of character for Reid. Even the mainstream press has picked up the foul stench of his past activities.\n\nIn 2012, Reuters reported that Reid had been doing yeoman\u2019s work on behalf of a Chinese energy firm, ENN, that wanted to build a $5 billion solar panel plant in Nevada. Turns out Reid\u2019s son Rory worked at the law firm representing that very same company.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that in 2004 and 2005, Reid earmarked $21.5 million for a bridge linking a gambling resort town in Nevada with a city in Arizona where Reid just happened to own 160 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nReid also reportedly funneled some $47 million in earmarks that directly benefited organizations his son Key was affiliated with. And last year, a close Reid friend, Harvey Whittemore, was found guilty of directing more than $130,000 worth of illegal funds into Reid\u2019s re-election war chest.\n\nJust because the DOJ roadblock protects both Reid and Lee doesn\u2019t necessarily absolve the agency of playing politics. Since the two cases are intertwined, officials could hardly let one go forward while keeping the other bottled up.\n\nThen there\u2019s this to consider: Reid has been and continues to be President Obama\u2019s most potent weapon in Congress, willing to do anything to help the president.\n\nIn the 2012 presidential campaign, he willingly debased himself by claiming, without a shred of evidence, that Mitt Romney hadn\u2019t paid income taxes for years.\n\nThis year, he debased the entire institution of the Senate by blowing up the filibuster rules so Obama could get his extremist pals on the federal bench and in key administration posts.\n\nNow Reid is waging war against two private citizens who dared to attack ObamaCare \u2014 standing on the Senate floor to denounce them as \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nHis cretinous behavior on behalf of Obama only makes the Justice Department\u2019s stonewalling of the Utah investigation all the more suspicious.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Corruption: While the Justice Department was busy compiling a case against Obama critic Dinesh D'Souza for minor campaign-law violations, it was blocking a more", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Corruption: While the Justice Department was busy compiling a case against Obama critic Dinesh D\u2019Souza for minor campaign-law violations, it was blocking a more troubling probe involving the \u2026", "title": "Why Is Obama\u2019s DOJ Shielding Reid From Corruption Probe?", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/is-obama-doj-protecting-harry-reid-from-a-federal-corruption-investigation/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDeditorials"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-03-14 15:33:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-14T15:33:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf425\"", "article_summary": "Just because the DOJ roadblock protects both Reid and Lee doesn\u2019t necessarily absolve the agency of playing politics.\nA senior FBI official told ABC News the inaction by the DOJ \u201crisks creating the perception of a cover-up.\u201dNo kidding.\nIt\u2019s not like this sort of corruption charge is wildly out of character for Reid.\nReid also reportedly funneled some $47 million in earmarks that directly benefited organizations his son Key was affiliated with.\nIn one incident being investigated, Reid allegedly switched sides and sponsored an online gambling bill after he allegedly received money from the industry."}
