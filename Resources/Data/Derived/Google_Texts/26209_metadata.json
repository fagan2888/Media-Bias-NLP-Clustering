Let\u2019s see.\n\nThe subhead to Schultheis\u2019 article is \u201cThe party that deployed \u2018war\u2019 rhetoric to help defeat Mitt Romney is looking for less divisive ways to reach female voters this cycle.\u201d Oh, please. This would be almost amusing if it weren\u2019t just as deceiving (and misleading) as the empty-headed \u201cwar on women\u201d clich\u00e9.\n\nAs I read the article, I thought of the memorable quote attributed to pro-abortion former Vice President Al Gore: \u201cWhen you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. When you have the law on your side, argue the law. When you have neither, holler.\u201d\n\nPro-abortion Democrats are desperately looking are images and issues that they can twist so as to holler that Republicans are actively hostile to women.\n\nAs we noted in \u201cObamaCare\u2019s unfavorable numbers in July worse yet,\u201d pro-abortion Democrats do not want to talk about ObamaCare which includes (among other objectionable provisions) massive federal tax subsidies to assist many millions of Americans to purchase private health plans that will cover abortion on demand.\n\nNor do they want to talk about laws to protect unborn children capable of feeling pain from the horrors of abortion. Pro-abortion Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nv.) simply won\u2019t bring up the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (S. 1670).\n\nAs the National Journal article makes clear, instead of these issues or the economy or foreign affairs, Democrats want to talk about contraception, code for the \u201cBurwell v. Hobby Lobby\u201d Supreme Court decision.\n\nOf course what was actually at issue in that case was whether the government can force employers to provide health coverage for drugs and procedures to which they have moral or religious objections\u2014freedom of conscience.\n\nHowever what many people don\u2019t understood is that there is another very dangerous problem that has always lurked in the background which the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision did not address.\n\nThe decision did not truly correct any of the major abortion-expanding problems created by Obamacare, including the overly expansive authority that the Obamacare law itself provides to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to define \u201cpreventive services.\u201d\n\nWhat if in the future, HHS chooses to add the abortion pill RU-486, or even elective abortion, including late abortions, to the list of mandated \u201cpreventive services\u201d? Nor is there anything to prevent HHS from requiring coverage for, say, doctor-prescribed suicide, or anything else it chooses to classify as \u201cpreventive services.\u201d\n\nTo return to Schultheis\u2019 article, when pro-abortion Democrats do choose to avoid the inane \u201cwar on women\u201d conceit, they are merely exchanging one set of misleading, divisive stereotypes for another.\n\n\u201cThe playbook\u2019s the same,\u201d GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway told Schultheis.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/obama551-248x300.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe173e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWomen find it divisive, political\u2014they don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u2014 From an article in Thursday\u2019s National Journal, \u201cWhy Democrats are Ditching the \u2018War on Women,\u2019\u201d by Emily Schultheis.\nThis would be almost amusing if it weren\u2019t just as deceiving (and misleading) as the empty-headed \u201cwar on women\u201d clich\u00e9.\nBy Dave Andrusko\u201c[Saying] \u2018Republicans are waging a war on women\u2019 actually doesn\u2019t test very well,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\nThe subhead to Schultheis\u2019 article is \u201cThe party that deployed \u2018war\u2019 rhetoric to help defeat Mitt Romney is looking for less divisive ways to reach female voters this cycle.\u201d Oh, please.\nWhen you have neither, holler.\u201dPro-abortion Democrats are desperately looking are images and issues that they can twist so as to holler that Republicans are actively hostile to women."}
