The Medicaid expansion is a gift to states, with the federal government footing the entire bill for the first few years, then the vast majority of it afterwards. It\u2019s free money to the states to keep their people healthy.\n\nRick Perry rejected that free health care for the poor people of Texas. But he didn\u2019t reject free health care for himself.\n\nH/T: American Bridge, Rick Perry\u2019s ridiculous letter to Kathleen Sebelius (PDF)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rick Perry rejected that free health care for the poor people of Texas.
