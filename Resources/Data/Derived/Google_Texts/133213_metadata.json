They got their first checks, for $20,000 each, this past October. But since then, they have heard hardly anything from the state about their final payments, which could bring their total compensation to as much as $50,000 each.\n\nAll across our state, and in other states as well, victims of North Carolina\u2019s program are wondering when they will get their final checks. The state won\u2019t do the victims the simple courtesy of sending them a mass mailing in which it explains the delay. We here at the Journal editorial board tell several victims fortunate enough to have our phone number the reasons for the delay. There\u2019s the state budget process, which is taking the longest time in years for the legislature and the governor to nail down. And even after the state leaders agree on a budget, it\u2019s uncertain when the next compensation payment will go out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s the state budget process, which is taking the longest time in years for the legislature and the governor to nail down.\nAnd even after the state leaders agree on a budget, it\u2019s uncertain when the next compensation payment will go out.\u201d\nAll across our state, and in other states as well, victims of North Carolina\u2019s program are wondering when they will get their final checks.\nThe state won\u2019t do the victims the simple courtesy of sending them a mass mailing in which it explains the delay.\nBut since then, they have heard hardly anything from the state about their final payments, which could bring their total compensation to as much as $50,000 each."}
