An 18-year-old animal enthusiast and girl scout from Ocean Springs was honored over the holiday weekend by being allowed to take part in the freeing of several endangered sea turtles.

Asher Day carried the rescued turtles to the water Saturday as a crowd watched on the beach in Biloxi.

Day has been working since 2013 with the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies on a sea turtle awareness project.

She tells WLOX-TV that she held workshops and presentations to educate the community about the dangers that five species face.

The institute's Dennis McGrury said the turtles freed Saturday were Kemp's Ridley turtles. Some had been caught at fishing piers and some were stranded.
