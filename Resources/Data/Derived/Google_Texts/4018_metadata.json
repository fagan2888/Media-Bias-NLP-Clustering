Noonan said she found the way in which this administration has handled this crisis has been among the \u201coddest\u201d she\u2019s seen. Noonan added that she would like to see \u201chumility\u201d from President Barack Obama rather than combativeness.\n\n\n\nKissel began by asking about the \u201cpuzzle\u201d of the president\u2019s response to the crisis surrounding the ACA\u2019s faltering website.\n\n\u201cI look at the White House the past two months, I think the president and those around him perhaps do not understand deep and serious history well enough to understand the size and scope of the debacle they\u2019re in,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cThey keep handling it as a problem, so they keep jerking forward with different ideas each day and different approaches.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the oddest handling of an authentic crisis I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she added.\n\nKissel noted that the WSJ editorial page has suggested that Obama defaults to pugnacity when he is confronted with a public relations issue. When asked what she thought was behind Obama\u2019s odd response to a crisis, Noonan replied, \u201cYouth.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kimmel: Number of People Signed Up for Obamacare Dwarfed by Number of Obama\u2019s Speeches\n\n\u201cWhat should he do?\u201d Kissel asked.\n\n\u201cBe very serious about it,\u201d Noonan answered. \u201cVery clearly, without weasel words, admit the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I would love to see from the president? Humility,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd almost embarrassed sense that they hadn\u2019t done it right and they\u2019re going to go back to square one, work with Republicans, and get it right.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip below via WSJ Live:\n\n[Photo via screen grab ]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan joined WSJ Live host Mary Kissel on Friday where they discussed the ongoing issues associated with the implementation", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noonan.jpg", "title": "Peggy Noonan Wants to See \u2018Embarrassed\u2019 Obama Show \u2018Humility\u2019 Over Obamacare Failures"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan joined WSJ Live host Mary Kissel on Friday where they discussed the ongoing issues associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
