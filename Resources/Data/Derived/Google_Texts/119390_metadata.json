Watch for more Nurse Watch every Wednesday in H&HN Daily.\n\nActors help RNs prepare for dire situations\n\nI imagine it\u2019s excruciatingly difficult for a nurse veteran to break the news to a terminally ill patient that there is nothing left to do, let alone if you\u2019re a fresh-faced nurse just starting in a hospital.\n\nAiming to close that experience gap, the University of Alabama in Huntsville has teamed up its nursing school with the theater department, hoping to better prepare RNs for hospice situations, according to uah.edu. Maria Steele, clinical assistant professor of nursing at the school, got the idea for the effort amid calls for departments of the university to collaborate more, and worries that nurses were ill-prepared for such end-of-life situations.\n\nThe theater department, of course, was on board and came up with seven students who displayed exceptional talent and dependability in class, each tasked with playing a family member of the \u201cdying\u201d patient. Thus far, the effort\u2019s been a success, with students from both schools spontaneously staying after the simulation to discuss what did and didn\u2019t work. Already, they\u2019re seeking further ways to collaborate.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of planning and coordination, but it was a real win-win,\" Steele tells uah.edu. \"I can foresee that this would only enhance the other simulations that we do.\"\n\nFinding the best settling spot as a new nurse\n\nWhat\u2019s the best potential nesting ground if you\u2019re a new nurse, fresh out of school? Is it sunny San Diego and its perfect year-round weather? New York City and its huge population of potential patients?\n\nAccording to SpareFoot.com, which teamed up with job site Indeed.com to crunch the numbers, the ideal locale is none other than Houston. The site reached that conclusion based on a variety of factors, including job availability, average annual salary, median home price and median annual rent. Houston topped the list for its largest share of nursing jobs, at 14.6 percent, along with the highest average salary ($78,000) and more affordable housing.\n\nNo love for H&HN\u2019s hometown of Chicago, but rounding out the top five are Tulsa, Okla., Dallas, Seattle and San Antonio, Texas.\n\nBattling bullying in the nursing profession\n\nDespite any strides made in the industry, bullying of nurses \u2014 by docs and RN peers \u2014 is still all too common in the profession.\n\nTo address the issue, American Sentinel University recently debuted a series of blogs on bullying prevention. Written by former nurse leader and anti-bullying expert Renee Thompson, R.N., the series explores the underlying causes of such hostility in the workplace, and offers up ways hospitals and other care settings might combat it.\n\nThe first such post explores what Thompson believes are the two primary causes of bullying: Nursing is a female-dominated profession and, as she puts it, \u201clet\u2019s face it, ladies, we are not always that nice to each other,\u201d and, second, nursing is an oppressed profession. \u201cFeelings of frustration, coupled with an increasingly complex and stressful job, can create environments where nurses \u2018take it out\u2019 on each other,\u201d she writes. The second piece, meanwhile, poses the question \u201cWho is eating whom?\u201d and challenges the common perception that it\u2019s always the older RNs who are \u201ceating their young.\u201d\n\nPay OK, but many still looking to leave nursing ranks\n\nWhile many nurses may be happy with the paychecks they bring home, they\u2019d still consider another profession if they had to do it all over again, according to a new survey of RNs by Medscape.\n\nOnly about 60 percent of advanced practice nurses said they would choose nursing as a career again, Medscape reports, which would drop to 56 percent for regular registered nurses, and 48 percent for licensed practical nurses. APNs made the most, according to the survey, at a range of $95,000 to $170,000, depending on their specialty. RN salaries averaged about $79,000 while LPNs make about $46,000.\n\nMedscape hopes the numbers will kickstart a conversation about what\u2019s fueling this dissatisfaction, Reuters reports. \u201cNursing is a very difficult and demanding career choice \u2014 long hours, weekend and holiday work, and most importantly, the need to provide hands-on care to people at their most vulnerable times in life \u2014 often when they are injured, ill, in pain or dying,\u201d Susan Yox, R.N., a director of editorial content for Medscape, told the site. \u201cWe hope this survey will begin to foster dialogue about the reasons for nursing dissatisfaction and burnout and spur changes where needed.\u201d\n\nGot more nursing news that you\u2019d like to see covered in H&HN, or ideas on how to make \"Nurse Watch\" better?
