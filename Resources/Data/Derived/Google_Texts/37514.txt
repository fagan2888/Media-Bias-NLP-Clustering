What does all of this mean for enthusiasts and manufacturers? As an enthusiast, turning an older, classic vehicle into a track-only car is not only affordable, but also enjoyable. If this regulation were to pass, one would have to be extremely careful with modifying a vehicle for track only use as it would have to meet emissions standards. Moreover, manufacturers would have to stop selling and making emissions-related components for track-only cars. That means a drastic increase in sales. Then again, it could be worse. For now, it looks like the EPA will stay away from cars that are only used on the track, which is good.
