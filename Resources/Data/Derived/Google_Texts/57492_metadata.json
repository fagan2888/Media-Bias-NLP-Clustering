LOUIS \u2014 For one inning, Jorge Soler and all those Chicago Cubs rookies looked like playoff-tested veterans and the St. Louis Cardinals appeared shaken.\n\nThat\u2019s all it took.\n\nKyle Hendricks and Addison Russell had successful squeeze bunts and Soler capped a five-run (all unearned) second inning with a two-run homer off Jaime Garcia, and the Cubs held off the Cardinals 6-3 on Saturday night to even their NL division series at a game apiece.\n\n\u201cListen, I can\u2019t be more proud of our guys,\u201d manager Joe Maddon said. \u201cWhen you win a wild-card game like we did, I promise you, you settle in. We didn\u2019t win yesterday, but we were not overwhelmed by anything.\u201d\n\nMaddon made all the right moves a night after the Cubs lost the opener 4-0. Now the teams shift to Wrigley Field for Game 3 on Monday, the first playoff game at the friendly confines since 2008, where Chicago\u2019s 22-game winner Jake Arrieta faces St. Louis\u2019 Michael Wacha in the best-of-five series.\n\n\u201cGetting back there 1-1 with our big dog on the mound, the atmosphere is going to be good,\u201d Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said.\n\nBOXSCORE: Cubs 6, Cardinals 2\n\nThe usually steady NL Central champion Cardinals made two errors as the Cubs didn\u2019t hit the ball out of the infield in scoring their first three runs in the second.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to watch a club that\u2019s played so well defensively, see a couple things happen that are kind of uncharacteristic for us,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.\n\nMaking his first postseason start, Soler connected off Garcia (0-1), who was lifted because of a stomach ailment after the second. The Cubs have been working Soler back into the mix after he returned from a left oblique strain in mid-September.\n\n\u201cAll I was trying to do was help the team win,\u201d Soler said through a translator. \u201cHe got a ball up where I could hit it hard.\u201d\n\nGarcia told the team he felt a bit ill about an hour before the game but thought he would be fine.\n\n\u201cI was going to pitch, it was my game,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI worked so hard all year for this situation and unfortunately it didn\u2019t go my way, but no excuse.\u201d\n\nDexter Fowler, Soler and Starlin Castro each had two of Chicago\u2019s six hits in a game played in front of a lively crowd of 47,859, a postseason record at 10-year-old Busch Stadium, which included thousands of Cubs fans.\n\nSoler also doubled and walked twice in the Cubs\u2019 first postseason victory since 2003. Chicago had lost seven straight Division Series games.\n\nThe Cardinals homered three times, including a leadoff long ball by Matt Carpenter. Consecutive shots by Kolten Wong and pinch-hitter Randal Grichuk with two outs in the fifth chased Hendricks one out shy of qualifying for the victory in his postseason debut.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cubs even NLDS series with Cardinals", "title": "Cubs even NLDS series with Cardinals", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/10/cubs-even-nlds-series-with-cardinals/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__BN20151011_CC4_BNSP11BBNCARDSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__BN20151011_CC4_BNSP11BBNCARDSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T20:22:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T05:33:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce07b\"", "article_summary": "ST.
