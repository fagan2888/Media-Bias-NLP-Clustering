Levinson.\n\nBut software glitches and capacity issues thwarted many users upon its launch in Oct. 1, an embarrassment for the White House that required a frantic rescue mission to make the site usable for people in 36 states.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report outlines what contributed to some of the problems.\n\nIt said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tended to favor contractors that already did business with the government. Also, it did not identify a lead integrator to coordinate the work of dozens of contractors until after the October 2013 debacle, when it identified QSSI to run point on the rescue effort.\n\n\u201cThe 33 companies that were awarded the 60 federal marketplace contracts each had individual tasks to support the implementation of the [exchange], but there was no single point-of-contact with responsibility for integrating contractors\u2019 efforts and communicating the common project goal to all 33 companies,\u201d the inspector general found.\n\nAn agency official told the inspector that CMS considered one of its lead contractors, CGI Federal, to be the integrator, although the company says it didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cThis deficiency could have been addressed through more rigorous acquisition planning, such as clearly defining roles in an acquisition strategy and in descriptions of contractors\u2019 work,\u201d the inspector general said.\n\nWell into its second signup period, Obamacare\u2019s websites have operated relatively smoothly since late 2013.\n\nAdministration officials say the law is working as intended and chipping away at the uninsured rate.\n\nBut the inspector\u2019s report lends weigh to critics who said the White House did not put anyone in charge of Care.gov. Since then, the administration has hired a CEO to oversee the federal marketplace.\n\nThe findings also provide fuel to Republican critics who say the administration squandered billions of dollars on Obamacare.\n\nSenate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican, said Tuesday he still wants to recoup federal grant dollars spent on glitch-laden state exchanges.\n\n\u201cWe need to know what happened and whether that money will ever be paid back,\u201d he told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFor the federal exchange, HHS doled out 60 contracts across 33 companies to perform work on HealthCare.gov.\n\nFifty-five of the 60 deals were awarded as orders under established contracts, the inspector general found, so \u201conly companies that held previously established contracts were eligible to obtain these orders.\u201d\n\nFurther limiting itself, the agency solicited a proposal from only one company for a third of the contracts.\n\nAmong its other findings, the inspector general said CMS did not develop acquisition strategies and plans for the overall project and individual contracts \u2014 moves that would have helped them identify contract risks and ways to avoid them.\n\nThe inspector general said in the future, CMS should choose a systems integrator so contractors are on the same page, and they should adhere to contracting guidelines.\n\nCMS told the inspector that it concurs with its findings. It said it has \u201cmoved aggressively\u201d to implement contracting reforms and appointed a task force to oversee its contracting for the federal exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The agency in charge of Obamacare didn't strategize wisely or look beyond existing government contractors before they doled out 60 contracts to build out HealthCare.gov, according to an inspector general's report Tuesday that sheds light on a federal project that stumbled out of the gate in fall 2013.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The agency in charge of Obamacare didn\u2019t strategize wisely or look beyond existing government contractors before they doled out 60 contracts to build out HealthCare.gov, according to an inspector general\u2019s report Tuesday that sheds light on a federal project that stumbled out of the gate in fall 2013.", "title": "Admin played favorites with contracting for faulty Obamacare website: report", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/20/admin-played-favorites-contracting-obamacare-site/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/07/health-overhaul-sign-upsjpeg-03977.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/07/health-overhaul-sign-upsjpeg-03977.jpg", "description": "The agency in charge of Obamacare didn't strategize wisely or look beyond existing government contractors before they doled out 60 contracts to build out HealthCare.gov, according to an inspector gene", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Admin played favorites with contracting for faulty Obamacare website:"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf68\"", "article_summary": "The inspector general said in the future, CMS should choose a systems integrator so contractors are on the same page, and they should adhere to contracting guidelines.\nFor the federal exchange, HHS doled out 60 contracts across 33 companies to perform work on HealthCare.gov.\n\u201cThis deficiency could have been addressed through more rigorous acquisition planning, such as clearly defining roles in an acquisition strategy and in descriptions of contractors\u2019 work,\u201d the inspector general said.\nIt said it has \u201cmoved aggressively\u201d to implement contracting reforms and appointed a task force to oversee its contracting for the federal exchange.\nThe inspector general\u2019s report outlines what contributed to some of the problems."}
