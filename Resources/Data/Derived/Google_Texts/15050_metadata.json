Unfortunately there are plenty of them.\n\nNet neutrality is an Internet ideal that will become possible If the Federal Communications Commission decides to reclassify Internet service providers from information services to telecommunications services. If the FCC reclassifies ISPs, it will be able to regulate them\u2014and that could affect a push by ISPs to provide faster Internet service to Web companies willing to pay for the privilege.\n\nData-hungry Web companies like Netflix want the speed, and the ISPs want the money. Others, however, fear a pay-to-play scheme could put cash-strapped startup sites at a disadvantage.\n\nAdd the pro- and anti-regulation forces to this mix, and the rhetoric's flying in all directions on social media as well as in the news. We\u2019ve teased out the facts behind five net neutrality myths. It won\u2019t resolve the debate, but it\u2019ll help you understand what\u2019s really going on.\n\nMyth #1: Net neutrality is \u2018Obamacare for the Internet\u2019\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s recent tweet making this comparison is more convenient than accurate. Obamacare is about access (to health care), while net neutrality is about quality (think speed) of access to the Internet. More to the point, it's about how to manage just the ISPs, not the Internet as a whole\u2014no matter what conservatives say.\n\nMyth #2: An 'open' and 'neutral' Internet are the same thing\n\nListen carefully to the use of \"open\" or \"neutral\" in this debate. The Internet has always been \u201copen,\u201d because anyone can use it for any application. The ISPs are the Internet gatekeepers facing possible regulation, and that's about remaining \"neutral.\"\n\nThe term \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d was coined by Columbia law professor Tim Wu in 2003. The basic concept was that all Internet traffic should be allowed to flow freely regardless of what it is or where it comes from.\n\nThe Internet was a simpler place a decade ago, however. Now, in an age when consumers surf the web, Skype and watch Netflix simultaneously, ISPs face a demand for more bandwidth\u2014and naturally, they want to be paid for providing it. Net neutrality proponents say a pay-to-play fast lane won't be neutral, and may be considered less open, because it will hamper companies that can't afford faster service.\n\nMyth #3: Regulating ISPs is good (or bad) for users\n\nNet neutrality advocates think regulating ISPs will level the playing field for Web entrepreneurs. On the other hand, ISPs and other critics are concerned that regulating the market would discourage future investments in Internet infrastructure.\n\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said recently that his company will \u201cpause\u201d investments in fiber networks until the net neutrality debate is over. In a less dramatic announcement, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said his company agrees with Obama in principle but that \u201cthe unfortunate reality is the uncertainty it creates, investment uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThere's no myth here. We simply don't know what ISPs will end up doing if they face regulation.\n\nMyth #4: Without net neutrality, some Internet users will experience slower service\n\n\n\nThis isn't a myth either, but two different positions around the same fact. This is the fact: If ISPs offer faster service for some Web companies, the service for other companies will be slower by comparison.\n\nThe argument centers around a perception: Is slower bad, or just not as good as faster? Net neutrality advocates warn that if ISPs give some websites a fast lane for an extra fee, that's essentially downgrading service for all other websites. Opponents contend that service to all wouldn\u2019t be downgraded, but those who paid extra would get better (faster) service.\n\nMyth #5: President Obama has the final word on net neutrality\n\n\n\nWhile the President\u2019s opinion might hold more weight than yours or mine, it\u2019s not binding. Since President Obama issued his statement supporting reclassification, the White House has reiterated that the ultimate decision will be in the hands of the independent FCC.\n\nThat means FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is under a lot of pressure. His only official statement reflects that the commission is trying its best to end the years-long quest for net neutrality rules: \u201cWe must take the time to get the job done correctly, once and for all, in order to successfully protect consumers and innovators online.\u201d A decision is expected in the near future.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://core3.staticworld.net/images/article/2014/11/180886514-100533096-small.jpg", "description": "No matter how you feel about net neutrality, these five myths only make the issue more confusing.
