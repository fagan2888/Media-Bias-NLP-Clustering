The book\u2019s title\u2014By The People\u2014has been held up for ridicule for exemplifying the emptiness of the populist appellations conservatives typically apply to the handiwork of wealthy, self-interested ideologues. But perhaps the joke\u2019s on us, and Murray\u2019s simply using a different form of the word \u201cby\u201d than Abraham Lincoln had in mind when he wrote the Gettysburg Address.\n\nThe subtext of Murray\u2019s argument is that principled conservatives can only set back liberalism with rearguard action, and that even then, they can hope only for modest victories. Remarkably, the 100-page buildup to the strategy that has PFAW so concerned reads less like a battle cry than like a manifesto of hopelessness\u2014or perhaps like a letter of surrender to the left. Murray tells his fans that \u201ca restoration of limited government is not going to happen by winning presidential elections and getting the right people appointed to the Supreme Court\u201d\u2014asking them to accept, as a premise, that the billions of dollars conservative activists have spent trying to advance the cause through the White House have been wasted, or at least could have been better spent.\n\nLike an adolescent Ayn Rand devotee, Murray can\u2019t quite come to grips with the unattractiveness of his ideology. He is perfectly aware that the policies he opposes and the regulations he wants to overwhelm with litigation could theoretically be overturned by Congress and a conservative president. But to him, the unlikelihood of that outcome isn\u2019t attributable to the normative weaknesses of his worldview but to a playing field that\u2019s tilted against it. His ideas falter not because the people don\u2019t support them, but because a series of ingredients, including\u2014in his words!\u2014the democratization of the House of Representatives, have corrupted the political system systemically. To the extent that \u201cthe people\u201d he claims to be speaking for don\u2019t rise up to challenge this corruption, it\u2019s because they run up against what Murray calls \u201cthe fundamental theorem of democratic politics\u201d\u2014the fact that \u201cpeople who receive government benefits tend to vote for people who support those benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of 2012,\u201d Murray laments, \u201capproximately half of all Americans received such benefits.\u201d And more than one in three receive such generous benefits (either through welfare or retirement programs) that \u201cthe continued security of those programs is likely to be near the top of the recipients\u2019 political calculations.\u201d\n\nConservatism has been checkmated, not by a superior player, but by an unscrupulous one. Under the circumstances, Murray sees no choice but to move the game from the chessboard into the wild.\n\nIn truth, there\u2019s nothing particularly novel or disquieting about the scheme Murray\u2019s drawn up, except insofar as the procedural extremism conservatives have deployed in the Obama era is alarming in general. From the moment conservatives lost the White House six and a half years ago, they\u2019ve been asking judges to do on their behalf what they\u2019ve been unable to accomplish in the democratic branches. A few weeks from now, the Supreme Court will issue a ruling in a case that was devised as part of an explicit strategy to hobble the Affordable Care Act through the judiciary, knowing that the legislature wouldn\u2019t be able to do it for them.\n\nThis strategy has been intermittently successful, but has also run aground when its objectives\u2014such as paralyzing the administrative state by flooding the courts with litigation\u2014are unsupportable or too nakedly political. Notwithstanding Murray's continued influence over conservative thinking, including favorable mentions just this month by GOP presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Rand Paul, his latest big idea will run into a feasibility problem: even if it were attempted, it wouldn't work particularly well.\n\nWhat\u2019s refreshing about By The People is that it blows right past the typical pretense that conservatives are, humbly and alone, defending the constitution and the rule of law, except to the extent that he believes the country went off the constitutional rails in systemic fashion several decades ago. He happily admits that his means here are subversive, undemocratic and of questionable legality. His substantive aims are not so different from those of, for instance, National Review writers Reihan Salam and Ramesh Ponnuru, who have outlined an agenda for the GOP Congress that includes unwinding the cooperative federalist models, responsible for so much of the regulatory and redistributive status quo Murray detests, and subjecting the regulatory regime in the crosshairs of his litigation strategy to legislative approval. But what Murray sees that others don\u2019t, or won\u2019t admit, is that these goals can be achieved only by short-circuiting the normal policy-making process.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame in a way, because notwithstanding his Romney-esque conception of the political economy of modern welfare states, Murray\u2019s overall critique of the American political system has a lot of merit to it. Were Murray\u2019s central purpose to make Congress and the executive branch more responsive to the public, irrespective of the public\u2019s political disposition, he\u2019d find a lot of support in unexpected places. But that\u2019s not his central purpose, and for good reason. As infuriating and frustrating as the U.S. government\u2019s many corruptions are, they do not explain why conservatives have failed to upend enforcement of environmental, anti-discrimination and workplace-safety regulations. That\u2019s why his preferred instrument of reform isn\u2019t the ballot box, but the court system, and that in turn gives away the game. The former helps ensure that policy reforms have public sanction. The latter makes it possible to sneak ones that don\u2019t By The People.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Early last week, a watchdog website hosted by People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, reacted with alarm to a political-legal strategy outlined in a new book by the conservative social theorist Charles Murray.&nbsp;Normally when liberals assail Murray it\u2019s in connection with his infamous tome The Bell Curve, which made him synonymous with race science\u2014specifically the presumption th...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Why so many of the right's plans for conservative reform run through the courts.", "title": "Charles Murray and the Right's Plan to Subvert Democracy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ecbdebd5a03a568c49c4a81f96b0a4e80327b405.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/121824/charles-murrays-people-anti-democratic-manifesto", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why so many of the right's plans for conservative reform run through the courts.", "title": "Charles Murray and the Right's Plan to Subvert Democracy", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ecbdebd5a03a568c49c4a81f96b0a4e80327b405.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/ecbdebd5a03a568c49c4a81f96b0a4e80327b405.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Charles Murray and the Right's Plan to Subvert Democracy\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121824/charles-murrays-people-anti-democratic-manifesto\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-18T08:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":121824,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Obamacare\",\"Charles Murray\",\"The Bell Curve\",\"Supreme Court\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Barack Obama\",\"Hillary Clinton\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-05-18"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd309\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a shame in a way, because notwithstanding his Romney-esque conception of the political economy of modern welfare states, Murray\u2019s overall critique of the American political system has a lot of merit to it.\nHis ideas falter not because the people don\u2019t support them, but because a series of ingredients, including\u2014in his words!\u2014the democratization of the House of Representatives, have corrupted the political system systemically.\nThe subtext of Murray\u2019s argument is that principled conservatives can only set back liberalism with rearguard action, and that even then, they can hope only for modest victories.\nBut perhaps the joke\u2019s on us, and Murray\u2019s simply using a different form of the word \u201cby\u201d than Abraham Lincoln had in mind when he wrote the Gettysburg Address.\nLike an adolescent Ayn Rand devotee, Murray can\u2019t quite come to grips with the unattractiveness of his ideology."}
