In addition, he said, data transmission lines are outdated and insufficient for the building\u2019s computer system.\n\n\u201cThey also need a paging system in the building in the event something goes wrong in a courtroom and they have to put the whole building on lockdown, for example,\u201d Farrar said.\n\nDetails of the upgrade had not been fully determined, but he said he had obtained preliminary quotes and information from Ben Lomond, whose fiber optic cable runs along Highway 41, and Charter Communications.\n\n\u201c(Circuit Court Clerk) Heather Duncan is willing to pay for part of the upgrades from her own budget, and we\u2019re looking at quotes from different companies, but the final request will be bid out.\u201d\n\nDuncan later said the courts\u2019 phone system has been shutting down intermittently for many years, but recently the problem has spiked into a constant hindrance for members of the public who are trying to pay a fine or check on a court date.\n\nEmployees are also frequently hindered from getting work done because they can\u2019t call out, or their fax goes to the wrong location. In some instances, she said, it even becomes a safety issue.\n\n\u201cOne time we had someone pass out due to an illness, but we couldn\u2019t get a dial tone to call 911,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunately, we have cell phones now, but we need a phone and paging system at this building that works right.\n\n\u201cAnd I want the public to know: we are here every day, and we\u2019re not ignoring the phones, even though it may sound like your calls are not being answered.\n\n\u201cIts just that the phone system shuts down a lot and we have no control over it. We don\u2019t hear any ringing, and then suddenly I start getting emails from people saying they\u2019ve been calling all morning and can\u2019t get through.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the public to have a problem like this.\u201d\n\nDuncan said call volume is high from about 8 to 10 a.m., and that often seems to be when it goes out.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also after rain storms and other times. So if you don\u2019t get through in the morning, just try back in the afternoon,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to hold expenses down for the county as much as possible, but this phone system was installed in 1996, and the phones were used even at that time. So these phones are so old at this point, we can\u2019t even get parts for them.\u201d\n\nDuncan said that fortunately, the state allows her department to charge $4 per case to go into a technology fund, from which she feels the phone system would qualify as a justifiable expense.\n\nFarrar said Duncan\u2019s funds could pay for roughly half the cost of a new system for the entire building, which he estimated at around $13,000, but the rest would have to come from elsewhere.\n\nEdinger suggested the capital outlay fund could pay the other half. The committee then passed motion to approve up to $6,000 to be paid from the Capital Outlay Fund, with the remainder to be paid from Duncan\u2019s budget.\n\nNew roof for child care center\n\nMaintenance director Robert Gilliam requested a preliminary amount be set aside for a new roof at the Coffee County Child Care Center, which has been leaking during rain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly small roof job,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will be bidding out, but I think if we could set aside about $7,000, the bids should come in well under that.\u201d\n\nEMS\n\nEMS Director Michael Bonner requested an additional $246,812 for next year, or 2.5 cents, over his current-year budget of $2.43 million. The extra funds are needed, he said, for his staff\u2019s 2-percent step increases, the 3.85 percent increase for the 27th pay period, a new ambulance and a new ambulance engine.\n\n\u201cWe have one ambulance that will be going off-line next year that has to be replaced, but we\u2019ve also had to replace three engines in three years for these Ford ambulances, so I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll probably need another one next year too,\u201d Bonner said.\n\nThe EMS budget is not included in the general fund but is supported for by a 5-cent tax on the annual property tax bill, which generates $500,000, roughly one-quarter of its total budget. EMS tries to cover the remaining 3/4 through its own ambulance billings. However, Bonner said, costs continue to outpace revenues for a number of reasons, including unfunded mandates on the state and federal levels.\n\nOne example, Bonner said, was that under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals can no longer be reimbursed by insurance for a patient who returns to the hospital within one week for the same medical reason. If the return visit involves an ambulance, the ambulance transport does not get reimbursed either.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the problem (of return visits to hospitals) through some kind of community care service, where EMTs or someone goes to people\u2019s homes to check in on the patient, make sure they\u2019re taking the meds as directed, and so forth, but they haven\u2019t said where that money is going to come from either.\u201d\n\nBricken then asked why the non-emergency transports, such as those for scheduled dialysis appointments, were not generating more revenues.\n\n\u201cWe had all those discussions last year about how the non-emergency truck was supposed to generate more revenues than the emergencies, what happened with that?\u201d he asked.\n\nCommissioner Mark Kelly answered that there were two problems with the non-emergency transport business, one being competition from private ambulance companies, who only service non-emergencies, and the other being that those enrolled in EMT and paramedic programs can become nurses with only one extra semester of schooling.\n\n\u201cIf we send our non-emergency truck out, we can\u2019t answer the emergency calls, which we\u2019re required to do, by law,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe private companies don\u2019t have that problem.\n\n\u201cPlus, (EMS) cannot staff our non-emergency truck when the county only pays $14/hour for a paramedic because the private ambulance companies offer $17 an hour or more in some areas,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cPlus, if these same people can go to school just one more semester, they can start as a nurse for $30/ hour instead of $14.\u201d\n\nHe went on to point out that TennCare and Medicare continue to pay the same flat rate for ambulance transports that only amounts to a small fraction of the actual bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you more revenues as soon as you can get Medicare and TennCare to pay the full amount of their bill,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cThere is only one model nationwide that has a \u2018profitable\u2019 ambulance service, and that\u2019s when the fire department and EMS department are combined.\n\n\u201cIf we can ever make that happen here, we can have an ambulance service that at least breaks even.\u201d\n\nThe next meeting of the budget and finance committee is scheduled for 5 p.m. Tuesday, May 3 in Committee Room 1 of the Coffee County Administrative Plaza in Manchester.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "DSuZnC9hJQAMvp9aACU2GR1smwoMgHv-RH5LWmQ0SkM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2145\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere is only one model nationwide that has a \u2018profitable\u2019 ambulance service, and that\u2019s when the fire department and EMS department are combined.\n\u201cIts just that the phone system shuts down a lot and we have no control over it.\nmarian galbriathSeveral department representatives were in attendance at last week\u2019s meeting of the Coffee County Budget and Finance Committee to request additional funds for unforeseen expenses.\nAmong those requesting funds was Coffee County Purchasing Officer Andy Farrar, who is asking for funding to replace an out-of-date phone system in the Justice Center.\n\u201cFortunately, we have cell phones now, but we need a phone and paging system at this building that works right."}
