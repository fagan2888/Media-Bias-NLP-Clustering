Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) is hoping to resolve the “bureaucratic mess” that is the Veterans Affairs office by pushing a plan that would allow privatization of some vets’ health care.

“I’m going to describe a system where we begin to decompress the VA health care system, which is obviously overburdened, and begin to consider offering veterans who are newly assigned to the VA the benefit option of going to the private system and being taken care of in their local hospitals instead of in the VA system,” Harris told “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday.

Harris said he is qualified to address the issue as a doctor and a former member of the Navy medical corps.

“During my training, I did time in a VA hospital,” Harris said. “I understand the military and the VA health system and I understand why the VA system is a bureaucratic mess.”

Harris said that his plan would benefit veterans who live far from VA centers, as well as cutting costs.

“The VA budget has roughly tripled in the past 12 years, including the VA health budget,” Harris said. “When you look at the numbers, we’re paying more for veterans and those priority one veterans in the VA system then we would if we bought them, for instance, a silver level plan on the Obamacare exchange.”

According to Harris’ office, the lawmaker has not proposed any legislation for a veteran voucher program at this time.
