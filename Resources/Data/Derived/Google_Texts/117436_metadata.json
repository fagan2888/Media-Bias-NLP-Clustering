Obama has seen far more of his nominees blocked than either of the two presidents who came before him, as Republicans have deployed the filibuster to prevent Obama from shifting the federal bench to the left.\n\n\u201cFour of my predecessor\u2019s six nominees to the D.C. Circuit were confirmed,\u201d Obama noted in a statement following the vote. \u201dFour of my five nominees to this court have been obstructed.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans have come up with a long list of excuses for engaging in conduct they angrily denounced as unconstitutional when George W. Bush was in office. They\u2019ve said Obama is trying to \u201cpack the court\u201d with ideologues, even though the president is merely filling vacancies, not altering the number of seats on the bench. They\u2019ve argued that the DC Circuit, which hears many high profile regulatory and national security cases, is underworked even though it has a similar caseload to when Bush was making appointments to the court. In moments of honesty, they\u2019ve simply admitted that they\u2019d just rather the influential court stay skewed to the right.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Monday evening, Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley came up with a new one: this whole nominating judges thing is just an attempt by the Democratic Party to distract from the difficulties the administration has been having in implementing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cRather than focus on this crisis\u2013a real crisis\u2013the other side has developed a strategy specifically designed to divert attention from it,\u201d Grassley declared. \u201cThat strategy is to use the D.C. Circuit as a smokescreen.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama nominated Millett, Pillard and Wilkins in June, months before the difficulties with the Affordable Care Act implementation were known. Republicans had been giving notice of their intent to filibuster every single one of Obama\u2019s nominees to the DC Circuit as far back as August. The problems with the Affordable Care Act exchanges didn\u2019t begin until they opened on October 1.\n\nObama certainly didn\u2019t need a crystal ball in June to know that Republicans would try to block his nominees. But it\u2019s ludicrous for Grassley to claim, as he did in April, that Obama was engaged in a nefarious \u201ccourt-packing\u201d scheme\u2013and then say now that the president was nominating judges in an attempt to distract from a political problem that hadn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nRepublicans have made it clear that they won\u2019t let a single one of Obama\u2019s nominees through. Democrats have two choices: they can either alter the Senate rules to make it more difficult to filibuster judicial nominees, or they can allow Republicans to continue nullifying the results of the 2008 and 2012 elections by preventing Obama from making appointments to the bench.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republicans have now filibustered all of Obama's recent DC Circuit nominees, and have made it clear they won't let through a single one of his nominees.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-block-wilkins-nomination", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Republicans have now filibustered all of Obama's recent DC Circuit nominees, and have made it clear they won't let through a single one of his nominees.", "title": "GOP blocks another of Obama's DC Circuit Court nominees", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-block-wilkins-nomination", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/169908355.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-block-wilkins-nomination", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/169908355.jpg?itok=uaaPoPiY", "height": 553}, "title": "GOP blocks another of Obama's DC Circuit Court nominees", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Republicans have now filibustered all of Obama's recent DC Circuit nominees, and have made it clear they won't let through a single one of his nominees."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-18T21:00:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "adamserwer", "title": "GOP blocks another of Obama's DC Circuit Court nominees", "tags": "democrats,filibuster,republicans", "published": 1, "date": "11/18/2013 21:00:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-block-wilkins-nomination"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Republicans have now filibustered all of Obama's recent DC Circuit nominees, and have made it clear they won't let through a single one of his nominees.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Republicans, Filibuster"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ee6\"", "article_summary": "For the third time in about as many weeks, Republicans have filibustered one of President Obama\u2019s nominees to the influential DC Circuit Court of appeals.\nRepublicans had been giving notice of their intent to filibuster every single one of Obama\u2019s nominees to the DC Circuit as far back as August.\nRepublicans have made it clear that they won\u2019t let a single one of Obama\u2019s nominees through.\nAfter filibustering experienced Supreme Court litigator Patricia Millett and Georgetown Law professor Cornelia Pillard, Senate Republicans blocked district court judge Robert Wilkins Monday, fulfilling their goal of not allowing a single one of Obama\u2019s recent nominees to the DC Circuit make it to the bench.\nThey\u2019ve argued that the DC Circuit, which hears many high profile regulatory and national security cases, is underworked even though it has a similar caseload to when Bush was making appointments to the court."}
