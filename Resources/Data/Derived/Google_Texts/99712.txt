Re. May 8 editorial, “The Omniscient One”:

The editorial, which noted Donald Trump’s comment that “I can tell you more about Caterpillar tractors than the people that work there,” highlights the real problem with the U.S. government and governments around the world. It’s called fatal conceit in economics.

Fatal conceit is when politicians and therefore governments believe that they are smarter than the people they serve. History is littered with examples of America’s fatal conceits, from ObamaCare to the New Deal.

Many people claim that the two candidates running for president are bad choices. I believe it is the system that is broken, not the people trying to become president. This is not what the Founding Fathers envisioned for this country. The U.S. was supposed to have a government that served the people and was as small as possible. Trump and Hillary both think they know what is best for America, but shouldn’t we allow Americans to decide what is best through their own plans?

If everyone planned for their own well-being, this country would be in a much better place.

Trump does not know more about Cat than the people who work there. No one knows everything.
