Read the first part on how the health care law is being received in Northeast Ohio.\n\nWilloughby resident Valerie Goetz didn\u0092t have health care insurance when she attended a recent informational meeting at the Fairport Harbor Senior Citizens Center.\n\nGoetz learned at the event that she was eligible to sign up for Medicaid because of her lower income level. So, she planned to enroll for the health insurance coverage when she met individually with a certified application counselor from the Lake County General Health District.\n\nPeople in Ohio who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level or equal to a $1,321 gross monthly income of per individual are eligible now to receive Medicaid benefits.\n\nThe Health District recently received a $35,000 grant from the Ohio Association of Food Banks to help people learn more about their health care options and for assistance to sign up for a health care plan through the new federal Health Insurance Marketplace website www.healthcare.gov or to provide enrollment assistance for Medicaid through the state of Ohio\u0092s website www.benefits.ohio.gov.\n\n\u0093It was an idea earlier in the year that we decided we would do this as a small benefit to the community,\u0094 said Sandra Allison, public health social worker unit supervisor for the Health District.\n\nAllison said the grant stipulates at least 100 people be served directly per month along with 350 people served through outreach programs.\n\nTwo certified application counselors at the Health District are on hand to help people who want to enroll in health care plans through the federal and state government websites.\n\nShe reminds people who don\u0092t have a health plan that qualifies as minimum essential coverage that there is a March 31 deadline to enroll in a plan or face a tax penalty on their tax return that is filed in 2015. People with very low incomes and others may be eligible for waivers.\n\nOutreach programs such as the one conducted at the Fairport Harbor Senior Center will continue throughout the year by the Health District in Lake, Geauga and Ashtabula counties.\n\nRyan Deluca, a health educator at the Health District, is a certified application counselor who will provide assistance to people who would like to find out more about their options and he can meet individually with people to help guide them to sign up.\n\n\u0093My job is to do marketing and advertise the health insurance marketplace to get more uninsured people covered,\u0094 Deluca said. \u0093I can do one-on-one assistance with any consumers that need the help. I can navigate them through the site.\u0094\n\nDeluca has conducted outreach events at other places such as senior citizen centers, Lakeland Community College, Salvation Army locations and other places where people might need help to learn more about their health care options.\n\n\u0093The Medicaid expansion has been a big hit, a lot of individuals sign up with me for that so that\u0092s been a success,\u0094 Deluca said. \u0093The Marketplace is still pretty new, haven\u0092t had too many people actually sign up with me, but I\u0092ve had clients come in and we\u0092ve reviewed all the plans because they are unclear on what they want.\u0094\n\nThe most common question he answers from people are how much will the insurance cost and what will they be eligible to receive.\n\n\u0093I can\u0092t answer that right off that bat until we get their personal information,\u0094 he said. \u0093When they come in it\u0092s pretty straight forward, there is a lot of the less computer-savvy individuals who have trouble creating a user name and password so it can get confusing.\n\n\u0093After that it\u0092s pretty straightforward questions and I\u0092m right there, they\u0092re supposed to be doing it themselves, but I\u0092m right here to support them.\u0094\n\nMany people are eligible for a tax credit when they enroll in the Marketplace and they can take it either in the form of lower premiums or they can pay the full premium and claim the credit when they complete their tax returns, Deluca said.\n\nProviding tax guidance is not something he does as a certified application counselor.\n\nDeluca said some people have expressed frustration with the federal health care website not functioning properly.\n\n\u0093To be honest with you, it has it\u0092s days it\u0092s been up and down,\u0094 he said. \u0093There\u0092s been times where I type in the information people are in and out in a half hour, submit it, and it\u0092s good to go.\n\n\u0093Other times it won\u0092t accept the application and they kind of sit there and wonder what is going on. I try to tell them I don\u0092t have any control over the site, I just try to assist and it\u0092s the site everyone is using.\u0094\n\nDeluca was able to answer many questions that Goetz asked during his presentation at the Fairport Harbor Senior Center.\n\n\u0093It went very well,\u0094 she said.\n\n\u0093I did not know that with my low income I could go on a different site and go with Ohio\u0092s Medicaid.\u0094\n\nThe Health District also will conduct a presentation on the Affordable Care Act from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. March 10 at the Willoughby Senior Center.\n\nFor people who have tax questions regarding health care coverage, a certified application counselor from the Health District will be available along with the Kathleen J. Miller and Associates every Friday in March from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at agency at 7351 Center St., Mentor. An appointment can be scheduled with Miller and Associates by calling 440-255-1541.\n\nFor more information about the Affordable Care Act or to make an appointment for direct assistance in enrollment in the Marketplace or through Medicaid call the Health District at 440-350-2056.\n\nRelated:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart One: Is the Affordable Care Act working in Ohio?
