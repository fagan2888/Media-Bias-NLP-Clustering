Ellen Kearns, co-chair of our Wage and Hour Practice Group, wrote a great Client Bulletin on the Rule, taking a complex subject and explaining it in a pithy and readable way.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for a little wage-and-hour humor (does such a thing even exist?), be sure to read Steve Katz\u2019s post on the unique circumstances that the DOL\u2019s Final Rule creates for California employers.\n\nBut not everything this week was wage-and-hour related. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration came out with a Final Rule last week that will require employers to post their workplace injuries on a public website and will prohibit employers from having injury-reporting procedures that are not \u201creasonable.\u201d Our OSHA Practice Group has the story.\n\nFinally, I wrote a bulletin on the Final Rules from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concerning wellness programs and the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. I didn\u2019t think the rules were too bad (considering that there is a conflict between the ADA and the GINA \u2014 the laws that the EEOC is charged with enforcing \u2014 and the wellness provisions of the Health Insurance Portability Accountability and Affordability Act and the Affordable Care Act), but apparently some lawyers think the EEOC could have done better. Let me know what you think.\n\n*Apologies to the Five-Man Electrical Band.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=567069cc-8bd1-4437-9e06-a2163f6f42b9", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "\u201cDo this, don\u2019t do that, can\u2019t you read the rules . . .\u201d* Of course, the mega-topic this week was the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Final Rule on\u2026", "title": "Too many RULES, man! | Lexology"}, "Description": "\u201cDo this, don\u2019t do that, can\u2019t you read the rules . . .\u201d* Of course, the mega-topic this week was the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Final Rule on\u2026", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "USA May 20 2016\u201cDo this, don\u2019t do that, can\u2019t you read the rules .\nFinally, I wrote a bulletin on the Final Rules from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concerning wellness programs and the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.\n), be sure to read Steve Katz\u2019s post on the unique circumstances that the DOL\u2019s Final Rule creates for California employers.\n.\u201d*Of course, the mega-topic this week was the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Final Rule on white-collar exemptions to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nBut not everything this week was wage-and-hour related."}
