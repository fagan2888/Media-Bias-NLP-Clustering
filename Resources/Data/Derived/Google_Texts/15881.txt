Those who manage to apply for health insurance through HealthCare.gov are also offered the opportunity, through the site, to register to vote.

Brian Cook, spokesman of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the Washington Post last month that the exchanges include the option because the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the “motor voter” law) “requires states to offer voter registration [at] all offices that provide ‘public assistance’ (including Medicaid applications). Because people applying on healthcare.gov could be eligible for either Medicaid or Marketplace coverage, we will be providing info on voter registration to people who request it.”

Over at The Fix, Juliet Eilperin and Scott Clement noted that this feature could add many more Democrats to the voting rolls, since the uninsured, according to one poll, favored Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a 2:1 margin.
