As of Mar. 2014 (the latest available data reported by the Department of Agriculture), 46,097,719 people received food stamps.\n\nIn Dec. 2013, food stamp enrollments fell below 47 million for the firsttime in over a year and have edged lower each consecutive month thisyear. Still, even counting those marginal declines, since Obama entered office, over 14 million more people now receive taxpayer-funded food stamp benefits than did prior to his becoming president.\n\nWhether Obama and Democrats can spark a jobs boom and move millions from welfare to work in the run up to the midterm elections remains to be seen. If so, they need to hurry.\n\nVoters head to the polls Nov. 4.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With just 121 days until Democratic candidates face angry voters at the polls, President Barack Obama is touting a recent jobs report as evidence that his jobs agenda is finally working.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "With just 121 days until Democratic candidates face angry voters at the polls, President Barack Obama is touting a recent jobs report as evidence that his jobs agenda is finally working.", "title": "14 Million More on Food Stamps Under Obama - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Welfare/foodstamps_sign_AFP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/06/14-million-more-on-food-stamps-under-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With just 121 days until Democratic candidates face angry voters at the polls, President Barack Obama is touting a recent jobs report as evidence that his jobs agenda is finally working.", "title": "14 Million More on Food Stamps Under Obama - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Welfare/foodstamps_sign_AFP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "New York Times, Politico, Twitter,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-07-06T14:07:48-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd2f\"", "article_summary": "2014 (the latest available data reported by the Department of Agriculture), 46,097,719 people received food stamps.\nStill, even counting those marginal declines, since Obama entered office, over 14 million more people now receive taxpayer-funded food stamp benefits than did prior to his becoming president.\nIn Dec. 2013, food stamp enrollments fell below 47 million for the firsttime in over a year and have edged lower each consecutive month thisyear.\nWhether Obama and Democrats can spark a jobs boom and move millions from welfare to work in the run up to the midterm elections remains to be seen.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making progress,\u201d Obama declared proudly."}
