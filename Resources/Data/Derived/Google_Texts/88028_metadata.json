Rand Paul (R-KY) spoke at the National Religious Broadcasters\u2019 First Amendment lunch on Capitol Hill. As expected, he explained the importance of defending free speech and free expression from the always-offended Thought Police\u2014as well as the moral urgency of preserving traditional marriage and families.\n\nMost memorably, however, he urged conservatives to begin reframing and rethinking the way they discuss perhaps the most divisive social issue in America: abortion.\n\n\u201cA couple weeks ago I had a press conference in New Hampshire and they had asked me, in an interview earlier, about the issue of abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they did what all liberal groups do; they wanted to know about this exception or that exception. I think about it in the opposite terms. Should we not ask them if there are any exceptions to when you can have an abortion?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve let them trap us on the opposite end,\u201d he continued. \u201cLet\u2019s trap them where the real question is. When the vast majority of the public is with us\u201484 percent of the public is upset about the idea of third trimester abortions\u2014[we must stand our ground]. And I\u2019m not saying you stop there, but certainly that\u2019s where the argument ought to start. We should ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and all the Democrats, \u2018Do you think a seven pound baby has no rights just because it\u2019s still in the womb?\u201d\n\nAs it happens, Paul has already asked her that question before. And her answer was stunning. This is why the government, he believes, has a vested and legitimate interest in ending such grisly procedures.\n\n\u201cSometimes people look at me and they say, \u2018you\u2019re a libertarian don\u2019t you believe in freedom of choice?\u201d he intoned. \u201cWell, I do. But the thing is that I also acknowledge that the government should be involved in protecting life. I believe in the police, I believe in the army, I believe in all these things that the government is involved. [I don\u2019t care] what kind of light bulbs you get. But in protecting you from aggressing against another individual? Absolutely yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we win that argument,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we win it hands down and I think we need to push back on it. And I\u2019m going to continue fighting on this issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I think we win that argument.\".05/27/2016 8:48:06AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"I think we win that argument.\"", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Rand Paul: We Let Liberals Trap Us On Abortion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/05/07/rand-paul-we-let-liberals-trap-us-on-abortion-n1995972", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/119/2015-04-29T162641Z_1_LYNXMPEB3S0SQ_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"I think we win that argument.\"", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Rand Paul: We Let Liberals Trap Us On Abortion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/05/07/rand-paul-we-let-liberals-trap-us-on-abortion-n1995972", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/119/2015-04-29T162641Z_1_LYNXMPEB3S0SQ_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Rand Paul: We Let Liberals Trap Us On Abortion , Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "On Thursday, Sen.
