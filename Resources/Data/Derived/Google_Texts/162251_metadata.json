The 17-year-old, Lamont Cathey, is ingesting screws, needles, and anything else he can find at Cook County Jail. In the process, he has managed to rack up over $1 million in medical fees after being hospitalized 24 times to remove digested pieces of metal.\n\nCathey was charged with burglary for a theft from a pizzeria, spending the last year and four months in prison after failing to pay a $5,000 cash bond. Since then, he's been struggling with depression and other mental health issues. He's one of the many inmates who need professional care but haven\u2019t come close to receiving it. As the Treatment Advocacy Center noted in a report released, \u201cprisons and jails have become America\u2019s \u2018new asylums.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs of 2012, there were almost 400,000 inmates who were severely mentally ill. When you contrast that with the amount of patients who were in state psychiatric hospitals (35,000), you can see the structural issues at work. There are more than 1.57 million inmates behind bars as of 2013. That means that nearly a quarter of those inmates are dealing with severe mental illnesses.\n\nThe conditions of many prisons across America are incredibly poor, leaving the inmates untreated and unkept. It is in these types of conditions that Cathey finds himself. In addition to eating metal, he has also continued to rack up charges. He shoved a guard and committed other offenses, which could leave him in prison longer.\n\n\u201cThis case to me is a perfect example of the failure of the criminal justice system,\u201d the prison\u2019s executive director Cara Smith told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAfter racking up the $1 million in medical fees, officials then decided to move Cathey into a location with no access to loose objects.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jailed, teen, racks, 1m, medical, costs, eating, screws, needles, prison", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Chicago teen has cost $1 million in medical fees after ingesting various metal objects around prison.", "title": "Jailed Teen Racks Up $1M In Medical Costs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jailed-teen-racks-1m-medical-costs-eating-screws-needles-prison-335054", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/26/prison.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Chicago teen has cost $1 million in medical fees after ingesting various metal objects around prison.", "title": "Jailed Teen Racks Up $1M In Medical Costs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jailed-teen-racks-1m-medical-costs-eating-screws-needles-prison-335054", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/26/prison.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/26/prison.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-05-28T16:54:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T16:54:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Chicago teen has cost $1 million in medical fees after ingesting various metal objects around prison."}, "article_summary": "There are more than 1.57 million inmates behind bars as of 2013.\nThe 17-year-old, Lamont Cathey, is ingesting screws, needles, and anything else he can find at Cook County Jail.\nAfter racking up the $1 million in medical fees, officials then decided to move Cathey into a location with no access to loose objects.\nIn the process, he has managed to rack up over $1 million in medical fees after being hospitalized 24 times to remove digested pieces of metal.\nA teenage Chicago basketball star is eating a prison from the inside out \u2014 literally."}
