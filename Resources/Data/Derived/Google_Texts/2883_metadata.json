But those tasked with signing up consumers in health plans are sure to face plenty of challenges for the second open enrollment go-around. Throughout the Marketplace\u2019s first year, healthcare navigators served a vital function. These workers, trained with federal grant funds to help consumers analyze insurance options, helped shepherd people through a new and cumbersome process.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn-person assisters have an impact on the lives of so many Americans, helping individuals and families across the country access quality, affordable health coverage,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAccording to a July Kaiser Family Foundation survey of the health insurance marketplace assistor programs, more than 4,400 of them, employing over 28,000 full-time-equivalent staff and volunteers, helped an estimated 10.6 million people during the first open enrollment period. The navigators typically work in local libraries, churches and food bank offices.\n\n\n\nOver 80% of those programs reported that most consumers who sought help didn\u2019t understand the ACA or the coverage choices offered them, or simply lacked confidence to apply on their own. Almost 90% of programs reported the majority of consumers they helped were uninsured. (There are different types of assistor programs that provide outreach; they include navigators, in-person assistors and certified application counselors. Each receives training to provide enrollment assistance to consumers, but they differ in the extent of their duties.)\n\n\n\nHHS announced this month it\u2019s giving $60 million in grants to 90 nonprofit groups that hire navigators and assistors nationwide. That\u2019s down from $67 million for the first enrollment cycle.\n\n\n\nNew challenges\n\n\n\nIn some regards, navigators and assistors, considered the backbone of Obamacare\u2019s ongoing outreach effort, are likely to have a tougher job this year for a few reasons.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the biggest challenge for assisters will be to help more people with more tasks in half the time,\u201d says Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The coming enrollment lasts three months (Nov. 15, 2014 -- Feb. 15, 2015), compared with six months for the launch.\n\n\n\nMany of the consumers who haven\u2019t yet signed up for a plan are the hardest to get to. The 8 million newly insured people were the easier targets \u2013 out of more than 47 million nonelderly Americans who were uninsured in 2012 \u2013 and the 5 million people who the Congressional Budget Office forecasts will enroll for 2015 coverage may be less informed and resourced than the initial enrollees. And if that\u2019s the case, consumers may require even more help from assisters than they did last year, Pollitz says.\n\n\n\nAnother unknown is continuity among assistor-navigator programs. People who worked as assistors and navigators last time can work more efficiently because they\u2019re experienced and have established systems and procedures. But almost 40% of 2015 navigator programs that received federal grants are new, which means these groups and the navigators they hire \u201cwill have to master the learning curve,\u201d Pollitz says. And again this year, HHS awarded the navigator grants late in the season, so time to prepare for the second enrollment period is limited.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll these factors suggest a net increase in the workload, and intensity of workload, for this next class of marketplace assisters,\u201d Pollitz says.\n\n\n\nThe ABCs of health insurance\n\n\n\nThe chief hurdle for navigators last year was a lack of consumer awareness and understanding of the law. A recent survey by Transamerica Center for Health Studies shows this ignorance hasn\u2019t dramatically abated. It found that 46% of those who remain uninsured have still not heard of the individual mandate, and 43% haven\u2019t heard of the health exchanges.\n\n\n\nAnswering questions about what the ACA was and its impact on consumers was the most important part of many navigators\u2019 jobs in the first go-round, and it\u2019s likely to be so again this year. Fully comprehending the details of an insurance plan can be a struggle for someone who\u2019s had it their whole working lives, but for those who\u2019ve never carried an insurance card, it\u2019s a whole other language.\n\n\n\nJulie Leon, a navigator with the Ohio Association of Food Banks, last year helped enroll many people who had been uninsured before the ACA kicked in. Explaining the basics of having health insurance was a prodigious effort, says Leon, who plans to work as a navigator again this year.\n\n\n\nThe slogging nature of navigators\u2019 work has been universal. \u201cGetting into the basics of insurance with an individual who\u2019s never had insurance is complicated,\u201d says Jodi Ray, principal investigator for the University of South Florida Navigator grant. (USF got a $5.38 million grant, the largest in the country.) \u201cYou\u2019re talking about deductibles, co-insurance, how do you pick a network, a plan. It\u2019s very time-consuming.\u201d\n\n\n\nShopping for a health plan involves evaluating multiple price points \u2013 for instance, some plans have lower premiums but smaller doctor networks, while others have higher premiums but lower co-pays \u2013 adding another layer of complication to navigators\u2019 work.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat conversation really takes a long time \u2013 longer than we ever anticipated. Oftentimes it took several visits,\u201d says Zach Reat, who oversees the navigator program at the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, which received a $2.18 million grant this year and $2.05 million last year.\n\n\n\nTax complications\n\n\n\nFor the second enrollment period navigators expect inquiries similar to those they received the first time around, along with an increased focus on questions around tax subsidies.\n\n\n\nInsurers are sending customers auto-renewal notices now, and many, if not most, of those already enrolled should go back to Healthcare.gov to review their plan choices and subsidy eligibility, says Pollitz. Plans and premiums have changed. Consumers who don\u2019t review their options may get the incorrect credit amount for 2015 and risk over-collecting on the subsidy (which they\u2019d have to ultimately pay back) or not collect all the subsidies they\u2019re entitled to.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a consumer received subsidies for a silver plan last year that became cheaper for the following year, they may end up owing the IRS money when they file their 2015 taxes, even if their own income remained steady, Pollitz says. Also, consumers\u2019 subsidy eligibility may change if their income for 2014 looks like it will be significantly higher or lower than they estimated originally.\n\n\n\nThough navigators aren\u2019t tax experts and are not tasked with helping consumers file their tax returns, they have to be ready to answer these kinds of questions, Ray says.\n\n\n\n\u201cNavigators need to take time to be sure that consumers walk away with an understanding of how to pick a plan and what they do with the plan once they get it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just filling out a form.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more in our Obamacare series:\n\n\n\nThe Obamacare marketplace one year later: How you\u2019re faring\n\n\n\nHow to see through opaque health care costs\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Video:", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Yahoo Finance: Navigators and assistors, considered the backbone of Obamacare\u2019s ongoing outreach effort, are likely to have a tougher job this year for a few reasons.", "original-source": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/obamacare-navigators-will-face-tougher-second-enrollment-period-143350839.html", "og": {"site_name": "Yahoo Finance", "description": "Navigators and assistors, considered the backbone of Obamacare\u2019s ongoing outreach effort, are likely to have a tougher job this year for a few reasons.", "title": "Obamacare navigators will face tougher second enrollment period", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/obamacare-navigators-will-face-tougher-second-enrollment-period-143350839.html", "image": "http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/3oWhAtYpkNZw3.budJh9Og--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/gettyimages.com/navigators-help-floridians-sign-health-20131008-172101-494.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Navigators and assistors, considered the backbone of Obamacare\u2019s ongoing outreach effort, are likely to have a tougher job this year for a few reasons.", "title": "Obamacare navigators will face tougher second enrollment period", "image": {"src": "http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/3oWhAtYpkNZw3.budJh9Og--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/gettyimages.com/navigators-help-floridians-sign-health-20131008-172101-494.jpg", "identifier": "http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/3oWhAtYpkNZw3.budJh9Og--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/gettyimages.com/navigators-help-floridians-sign-health-20131008-172101-494.jpg"}, "site": "@YahooFinance", "dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "fb": {"app_id": 90376669494}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "theme-color": "#400090", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "application-name": "Obamacare navigators will face tougher second enrollment period", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/yahoofinance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But those tasked with signing up consumers in health plans are sure to face plenty of challenges for the second open enrollment go-around.\nTax complicationsFor the second enrollment period navigators expect inquiries similar to those they received the first time around, along with an increased focus on questions around tax subsidies.\nAfter last year\u2019s ugly rollout of the healthcare marketplace, the Obama administration is no doubt counting on a smoother course for its second enrollment period.\nAnd again this year, HHS awarded the navigator grants late in the season, so time to prepare for the second enrollment period is limited.\nExplaining the basics of having health insurance was a prodigious effort, says Leon, who plans to work as a navigator again this year."}
