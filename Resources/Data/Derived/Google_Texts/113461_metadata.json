The backers of this law say keeping records on whether they have guns in their homes violates their Second Amendment rights.\n\nWUSF's Craig Kopp spoke with a Jacksonville pediatrician and a firearms expert about whether doctors should talk to patients about guns.\n\nIn this excerpt from Florida Matters, Joe Krawtschenko, a manager and lead firearms instructor at Aegis Tactical in Lakewood Ranch, questions the way pediatricians collect information about children and their families.\n\nDr. Mobeen H. Rathore, president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, explained how and why the questions and ensuing conversations are a matter of safety.\n\nCraig Kopp: Last year, 17 kids were killed by guns in Florida. Joe, is there any way you can see to resolve this short of telling doctors how to practice?\n\nJoe Krawtschenko: Just don\u2019t answer their question. To me it\u2019s simple, and this is like a waste of taxpayer\u2019s money going through all this. If you don\u2019t like your doctor, if he asks you if you have guns, you don\u2019t want to answer and he doesn\u2019t want to see you, you find a new doctor.\n\nThe doctor here is saying he\u2019s keeping records to help treat his patients better. So you are keeping records if they have swimming pools, what car they have, if they have a lighter in the house, if they smoke, what kind of food they eat so they don\u2019t choke. You keep records of all that. And that\u2019s going to help you treat them better. I find that hard to believe.\n\nKopp: Dr. Rathore, do you keep all those kinds of records? Maybe you can give us an example. You mention swimming pools; you mention poisons and storage of poisons. What other kinds of questions does a pediatrician regularly ask of your patients?\n\nDr. Mobeen H. Rathore: We ask them you know, if when they are in their cars, do they wear seatbelts? We don\u2019t need to know what sort of kind of car they drive, but we do need to advise them they need to wear seatbelts if they are driving. We also need to advise the families about car seats, and how to appropriately put the car seats in and where the child should be in the car. We also need to advise them about helmets, using helmets when using bicycles or skateboarding. I mean there are so many things we have to talk over.\n\nKopp: Doctor, Are you keeping records of that?\n\nRathore: We will definitely say we discuss the car seat issue, and that the family did have a car seat. We advise them how car seats should be used. We also keep records if they are smoking in the house and how we would advise them that exposure to smoke for children is dangerous for children\u2019s health. So we would advise them if they are not using helmets. We would ask them about that.\n\nKrawtschenko: So do you have a little check off list that you are using? Do they have a bicycle, are they wearing a helmet, do they have a swimming pool, do they have a cage around it\u2026 Do they have a firearm? Did you tell them to keep it locked up?\n\nKopp: I am smelling here an information gap between one side and the other. So when a pediatrician does this, I suspect it\u2019s a kind of check list, right\u2026and it\u2019s kept in a patient\u2019s record\u2026\n\nRathore: Yes, so the anticipatory guidance would be very age-dependent. When you have a child who is about starting to crawl, before they actually start to crawl, we have to talk to the parents about how they are securing the electrical outlets.\n\nAs the child starts to walk, we have to make sure we talk to them about when they are boiling water on the stove, how it needs to be kept safely. So it\u2019s not necessarily a checklist, but it\u2019s at each age-appropriate stage of the child\u2019s growth. We ask appropriate questions so we can provide anticipatory guidance.\n\nNow Craig, the main issue here is this is something that all doctors, all people in this country should be very concerned about, this ruling and the loss of the First Amendment protection to speak to patients about issues that impact their health and safety.\n\nAnd all patients in this country should also be concerned with this ruling because this will interfere with the doctor\u2019s ability to provide good, sound medicine and medical advice to our patients. And I think we don\u2019t want to be in a situation where we are not able to provide that information and advice to our patients and families.\n\nTo hear more of the conversation about whether doctors should talk to their patients about gun ownership visit Florida Matters at WUSF.org.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A federal appeals court recently upheld a Florida law that limits what doctors can tell their patients about gun ownership.
