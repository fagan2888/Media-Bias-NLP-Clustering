A Ladson man who was charged with driving without a valid license for the fifth time this week hid a bag of pot inside the patrol car after he was arrested, according to North Charleston police.

Jesse Sebastian Broughton, 23, of Ladson Road was arrested Wednesday and charged with speeding, fifth-offense driving under suspension, habitual offender and possession of a controlled substance.

At 4:44 p.m. an officer on Dorchester Road near Ranger Drive saw a white pickup truck doing 54 mph in a posted 35 mph zone and pulled it over, according to the incident report. As the officer approached, he said he saw the driver and female passenger switch places.

The officer called for backup and knocked on the passenger door. When Broughton opened it, “I could smell the overpowering odor of marijuana,” the officer reported. Officers reported finding Xanax in a book bag. Broughton told police they had smoked the pot, according to the report.

Officers also said they found a loaded handgun in the center console between the seats, but no red flags came up when they ran a check on it.

The passenger who had jumped into the driver’s seat was cited for allowing an unauthorized person to operate her rental car.

The next day, the arresting officer smelled pot in the patrol car but couldn’t find the source. He reviewed the arrest video and observed Broughton pull a clear bag that later tested as pot from his pants and wedge it in the partition, according to the report. Broughton also was cited for possession of pot.

Broughton was released from the Charleston County jail on $10,000 total bail and must also go to court for the speeding ticket.
