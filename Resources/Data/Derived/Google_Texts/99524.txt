Five Connecticut hospitals have left the network of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, after they failed to reach an agreement with the insurer.

The five all belong to the same parent company, Hartford Healthcare. They are Hartford Hospital, William Backus in Norwich, Midstate Medical Center in Meriden, The Hospital of Central Connecticut, and Windham Hospital.

The failure of the deal means patients who have Anthem insurance will have to pay higher out-of-network rates if they seek care at one of the five, although the insurer says it will make arrangements for patients who are currently receiving ongoing care.

Anthem is the state's largest insurer. The company says the biggest issue between the two sides is the question of linking pay to performance. The hospitals could return to the network if continuing talks produce an agreement.
