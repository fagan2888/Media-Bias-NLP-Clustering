What a time that was \u2013 the uncomfortable-in-his-own-skin awkwardness; the sad, pleading earnestness; the inescapable aura of crushing sadness and defeat; the Apple Watch. It was magical. And to counteract all that soul-withering desperation, there was the Jeb Bush promise, the much-mocked and self-evidently overoptimistic guarantee that under President Jeb the United States economy would grow at an annual rate of no less than 4 percent.\n\nThat promise was wildly out of step with historical averages \u2013 going back to 1968, only one president, Bill Clinton, averaged 4 percent growth over a four-year term. And Jeb based his guarantee off his experience as governor of Florida, when he averaged 4.4 percent statewide growth on the strength of a perilously large housing bubble that catastrophically popped shortly after he left office (somehow that detail never made it into the campaign literature). Regardless, \u201cfour-percent growth\u201d was the mantra of Jeb the incurable optimist.\n\nWell, as it turns out, ol\u2019 Jeb was nothing but a piker. Four percent? That\u2019s a loser\u2019s goal. Because here comes Ted Cruz, the last man standing between Donald Trump and the Republican nomination, promising America that under his watch the economy will zip along at \u201ca minimum of five-percent GDP growth.\u201d Five percent! As you might guess, that\u2019s an even rarer accomplishment than Jeb\u2019s guaranteed 4 percent. Harry Truman enjoyed 6.5 percent average growth in the post-war economic boom; the Kennedy-Johnson administration of the early \u201960s cleared 5 percent average growth; and since then no president has broken the 5 percent barrier for a single term. Cruz is promising not just to break that trend but to deliver sustained growth at or above 5 percent.\n\nHow\u2019s he going to get there? Well, Ted Cruz has a plan. Per CNN: \u201cCruz says it\u2019s about going back to Reagan-style economics: cut taxes, scale back regulation on business and repeal Obamacare.\u201d Ted Cruz\u2019s tax plan is unique in that it represents the most radical and aggressive upward redistribution of wealth of any of the plans offered by 2016 Republicans. His big idea is to completely restructure the tax code in such a way that the wealthiest Americans will reap massive windfalls. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of the plan\u2019s cost (79.6 percent) goes to helping the richest fifth of taxpayers,\u201d Dylan Matthews noted at Vox: \u201c43.7 percent goes to the top 1 percent alone.\u201d And as Bryce Covert writes at ThinkProgress, the assumption at play here \u2013 that colossal tax cuts for the wealthiest will trigger massive economic growth \u2013 is not backed up by research. What Cruz\u2019s tax cuts will do, however, is explode the national debt by more than $10 trillion in the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz and the author of the Kansas tax-cut disaster are going to make trickle-down work this time, honest", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s 5-percent flim-flam: His latest economic promise is a real laugher", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ted Cruz and the author of the Kansas tax-cut disaster are going to make trickle-down work this time, honest", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s 5-percent flim-flam: His latest economic promise is a real laugher", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/18/ted_cruzs_5_percent_flim_flam_his_latest_economic_promise_is_a_real_laugher/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/ted_cruz36.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz and the author of the Kansas tax-cut disaster are going to make trickle-down work this time, honest", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s 5-percent flim-flam: His latest economic promise is a real laugher", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/ted_cruz36.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, Art Laffer, Editor's Picks, Jeb Bush, Kansas, Sam Brownback, Tax cuts, Ted Cruz, trickle-down economics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "What Cruz\u2019s tax cuts will do, however, is explode the national debt by more than $10 trillion in the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center.\nWell, Ted Cruz has a plan.\nAnd to counteract all that soul-withering desperation, there was the Jeb Bush promise, the much-mocked and self-evidently overoptimistic guarantee that under President Jeb the United States economy would grow at an annual rate of no less than 4 percent.\nCruz is promising not just to break that trend but to deliver sustained growth at or above 5 percent.\nThat promise was wildly out of step with historical averages \u2013 going back to 1968, only one president, Bill Clinton, averaged 4 percent growth over a four-year term."}
