Steve King, Same-sex marriage, Stephen Colbert, wedding cake, Entertainment News, News, Politics News\n\nFriday night\u2019s Late Show with Stephen Colbert joked that \u201cgay marriage is still a controversy in this country despite the fact that it\u2019s not.\u201d But so many right wing activists are fighting tooth and nail to maintain some lasting form of homophobia as the Culture War takes its final dying breath.\n\n\u201cI think everyone should love whoever they want,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cSo, I was miffed when Kentucky County Clerk and forehead magnate Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But I also felt bad for her when that judge sent her to jail and even worse when she was sentenced to send an afternoon with Mike Huckabee. It\u2019s cruel and unusual,\u201d he joked.\n\nColbert said that Davis isn\u2019t alone and brought up Iowa Congressman and cantaloupe calves fan Steve King who recently compared same-sex marriage to marrying a lawn mower. \u201cWhile introducing Mike Huckabee at a campaign event just this summer, King criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that legalized gay marriage by claiming it means \u2018You can marry my lawnmower.\u2019 It makes sense, I mean, who hasn\u2019t looked at a manifold on a two stroke Toro and thought \u2018damn, I wouldn\u2019t mind yankin\u2019 that cord!'\u201d\n\nColbert reminded the audience that King is an actual Congressman, not some crazy old man, though many could see the striking resemblance. \u201cHe has sound legal backing for his theories,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s some guy he met. He says \u2018I had a \u2026 lawyer tell me\u2026 what it brings about is: It only requires one human being in this relationship \u2014 that you could marry your lawnmower with this decision. I think he\u2019s right.\u2019 Yes, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was very clear. Marriage is between one man, and any other noun. I\u2019m not surprised, my college roommate was in a common law marriage with a tube sock.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"So, who's going to do party planning for Steve King's nightmare marriage scenarios?
