Among other things, it drives home the extent to which \u2014 despite all the glitches likely in the first few months \u2014 this is now being fought on favorable terrain for the reformers.\n\nNever mind the polls showing approval of Obamacare moving one way or the other; they are all being taken in an environment where people are amazingly ignorant about the law, with a large minority believing that it has been repealed. What matters is how the thing works \u2014 and that, in turn, depends crucially on sufficient numbers of young, currently uninsured people signing up for the exchanges. Advocates will try to get those people signed up; Republicans will try to convince them not to. So how are the two sides\u2019 chances.\n\nWell, let\u2019s think about who we\u2019re talking about: Young. Currently uninsured, which generally means not very affluent, and also tends to mean nonwhite more than average.\n\nIn other words, basically the opposite of the profile of Tea Party backers. Also, by the way, more or less the opposite of midterm voters.\n\nChait stresses the youth aspect:\n\nFortunately for Obama, this field of battle favors his side. To pass the law, he needed to win over skeptical senators. To defend it in court, he needed conservative jurists. But identifying and persuading young people is a battle Obama does not expect to lose to Republicans, and in place of the federal outreach funds, the administration is deploying a campaignlike array of weapons: microtargeting, including door-to-door outreach, and all forms of media. (A few weeks ago, Katy Perry tweeted out a link informing her 42 million followers that health care was available beginning October 1.)\n\nYep, when it comes to reaching hipsters, or young people in general \u2014 I know, Katy Perry \u2014 Dems have big advantages; all that coastal cultural elite hatred suddenly turns into a big disadvantage for the right.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: there are also channels of influence the party of Fox News simply cannot reach: Spanish-language radio and TV, black churches (which played a big role in 2012), and more.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether anyone thought this out in advance, but the battle of the exchanges is indeed being fought on remarkably favorable ground for the reformers. And I, for one, find the thought of conservatives humiliated by an army of tweeting hipsters remarkably cheering.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130923143846, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 23, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Attack of the Killer Hipsters ( 20130923 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Democrats, Republicans, and the battle of the exchanges.", "title": "Attack of the Killer Hipsters", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/attack-of-the-killer-hipsters/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002459889, "description": "Democrats, Republicans, and the battle of the exchanges.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 23, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1379961526, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T18:38:46-04:00"}, "utime": 20130923183846, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130923, "pdate": 20130923, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Democrats, Republicans, and the battle of the exchanges.", "title": "Attack of the Killer Hipsters", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/attack-of-the-killer-hipsters/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/attack-of-the-killer-hipsters/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Attack of the Killer Hipsters", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd845d\"", "article_summary": "And I, for one, find the thought of conservatives humiliated by an army of tweeting hipsters remarkably cheering.\nAdvocates will try to get those people signed up; Republicans will try to convince them not to.\nWhat matters is how the thing works \u2014 and that, in turn, depends crucially on sufficient numbers of young, currently uninsured people signing up for the exchanges.\nJonathan Chait has an excellent survey of the current state of the battle for health reform.\nYep, when it comes to reaching hipsters, or young people in general \u2014 I know, Katy Perry \u2014 Dems have big advantages; all that coastal cultural elite hatred suddenly turns into a big disadvantage for the right."}
