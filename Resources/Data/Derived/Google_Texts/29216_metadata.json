(REUTERS/Jason Reed)\n\n4443225\n\nSeven months after federal officials fired CGI Federal for its botched work on Obamacare website Healthcare.gov, the IRS awarded the same company a $4.5 million IT contract for its new Obamacare tax program.\n\nCGI is a $10.5 billion Montreal-based company that has forever been etched into the public\u2019s mind as the company behind the bungled Obamacare main website.\n\nAfter facing a year of embarrassing failures, federal officials finally pulled the plug on the company and terminated CGI\u2019s contract in January 2014.\n\nYet on Aug. 11, seven months later, IRS officials signed a new contract with CGI to provide \u201ccritical functions\u201d and \u201cmanagement support\u201d for its Obamacare tax program, according to the Federal Procurement Data System, a federal government procurement database.\n\nThe IRS contract is worth $4.46 million, according to the FPDS data. The contract expires Aug. 15, 2015.\n\nPrior to terminating CGI\u2019s contract, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress, \u201cI am as frustrated and angry as anyone with the flawed launch of HealthCare.gov.\u201d She called the CGI-designed website a \u201cdebacle.\u201d\n\nA joint Senate Finance and Judiciary Committee staff report in June 2014 found that Turning Point Global Solutions, hired by HHS to review CGI\u2019s performance on Healthcare.gov, reported they found 21,000 lines of defective software code inserted by CGI.\n\nScott Amey, the general counsel for the non-profit Project on Government Oversight, which reviews government contracting, examined the IRS contract with CGI.\n\n\n\n\u201cCGI was the poster child for government failure,\u201d he told The Daily Caller. \u201cI am shocked that the IRS has turned around and is using them for Obamacare IT work.\u201d\n\nWashington was not the only city that has been fed up with CGI on healthcare.\n\nLast year, CGI was fired by the liberal states of Vermont and Massachusetts for failing to deliver on their Obamacare websites.\n\nThe Obamacare health website in Massachusetts never worked, despite the state paying $170 million to CGI.\n\nMassachusetts, the state that pioneered government healthcare through its Romneycare health insurance program in 2006, could only enroll 31,000 people in 2014. Most enrollments were through paper applications.\n\nAnd in Vermont, state officials pulled the plug on CGI after its system failed to work for 10 months. Vermont had paid $66.7 million to CGI. The state imposed a $5 million penalty on the company for shoddy work.\n\nCGI\u2019s 2014 annual report says nothing about the disastrous rollout of online healthcare websites in the United States.\n\nCuriously, CGI features its online health work in Helsinki, London, Alberta, Saskatchewan and for the New York State of Mental Health, but says nothing about its ruined rollout of Obamacare web sites.\n\nIn Canada, CGI\u2019s parent company, Montreal-based CGI Group, was just as deficient.\n\nOntario health officials fired CGI after it failed to deliver a flagship provincial online health registry.\n\nAbout 7 million Obamacare policyholders and about 20 million Americans who don\u2019t have healthcare coverage will depend this year on the proper IRS processing of their 2014 income tax returns.\n\nImproper processing of health information could cause some Americans to receive smaller tax refunds, or even pay more out-of-pocket for their government-issued healthcare policies.\n\nA September 2013 audit by the IRS inspector general criticized the tax agency\u2019s software and computer systems aimed to process Obamacare tax return forms.\n\nMichael E. McKenney, the acting deputy inspector general, found many problems with the IRS software, including lax security and fraud controls.\n\nGovernment auditors found \u201cMany of the vulnerabilities in information systems can be traced to software flaws and misconfigurations of system components.\u201d\n\nThe IRS did not reply to numerous inquiries to the agency about the CGI contract.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "rpollock", "description": "Try again", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Seven months after federal officials fired CGI Federal for its botched work on Obamacare website Healthcare.gov, the IRS awarded the same company a $4.5 million IT contract for its new Obamacare tax p", "title": "BOMBSHELL: IRS Has Active Contract For MILLIONS With Company HHS FIRED Over Botched Healthcare.gov", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/01/21/bombshell-irs-has-active-contract-for-millions-with-company-hhs-fired-over-botched-healthcare-gov/", "image": {"width": 604, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6041.jpg", "height": 262}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Try again", "title": "BOMBSHELL: IRS Has Active Contract For MILLIONS With Company HHS FIRED Over Botched Healthcare.gov Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/01/21/bombshell-irs-has-active-contract-for-millions-with-company-hhs-fired-over-botched-healthcare-gov/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6041.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-21 23:33:40", "sailthru.title": "BOMBSHELL: IRS Has Active Contract For MILLIONS With Company HHS FIRED Over Botched Healthcare.gov", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,healthcare-gov,internal-revenue-service,obamacare,rpollock", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "standout,barack obama,healthcare.gov,internal revenue service,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Seven months after federal officials fired CGI Federal for its botched work on Obamacare website Healthcare.gov, the IRS awarded the same company a $4.5 million IT contract for its new Obamacare tax p", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6041.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6b7\"", "article_summary": "Scott Amey, the general counsel for the non-profit Project on Government Oversight, which reviews government contracting, examined the IRS contract with CGI.\n(REUTERS/Jason Reed)4443225Seven months after federal officials fired CGI Federal for its botched work on Obamacare website Healthcare.gov, the IRS awarded the same company a $4.5 million IT contract for its new Obamacare tax program.\nThe IRS contract is worth $4.46 million, according to the FPDS data.\nA September 2013 audit by the IRS inspector general criticized the tax agency\u2019s software and computer systems aimed to process Obamacare tax return forms.\nAfter facing a year of embarrassing failures, federal officials finally pulled the plug on the company and terminated CGI\u2019s contract in January 2014."}
