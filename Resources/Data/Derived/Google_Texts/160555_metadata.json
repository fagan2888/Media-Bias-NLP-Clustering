He\u2019s also considering keeping Alexander Hamilton, the current resident of the bill and the nation\u2019s first Treasury secretary, on some of the notes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe woman hasn\u2019t been chosen yet. In true Washington bureaucratic style, the currency change will be open for public comment first.\n\nThe decision \u201creflects our aspirations for the future as much as our aspirations of the past,\u201d Lew told reporters.\n\nWomen were last seen on paper currency in the 19th century, when Pocahontas was featured on $20 bank notes and Martha Washington appeared on $1 silver certificates.\n\nThe decision to change the ten-spot came as feminist groups have been pushing for a woman on the currency in 2020 to mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. Sharing space with Hamilton \u2014 who not only conceived the nation\u2019s financial system but also served as a protagonist in the nation\u2019s first sex scandal \u2014 wasn\u2019t exactly what they had in mind.\n\nA nonprofit organization, Women On 20s (Slogan: \u201cA woman\u2019s place is on the money\u201d), has been campaigning instead to get rid of Andrew Jackson, the nation\u2019s seventh president, whose face appears on the $20 bill. Jackson\u2019s record of removing Native Americans from their land and his opposition to the central banking system made him a good candidate to be yanked, they\u2019ve argued.\n\nHarriet Tubman was the winner of a poll the organization conducted to determine which woman should replace Jackson.\n\nU.S. currency has rarely undergone major redesigns, but in 2013, the $10 bill was chosen for a remake partly to beef up protections against counterfeit threats, the Treasury said.\n\nLew said putting a woman on a bill had been under consideration well before his tenure at Treasury began, and President Barack Obama endorsed the idea last year, when he called it a \u201cpretty good idea\u201d during a July speech about the economy in Kansas City.\n\nThe Obama administration will be considering nominations of prominent women in U.S. history over the coming months and expects to announce its selection at the end of the summer, the Treasury said.\n\nLew said it was \u201cpersonally very important\u201d to him to preserve Hamilton\u2019s place of honor on the $10. So whether it\u2019s by printing $10s with different faces, or with multiple portraits on a single one, the woman will have to share with Hamilton.\n\nIn fact, Hamilton shared his bed with more than one woman \u2014 making him one of the first subjects of a political sex scandal.\n\nWhile his wife, Elizabeth, and kids were staying with relatives, Hamilton began an affair with a young woman named Maria Reynolds in 1791. He was secretary of the Treasury at the time, and Reynolds and her husband started extorting money from Hamilton. Hamilton eventually confessed to the affair in full detail in a pamphlet that also featured letters between him and his mistress.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "In true Washington bureaucratic style, the currency change will be open for public comment first.", "title": "Woman will appear on $10 bill", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/woman-will-appear-on-10-bill-119135.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/17/150617_10_dollars_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Women,Money,Kansas City,Treasury Department,Currency,Banks,Jack Lew,Alexander Hamilton", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "In true Washington bureaucratic style, the currency change will be open for public comment first.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Woman will appear on $10 bill But Alexander Hamilton may still be featured on some notes.\nThe $10 bill, up for a redesign in 2020, will feature a female face, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced Wednesday.\nHe\u2019s also considering keeping Alexander Hamilton, the current resident of the bill and the nation\u2019s first Treasury secretary, on some of the notes.\nWhile his wife, Elizabeth, and kids were staying with relatives, Hamilton began an affair with a young woman named Maria Reynolds in 1791.\nHarriet Tubman was the winner of a poll the organization conducted to determine which woman should replace Jackson."}
