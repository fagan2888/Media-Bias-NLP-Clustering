However, one interesting development in this field is how hospitals are integrating consumer data with clinical data to identify patients at high risk. For example, if the post-surgical heart patient buys a package of cigarettes, some hospitals say they want to know.\n\nThis is a trend with interesting implications for clinical laboratories. For example, will hospitals using big data in this fashion want to include medical laboratory test results in the mix of information they collect and analyze on their patients? If so, are there ethical issues associated with using such lab test data in this manner?\n\nMajor Health Systems Are Assembling \u2018Big Data\u2019 on Their Patients\n\nRecent news stories describe how prominent health systems, such as the Carolinas HealthCare System and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), are taking their first steps to integrate consumer data\u2014such as what people buy or characteristics of their zip code\u2014with clinical data, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek story.\n\nThe providers are tapping detailed consumer information compiled by data brokers from credit card transactions and public records. The idea is to \u201cidentify those most likely to get sick, so the hospitals can intervene before they do,\u201d Bloomberg reported.\n\nSome experts say that providers are motivated to make their big data bigger with the consumer health information, because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA rewards hospitals for quality outcomes, as opposed to paying fees for services.\n\nAdditionally, since 2012, ACA has penalized hospitals for excessive Medicare patient readmissions related to select conditions. These include acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. Meanwhile, accountable care organizations (ACOs) and patient-centered medical homes are reimbursed based on \u201cright care at the right time and unnecessary duplication of services.\u201d\n\nConsequently, providers are exploring resources\u2014including big data\u2014that give them a peek at people\u2019s habits. Pathologists and medical laboratory professionals need to be aware of this new healthcare trend and its related privacy issues. That\u2019s because clinical lab data is expected to be part of the clinical information that gets matched with consumer information.\n\nHealthcare Systems Use Consumer Data to Profile Patients\n\nCarolinas HealthCare System is integrating consumer data\u2014purchases made with credit or store loyalty cards\u2014into \u201calgorithms designed to identify high-risk patients,\u201d the Bloomberg article shared.\n\n\u201cWhat we are looking to find are people before they end up in trouble. The idea is to use big data and predictive models to think about population health and drill down to the individual levels to find someone running into trouble that we can reach out to and try to help out,\u201d said Michael Dulin, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Clinical Officer for Analytics and Outcomes at Carolinas HealthCare System, in the Bloomberg article.\n\n\n\nPictured above is Michael Dulin, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Clinical Officer for Analytics and Outcomes at Carolinas Healthcare System (CHCS). He told Bloomberg Businessweek that the CHCS, a 900-care-center system, may have patient risk scores, based on predictive models, available to doctors and nurses in just two years. An asthma patient\u2019s score, for example, will rise with consumer data showing missed medication refills at the pharmacy, cigarette purchases and residing in an area with a high pollen count.

This business unit is targeting population health management, individualized patient care, and predictive modeling. (See Dark Daily, \u201cHospitals Mine Clinical Data to Help Reduce Costs and Avoid Readmissions, Creating Opportunities for Clinical Laboratory Pathologists to Contribute to Improved Patient Outcomes,\u201d April 4, 2014.)\n\nMining Big Data at UPMC in Pittsburgh\n\nMeanwhile, in Pennsylvania\u2019s UPMC\u2019s Insurance System reviews demographic and household data, such as whether a car is owned and number of people per household. A UPMC spokesperson told Bloomberg that such data on two million members helps predict people likely to use the emergency room or urgent care.\n\nData analytics that go beyond clinical data is important to the success of an ACO, according to Mark Caron, Senior Vice President and CIO of Capital Blue Cross in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Analytics must also include patient accountability so individuals are held to more responsible lifestyle behaviors in the accountable care structure, reported Fierce Health Payer in its story about how hospitals are using big data.\n\nPrivacy Advocates Voice Concerns\n\nBut not everyone wants Big Brother to call and advise them to lay off the cupcakes. Privacy advocates and patients reportedly have expressed concerns about the intrusive nature of big data in health, including the doctor-patient relationship. Lifestyle choices are regarded as personal matters.\n\n\u201cOther people are saying they have had a hard enough time getting in touch with their doctor as it is. So this (consumer data use in healthcare) seems like a weird next step,\u201d reported St. Louis\u2019s KMOV.com, which was one of many media outlets nationwide that picked up the Bloomberg story.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to stop this particular train. Data brokers are companies that collect and store billions of data elements from nearly all U.S. consumers. Sources include social media, the Department of Motor Vehicles, retailers, and more, reported Consumerist in its story.\n\nThe Obama administration in May made six recommendations to protect people\u2019s privacy. This included a consumer bill of rights and national standards for data breach notifications, Bloomberg reported in another story.\n\nBig Data Means Big Money, Knowledge\n\nBig data also means big money. Last fall, the Direct Marketing Association issued an economic study on the value of data. It showed that data shared online by consumers added $156 billion in revenue to the U.S. economy in 2012 and contributed to creation of 675,000 jobs.\n\nThe popular adage, \u201cknowledge means power,\u201d has relevance here. With more knowledge\u2014suggested by the consumer data\u2014and good intentions, healthcare providers may succeed in their outreach efforts to engage patients at risk of many diseases and health conditions before any type of acute or episodic event occurs.\n\nMeanwhile, clinical laboratory managers and pathologists may want to be alert to big data initiatives happening within the hospitals and healthcare systems they serve. Because the use of consumer data with clinical data is such a new development, there may be as many pitfalls as benefits from the use of such information as there are benefits in providing a method to identify and approach individual patients deemed at highest risk for serious health conditions.\n\n\u2014By Donna Marie Pocius\n\nRelated Content:\n\nYour Doctor Knows You\u2019re Killing Yourself.
