During the previous 2012 Summer Olympics in London, an athlete from South Sudan competed independently under the Olympic flag as the young country was still being formed.\n\nSo why is India, an independent democracy since 1947, not allowed to show its flag this year?\n\nIndia actually has been banned from Olympic activity since December 2012, when its Olympic association was banned by the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe New York Times reported that India was suspended because the leaders of its Olympic association are primarily politicians, which is against Olympic rules. In order to prevent the suspension, those holding power in the government would need to step down, which did not happen in time.\n\nThe association needed to elect new leaders prior to the start of the Olympics in order to have their athletes recognized, but news website Quartz reports the group will not hold elections until Feb. 9.\n\nThe leaders of the Indian Olympic Association didn\u2019t seem too upset about the change, with acting President Vijay Kumar Malhotra telling India\u2019s Outdoor Journal that India\u2019s athletes \u201cdon\u2019t stand a chance of winning any medals.\u201d\n\nThey may not have won any medals yet, but Shiva Keshavan turned some heads by making an impressive save following a nasty crash on the luge course during a practice run.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Why you didn\u2019t, and won\u2019t, see the Indian flag at the Winter Olympics", "title": "Why you didn\u2019t, and won\u2019t, see the Indian flag at the Winter Olympics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/why-you-didnt-and-wont-see-the-indian-flag-at-the-winter-olympics/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__p_82837838-c56f-41e2-b5cf-8060b08ac124lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208__p_82837838-c56f-41e2-b5cf-8060b08ac124lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T09:18:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:24:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "India actually has been banned from Olympic activity since December 2012, when its Olympic association was banned by the International Olympic Committee.\nThere are three athletes from India in Sochi for the Winter Olympics: Himanshu Thaku for alpine skiing, Nadeem Iqbal for cross country skiing and Shiva Keshavan for the luge.\nDuring the previous 2012 Summer Olympics in London, an athlete from South Sudan competed independently under the Olympic flag as the young country was still being formed.\nThe New York Times reported that India was suspended because the leaders of its Olympic association are primarily politicians, which is against Olympic rules.\nSo why is India, an independent democracy since 1947, not allowed to show its flag this year?"}
