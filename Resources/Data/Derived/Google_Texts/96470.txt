About Abe Davis

Abe Davis is a doctoral candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a musician.

In 2014, he revealed the "visual microphone," an algorithm that samples the vibrations of ordinary objects â€” such as a bag of potato chips â€” from high-speed video footage and transforms them into intelligible audio.

Davis also created Caperture, a 3D-imaging app designed to create and share 3D images on any compatible smartphone.
