The highway is routinely cited as being one of the region\u2019s most dangerous roads.\n\nOn June 19, AARP New York, the Walkable & Livable Communities Institute (WALC), Vision Long Island and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign (a nonprofit dedicated to reducing car dependency in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut metro area) joined forces to call attention to the highway\u2019s hazards. The four groups \u2013 along with supporters that included AARP volunteers, elected officials, county planning officials, transportation specialists and area residents \u2013 had also gathered out of concern that although the New York State Department of Transportation was making plans for safety improvements, the community had not been invited to participate in the process.\n\nSubscribe Today!

The same activity followed in the hamlet of Baldwin and then the village of Freeport, where the day of action ended with a presentation at the Freeport Library. The three towns were chosen among the more than a dozen communities along Sunrise Highway due to their interest, willingness and steps already taken to bring infill development to the areas.\n\nThe assessments proved eye-opening to the participants.\n\n\u201cWalking around today I realize that this is a suburban community best and most safely enjoyed from your car,\u201d observed Veronica Vanterpool, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. \u201cThe irony is that most people move to the suburbs because they want to enjoy the natural resources the suburbs offer. They\u2019re looking for a community fabric that\u2019s knitted together with a vibrant downtown center and community activities. But that\u2019s not what we see. We\u2019re seeing lots of roadways, lots of pavement. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of communities and neighborhoods divided by that pavement. The resources are just not being enjoyed because people don\u2019t feel safe enough to do so on their two feet.\u201d\n\nOther participants remarked about how simple changes along the Sunrise Highway corridor could have a dramatically positive impact on both the walking and driving experiences encountered on the roadway. The next steps involve reconvening the community within a few months for a larger forum to discuss the assessments and improvement opportunities.\n\nSee pictures of the day on Twitter by searching #BurdenonLongIsland.
