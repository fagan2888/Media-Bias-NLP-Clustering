It has also pulled the piece in question.\n\nWhen Personhood USA\u2019s listicle, titled \u201c8 Outrageous Things Planned Parenthood Was Caught Doing,\u201d was first published on the site, online feminists jumped to question what the community contributors guidelines were, and if Personhood USA\u2019s qualified. It wasn\u2019t the first time: Earlier that month, a community post from the conservative Heritage Foundation confused a sitting US senator into thinking that even the \u201cleft-wing\u201d media had turned against Obamacare.\n\nAfter the controversy over Personhood USA\u2019s post, a BuzzFeed representative told ThinkProgress that the company was \u201cin the process of figuring out where and whether we should draw lines about what\u2019s appropriate on what we conceived as an open platform, like Facebook and Twitter.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed has now drawn its lines.\n\nA spokesperson there pointed ThinkProgress to an article published last week on paidcontent.org in which BuzzFeed\u2019s editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, confirmed a change in community contributor guidelines, and a new design for indicating community posts. The updated (but still somewhat amorphous) rules instruct users, \u201cDon\u2019t be that guy,\u201d and that \u201cno haters\u201d and \u201cno personal attacks\u201d are allowed.\n\nPersonhood USA seems outraged by the change. In a press release on Tuesday, the group said, \u201cSadly, Buzzfeed capitulated to the pro-choice lobby by shutting down the free press and censoring speech that would dare expose the abortion industry\u2019s horrifying misconduct.\u201d\n\nBut it seems that the new guidelines will actually go both ways. BuzzFeed also pulled a listicle titled \u201c5 Reasons Ken Cuccinelli Is Lying About Restricting Birth Control,\u201d by the pro-choice group NARAL Pro-Choice America, after ThinkProgress reached out to ask whether it violated the company\u2019s newly-instated policies.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "BuzzFeed has decided to update its guidelines for community contributor posts after facing controversy last month over running a piece by the anti-abortion group Personhood USA.
