Joseph Gordon-Levitt‘s lovelorn Tom Hansen may not have gotten the Hollywood ending of his dreams in “(500) Days of Summer,” but it sounds like the actor did in real life a couple of weeks ago. In a story initially reported by People, the “Don Jon” star married his girlfriend, Tasha McCauley, on December 20 in a private ceremony at the couple’s home.

Gordon-Levitt, who first rose to stardom as “teenager” Tommy Solomon (technically his character was the eldest of the visiting aliens) on the NBC sitcom “Third Rock From the Sun,” has for the most part kept his private life under wraps despite his successful film career. “I have a girlfriend but I tend not to really like to talk about it in public,” he told Howard Stern in 2013. “She is not in show business.”

The girlfriend in question, now Gordon-Levitt’s new wife, is in fact – according to McCauley’s Twitter profile – the co-founder and CEO of Fellow Robots, a robotics company based at NASA Research Park in Mountain View, California.

Gordon-Levitt’s representative confirmed the news of the nuptials.
