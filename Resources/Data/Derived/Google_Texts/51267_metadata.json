He recently committed to play for the Roadrunners.\n\n\"I thought about it because it is far,\" Maddred said of Bakersfield. \"But it's a great opportunity. It's always been a dream of mine to play Division I.\"\n\nCal State-Bakersfield competes in the Western Athletic Conference with programs such as New Mexico State, Idaho and Seattle.\n\nMaddred said he regards the scholarship offer as a \"second-chance\" as he needed to improve his grades after his scholastic career at Camden .\n\n\"I have to take advantage of this chance,\" Maddred said. \"I've been to 'Cali' many times but never to Bakersfield. I'll probably make my official visit after our season is over in March.\n\n\"They play a good schedule, play USC and some other schools. I know the weather is going to be great. I don't even need to bring a coat, just a hoodie.\"\n\n-- Contact Phil Anastasia at panastasia@phillynews.com\n\n-- Follow @PhilAnastasia on Twitter\n\nPublished: The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Phil Anastasia", "contenttype": "Blog_Post", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "pubdate": 20160524, "title": "Basketball: Former Camden standout Maddred commits to Cal State-Bakersfield", "og": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/245985475.html", "type": "article", "image": "http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom-FB.jpg", "site_name": "Philly.com", "title": "Basketball: Former Camden standout Maddred commits to Cal State-Bakersfield"}, "contentid": 245985475, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/245985475.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/designimages/Philly_Twitter_Generic_880x440.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Basketball: Former Camden standout Maddred commits to Cal State-Bakersfield"}, "cg": "news", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-18T07:50:50-04:00", "editdate": "20140218T07:50:50", "searchdate": "2014-02-18", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "Phil Anastasia", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "livedate": "20140218T07:50:50", "sourcepublication": "Inquirer", "news_keywords": "Phil Anastasia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd766\"", "article_summary": "By Phil AnastasiaFormer Camden standout Amir Maddred has commited to attend Cal State-Bakersfield on a basketball scholarship.\nCal State-Bakersfield competes in the Western Athletic Conference with programs such as New Mexico State, Idaho and Seattle.\nMaddred said Tuesday that he was offered a scholarship by a Cal State-Bakersfield assistant coach during a national prep school tournament in Rhode Island in late January.\nMaddred said he regards the scholarship offer as a \"second-chance\" as he needed to improve his grades after his scholastic career at Camden .\nThe 6-foot-7 Maddred, who helped Camden win back-to-back South Jersey Group 3 titles in 2012 and 2013, is spending this school year at Coastal Academy, a post-graduate program based in Belmar, New Jersey."}
