Gen. Kamala Harris\u2019s No. 1 and, so far, only opponent, Calbuzz spent some time the other day chatting with him about actual, you know, issues. Our motto: We do this so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nTurns out that while Chavez, 63, is at odds with the mainstream of California political sentiment on some key issues \u2013 abortion rights, health care, minimum wage, offshore oil drilling, for example \u2014 he is more thoughtful and not nearly as rabid nor strident as your hardcore, right-wing, Tea Party type Republicans. Talking issues with Rocky Balboa, you have to admire his openness and easy candor.\n\nPro-Cuomo on Abortion: Take abortion rights, for example, a position overwhelmingly favored by California voters. As a practicing Catholic, Chavez is pro-life. Importantly, however, he says he would not support an attempt to overturn Roe v Wade\u2019s protection of a woman\u2019s right to choose because \u201cthat\u2019s been settled in the courts.\u201d Nor, he said, would he vote for measures to further restrict abortion rights, like requiring parental consent for minors.\n\nAnd it infuriates him when people from the anti-abortion right wing accuse him of being a \u201cweak Catholic.\u201d Basically, his position is similar to the one laid out at Notre Dame in September 1984 by former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.\n\nHere\u2019s what the late great Cuomo said, in part:\n\nThe Catholic who holds political office in a pluralistic democracy \u2014 who is elected to serve Jews and Muslims, atheists and Protestants, as well as Catholics \u2014 bears special responsibility. He or she undertakes to help create conditions under which all can live with a maximum of dignity and with a reasonable degree of freedom; where everyone who chooses may hold beliefs different from specifically Catholic ones \u2014 sometimes contradictory to them; where the laws protect people\u2019s right to divorce, to use birth control and even to choose abortion.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the position Gov. Jerry Brown also holds on the issue. So Rocky\u2019s in good company.\n\nFor the record, he believes the big choice vs. life issue in California is not abortion, but assisted suicide and he\u2019s absolutely opposed to allowing it. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for anything that doesn\u2019t see the sanctity of life,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a personal issue for him. His 37-year-old son was diagnosed and hospitalized with schizophrenia years ago and at a point of unbearable misery wanted his father to help him end his life \u2013 a plea Chavez said he refused. He son is doing well today, he added.\n\nWould Allow Obamacare to Crash While the Field Poll says California voters favor the Affordable Health Care Act by a margin of 56-35%, Chavez says he would \u201cvote to change Obamacare because it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d (This is not what you might call an actual fact, but it is his belief.)\n\nWe\u2019re spending a lot of money processing insurance, he argues. \u201cIt would have been cheaper to buy everybody a Blue Cross policy.\u201d\n\nGiven the chance, he\u2019d vote in the Senate to eliminate the individual mandate that requires people to have health insurance. He acknowledged that if the individual mandate is eliminated, the health care system as now constructed in California would collapse, but is willing for that to happen to eliminate what he believes is a terrible public policy.\n\nMinimum Wage Chavez told us he\u2019s opposed to increasing the minimum wage \u2013 another position that many California voters may not like much. His reason: he believes it freezes many teenagers out of the employment market. \u201cI don\u2019t think the issue is minimum wage\u2026I think it prevents kids from having a job,\u201d he said, recalling his own first jobs \u201cclean(ing) toilets and bus(ing) tables.\u201d\n\nOffshore Oil. He said he would vote for renewed offshore oil drilling in federal waters \u201cif it meets all the requirements for science and safety of the Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources.\u201d\n\nFighting ISIS. As for fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), he\u2019d vote to give President Obama whatever powers he needs. He said he believes Obama\u2019s foreign policy is \u201ca total disaster in the Middle East.\u201d But would not have signed the letter that 47 Republican senators recently sent to Iran seeking to undermine Obama\u2019s negotiations to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\u201cPartisanship ends at our borders,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is the Commander in Chief,\u201d he added, sounding very much like the retired Marine colonel that he is.\n\nPathway to Something. On immigration, Chavez offers a position much closer to the California mainstream than most Republican politicians \u2013 a pathway to legal residency. It\u2019s not a pathway to citizenship, but a compromise position, that might not be as expansive as most Latino voters would prefer, but a lot less off-putting than the round-\u2018em-up-and-send-\u2018em-home stand so popular within the GOP.\n\nChavez says he approaches the issue using three principles:\n\n1) Family \u2013 \u201cThe Republican Party has always valued marriage and children,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re sending mothers and fathers away from their kids. That\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\n2) Security \u2013 He wants better security at the border, but that shouldn\u2019t be the first thing out of a Republican candidate\u2019s mouth, he said. That just causes Latino voters to shut down. \u201cThey say, \u2018Why would I vote for you if I felt you\u2019d never want me over for dinner?\u2019\u201d\n\n3) Citizenship: No \u2013 We have laws governing how people become citizens (which he\u2019s still researching, he said) but he favors \u201cwhat I call residency,\u201d with which immigrants could register, get a driver\u2019s license, pay taxes and follow procedures to obtain their citizenship over time.\n\nUnlike a lot of politicians, Chavez \u2014 Chico State and USMC \u2014 is refreshingly straight-forward. He\u2019s not the most articulate candidate we\u2019ve encountered, be he\u2019s a bright guy who\u2019s willing to risk a seat in the California Assembly to give Queen Kamala a challenge.\n\nIn his big underdog willingness to take on a candidate who\u2019s backed by California\u2019s powerful Democratic establishment and Washington\u2019s liberal elite, we\u2019re reminded of the words of another Rocky, namely the underdog boxer played by Sylvester Stallone in \u201cRocky.\u201d\n\nThe world ain\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows\u2026 You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain\u2019t how hard you hit; it\u2019s about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That\u2019s how winning is done.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California politics, news, analysis, commentary, opinion, California local and state politics, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento", "og": {"site_name": "Calbuzz", "description": "Now that Repub- lican Assemb- lyman Rocky (his actual name - we asked) Chavez of Oceanside has officially joined the race for U.S. Senate from California, becoming Democratic Atty.
