It\u2019s an invitation to teach the way he and many others have always wanted.\n\nAfter years of fatigue over educational requirements that often felt restrictive, \u201cThe standards finally seem to line up with why we all became educators, which is to support the students in developing their critical-thinking skills and finding the passion that will drive their learning beyond high school and throughout their lives,\u201d said Pronovost, the science, technology, engineering and math coordinator for the Ravenswood City School District.\n\nHis optimism is widely shared within the East Palo Alto district, which has a number of schools performing below state targets. Ana Maria Pulido, president of the school board, said the Common Core emphasizes depth of understanding over breadth, and moves away from a focus on repetition and memorization.\n\n\u201cIn the future, our students will be far less reliant upon their knowledge of a wide spectrum of topics \u2026 and more reliant upon their ability to think creatively, to problem solve and to adapt quickly to changes that are happening in our marketplace on an ongoing basis,\u201d she said.\n\nA group of educators brought together by the National Governors Association developed the Common Core in 2009. The initiative leaves curriculum planning to individual school districts, but provides a set of universal standards for each grade level.\n\nWhile 45 states have implemented those standards, support is not universal. Texas, Virginia, Alaska and Nebraska, for example, have not adopted either the language arts or mathematics standards.\n\nSome think tanks, ranging from the conservative Heritage Foundation to the more-liberal Brookings Institute, question whether the standards will be able to fix deeply ingrained problems such as parental involvement, school accountability and incentive structures within the education system.\n\nPilot testing in California is scheduled for this school year. To prepare, Ravenswood is holding many training sessions, and district educators have expressed eagerness to adapt their curriculum to the Common Core.\n\nAt an Oct. 17 school board meeting, principals from Ravenswood\u2019s seven elementary and middle schools spoke about their goals for the school year, all mentioning steps they\u2019re taking to transition to the new standards. Anika Guillaume, principal of Cesar Chavez & Green Oaks Academy, said her school has focused on peer coaching and mentoring; highly-qualified teachers will observe newer teachers, provide feedback and plan lessons with them.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing these coaching cycles so that we can really make sure that folks understand what does high-quality instruction look like for our kids, in light of Common Core,\u201d Guillaume said.\n\nPulido believes the new standards are a big improvement over No Child Left Behind, former President George W. Bush\u2019s signature education initiative. Critics of the law said it encouraged teachers to \u201cteach to the test\u201d and motivated states to lower their achievement goals.\n\nSupporters of No Child Left Behind, which enjoyed bipartisan support when Congress passed the law in 2002, said it increased accountability for schools and teachers, boosted test scores and improved upon local standards.\n\nFor his part, President Obama has encouraged adoption of the Common Core through his administration\u2019s Race to the Top initiative, the Department of Education\u2019s $4.35 billion contest to incentivize reform in K-12 education. Starting in 2010, states began adopting Common Core standards to make their Race to the Top funding applications more competitive.\n\n\u201cThe Common Core standards really were developed through a collaboration of teachers and educators across the country who had a long range view of education, as opposed to the model that has been there before,\u201d Pulido said.\n\nAn innovative part of the Common Core includes measurement of the cognitive demands of tasks according to a scale called Depth of Knowledge, or DOK. A DOK Level 1 means students can recall and reproduce what they\u2019ve learned, while a DOK Level 4 means they can synthesize, critique and connect. The Common Core suggests that instructional materials include a mix of DOK levels, progressing from basic recall to extended thinking.\n\nHaving looked at some sample questions from new Common Core assessments, Pulido believes these standardized tests will be a major upgrade. She said the new tests will be able to measure depth of knowledge by requiring students to show their work and explain their answers.\n\nHowever, the Ravenswood district faces special challenges in ensuring that students meet the new standards. Many Ravenswood students are from low-income families, with parents working multiple jobs, and therefore do not have the opportunity to attend preschool or get extensive preparation for school at home.\n\n\u201cI feel like our job as a board is to constantly evaluate how we can streamline services so we can squeeze the maximum value out of each dollar,\u201d Pulido said.\n\nBeing a district with so many students who speak English as a second language also poses challenges, Pronovost said, explaining that the district must \u201cbe more intentional about our instructional choices and about our teaching of academic language.\u201d To address this issue, Ravenswood is focusing on integrating specially designed academic instruction in English into the new curriculum, he said.\n\nPulido maintained that the biggest challenge of all, though, is the transition itself.\n\nTailoring learning towards standardized testing is the easy way out, she said. Developing deep understanding is more difficult for teachers and students alike.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is asking everyone to engage in a more intense way than they have before,\u201d Pronovost said, \u201cWe have teacher leaders coming in on their weekends to curriculum map, curriculum coordinators preparing professional development sessions differentiated by grade level and all teachers collaborating with their colleagues.\u201d\n\nBut, Pronovost emphasized, \u201cThe engagement is coupled with an excitement that has been missing for so long.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ana maria pulido,common core,common core state standards initiative,depth of knowledge,East Palo Alto,Education,education reform,Katie Brigham,no child left behind,race to the top,Ravenswood City School District,robert pronovost,standardized testing,Politics & Gov,Frontpage Featured", "description": "Teachers and administrators in East Palo Alto are preparing for a national initiative that leave curriculum planning to individual school districts, but\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd532\"", "article_summary": "Starting in 2010, states began adopting Common Core standards to make their Race to the Top funding applications more competitive.\nA group of educators brought together by the National Governors Association developed the Common Core in 2009.\nThe Common Core suggests that instructional materials include a mix of DOK levels, progressing from basic recall to extended thinking.\nHaving looked at some sample questions from new Common Core assessments, Pulido believes these standardized tests will be a major upgrade.\nFor Robert Pronovost, the Common Core State Standards Initiative is more than just another stab at education reform."}
