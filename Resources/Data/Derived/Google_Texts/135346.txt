Maureen Groppe

Maureen Groppe, The Indianapolis Star’s Washington bureau reporter, is a winner of the National Press Foundation’s Feddie Award.

The prize goes to reporters judged to have shown effectiveness in reporting the impact of federal rules and regulations outside the nation’s capital. Groppe reports on how Washington affairs affect Indiana. She works for Gannett, The Star’s parent company.

Her stories that were recognized by the National Press Foundation showed how school districts and small employers in Indiana were preparing for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act by reducing the hours of aides, bus drivers and others to avoid having to cover them, a foundation news release said.

Groppe was among 11 winners of the foundation’s annual awards. Winners will be formally recognized at a March 5 dinner in Washington, D.C.
