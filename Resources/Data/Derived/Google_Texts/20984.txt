Last Friday, Bill Maher was on his weekly show, "Real Time", when he openly criticized the notion that Muslims share the same values as other religions. Maher is known for his anti-religious rhetoric and receives backlash from groups that he criticizes. Usually Maher attacks conservative values, but from time to time, he attacks his own liberal base by challenging them to see religion in a different light.

“This idea that all religions share the same values is bull***t and we need to call it bull***t... if you are in this religion (Islam), you probably do have values that are at odds (with American values). This is what liberals don’t want to recognize,” Maher said.

Warning (Language):

Maher also points out an inconvenient truth that while most Muslim countries do not consist of terror groups, there are many within those countries who are sympathetic towards terror groups.

There is growing belief that the more accepting Americans are towards Islam, then more moderate countries like Indonesia will join in and help eradicate the more radical views of Islam. “What about Indonesia? The moderate country of Indonesia (where) only 18 percent believe in honor killings. Really? One out of five people in the country that you’re holding up as the moderate country believes if a woman is raped, we blame and kill her?” Maher said.

For as much as Bill Maher gets wrong, he is right on this issue. All religions are not the same.
