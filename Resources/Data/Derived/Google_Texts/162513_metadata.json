(AP Photo/Jeff Barnard, File)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) \u2014 Five years after the Affordable Care Act became law, healthcare advocates believe it\u2019s finally paying off.\n\nAcross Ohio, community health centers are seeing more patients coming with insurance. It is allowing them to expand their services and add additional locations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had our patient base go from about 50 percent uninsured we are seeing everyday and every month,\u201d said Dr. Dana Vallangeon, CEO of Lower Lights Christian Health Center.\n\nThe health center, located in the heart of Franklinton, opened its doors in 2002. Today, thanks to ACA and Ohio\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, they now have seven locations across central Ohio.\n\nDr. Vallangeon said their patient load has grown from over 6,000 to more than 11,000. They have the capacity for 15,000 patients.\n\nLast month, they opened their on-site pharmacy and have been gradually adding services since the passage of health care reform.\n\n\u201cSince 2010 and 2011, we\u2019ve been able to add psychiatry. We\u2019ve been able to add some collaborations with Maryhaven for substance abuse,\u201d said Dr. Vallangeon. \u201cBut we\u2019ve actually been able to directly add dental care and optometry services.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio Association of Community Health Centers reports that in 2002, Lower Lights was one of 23 centers and 110 sites in Ohio. In 2014, that number has grown to 45 federally qualified health centers with 244 sites.\n\nFederally qualified health centers offer comprehensive primary-care in under-served communities. In Ohio, these centers have obtained more almost $29 million dollars in federal grants this fiscal year.\n\nDr. Vallangeon doesn\u2019t see the money drying up. She said there is support from both political parties to keep community health centers growing.\n\n\u201cWe are just really scratching the surface of what the country needs from real reform and where people are accessing care,\u201d said Vallangeon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years after the Affordable Care Act became law, healthcare advocates believe it's finally paying off.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=380703612", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4i.com", "description": "Five years after the Affordable Care Act became law, healthcare advocates believe it\u2019s finally paying off.", "title": "Community health centers showing growth, ACA, Medicaid expansion helping", "url": "http://nbc4i.com/2015/10/12/community-health-centers-showing-growth-aca-medicaid-expansion-helping/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/contentid59beba5391048528810f6a7067001887fmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2015-09-09t134112mediaphotorecordid845d584904464ba0a9a7ed8cfd61de0ecloudfrontavailablefalseakamaiavailabletrueitemidd8.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Five years after the Affordable Care Act became law, healthcare advocates believe it\u2019s finally paying off.", "title": "Community health centers showing growth, ACA, Medicaid expansion helping", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/contentid59beba5391048528810f6a7067001887fmtjpgrolepreviewreldt2015-09-09t134112mediaphotorecordid845d584904464ba0a9a7ed8cfd61de0ecloudfrontavailablefalseakamaiavailabletrueitemidd8.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@nbc4i", "site": "nbc4i", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "affordable care act, community, dental, doctors, health care, health centers, lower lights, medicaid, medical, pharmacy, psychiatry, services Local, News", "msapplication-tooltip": "Columbus, Ohio News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_09ba3f0df1447f40e98674ba9d62c747", "fb": {"pages": 38342932750}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nbc4i.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6f1d97944cdcea2214c0f42e5738057f?s=16", "application-name": "NBC4i.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBC4Columbus", "published_time": "2015-10-13T02:31:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T03:44:47+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "Y7Un57nax7y1Nq_Ap5-4MFnKkuvSsOsEzQ67vpVKTFQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Across Ohio, community health centers are seeing more patients coming with insurance.\nShe said there is support from both political parties to keep community health centers growing.\nLast month, they opened their on-site pharmacy and have been gradually adding services since the passage of health care reform.\nIn 2014, that number has grown to 45 federally qualified health centers with 244 sites.\nFederally qualified health centers offer comprehensive primary-care in under-served communities."}
