He blogs at KeithHennessey.com.\n\nJared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Biden, is a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. He is a contributor to The New York Times Economix blog and is the host of \"On the Economy.\"\n\nWhen Visions of Government Differ The deal President Obama signed Wednesday night included a budget patch at current spending levels through mid-January and an increase in the debt ceiling through early February. That\u2019s right, we just went through all of that craziness \u2014 800,000 workers initially furloughed, the waste of $24 billion in output, the threat of default, the shutting down of the national parks, the damage to businesses and markets, the raw exposure of our political dysfunction to the world \u2014 to get a three-month patch that maintains the lousy status quo. So, here\u2019s my first point: regardless of where budget negotiators are in three months, we mustn\u2019t go through this again. The options here are not \u201cbudget deal\u201d or another shutdown. Both parties have now named negotiators to a budget conference, but even if these members make no progress on an actual budget agreement (versus another stopgap patch), the parties \u2014 and it\u2019s really the House Republicans \u2014 must be disciplined enough to keep shutdown or default far away from the table.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not a plea to Senator Ted Cruz or the House Tea Party caucus. I expect business as usual from them. It\u2019s a plea to more moderate voices to shut out such terribly destructive, uncompromising extremism, as they ultimately did earlier this week, though it took them far too long. Can they do better than another continuing resolution, as these temporary budget patches are called? Doubtful. Can they do better than another continuing resolution, as these temporary budget patches are called? Doubtful. The conference committee will be unable to reconcile the existing House and Senate budgets, as they represent totally different visions of government. The House budget provides trillions in tax cuts for the wealthy, makes similarly large cuts in safety net programs, repeals Obamacare (though it keeps its tax increases and Medicare cuts), and turns Medicare into a voucher program. The Senate budget replaces the sequester cuts ($1.2 trillion in indiscriminate budget cuts through 2021, split evenly between defense and non-defense) with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases on the wealthy. None of that will happen. If anything, they\u2019ll try to replace the 2014 sequestration cuts. That\u2019s a good idea as the cuts create a fiscal drag on the economy that\u2019s hurting growth and jobs, but the question is: Replace them with what, starting when? A balanced approach would involve tax increases and spending cuts that were timed to hit when the economy was stronger, but the Republicans have already stressed that they absolutely won\u2019t entertain the possibility of any new revenues. Indeed, they\u2019ve already countered with a peculiar offer to replace the 2014 defense cuts with entitlement cuts, a deal Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid immediately labeled \u201ca stupid trade.\u201d So, if tax revenues stay off the table, the only possible deal would involve replacing one set of cuts with another. Unless they\u2019re talking about back-loading the new cuts, that\u2019s bad economics \u2014 fiscal drag is fiscal drag. And we certainly don\u2019t need more cuts. Of the trillions in deficit reduction that have been completed over the last few years, 70 percent have thus far come from the spending side (79 percent if the sequester sticks).\n\n\n\nThe gridlock I\u2019ve just described has delivered dozens of these \u201ccontinuing resolutions\u201d (temporary budget patches) in recent years, but only one shutdown and near default. I\u2019m sorry to set sights so low, but the answer to \u201chow do we avoid another round of self-inflicting wounds?\u201d may well be to accept the fundamental incompatibility born not just of divided government but of sharply different visions of government\u2019s role. If that acceptance means we slog along with patches instead of traditional budget agreements, that\u2019s better than shutdown and default.\n\nA Budget Deal vs. a Debt Limit Scare Reaching a budget deal and avoiding another shutdown or debt limit scare next year are separate challenges. I advise Congressional Republicans to support, even embrace, full-year clean extensions of both the continuing resolution and debt limit before they expire. The recent \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d strategy was vaporware from the start. I agree with Jared that a short-term budget deal is unlikely because the House and Senate budgets reflect fundamentally different visions of government. The Senate budget proposes record-high government spending, taxes and debt, while the House budget would slow entitlement spending growth (although not enough), reduce government debt and facilitate tax reform to accelerate economic growth. If you believe that America\u2019s most pressing problems are outside of Washington and that the solution is even bigger government, then the Senate budget is the one for you. If you think America\u2019s biggest problems are caused by Washington and the top priorities should be a stronger private sector and borrowing less from future generations, then you should favor the House approach. Will you join me in proposing that Congress adjust the way inflation is measured? I also agree with Jared that replacing the sequester is unlikely. Washington is stuck with a fiscal Gordian knot. Democrats want to increase nondefense discretionary spending. Some Republicans want to increase defense spending, and most would agree to both spending increases as long as they are at least balanced by entitlement spending cuts (which should produce even greater long-term savings). But Democrats insist that any entitlement spending cuts be accompanied by tax increases, and Republicans won\u2019t agree to any more tax increases after the president successfully raised them last New Year\u2019s Day. The short-term sequester stalemate will therefore likely continue, and we\u2019ll see if President Obama again cries wolf about its effects. Note that the sequester no longer represents spending \u201ccuts,\u201d but a continuation of the spending levels under which the federal government has been operating since Jan. 1 (except during the ill-advised shutdown). Policymakers will be debating whether to increase government spending, not whether to cut it further. I\u2019ll try to start the bipartisan ball rolling with a proposal to Jared: Will you join me in proposing that Congress adjust the way inflation is measured, the so-called chained C.P.I. fix? I propose a standalone \u201cclean\u201d technical fix that would apply identically to all spending and taxes. This would result both in slower growth in Social Security and other benefit program payments, as well as higher income tax collections, as both would be measured using a more accurate, and lower, measure of inflation. I have been a long-time proponent of lower taxes and an opponent of tax increases, yet I am comfortable that such a technical correction should not be classified as either a \u201ctax increase\u201d or a \u201cbenefit cut.\u201d This technical correction would reduce federal deficits by $340 billion over the next decade. While I\u2019d prefer to dedicate the higher revenues that would result to pro-growth tax reform, I\u2019m guessing that would be a deal-breaker, so I instead propose using all $340 billion to pay down some of our $12 trillion debt.\n\nWe Need to Increase Revenues I\u2019m glad Keith agrees with my main point: avoiding the next shutdown-default threat is not contingent on a full-fledged budget agreement as opposed to another short-term patch. Beyond that, however, our disagreements look a lot like those we\u2019re already hearing out of the budget conferees. In our case, perhaps that\u2019s a good thing: if we can hammer out an agreement, maybe our Congressional counterparts can too. Our disagreement about the Senate and House budgets is an instructive place to start. I suspect we agree that they can\u2019t be reconciled because one (the Senate) achieves deficit savings by both raising taxes and cutting spending, whereas the House budget just cuts spending (it sharply cuts tax rates for the wealthy but purports to pay for them with the old magic asterisk of loopholes closures to be named later; Keith calls that \u201cfacilitating tax reform,\u201d I call it irresponsible budgeting). Can you come up with any other cuts or fees we could backload in later years to offset the cost of replacing these 2014 cuts? We also see the numbers quite differently. Keith claims that \u201cthe Senate budget proposes record-high government spending, taxes and debt.\u201d Yet spending in that budget averages 21.7 percent as a share of G.D.P. over the next decade, compared to a historical average since the late 1960s of 20.9 percent. Debt declines under the Senate budget, from 78.5 percent in 2014 of G.D.P. to 70.4 percent in 2023. It collects an average of 19.3 percent of G.D.P. in taxes over the next decade compared to the historical average of 18 percent. I find those numbers far less alarming than Keith\u2019s rhetoric suggests. Our demographic challenges alone might lead a responsible budgeteer to predict larger increases in outlays and receipts going forward. Yet, despite the fact the virtually every grand bargain-style budget deal by outside experts includes both spending cuts and revenue increases, the Republicans will not accept the latter, so there will be no such bargains. Which leads me to Keith\u2019s offer to join him in a deal to simply change the way we measure price growth (the chained C.P.I.) and call it a day. Actually, that\u2019s the stuff of grand bargains. In fact, President Obama makes that same offer in his budget, as part of a comprehensive plan that includes tax increases and entitlement cuts, the latter of which includes this \u201ctechnical\u201d inflation change \u2014 according to the Congressional Budget Office, it would cut Social Security benefits by $127 billion over 10 years. The only way Democrats would begin to go there would be in the context of a very big deal involving significant revenues. Like it or not, Keith, we have to think small. Probably the only chance of coming up with anything useful here is to at least partially replace this year\u2019s sequestration. Are you sure you can\u2019t find even $50 billion in revenues from closing loopholes (oil or gas subsidies, carried interest, tax avoidance on foreign earnings, a tiny tweak-up on the historically low capital gains rate \u2014 high-end asset holders are doing great these days!)? I suspect that\u2019s a \u201cno.\u201d Can you come up with any other cuts or fees we could backload in later years to offset the cost of replacing these 2014 cuts? Would you consider adding it to the deficit (it would add a measly 0.6 percent of G.D.P.)?\n\nSpending Must Be Brought Under Control Jared and I agree that neither the next debt limit increase nor the next continuing resolution should be contingent on a budget agreement. As a predictive matter I don\u2019t know what Congressional Republicans will do. The fiscal stalemate rests on two core conflicts: a disagreement about how much debt is acceptable and a core conflict about tax levels. Jared is correct that the Senate Democrats\u2019 budget would reduce debt to just above 70 percent of G.D.P. in 10 years. That\u2019s 15 percentage points higher than the House Republican budget, an enormous difference, and about 35 points higher than historic norms. In addition to passing a balanced budget, the House Republicans propose borrowing much less from future generations than do Senate Democrats. Just two years ago President Obama worked hard to match House Republicans on debt reduction. He has since abandoned that approach, leaving Erskine Bowles as the only prominent Democrat arguing for dramatic and rapid debt reduction. Are Congressional Republicans unreasonable for rejecting a 'balance of spending cuts and tax increases?' No, because that\u2019s the wrong metric. Three years ago the president and a Democratic Congress enacted a massive expansion in entitlement spending (Obamacare), financed in part by tax increases. Ten months ago President Obama won a Pyrrhic victory by signing into law another significant tax increase. The president and his party now demand that Republicans raise taxes to pay for short-term discretionary spending increases, that they raise taxes again to pay for a technical correction to the way inflation is measured, that they raise taxes again as the legislative price of even the most modest yet arithmetically unavoidable entitlement reforms. If Congressional Republicans were to agree to these demands, debt would still be twice as big a share of the economy as it was pre-crisis, and the even bigger longstanding entitlement spending problem would remain untouched. Guess what the price of even modest progress in solving those two problems would then be? That\u2019s right, more tax increases. Still we are told that Republicans are intransigent on substance, an argument bolstered by the disruptive style of some conservatives. You have to draw the line somewhere, and Congressional Republicans are right to insist, even demand, that spending be brought under control before any more taxes are raised. While their recent tactics were mistargeted and foolhardy, the conservatives\u2019 underlying fiscal principles are sound: the spending problem must be solved, debt must be reduced rapidly and raising taxes to finance bigger government only makes things worse. Will Congressional Republicans agree to raise current taxes or deficits (which are really just future taxes) by \u201ca measly 0.6 percent of G.D.P.\u201d ($100 billion per year) to pay for bigger government? I doubt it and I hope not. Are Congressional Republicans unreasonable for rejecting a \u201cbalance of spending cuts and tax increases?\u201d No, because that\u2019s the wrong metric. We should instead judge fiscal policy on the balance between privately controlled resources and government-controlled resources. We should judge fiscal policy on the balance of resources between this generation and future generations. We should judge fiscal policy on whether it contributes to an investment and productivity growth path that allows future living standards to double every generation as they did for our parents and grandparents. There used to be a significant block of moderate Democrats in Congress who favored slowing the growth of entitlement spending and who looked on tax increases as a necessary evil to pay for government services or to pay down debt. These moderate Democrats worked with Congressional Republicans and Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush to enact welfare reform and a balanced budget, NAFTA and tax relief in 1997 and 2001. These Democrats still exist outside of Washington, in Silicon Valley and New York and on Center Street in Little Rock. But thanks to President Obama\u2019s leadership, they have been replaced by an approach that makes tax increases, bigger government and greater redistribution the core goals of fiscal policy. The tactics and style of Tea Party Republicans contributed significantly to the recent conflict, but the substantive shift leftward among Congressional Democrats is even more important in the long run. In the short run a small block of Democrats could split off, abandon their immediate demand for additional tax increases, and support an entitlements-for-discretionary spending swap. But it\u2019s hard to find a fiscally moderate Democrat in Washington these days who won't insist on raising taxes. When you strip away all the shouting and name-calling, this substantive chasm between the parties is why the fiscal stalemate will most likely continue.\n\nIn Search of Some Common Ground I think Keith and I may have just rehearsed the debate that\u2019s about to take place. We clearly see the role and size of government very differently: Keith makes a much greater distinction than I do between private and public spending and investment. He wants a lot less spending. I think we\u2019re in the process of disinvesting in public goods and human capital in a way that hurts private productivity. To be sure, I\u2019d cut lots of waste (regressive tax expenditures!), but spend more on early education, infrastructure, work supports. And I\u2019d raise more revenue to do so. We\u2019re talking about Band-Aids at best. We\u2019re dealing neither with the real budget issues nor the economic growth issues. I\u2019d strengthen our social insurance programs; I\u2019d aggressively implement Obamacare (which needs implementation help, for sure). In fact, I\u2019m puzzled by Keith\u2019s attack on the program as a \u201cmassive expansion in entitlement spending\u201d when it\u2019s partially paid for by significant Medicare cuts and significantly reduces future budget deficits, according to Congressional Budget Office. Remember, our future budget pressures come not from all this discretionary spending we\u2019re squabbling about. They come from health care. It doesn\u2019t help to just say we\u2019re spending too much and hack away with sequesters and lower caps on the agency budgets. You\u2019ve got to offer a different plan to reduce the growth rate of health costs. So where does that leave us? Keith has joined me in \u201csmall ball\u201d and suggests entitlement cuts as a replacement for part of the sequester\u2019s cuts. If you broaden that to all mandatory spending, including, say, farm supports, we might be able to get somewhere. But both of us know we\u2019re talking about Band-Aids at best. We\u2019re dealing neither with the real budget issues nor the economic growth issues. We should, in some forum, keep talking about those main events, not these dysfunctional side shows. I have a lot of respect for your knowledge and experience and wonder if we might yet be able to find some common ground.", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/10/18/opinion/CapitolDomeRFD/CapitolDomeRFD-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/10/18/opinion/CapitolDomeRFD/CapitolDomeRFD-thumbWide.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/a-federal-budget-to-prevent-another-government-shutdown", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/10/18/opinion/CapitolDomeRFD/CapitolDomeRFD-thumbWide.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/10/18/opinion/CapitolDomeRFD/CapitolDomeRFD-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The G.O.P. ended its standoff last week, but the deals were temporary.
