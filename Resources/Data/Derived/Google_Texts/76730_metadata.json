But the nominee is likely to move slowly, if at all, through the Senate Banking Committee, which hinders the controversial agency\u2019s ability to extend financing to some of its largest beneficiaries.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, the White House said Obama intends to nominate Republican J. Mark McWatters to the Export-Import Bank\u2019s Board of Directors for a four-year term. The nomination will head to the Senate Banking Committee, which is unlikely to move McWatters\u2019 nomination quickly.\n\nMcWatters served as a former aide to House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who is one of Ex-Im\u2019s most vocal opponents. Hensarling led the charge against reauthorizing the bank, which provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s charter expired June 30, 2015, for the first time in its 81-year history. Congress reauthorized the bank through 2019 in December, but the agency is crippled in its ability to approve financing for some of its biggest beneficiaries, such as Boeing, Caterpillar, and General Electric, which primarily receive financing for transactions of more than $10 million.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Board of Directors must approve all financing that exceeds $10 million and needs a quorum\u2014three active members\u2014to do so. Currently, only two of the seats on the five-member panel are filled, and the Senate Banking Committee had been sitting on Obama\u2019s nomination of Democrat Patricia Loui-Schmicker to a second term on the board since March.\n\nThe president withdrew her nomination Monday.\n\nAccording to The Mercatus Center\u2019s Veronique de Rugy, the majority of transactions Ex-Im approved over the last eight years are for less than $10 million. However, they represent just 16 percent of the total dollar amount the bank approved.\n\nSenate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has said in the past he\u2019s \u201cin no hurry\u201d to hold a vote on nominations to the bank\u2019s board.\n\nThe Alabama Republican has said he\u2019s waiting for the White House to send a nominee for vice chair for supervision of the Federal Reserve before moving on more than a dozen nominees, including Loui-Schmicker.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Banking Committee told The Daily Signal the \u201ccommittee will consider [McWatters] at an appropriate time.\u201d\n\nShelby told Politico Monday he was in no rush to move on McWatters\u2019 nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a primary right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in no hurry to hold hearings.\u201d\n\nConservatives have cheered the Senate\u2019s inaction on nominations to the board, as they view it as a way to stymie not only Ex-Im\u2019s financing to large corporations, but also the president.\n\n\u201cGiven the president\u2019s complete and utter disregard for the Senate\u2019s constitutional prerogatives, there is no reason for senators to confirm this nominee or any other non-security nominees,\u201d Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action for America, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cAlthough the bank was reauthorized, Republicans should not give in to Obama\u2019s desire to see the bank giving away hundreds of millions to massive international corporations,\u201d he continued.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nomination is unlikely to go anywhere", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The nomination is unlikely to go anywhere", "title": "White House to Send Nominee to Export-Import Bank Board", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160112_ExImNom_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-12T16:29:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Q2Wn7R"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The nomination is unlikely to go anywhere", "title": "White House to Send Nominee to Export-Import Bank Board", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160112_ExImNom_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2016-01-12T13:51:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T16:29:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, J.
