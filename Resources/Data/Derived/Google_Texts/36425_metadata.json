There were endless hoops we had to jump through to try to get to the bottom of her issues over the many YEARS of various problems.\u201d\n\nAfter years of this, David and Barbara started to lose hope. But they caught a glimmer when they began researching places outside of the U.S.\n\nThey needed a place they could retire comfortably that also offered affordable and good healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe country is full of beautiful locations\u2026 and we\u2019re getting healthier and cured from all that ailed us in the States.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of us wanted to move up the schedule in doing the things we\u2019ve always talked about doing,\u201d says David. \u201cWe were worried dialysis might kick in before we could get to the retirement place in our life we spent so much time talking about.\n\n\u201cSo we changed from a 65-year-old retirement time frame to around 55. We had to recognize and accept that our nest egg might not be as big, but what good is a larger nest egg if you don\u2019t live long enough to use it?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when they decided to move to Ecuador: \u201cMany places would have met our needs, but after visiting Ecuador, we found the locals to be very friendly and forgiving to non-Spanish-speaking expats (we\u2019re learning).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country is full of beautiful locations\u2026 our cost of living is ridiculously low (we rent a large penthouse apartment for the cost of a regular apartment in a low-cost area in the States)\u2026 we are much safer than in a big city in the U.S.\u2026 and we\u2019re getting healthier and cured from all that ailed us in the States.\n\n\u201cThe food in Ecuador is fresher and does not have all the dangerous chemical additives found in the foods in the States, so I\u2019ve got to believe that has also contributed to the fantastic turn around my wife has made in her health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also more active and walk most everywhere we go, so we are both healthier and in better shape.\u201d\n\nTo boot, he says, \u201cIn only a little over a year, my wife has had one surgery related to her kidney\u2019s at about 1/10th the cost of the same surgery in the U.S.\u201d\n\nWhat happened next is nothing short of incredible.\n\nAfter moving to Ecuador and living a healthier, cheaper and less stressful lifestyle, Barbara regressed to Stage 1 kidney failure. Something the doctors in the U.S. said would never happen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent years believing that her time was short and we had to speed up doing the things we\u2019ve talked about before it was too late. Now we have every expectation for a long and normal life for her.\u201d\n\nIt gets better: David also had a life-changing experience (albeit, not as dramatic) with regard to Ecuadorian healthcare\u2026\n\n\u201cIn the U.S.,\u201d he said, \u201cI had a problem every year with sinus infections that required decongestants to clear up. This was a problem that I thought I had to live with.\u201d\n\nHe suffered with it for over 30 years. And no doctor offered to help fix it\u2026 save for his doctor in Ecuador.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget how I felt when the doctor said that I needed to have sinus surgery to remove the tumors/polyps from my nasal cavities. All those years, I had thought I just had to suffer with this problem, and this Ecuadorian doctor had a way of curing it after a couple short hours of evaluation.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d David goes on, \u201cthe U.S. doctors all probably knew what would fix this problem (the Ecuadorian doctors go to the same medical schools as the U.S. doctors do), but they just didn\u2019t tell me because of the costs or some insurance complication.\n\n\u201cAt any rate, the surgery was performed, and I haven\u2019t had a problem in over a year now. In fact, I also had sleep apnea that has also gone away as a result of the same surgery.\n\n\u201cI have to admit I\u2019m furious that this simple solution was never offered over the many years I had the problem in the U.S., but I\u2019m grateful I\u2019m living somewhere where the doctors are allowed to practice medicine and cure their patients.\n\n\u201cMy wife,\u201d David writes, \u201cis one perfect example of why we should not assume that our health care issues are set in stone once a few US doctors tell you that you are doomed.\n\n\u201cTo get there, we had to change one of our life-long paradigms about the health care system being the best in the U.S\u2026.\n\n\u201cWhich is probably still true if you have very large sums of money or if you know the correct code word needed to get past the insurance company controls and have the patience to keep fighting with them, etc. (thank god we\u2019re done with that).\n\n\u201cBut as is the case with health care, there are many life-changing paradigms you can pursue if you\u2019re just open to the possibility. And if you\u2019ll just consider them and take that steps to implement them.\n\n\u201cSo my advice to anyone who may be fearful of taking that \u2018first or next risky step\u2019: Consider how life changing that step might be.\n\n\u201cI admit, in most cases, a move overseas may not be the radical solution you are looking for. But whatever it is that ails you, take that little step, that large step, that next step, or that giant leap if you want to change your current world.\n\n\u201cThe results may be better than you even imagined. It was for us.\u201d\n\nThanks for writing in, David. Amazing story.\n\nCoincidentally, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of personal research lately on medical tourism.\n\nMany international hospital staff and doctors are educated and board certified in the U.S.\n\nIn fact, Laissez Faire\u2019s in-house \u201cmedical tourism\u201d expert, Jud Anglin, is helping me plan a trip to have some dental work done in Thailand.\n\nJud is the founder of MedRetreat. They arrange high-quality, low-cost surgery and procedures all around the world.\n\n\u201cMedical tourism is not a new phenomenon,\u201d Jud told me. \u201cCanadian and British patients have been traveling for decades in order to escape their universal health care systems, in which extensive surgical wait times are the norm.\u201d\n\nSensing some jitters about the whole thing, Jud reassured me with a couple little-known facts\u2026\n\nMany international hospital staff and doctors are educated and board certified in the U.S.\n\nMedRetreat uses only hospitals accredited by the same organization that accredits top U.S. hospitals \u2014 the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (formerly JCAHO).\n\n\u201cA JCAHO hospital,\u201d says Jud, \u201cis required to follow the same standards, procedures, and protocols as U.S. hospitals.\n\n\u201cSo if your insurance deductible is too high or you are denied access to the surgical procedure that you need, it may be time to consider packing your bags and heading off to a foreign hospital.\u201d\n\nThrough MedRetreat, Jud will hook me up with a dentist he\u2019s met personally. He\u2019ll also help me set up tours through some of the most cutting-edge hospitals in the world. Yes, in Thailand.\n\nI\u2019ll be flying out in January. And, of course, I\u2019ll be writing all about it while I\u2019m there.\n\nMore on that \u2014 and lots more on medical tourism \u2014 to come.\n\nRegards,\n\nChris Campbell\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nEd.
