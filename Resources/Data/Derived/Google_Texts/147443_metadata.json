He\u2019s got stacks of science books on his desk to help him prepare, and a rainbow of biochemistry charts pasted to the walls: glycolysis, citric acid cycle, electron transport chain; mitosis, meiosis; DNA replication.\n\nHe also has a thick prep book on psychology and sociology -\u2013 a complete novelty for this year\u2019s MCAT takers.\n\nThe Medical College Admission Test has been thoroughly revamped and is now three hours longer \u2014 it takes 7.5 hours to complete, including breaks \u2014 and covers four new subjects, including a combined section on psychology and sociology that accounts for a quarter of the overall score.\n\nTest takers will now have to define terms like \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d and \u201csocial constructionism,\u201d and answer applied questions about how race and class affect health.\n\nDriscoll focused on biomedical engineering in college. So for him, the new psychology/sociology section is the one he\u2019s most nervous about.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the end of the test, which makes it more difficult because you\u2019re pretty tired by then,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the thing I had the least experience with.\u201d\n\nBringing Test Up to Date\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges, which administers the MCAT, wants to make sure the doctors of tomorrow are better prepared to care for an increasingly diverse patient population in a rapidly changing health care system. Administrators say the exam changes are necessary to bring it up to date with how medicine is practiced, and with all the scientific discoveries that have been made since the test was last revised, more than 20 years ago.\n\nResearch on genetics, and the \u201csocial determinants of health,\u201d in particular, have advanced significantly.\n\n\u201cWhether or not someone becomes ill has a lot to do with the society in which they live,\u201d says Catherine Lucey, vice dean of education at UC San Francisco School of Medicine and a member of the committee that will assess the new MCAT.\n\nFor example, she says, we now know a lot more about what happens to children who are exposed to violence before they turn five.\n\n\u201cIf they live in a violent neighborhood, if they hear gunshots all the time, if they themselves are the victims of interpersonal violence or child abuse,\u201d Lucey says, \u201cthey are much more likely to develop diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and many other chronic conditions, because of their social environment.\u201d\n\nHow those conditions are treated has also evolved. Doctors know how to treat acute infection now. But managing chronic disease has become a much bigger part of medical care, and doctors need to develop different skills and a different kind of relationship with the patient. Doctors need to build trust, Lucey says, to understand how patients think and make decisions, in order to convince them to exercise more and change their diet.\n\n\u201cMy ability as a physician to affect that patient\u2019s health is not only dependent on medical knowledge, in terms of what drug should I give this individual, but on my ability to support this patient in the decisions they\u2019re making on a daily basis,\u201d she says.\n\nAttracting New Type of Student\n\nWhile the test prep industry adapted quickly to the new MCAT, actual enrollment in prep courses at the Princeton Review and Kaplan is only starting to pick up.\n\nThe real rush was last fall, when students flocked to take the old test, says Krissi Taylor Leslie, tutoring director at the Princeton Review in Northern California.\n\nThere was a recognition among students \u201cthat was my chance at the \u2018easier\u2019 test and now I\u2019m up against this beast,\u201d Leslie says.\n\nShe says the new social sciences section is already attracting a different kind of student to consider med school.\n\n\u201cIt entices certain students to come in and consider this test when they might not have otherwise,\u201d she says. \u201cFor instance, an increase in the number of English majors, of psychology majors.\u201d\n\nAnd philosophy majors, like Ari Fischer. He started thinking about a career in medicine the summer after his junior year, when his grandfather was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I was first shown, hands on, what physicians do every day,\u201d he says.\n\nHe started taking medical ethics classes -\u2013 one was called \u201cLife and Death\u201d -\u2013 where he read works about immortality, the meaning of death, and the meaning of life in the face of death.\n\nFischer says he can imagine drawing on this knowledge one day if he has a patient facing tough end-of-life decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a scientific view, then there\u2019s the theological views, or philosophical views. Knowing what other disciplines believe is going on at the same time, I think that could really help me in a daily practice of medicine,\u201d Fischer says. \u201cWhat a cool way to take my degree in philosophy and turn it into a helpful, practical skill.\u201d\n\nFischer took the MCAT on the first testing date for the new exam in April, and just got his full score back on Tuesday. He did best on the social sciences section and the verbal, analytic reasoning -\u2013 and landed in the 87th percentile overall.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Harvard will think I\u2019m lacking in my MCAT score,\u201d he says. \u201cFor myself, I did well enough.\u201d\n\nAltogether, he\u2019s applying to 38 schools. He says he\u2019s willing to go anywhere that will take a humanities major like him.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019ve ever wanted out of the MCAT really is a score that\u2019s good enough to not get me kicked out of the pile when it comes to admissions decisions,\u201d he says. \u201cAny school that that gives me a shot, I\u2019m going to be thrilled.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new test is longer and includes an emphasis on social sciences --- psychology and sociology.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Medical School Hopefuls Grapple with Overhauled Entrance Exam\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/06\\/18\\/medical-school-hopefuls-grapple-with-overhauled-entrance-exam-mcat\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-18 09:08:38\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-18 12:54:21\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":37385,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Physician Workforce\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/06\\/IMG_1002-e1434495183650.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The new test is longer and includes an emphasis on social sciences --- psychology and sociology.", "title": "Medical School Hopefuls Grapple with Overhauled Entrance Exam", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/06/18/medical-school-hopefuls-grapple-with-overhauled-entrance-exam-mcat/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/06/IMG_1002-1440x1080.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "physician workforce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEach day, I\u2019m easily here for five hours,\u201d he says.\nShe says the new social sciences section is already attracting a different kind of student to consider med school.\nIt\u2019s T-minus four days until exam day, and Travis Driscoll is practically living at his desk.\nHe also has a thick prep book on psychology and sociology -\u2013 a complete novelty for this year\u2019s MCAT takers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the end of the test, which makes it more difficult because you\u2019re pretty tired by then,\u201d he says."}
