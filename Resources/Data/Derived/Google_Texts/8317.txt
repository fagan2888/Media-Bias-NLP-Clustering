An old grain elevator in Cowley County was destroyed in a fire Saturday night.

Several crews were called around 7:30 p.m. to the fire in Cambridge, a small town in Cowley County. Saundra Williams with the local fire department said the fire started in an area that had been used as a blacksmith shop.

The wooden grain elevator partially collapsed, Williams said. No injuries were reported, but the structure is likely a total loss.

Fire crews remained on scene late Saturday night. A cause of the fire has yet to be determined.
