KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) â€” Britain's Prince Harry has begun a five-day official trip to Nepal, meeting with the prime minister and attending a ceremony to mark 200 years of relations between the two nations.

Hundreds of people cheered as the 31-year-old prince came out of Kathmandu's airport Saturday.

He later met Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli at his official residence and attended a ceremony hosted by Nepal's government.

During his trip, Harry will tour areas hit by last year's devastating earthquake and visit a camp for displaced quake survivors. People are hoping his visit will draw attention to Nepal's struggle to recover from the disaster.

The prince will also stay with a family that includes men who served in the British army's famed Gurkha regiments, the unit that Harry served with in Afghanistan.
