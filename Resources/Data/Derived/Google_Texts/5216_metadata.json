Dannel P. Malloy will be seated in a place of honor in First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s box at the Capitol.\n\nMalloy is attending at the invitation of President Barack Obama, who is delivering the final State of the Union speech of his two-term presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly an honor. I want to thank the president and the first lady for this once-in-a-lifetime invitation,\u201d Malloy said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re doing big things in Connecticut.\n\n\"We\u2019ve passed the smartest gun law in the nation, and we\u2019ve helped drive a national conversation to help prevent gun violence. The president is taking action on this important issue just as we have in Connecticut \u2013 it is commonsense to keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn\u2019t have them.\"\n\nIn a statement, the White House said the invited guests \u201cpersonify President Obama's time in office and most importantly, they represent who we are as Americans: inclusive and compassionate, innovative and courageous.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Malloy was chosen because he \u201chas pursued many of the progressive priorities that the president laid out to make America stronger.\u201d\n\nThe governor was at the White House last week as Obama announced new executive orders aimed at curbing gun violence, which Malloy called \u201ca moving experience.\u201d\n\nObama was brought to tears during his speech as he recalled the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in 2012.\n\n\u201cTo see how moved the president is still from the Sandy Hook experience ... the strength that he has, the willingness to go after this issue, to move the ball forward time and time again is tremendous,\u201d Malloy said after the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nDuring his speech last Tuesday, Obama specifically mentioned efforts that Connecticut has made to increase background checks and gun safety courses, saying it has reduced gun deaths by 40 percent in the state. He also voiced support for a plan proposed by Malloy that would prevent gun from being sold to people on federal terror watchlists.\n\n\"We\u2019re proud of that record, just as we are proud of the myriad other initiatives Connecticut has led on, from Second Chance, to being the first state in the nation to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, to the first state to pass paid sick days, to launching a first-in-the-nation green bank to tackle global warming, to the best implementation of the Affordable Care Act in America,\" Malloy said. \"Connecticut has an amazing story to tell over the past few years \u2013 and we\u2019re proud to tell it.\u201d\n\nMark Barden, father of slain Sandy Hook first-grader Daniel Barden, will also attend the address \u2014 as the guest of U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). Barden last week introduced Obama at the gun control announcement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Bridgeport Daily Voice", "description": "FAIRFIELD COUNTY, Conn. \u2013 When citizens tune in to watch the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Connecticut Gov.
