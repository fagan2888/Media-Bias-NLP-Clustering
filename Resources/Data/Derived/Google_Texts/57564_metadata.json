Likely not. Even if they\u2019d been 8-0, Tortorella\u2019s point would stand.\n\nShootouts are fun to watch. They can be exciting, they can be tense.\n\nThey\u2019re also a gimmick and they have no place in deciding the actual outcome of a game.\n\nImagine if the NBA or college basketball decided one overtime was enough. Let\u2019s just go to a free-throw shooting contest.\n\nOr if baseball said hey, after two extra innings we\u2019re going to turn this into Home Run Derby!\n\nBogus. Gimmick. Any other synonym that comes to mind.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched much of the Caps lately, you can\u2019t help but think about shootouts since it seems like they\u2019re in one every game. Their 14 shootouts thus far lead the league, and they\u2019re 8-6 in them.\n\nIn the two previous games before Wednesday\u2019s matchup at Pittsburgh, the Caps went to shootouts against Buffalo and then San Jose. Caps coach Adam Oates sent Eric Fehr, Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom out in that order in each game. None scored. None really came close. Six cows on skates, maybe even blindfolded cows, might have come closer to scoring, actually. Poor Philipp Grubauer gets beat once and the Caps earn only one standings point while the other team gets two.\n\nBut the opinion wouldn\u2019t change even if the Caps were perfect in shootouts, even if the great Ovechkin could actually manage to score in one of them (he has at some point, though it hasn\u2019t happened very often lately).\n\nThey\u2019re a gimmick. They should be out of the league.\n\nShootouts are relatively new. The league adopted them for the 2005-06 season, part of a way to ignite some interest in the league following a season lost to lockout. Ties used to be a part of regular-season hockey. But who wants to see a tie? Let\u2019s figure out a way to have an actual winner, even if we have to cheapen the game!\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with a tie? It was a perfectly acceptable result for a lot of years, as much a part of hockey as faceoffs and fisticuffs. And it isn\u2019t like they were happening all that much.\n\nPer the NHL release announcing the shootout, 14 percent of the NHL games in the 2003-04 season ended in ties. Is that so bad?\n\nGoing into Wednesday, the Caps had been involved in 89 shootouts since the rule was changed (it only seems like all of them have been this year). They\u2019d won in 41 of them, good for 20th among all NHL teams. Pittsburgh, perhaps not surprisingly, is tops with 58 shootout victories in 88 tries.\n\nAs for the Caps players, they\u2019re a mixed bag. The choices Oates made in recent games are probably his best options to start the shootout, recent results notwithstanding.\n\nBackstrom is 6 of 12, Fehr 5 of 8. Ovechkin is the real head scratcher. He\u2019s the reigning MVP and leads the league in goals and he\u2019s 2 of 13 in shootouts this season (25 of 81 for his career). Mikhail Grabovski is 5 of 10 this season. Maybe Oates was saving him to be one of the extra shooters if it extended beyond the normal three shots. Brooks Laich is 2 of 2, Troy Brouwer 2 of 5, Martin Erat 1 of 2. No other Cap has a shootout goal this season.\n\nErat is at 32.7 percent for his career (16 of 49) with 12 game-deciding goals but he\u2019s not much of an option since he spends most of his time as a healthy scratch in the press box, waiting to be traded (along with one of the three goalies perhaps?). Maybe the Caps should have re-signed Matt Hendricks after all. Now an Edmonton Oiler, Hendricks is 9 of 17 for his career in shootouts.\n\nThe current career leader in shootout goals, just for the trivial heck of it, is Brad Bowes of Florida with 37 (in 79 tries).\n\nWhatever.\n\nThese aren\u2019t decisions Oates, Tortorella or any NHL coach should have to worry about in the regular season.
