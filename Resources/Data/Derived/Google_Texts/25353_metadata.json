Kronos Incorporated today announced that its workforce management solutions and services can help long-term care organizations comply with this new requirement.\n\nNews Facts\n\nSection 6106 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires long-term care facilities to electronically submit direct care staffing information, including agency and contract staff, based on payroll and other auditable data. The data, when combined with resident census information, provides visibility to the level of care that can be expected.\n\nBased on this requirement, the CMS set forth the \u201cPayroll Data Submission \u2013 Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) Reporting\u201d, a system that allows staffing and census information to be collected on a regular and more frequent basis than before and eliminates self-reporting by ensuring that the data is auditable for accuracy. This reporting requirement becomes mandatory beginning on July 1, 2016.\n\nLong-term care facilities can more effectively meet PBJ electronic staffing data reporting requirements by uploading PBJ data produced by the Kronos time and attendance solution. The Kronos solution also offers a complete, automated source of work hour and work type, inclusive of audit trails.\n\nKronos also offers a robust data configuration and conversion tool, allowing workforce management data to be converted to the appropriate format, quickly and reliably, transferring data fields such as employee ID, total hours worked, and more, from Kronos to a destination system. The Kronos solution also accommodates inclusion of resident census data, which the PBJ reporting system requires.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\nCarol D.
