P.A.s generally make about half a physician\u2019s salary or less, depending on specialty (an E.R. doctor makes on average $270,000, an emergency-room P.A. $112,000). But when a P.A. performs a procedure, insurance companies reimburse the clinic for about 85 percent of the charge, opposed to 100 percent for an M.D. Ms. Pagel said these numbers are similar nationwide. The difference is made up with higher patient volume. \u201cWhen a P.A. comes into a practice,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re able to see many more patients.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the Cleveland Clinic, P.A.s assist in all disciplines of medicine and surgery, and have been heavily integrated into the emergency department to improve patient flow. Incoming patients are evaluated by P.A.s, who funnel urgent cases (strokes, heart attacks) to an M.D. and manage non-urgent cases (ear infections, sprained ankles) themselves.\n\nLynn Pagliaccio, the clinic\u2019s P.A. manager for emergency services, described her work with physicians as \u201cvery collaborative.\u201d \u201cIf somebody comes in with a simple toothache, we can manage that on our own,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if they have a toothache and a high fever and their whole face is swollen, we have the doc come over and take a peek.\u201d\n\nSince instituting the fast-track system, wait time has decreased by two hours on average. Surveys show that patient satisfaction has increased, and reviews indicate no rise in misdiagnoses or malpractice suits, according to Dr. Stephen Meldon, emergency department director at the clinic\u2019s main campus.\n\nBut not all patients embrace physician assistants. According to a national survey last year by the American Academy of Family Physicians, 72 percent of Americans prefer physicians for information related to their medical care, viewing them as more knowledgeable and experienced.\n\nSome doctors worry that patients are getting short shrift as the bottom line pushes physicians out of the examination room. Dr. Prakash Masand, a psychiatrist in New York City and C.E.O. of Global Medical Education, an online medical education resource, is a critic of their increasing role in mental health care while receiving only 6 to 12 weeks of psychiatric training in school. \u201cThis is one of the reasons misdiagnoses, underdiagnoses and the over-prescription of antidepressants have flooded the mental health system,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil P.A.s receive more specialized training, they shouldn\u2019t handle patients who need a much more experienced doctor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch concerns are echoed for other fields. Dr. Houtan Chaboki, a plastic surgeon in Washington, D.C., points to a growing trend of Botox injections and laser treatments being performed by physician assistants. \u201cThey might be under physician supervision, but the physician may not even be in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may just be reviewing the chart afterward.\u201d\n\nTraining should keep P.A.s from overreaching, said Mary Warner, director of Boston University\u2019s program. \u201cP.A.s know what they can do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know their limits. And I think that the safety factor, having two brains rather than one, really improves the quality of care.\u201d Studies have found that including physician assistants on health care teams can shorten hospital stays and decrease postoperative complications, among other improvements in care.\n\nLike it or not, medicine is now a team sport, observes Dr. Reid B. Blackwelder, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. As his practice moves to team-based care, he may delegate more well-child visits to P.A.s or nurse practitioners. He enjoys seeing his healthy patients, he said, \u201cbut the paperwork takes a lot of time \u2014 as a physician, my time may be better spent with a patient who is critically ill.\u201d And he can still keep his relationship with the healthier children, he said, \u201cby a quick visit at the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all challenged to recognize some new truths,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a solo family physician in a small town called Trenton, Ga., and there\u2019s a badge of honor about that. But the reality is that no one in our current health care system is truly solo or truly independent anymore.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140801180018, "twitter": {"description": "No M.C.A.T., no residency, a few years of professional school and you\u2019re out with a six-figure medical career.", "title": "The Physician Assistant Will See You", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/education/edlife/the-physician-assistant-will-see-you.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003019460"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/education/edlife/03PA1/PA1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/education/edlife/the-physician-assistant-will-see-you.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003019460", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/education/edlife/the-physician-assistant-will-see-you.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "education/edlife", "hdl_p": "In Demand: The Doctor\u2019s Helper", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/education/edlife/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 1, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Graduate Schools and Students,Doctors,Medicine and Health,Nursing and Nurses,Health Insurance and Managed Care", "description": "No M.C.A.T., no residency, a few years of professional school and you\u2019re out with a six-figure medical career.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Barbara Moran", "SCG": "edlife", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "edl-03PA-t", "byl": "By BARBARA MORAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "No M.C.A.T., no residency, a few years of professional school and you\u2019re out with a six-figure medical career.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/education/edlife/03PA1/PA1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Doctor", "CG": "education", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Education Life", "modified": "2014-09-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/education/edlife/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2014-08-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "C7303E0D-6EB2-4FD3-B968-530EF9F38EB1"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140911100105, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/education/edlife/the-physician-assistant-will-see-you.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/education/edlife/03PA1/PA1-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "No M.C.A.T., no residency, a few years of professional school and you\u2019re out with a six-figure medical career.", "title": "The Physician Assistant Will See You"}, "pdate": 20140801, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000003019460, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Physician Assistant Will See You", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/education/edlife/03PA1/PA1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd073e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey might be under physician supervision, but the physician may not even be in the room,\u201d he said.\nBut the reality is that no one in our current health care system is truly solo or truly independent anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons misdiagnoses, underdiagnoses and the over-prescription of antidepressants have flooded the mental health system,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI was a solo family physician in a small town called Trenton, Ga., and there\u2019s a badge of honor about that.\nFor many health care providers, they are also critical to economic success."}
