To the chagrin of Democratic and Republican colleagues alike, Cruz made politically slippery arguments from his soap box as he articulated an ostensibly symbolic, nonsensical verbal crusade in which he referenced both the Nazis and the Little Engine That Could\u2014a salient cocktail of American tenets: fear and stick-to-itiveness.\n\nThe pugnacious Texas Republican led a vacuous and vain cruzsade to halt the funding of Obamacare; however, his meretricious filibuster was a fruitless facade: Obamacare had already been funded and Cruz\u2019s narcissistic absurdism had politically damaging effects on the GOP.\n\nAt Saturday night\u2019s CBS Republican Presidential Debate, Cruz vowed to filibuster any nominee put forth by President Obama. Sunday, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Cruz reiterated his moral-political imperative to \u201cabsolutely\u201d filibuster any nomination. Pragmatism be damned, Cruz made the blind pledge to block any nominee, going so far as to say the Senate has no obligation to consider an Obama nominee. \u201cNot remotely,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz dismissed the notion that the Senate has an obligation to consider an Obama nominee since the presidential election is still about nine months away. The Constitutional originalist appears to be reading provocative partisanship into the interpretation of Art. II, clause 2 of the supreme law of the United States which states, in part, the President \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint\u2026 judges of the Supreme Court.\u201d The Senator, who holds the Constitution so dear, has sadly let ambition subsume his reasoning.\n\nIf Ted Cruz was to filibuster President Obama\u2019s nomination, it would mark the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court justice in American history; there\u2019s very little precedent for that Ted. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, attempted to fill the seat of retiring Chief Justice Earl Warren by promoting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice in his last year in office. A mix of majority Senate Republicans and Democrats protested against Fortas and delayed the vote. While some consider it a filibuster because it, in effect, served the same purpose, it has not been documented as an official filibuster because it did not meet the official definition.\n\nA filibuster is a tactic that can be used in the Senate to prevent or delay the passage of the bill. Once a Senator is granted the right to speak on the floor, they can speak for as long as they are able to\u2014indefinitely. Senator Cruz\u2019s first filibuster came in at just over 21 hours.\n\nThe most recent filibuster precedent is\u2014shockingly\u2014a previous Obama nominee, Associate Justice Elena Kagan. After Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement in 2010, the Senate threatened to filibuster Justice Kagan\u2019s appointment. But that was just a threat, the filibuster never happened. That was less than halfway through Obama\u2019s first term as president. The \u201clame duck\u201d argument promulgated by Cruz and his cronies is veiled political chicanery.\n\nCruz is right, the 2016 election is a referendum, but the 2012 election was too and, let us not forget, President Obama won by a margin of 5 million votes.\n\n[h/t WashingtonPost]", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Ted Cruz was to filibuster President Obama's nomination, it would mark the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court justice in American history.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://lawnewz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_353101010.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz Wants to Filibuster Obama\u2019s Nominee, That\u2019s Never Happened"}, "twitter": {"site": "@law_newz", "image": "http://lawnewz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_353101010.jpg", "description": "If Ted Cruz was to filibuster President Obama's nomination, it would mark the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court justice in American history.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ted Cruz Wants to Filibuster Obama's Nominee, That's Never Happened"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2016-02-17T08:29:21+00:00", "keywords": "ted cruz,scotus,justice antonin scalia,scalia,antonin scalia,justice scalia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If Ted Cruz was to filibuster President Obama\u2019s nomination, it would mark the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court justice in American history; there\u2019s very little precedent for that Ted.\nAt Saturday night\u2019s CBS Republican Presidential Debate, Cruz vowed to filibuster any nominee put forth by President Obama.\nAfter Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement in 2010, the Senate threatened to filibuster Justice Kagan\u2019s appointment.\nPragmatism be damned, Cruz made the blind pledge to block any nominee, going so far as to say the Senate has no obligation to consider an Obama nominee.\nThe most recent filibuster precedent is\u2014shockingly\u2014a previous Obama nominee, Associate Justice Elena Kagan."}
