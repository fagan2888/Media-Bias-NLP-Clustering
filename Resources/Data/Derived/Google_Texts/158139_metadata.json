But Laura Witjens, the chief executive of the sperm bank, says it's currently working on trying to rectify the donation shortage in order to meet increasing demands.\n\nWitjens says there may be a few reasons for the shortage, which new advertising plans will try to work against. For one, the UK national sperm bank is still relatively young; it was started last year thanks to a one-off award of nearly $118,000 from the National Gamete Donation Trust and Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital. Along with this, recent anonymity laws have changed, potentially discouraging donors from visiting facilities. As of 2005, any child who has turned 18 and was born from a sperm donor is allowed to trace their biological father to try and make contact. No cases have been reported yet, but some are expected during 2023, which will be 18 years after the law was passed.\n\nAside from all of that, it\u2019s also time consuming to become a donor. \u201cIf 100 guys inquire, 10 will come through for screenings and maybe one becomes a donor,\u201d Witjens told The Guardian. \u201cIt takes hundreds of guys.\u201d\n\nTo donate, a man is required to make a donation twice a week for up to four months. He is also asked to refrain from sex or masturbation for the two days before each clinic visit, and follow up six months later for another test. To top it off, he must have sperm strong enough to withstand being frozen, which is more difficult than it sounds.\n\nDonors may also feel that what they earn is not enough to compensate for their time. Currently, a donor gets paid about $54 per session, but Witjens says that giving more money is not the answer. \u201cWe might get more donors in if we paid them [$75], or [$153] per donation. But money corrupts. If you feel you can make [$300] a week for four months, you might hide things about your health.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this shortage has proven to be a big loss for many couples looking to conceive using donor sperm. Thanks to changes in same-sex marriage legislation, an increase in same-sex couples looking for donors has put a strain on the market. According to 2013 figures from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, there has been a 20 percent increase in same-sex couples receiving donor insemination. These numbers still reflect times before the legislation was enacted, suggesting that number has increased even more.\n\nMoreover, many of those requesting sperm donors have high expectations, Witjens said. \u201cWe get asked for 6-foot-tall donors, when the average height is 5 feet, 7 inches in Britain, so you are effectively ruling out 90 percent of the donors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they all want doctors or barristers, but the reality is the majority of those professionals have not got time. So you actually get young guys with flexible jobs.\u201d\n\nIn order to get more donations, Witjens thinks that using Denmark\u2019s advertising tactics may hold the answer. Danish sperm banks often attract donors by appealing to their masculinity, and vanity, and so far it\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cIf I advertised saying, \u2018Men, prove your worth, show me how good you are,\u2019 then I would get hundreds of donors,\u201d said Witjens. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the Danish do it. They proudly say, this is the Viking invasion, exports from Denmark are beer, Lego, and sperm. It\u2019s a source of pride.\u201d\n\nTo mimic this strategy, Witjens has proposed a type of Superman-themed advertising to appeal to this side of men, while also emphasizing that only the strongest sperm will survive after being frozen. As for the proposed campaign, although it has yet to be finalized, it isn\u2019t as blunt as the Danish campaigns. She says that right now they plan to use real men for the commercial, though the picture on their pamphlet will be of a superhero character.\n\nWitjens also notes that a campaign centered on male pride rather than altruism could pose a moral dilemma: Future children of these donors may not be happy to find that they were a product of a marketing scheme to display masculine prowess.\n\nUltimately, Witjens and the national bank hope that increasing donor numbers through advertising will stop people from seeking donations from foreign banks. British banks are preferable, she said, because they limit the number of children that can be conceived from one donor. Those who don\u2019t limit this may cause problems for future children. \u201cIt\u2019s always a very real fear for the donor-conceived, running into a half-brother or sister.\u201d\n\nFor now, the UK national sperm bank has high hopes for the future. \u201cI want to get to a stage where there is an abundance of donors, so no woman ever feels she has to go on Gumtree to get sperm,\u201d Witjens said. \u201cWe can get there, we can have enough in three to five years. We just need the push.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "uk, national, sperm, bank, only, 9, registered, donors, wont, meet, increasing, demands, new", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The UK national sperm bank has only nine donors, but a Superman-themed advertising campaign may change that.", "title": "With Only 9 Donors, UK's National Sperm Bank Will Devise Superman-Themed Recruiting Plan", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/uk-national-sperm-bank-only-9-registered-donors-wont-meet-increasing-demands-new-350762", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/muscle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The UK national sperm bank has only nine donors, but a Superman-themed advertising campaign may change that.", "title": "With Only 9 Donors, UK's National Sperm Bank Will Devise Superman-Themed Recruiting Plan", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/uk-national-sperm-bank-only-9-registered-donors-wont-meet-increasing-demands-new-350762", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/muscle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/muscle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-01T19:03:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-01T19:03:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The UK national sperm bank has only nine donors, but a Superman-themed advertising campaign may change that."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s always a very real fear for the donor-conceived, running into a half-brother or sister.\u201dFor now, the UK national sperm bank has high hopes for the future.\nAny child born today from a UK sperm donor will have little trouble finding his biological father in the future \u2014 Britain\u2019s national sperm bank has just admitted that it only has nine registered donors.\n\u201cIf 100 guys inquire, 10 will come through for screenings and maybe one becomes a donor,\u201d Witjens told The Guardian.\nFor one, the UK national sperm bank is still relatively young; it was started last year thanks to a one-off award of nearly $118,000 from the National Gamete Donation Trust and Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital.\nBut Laura Witjens, the chief executive of the sperm bank, says it's currently working on trying to rectify the donation shortage in order to meet increasing demands."}
