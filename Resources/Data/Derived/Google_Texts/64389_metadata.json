According to the fund-raising emails being sent out, no one does.\n\nInstead, both parties claim to be on the brink of defeat. Fund-raising pleas from political figures ranging from the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, to Senator Rand Paul tell voters that the campaign is close but their side is losing.\n\n\u201cWith this new Republican outside spending, we\u2019ll still need 28,000 more online donations to be able to compete,\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote in one email. \u201cCan you please donate to President Obama\u2019s call-to-action, and help us limit the damage?\u201d As Politico noted, \u201cDemocratic and Republican operatives are dashing off Chicken Little emails at a dizzying rate\u201d for the purpose \"of leveling the playing field with the other sides\u2019 relentless billionaires.\u201d\n\nThe Upshot In a weekly e-mail newsletter, get the best of The Upshot's analysis about politics, policy and everyday life.\n\nWhy do campaigns keep saying they\u2019re losing? These doom-and-gloom messages seem to be effective at motivating donors. The best evidence to support this claim comes from a new study by the social scientists Todd Rogers of Harvard and Don A. Moore of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn other contexts, they note, projecting confidence is often a successful leadership strategy. But in politics it may serve to demobilize potential donors by convincing them that their contributions are unnecessary. Why give if your preferred candidate is going to win anyway? By contrast, people are often more motivated to act when trying to avoid an undesirable outcome \u2014 in this case, losing an election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo demonstrate this point, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Moore conducted experiments in which they showed that online survey participants are more supportive of hypothetical preferred candidates if they are just behind in the polls instead of just ahead.\n\nThese differences matter in the real world of campaigns, as the two professors show using fund-raising experiments conducted by the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association and Anne Lewis Strategies, Inc. Emails from the D.G.A. saying that Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for governor in Florida, was ahead of the Democrat Charlie Crist in the polls were almost 50 percent more likely to result in a donation and raised approximately 60 percent more than those saying Mr. Scott was behind.\n\nParadoxically, the best way to win in politics may be to tell everyone you are on the verge of losing.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141006060005, "twitter": {"description": "A study says doom-and-gloom messages seem to be effective at motivating donors.", "title": "How to Win at Raising Money: Warn That You\u2019re About to Lose", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/upshot/how-to-win-at-raising-money-warn-that-youre-about-to-lose.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003157166"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "BrendanNyhan", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/07/upshot/07up-nyhan/07up-nyhan-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/upshot/how-to-win-at-raising-money-warn-that-youre-about-to-lose.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003157166", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/upshot/how-to-win-at-raising-money-warn-that-youre-about-to-lose.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 6, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Campaign Finance,Midterm Elections (2014),United States Politics and Government", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Brendan Nyhan", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/07/upshot/07up-nyhan/07up-nyhan-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By BRENDAN NYHAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A study says doom-and-gloom messages seem to be effective at motivating donors.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/07/upshot/07up-nyhan/07up-nyhan-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "description": "A study says doom-and-gloom messages seem to be effective at motivating donors.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 6, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-10-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2014-10-06", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "07up-nyhan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141006110306, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/upshot/how-to-win-at-raising-money-warn-that-youre-about-to-lose.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/07/upshot/07up-nyhan/07up-nyhan-videoSixteenByNine1050-v3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A study says doom-and-gloom messages seem to be effective at motivating donors.", "title": "How to Win at Raising Money: Warn That You\u2019re About to Lose"}, "pdate": 20141006, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000003157166, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "How to Win at Raising Money: Warn That You\u2019re About to Lose", "col": "Giving When It Hurts", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceaa9\"", "article_summary": "According to the fund-raising emails being sent out, no one does.\nParadoxically, the best way to win in politics may be to tell everyone you are on the verge of losing.\nBut in politics it may serve to demobilize potential donors by convincing them that their contributions are unnecessary.\nBy contrast, people are often more motivated to act when trying to avoid an undesirable outcome \u2014 in this case, losing an election.\n\u201cWith this new Republican outside spending, we\u2019ll still need 28,000 more online donations to be able to compete,\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote in one email."}
