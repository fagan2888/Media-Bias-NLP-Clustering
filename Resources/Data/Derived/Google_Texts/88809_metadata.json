Instead of shooting webbing from his wrists, Spidey gets embedded in his chest a 5-inch-long, 3.8-ounce canister held by his wrists. A child presses his back to send a stream of a \u201cSilly String\u201d type substance at targets. Additionally, owners can embed the enclosed water canister to target relatives and pets. You did not hear that from this Santa\u2019s helper. Additional containers of Spidey Shot Web Fluid sold separately ($7.99).\n\nSEE ALSO: Best of Blu-ray and DVD (animation)\n\nMega Mutant Leo (Playmates, $29.99, for ages 3 and older, 2 AA batteries included) \u2014 The famed, sword-wielding Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle comes to life for youngsters in the form of a talking, 12-inch-tall action figure ready for training. The perfect small hands toy for tots, the child holds the hero with a handle on his back. He presses its lever to swing Leo\u2019s arms, move his eyes and activate sound effects and a few of over of 100 phrases such as \u201cthat will come in handy the next time we battle Shredder.\u201d He can deliver further phrases by pressing a button on his belt. Leo comes with a pair of removable soft plastic Katana blades to fit into his fists and has about a dozen points of articulation.\n\nDeluxe Flying Baymax (Bandai, $39.99, for ages 4 years old and older, 3 AA batteries included) \u2014 Wield the mechanical might of one of the co-stars of Disney\u2019s computer-animated superhero film \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d in this 11-inch-tall, interactive figure. Featuring a whopping 18-inch-long wingspan, the robot comes to life when a child presses his midsection to light up his head and deliver a selection of robotic sound effects. He features 20 points of articulation, collapsible wigs, a projectile fist (hard plastic warning) and detachable pieces of armor. Better yet, attach the 4.5-inch version of his 14-year-old, science genius Hiro Hamada to his back and Baymax delivers ascending and descending flight sounds when twisted in the air. Suffice to report, this highly entertaining, hands-on toy will thrill fans of the film.\n\nStomp & Chomp Grimlock (Hasbro, $79.99, for ages 5 years old and older, 2 AA batteries included) \u2014 The leader of the legendary Dinobots offers an ultimate gift for lovers of the Transformers. This noisy, mechanical Tyrannosaurus Rex is over 2 feet long (from snout to tip of tail). Owners use the handle and lever on its back to make Grimlock\u2019s jaw open, setting off a load roar and making his eyes glow red. Or, press his teeth to hear chumping sounds. Now, with a simple conversion (squeeze the lever and pull back), he becomes his robotic form, 20 inches tall, revealing pop-out weapons and able to hold an included, massive laser sword. Touch teeth (now above his head) to hear guttural dialogue snippets such as \u201cdestroy.\u201d The package also contains a 4-inch-tall version of Optimus Prime to mount on the Dinobot recreating a key moment of the \u201cAge of Extinction\u201d movie. His presence causes the T-Rex to pop out a laser cannon, triggering firing sounds while his eyes glow green.\n\nSEE ALSO: VIDEO GAME GIFT GUIDE: Best picks for Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4\n\nFor figure fans\n\nBatman Sprukit (Bandai, $19.99, for ages 8 and older) \u2013 Build a 5-inch-tall, articulated version of the Dark Knight in this action-figure model kit. Owners will need to take a deep breath and prepare for at least a 60-minute challenge as they snap together 95 pieces to produce DC Comics\u2018 famed hero in his Arkham City costume complete with Batarang and grapple gun. It\u2019s actually a very slick idea, but beware of over-playing with the hard plastic figure as parts could break. Best idea is to set a pose and show the Sprukit off to friends as more of a statue rather than play with the action figure. Other kits available include the Joker, Superman and Halo\u2019s Master Chief.\n\nSpeeder Biker with Biker Scout (Hasbro, $39.99, for ages 4 and older) \u2014 The Star Wars Black Series line offers collectors affordably priced, highly detailed and articulated action figures capturing authentic reproduction of characters from the famed galaxy, far, far away. This soldier of the Empire was found in the movie \u201cThe Return of the Jedi,\u201d where he was chasing Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia in the Endor forest and slammed into a large tree. Nuances to the almost 11-inch-long bike include a well-defined lower engine assembly, a swiveling lower blaster and a perfect, worn paint job (with spots of scraped metal, rust and dirt). The 6-inch-tall figure features black-and-white costuming, grey pouches around his abdomen, muddied boots, a small removable blaster holstered on one of his boot and over two dozen points of articulation. Owners will also appreciate the translucent stand to display their new collectible.\n\nGotham City Bane Battle (Mattel, $49.99, for ages 3 and older) \u2014 This mega collection of DC Comics-themed action figures feature 4-inch versions of Batman (grey blue costume), Robin (green and red costume), Batman Beyond, Red Hood, Azrael, Deathstroke and a towering, 6-inch-tall version of the Bat-breaking villain Bane. The smaller figures feature cloth capes (where applicable), plenty of articulation and the ability to hold an included pair of weapons (a large ax and pincers). However, the big bruiser Bane stars here. He has chains wrapped to serrated pieces of metal on his fists (easily removed) and the florescent green tubing ventilator (used to feed him the superpowering drug Venom) can be taken off to see his complete masked face. Youngsters should feel free to appreciate the figures in maximum role-play mode with little fear of breakage as they create the ultimate battle in the Dark Knight universe.\n\nFor watchers\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past: Ultimate Edition (20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, rated PG-13, $39.99) \u2014 Possibly the best superhero movie of the year makes a perfect stocking stuffer for fans of the Homo Superior. Charles Xavier and Magneto team up they find a way to send Wolverine back in time to try and get their younger counterparts to stop a war between mutant and human. The all-star line-up includes Hugh Jackman as Logan, Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Ian McKellan and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Halle Berry as Storm, just to name a few comic legends brought to life. The 131-minute effort directed by Bryan Singer explodes from home entertainment widescreens in the Blu-ray format, especially for those with three-dimensional televisions (look out for the massive Sentinels) and does fantastic justice to Chris Claremont and John Byrne\u2019s epic Marvel Comics\u2018 X-Men story from 1981. Take an iPad and install Fox\u2019s Second Screen app to get a load of production goodies on Apple\u2019s mobile device while watching the movie.\n\nMarvel Knights: The Wolverine Collection (Shout! Factory, not rated, $29.93) \u2014 This quintet of full-length cartoon motion comics highlight the life of the X-Men\u2019s famed feral mutant along with some fantastic sequential art from such superstars as Andy Kubert, Leinil Francis Yu and Simone Bianchi. The five, DVD disc collection contains \u201cWolverine: Origin,\u201d \u201cUltimate Wolverine vs. Hulk,\u201d \u201cWolverine vs. Sabretooth,\u201d \u201cWolverine vs. Sabretooth: Reborn\u201d and \u201cWolverine Weapon X: Tomorrow Dies Today.\u201d Each are roughly hourlong adaptations combining narration, voiceovers, sound effects, music and illustrations plucked from comic book panels that bring popular comic book mini-series to slightly animated life. Extras include interviews with some of the creators and staff at Marvel including writer Paul Jenkins and Joe Quesada, chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment.\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation, Season 7 (Paramount, not rated, $130.00) \u2014 TV-watching Trekkers bid farewell to Capt. Jean Luc Picard and the crew of USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) in the mid-1990s. This Blu-ray set offers the last 25 episodes of the critically acclaimed television series that ran from 1987 to 1994 and includes the extended farewell \u201cAll Good Things \u2026\u201d Extras include select episode audio commentaries, many deleted scenes and the three-part, roughly 90-minute documentary \u201cThe Sky\u2019s the Limit: The Eclipse of Star Trek: The Next Generation\u201d \u2014 and will not disappoint. For those unaware, the entire Next Generation series has been meticulously remastered in the high-definition format through a painstaking restoration process with season sets having been released over the last two years. Gift givers may find themselves purchasing other sets to try to fill out a fans ultimate Next Generation collection (prices as low as $60 on some third-party websites).\n\nFor collectors\n\n\n\nMan of Steel: Superman (Sideshow Collectibles, $379.99) \u2014 Collectors hooked on Warner Bros.\u2019 2013 live action movie starring actor Henry Cavill as DC Comics\u2018 iconic hero will unwrap and display this masterpiece faster than a speeding bullet. A team of Sideshow artisans crafted an impeccable 1:4 scale version of the latest Superman standing over 21-inches tall and incorporating a mixed media concoction of PVC, fabric and polystone. Entrenched atop a base displaying a buckled, Metropolis street, Clark Kent\u2019s alter ego arrives in a tightly fitted, hand tailored replica of his new costume, complete with a fully poseable cloth cape and looking, as well as feeling, ripped from the movie set. The likeness to Mr. Cavill is dead on, highlighting his dimpled chin, blue eyes and pumped up body as he stands ready to slug General Zod with both of his hands clenched into fists. For gift givers that can afford the homage, it will be a piece of pop culture art not soon forgotten for the lucky owner.\n\n\n\nPrison Tower and Gate (McFarlane Toys, $64.99) \u2014 Todd McFarlane and his band of crazed toy makers now dabble in the Lego and Mega Bloks universe with hybrid building sets paying homage to AMC\u2019s legendary zombie show, \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d This 620-piece construction set offers part of a location where Rick Grimes and his band of survivors held off the Governor, his minions and hungry undead. It includes a guard tower, barbed wire fence, gate, light post, assorted weeds and articulated, roughly 2-inch tall mini-figures (they also need built) of Glen Rhee and a pair of zombies (one crawling and one walking). Of course, with this set completed, keen collectors will start amassing other kits such as Daryl Dixon with Chopper ($19.99, 154 pieces) as well as buildable figure packs ($2.99 to $14.99) to begin assembling the ultimate dioramic apocalypse starring their favorite humans and walkers.\n\n\n\nSuperman and Wonder Woman Holiday Kiss (DC Collectibles, $99.99) \u2014 Sculptor Tim Bruckner brings to three-dimensional life the art of Jim Lee in this intricately designed, 9-inch tall, mixed media statue. A perfect holiday-themed gift for the modern comic book loving fan in the family, it presents the Man of Steel with his arm around his favorite Amazonian warrior and getting ready to kiss her under the mistletoe. The pair hovers atop clouds slathered in glitter while dressed in the latest version of their iconic costumes.\n\n\n\nFor readers\n\n\n\nBatman: A Celebration of 75 Years (DC Comics, $39.99) \u2014 Since 1939, Bob Kane\u2019s Caped Crusading vigilante has existed in sequential art.
