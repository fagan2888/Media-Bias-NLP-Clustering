The researchers are slated to present their findings next month, and Chrysler recently released a patch for the vulnerability.\n\nSome of their work was cited in a report released by Markey's office earlier this year titled \"Tracking and Hacking\" that found nearly all cars on the market include wireless technology that could be vulnerable and only two manufacturers could describe any capabilities to respond to an attack in real time.\n\nThe legislation would require the NHTSA to set standards to ensure all wireless access points of a vehicle are protected, that critical systems are isolated, that the vehicle has technology to detect and stop a hack in real time, and that all information collected is secured.\n\nIt would also require the FTC to develop rules to force car companies to make customers aware of collected data and give them the option to opt out of much of it. It would also prohibit marketers from using driving information for ad targeting.\n\nNew vehicles would also have to display information about how well their cars protects drivers' privacy and security.\n\nBlumenthal said carmakers have left vulnerabilities in their products as they rush to \"roll out the next big thing.\"\n\n\"Federal law must provide minimum standards and safeguards that keep hackers out of drivers\u2019 private data lanes,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cDrivers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between being connected and being protected,\u201d Sen.
