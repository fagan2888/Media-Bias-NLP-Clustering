Elizabeth cited the \u201cChristmas truce\u201d in 1914 as an example to be remembered.\n\n\u201cSomething remarkable did happen that Christmas, exactly 100 years ago today,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout any instruction or command, the shooting stopped and German and British soldiers met in No Man\u2019s Land. Photographs were taken and gifts exchanged. It was a Christmas truce.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: UK queen calls for harmony in Christmas message\n\nShe said German forces sang \u201cSilent Night\u201d so that it could be heard on the British side of the front line.\n\n\u201cThat carol is still much-loved today, a legacy of the Christmas truce, and a reminder to us all that even in the unlikeliest of places hope can still be found,\u201d the queen said before wishing everyone a happy Christmas.\n\nThe queen writes her own Christmas speech, which is pre-recorded and televised in many parts of the world. She made her first Christmas broadcast on radio in 1952.\n\nThe queen and her close family celebrated Christmas at the sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk.\n\nThe royals attended a church service Christmas morning before a gala lunch. Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate were present, but their toddler son, Prince George, didn\u2019t go to church.\n\nKate told one person in the crowd she didn\u2019t bring 1-year-old George because he would have made too much noise.\n\nPrince Charles\u2019 wife Camilla also didn\u2019t attend because of a painful back injury suffered earlier this month, officials said.\n\nThe queen arrived by car while the other royals walked from her estate to the village church.\n\nHundreds of well-wishers lined the route to the church to exchange Christmas greetings with the royals. Some shouted with glee as Prince Harry walked by. One visitor from Spain told reporters she had asked Harry to marry her.\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby cancelled his Christmas sermon because of a severe cold. In a statement he expressed \u201cgreat regret\u201d about his inability to preach his planned sermon about the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nChurch officials said the sermon at Canterbury Cathedral would instead be delivered by the Dean of Canterbury Robert Willis.\n\n___\n\nGregory Katz reported from London.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Queen Elizabeth II used her traditional Christmas broadcast Thursday to call for reconciliation throughout the United Kingdom and to praise medical workers fighting Ebola in Africa.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II used her traditional Christmas broadcast Thursday to call for reconciliation throughout the United Kingdom and to praise medical workers fighting Ebola in Africa.", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II calls for harmony in Christmas message", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/queen-elizabeth-ii-praises-workers-who-fight-ebola/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/25/britain-royal-christmasjpeg-084c3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/25/britain-royal-christmasjpeg-084c3.jpg", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II used her traditional Christmas broadcast Thursday to call for reconciliation throughout the United Kingdom and to praise medical workers fighting Ebola in Africa.", "card": "summary", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II calls for harmony in Christmas message"}, "Author": "Matt Dunham and Gregory Katz", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Christmas, Elizabeth II"}, "article_summary": "Elizabeth cited the \u201cChristmas truce\u201d in 1914 as an example to be remembered.\nThe queen arrived by car while the other royals walked from her estate to the village church.\nIt was a Christmas truce.\u201dPHOTOS: UK queen calls for harmony in Christmas messageShe said German forces sang \u201cSilent Night\u201d so that it could be heard on the British side of the front line.\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby cancelled his Christmas sermon because of a severe cold.\nSANDRINGHAM, England (AP) \u2014 Queen Elizabeth II used her traditional Christmas broadcast Thursday to call for reconciliation throughout the United Kingdom and to praise medical workers fighting Ebola in Africa."}
