Industry experts say these regulations would drive a final nail into the coal industry, which currently supplies almost half the nation\u2019s electricity. So, to justify the regulations, significant health benefits must be demonstrated.\n\nSuch stories have become expected in environmental policy. The government announces an aim or policy change, and the research community gets together, using taxpayer dollars, to confirm the government\u2019s approach is the best option. Those who support it post it to their Facebook pages; those who don\u2019t ignore it.\n\nResearchers from Harvard University, Syracuse University and four other institutions used climate models to predict the impact the EPA\u2019s proposed carbon emissions reductions would have on human health. And not surprisingly, it turned out the government\u2019s plan was not just among the options that would produce positive results but was, in fact, the best way to achieve the goals.\n\nBut there was a line in this story that sets it apart. Jonathan Buonocore, a research fellow at Harvard\u2019s Center for Health and the Global Environment, told U.S. News the EPA did not participate in the study or interact with its authors.\n\nBut it seems the agency did participate and did interact with the authors.\n\nEmails discovered through a Freedom of Information Act request by Steve Milloy, a former editor at JunkScience.com, found a string of correspondence to set up meetings and conference calls to, in the words of one such email, \u201cdiscuss methods for our next set of analyses.\u201d\n\nThe chain of emails went back and forth as the researchers and the agency both sought to add participants to the call. The fact the research showed precisely what the government wanted it to and that the government\u2019s own proposal, when mimicked by researchers, produced the best results further raise suspicion.\n\nCharles Driscoll seemed to grasp this when he told The New York Times it was \u201ca coincidence\u201d that one of the models so closely resembled the federal proposal.\n\nMilloy does not buy that explanation, and he doesn\u2019t buy that this research was not coordinated with the agency to maximize effectiveness in promoting the coal regulations.\n\nDespite the fact the study\u2019s authors \u201creceived or were involved in $45 million worth of research grants from the EPA,\u201d The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Associated Press described the researchers \u201csimply and innocuously\u201d as researchers and scientists, Milloy lamented in a recent post at JunkScience.com. \u201cAbsent some unimagined explanation, these emails flatly contradict the claims [of independence] made in the Harvard and Syracuse media releases and in statements to media [by the researchers themselves].\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal asked both the Harvard School of Public Health and Syracuse University if they stand by their characterization of the researchers as \u201cindependent\u201d in press releases on the study. Neither responded.\n\nThe scientists who produce this government-favored research not only have begun to cash in at taxpayers\u2019 expense, but they\u2019ve also begun to ask the agency for help with fundraising.\n\nMilloy uncovered an email in which Driscoll asks Ellen Kurlansky, an agency staffer, for her assistance and advice on raising money for another project.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see if I could arrange a short call with you to discuss fundraising [on a meeting related to mercury poisoning]. We are making some progress on the planning for this meeting, but it would help if I could raise a little money to help pay for some initial expenses.\u201d\n\nThis coziness is not healthy, said David Kreutzer, an energy economics and climate change policy analyst for The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe science can be judged on its own, but the independence of the researchers is undermined when emails show they were soliciting funds from the EPA even as they were writing up their study reviewing the impact of significant EPA rules.\u201d\n\nThe government is not nearly so accommodating for scientists who don\u2019t toe its preferred line.\n\nWillie Soon, an astrophysicist with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, co-authored a paper published in January that found the models used in the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are laced with mathematical errors. Soon then endured an avalanche of criticism of his funding sources and implications he had shaped his findings to please them.\n\nIt mattered not that he got only about $60,000 per year from the one \u201ccompromised\u201d source or that the compromised source was the Smithsonian or that he had not known where the Smithsonian got the money it paid him.\n\nThen, a few days after The New York Times piece on Soon appeared, Congress got into the act. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., ranking minority member on the House Natural Resources Committee, sent letters to seven universities asking for documents on climate change research connected with scientific skeptics who have questioned the premise of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming.\n\nThis was followed by a letter from Sens. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., to 100 fossil fuel companies, trade groups, and other outfits \u201cto determine whether they are funding scientific studies designed to confuse the public and avoid taking action to cut carbon pollution, and whether the funded scientists fail to disclose the sources of their funding in scientific publications or in testimony to legislators.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the deck remains stacked against those who dare to stray from the government message on global warming, and the conflicts of interest seem concentrated on the researchers and scientists who accept government money, according to William Happer, a professor of physics at Princeton University.\n\n\u201cUnless you accept the alarmist position and the dictates of the [Obama] administration, you cannot typically receive government funding,\u201d said Happer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The relationship between EPA and academic supporters is so cozy some researchers have asked the agency to help out with fundraising efforts.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The relationship between EPA and academic supporters is so cozy some researchers have asked the agency to help out with fundraising efforts.", "title": "Does EPA Help Greens Fundraise for Favorable Research?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150621_EPACoal.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T14:03:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QH9mrW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The relationship between EPA and academic supporters is so cozy some researchers have asked the agency to help out with fundraising efforts.", "title": "Does EPA Help Greens Fundraise for Favorable Research?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150621_EPACoal.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "environment", "published_time": "2015-06-21T03:01:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T14:03:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nature Climate Change, Harvard, Syracuse, EPA, coal regulations, Clean Power Plan, Raul Grijalva, Edward Markey, Barbara Boxer, Sheldon Whitehouse"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2b6\"", "article_summary": "The government announces an aim or policy change, and the research community gets together, using taxpayer dollars, to confirm the government\u2019s approach is the best option.\nRep.
