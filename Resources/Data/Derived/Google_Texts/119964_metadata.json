He\u2019s given soaring speeches about the \u201cRussian bear\u201d refusing to be caged and opened a theme park celebrating the Russian military. And in more sinister moves, his political party has announced plans to have vigilante groups patrolling the streets of Moscow and has passed laws that all but criminalize dissent.\n\nNow, according to Russian media reports, the next step being considered by the Kremlin is to encourage patriotism through pop music.\n\nRelated: Dissent in Putin\u2019s Russia Just Got More Dangerous\n\nThe Russian business daily Vedomosti reported on Monday that an investment holding company had agreed to sell its ownership stake in Russian Media Group to Goskontsert, a state-controlled concert organizer attached to the Ministry of Culture. RMG controls multiple radio stations broadcast throughout Russia and neighboring countries, reaching a reported 200 million listeners.\n\nThe deal, according to Vedomosti, was done to further a scheme within the Kremlin to create an \u201cincubator\u201d for \u201cideologically right-minded\u201d musical artists. The originator of the plan is apparently Vladimir Kiselyov, a former drummer with the Soviet-era \u201cspace rock\u201d band Zemlyane.\n\nZemlyane, which translates as \u201cEarthlings,\u201d was known for its patriotic songs about space exploration, and its hit \u201cTrava u Doma\u201d (\u201cThe Grass Of Home\u201d) has been carried into space by Russian cosmonauts.\n\n(Sample lyric:\n\nAnd we dream not of thunder at the cosmodrome,\n\nNot of the ice-cold blue of the sky -\n\nBut we dream of grass - the grass beside our house\n\nGreen, green grass \u2026)\n\nRelated: 7 New Weapons in Vladimir Putin's Arsenal\n\nKiselyov more recently has become the director of a Russian charity, Federatsiya, which ran into controversy a few years ago after the proceeds from a promotional tour of international celebrities were not completely accounted for.\n\nPutin himself has a complicated relationship with pop music. He has dabbled in singing popular tunes (though \u201cBlueberry Hill\u201d may more properly be considered an oldie). Earlier this year, he sang the Russian national anthem with a famous former pop star in a ceremony celebrating the annexation of Crimea.\n\nSome pop stars love Putin. Earlier this year, Siberian singer Mashany\u2019s song \u201cMy Putin\u201d and its accompanying video gained international attention. Singers Iosif Kobzon and Alla Perfilova were subject to calls for a boycott when they played in London last year because of their vocal public support of the Putin regime.\n\nHowever, the punk band Pussy Riot has been a thorn in Putin\u2019s side for years, singing public protest songs naming him personally and criticizing his policies. In a particularly embarrassing episode, members of the band were publicly horse-whipped by Cossacks loyal to Putin after they began singing one of their more controversial numbers at the Sochi Olympics.\n\nRelated: A New Warning About Russia from a Top U.S. General\n\nThe Russian government has become increasingly repressive in both the political and cultural spheres in the last decade, as well as more aggressive about asserting control over what the public can and cannot see, read, hear and listen to. Taking over pop music may just be the obvious next step.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "According to Russian media reports, the next step in Vladimir Putin\u2019s consolidation of power in Russia is to encourage patriotism through pop music.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Next Invasion: The Pop Charts", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/Putin-s-Next-Invasion-Pop-Charts-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-crisis-putin-west_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/28/Putin-s-Next-Invasion-Pop-Charts-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-crisis-putin-west_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "According to Russian media reports, the next step in Vladimir Putin\u2019s consolidation of power in Russia is to encourage patriotism through pop music.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "However, the punk band Pussy Riot has been a thorn in Putin\u2019s side for years, singing public protest songs naming him personally and criticizing his policies.\nNow, according to Russian media reports, the next step being considered by the Kremlin is to encourage patriotism through pop music.\nEarlier this year, he sang the Russian national anthem with a famous former pop star in a ceremony celebrating the annexation of Crimea.\nHe\u2019s given soaring speeches about the \u201cRussian bear\u201d refusing to be caged and opened a theme park celebrating the Russian military.\nSome pop stars love Putin."}
