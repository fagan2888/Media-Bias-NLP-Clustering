Between 1992 and 2006, 42.8 percent of U.S. counties had increased mortality rates among women compared with only 3.2 percent among men. These increases were more common among non-Hispanic white women with less education living in the South and West. \"\n\nThe report adds that such \"growing disadvantage in women's health has implications not only for women but for their families as well.\"\n\n\"The Task Force makes evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services to improve the health of all Americans,\" the report says.\n\n\"However, significant evidence gaps in key areas of women's health limit the full realization of these population health benefits, and limit the Task Force's ability to make definitive, science-based recommendations.\"\n\nThe report notes that \"improving the health of women and girls presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for how we think about prevention and wellness in the clinical care setting.\"\n\nThe challenges include addressing what the report calls the \"unique health care needs\" of women and girls \"related to reproductive and biological differences\" as well as the recognition that female health concerns are impacted by home environment, economic and educational resources.\n\n\"The USPST recognizes the complexity of women's health and acknowledges the larger impact of preventive interventions on the health and well-being of women and girls,\" the report adds.\n\n\"For the purpose of this report, we take a broader view of women's health, focusing in particular on the prevention of diseases or conditions not related to pregnancy and reproductive health.\"\n\nThe USPSTF is mandated by the Affordable Care Act to make an annual report to Congress. Its 15 members serve four-year terms and are appointed by the director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality which was directed by Congress, in 1998, to create the USPTF. Their recommendations on screenings based on their review of existing , sometimes controversial, are made to primary care practitioners This is their fifth report to Congress.\n\nThe report explores in depth the various areas in which its says more evidence based research is needed for more informed recommendations and in terms of implementation includes the following response to the question, \"How Can We Help More Women Talk to Their Doctors About Screening for Breast Cancer?\"\n\n\"Mammography is an important tool in the fight against breast cancer. Evidence indicates that the value of mammography increases with age. Women ages 40 to 49 years should make their own decision whether to get a mammogram, in consultation with their clinicians. This decision should be based on their health history, family history, individual risk for breast cancer, and individual preferences,\" the report states.\n\n\"In addition, women who are at increased risk for the BRCA gene mutation that causes breast and ovarian cancer should be identified for genetic counseling, and women at high risk for breast cancer should consider medications to prevent breast cancer. However, these decisions are complex. Research is needed to develop tools that help women and their clinicians make decisions about screening that are consistent both with the best evidence and with women's values and preferences.\"\n\nIn 2014, the USPSTF focused on the evidence gaps related to the care of children and adolescents.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Breast cancer, Task force, USPSTF, United States Task Force on Preventative Services, United States Congress, affordable-care-act, health, health-headlnes, united-states-task-force-on-preventative-services, news", "title": "More research needed on women's health, U.S. Preventative Services Task Force tells Congress", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"More research needed on women\\u0027s health, U.S. Preventative Services Task Force tells Congress\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/more_research_needed_on_womens_health_us_preventative_services_task_force_tells_congress.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/12/01/19302221-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17548742\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-01T16:17:54Z\", \"author\": \"Anne-Gerard Flynn | aflynn@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"@politics\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"health\",\"health-headlnes\",\"united-states-task-force-on-preventative-services\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/12/01/19302221-standard.jpg", "creator": "@aflynn2", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The U.S Preventative Services Task Force is calling for a focus on women's health beyond gynecological and reproductive issues in its annual report to Congress"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, December 01, 2015, 11:17 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"More research on women\\u0027s health needed, report says\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/breakingnews/photo/2015/12/01/mammoscreeningjpg-7d4b3cb45a364843.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"aflynn\", \"author_nickname\": \"Anne-Gerard Flynn | aflynn@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"2776\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "The U.S Preventative Services Task Force is calling for a focus on women's health beyond gynecological and reproductive issues in its annual report to Congress", "title": "More research needed on women's health, U.S. Preventative Services Task Force tells Congress", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/more_research_needed_on_womens_health_us_preventative_services_task_force_tells_congress.html", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/12/01/19302221-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 01, 2015, 11:17 AM", "article_author": "Anne-Gerard Flynn | aflynn@repub.com", "Description": "The U.S Preventative Services Task Force is calling for a focus on women's health beyond gynecological and reproductive issues in its annual report to Congress"}, "article_summary": "Screening for breast cancer at what age and what treatment upon diagnosis has become a much debated issue.\nThe report adds that such \"growing disadvantage in women's health has implications not only for women but for their families as well.\"\n\"The Task Force makes evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services to improve the health of all Americans,\" the report says.\nAn independent national board dedicated to improving better health outcomes through evidence based research has called for a focus on women's health beyond gynecological and reproductive issues in its annual report to the U.S. Congress.\n\"However, significant evidence gaps in key areas of women's health limit the full realization of these population health benefits, and limit the Task Force's ability to make definitive, science-based recommendations.\""}
