Scott Peters shared the stage for the first time Tuesday night at a forum that focused mostly on domestic issues and social programs.\n\nOver the course of 70 minutes they discussed their plans to overturn the Affordable Care Act, change immigration policies and modify the Social Security system in an effort to make the case that they\u2019re best equipped to replace two-term incumbent Democrat Scott Peters in the House of Representatives.\n\nTwo of the candidates, small business owner Terry Allvord and university professor Mike Canada, made their campaigns\u2019 debuts. Former Marine and businesswoman Jacquie Atkinson, small-business owner Denise Gitsham and information technology expert John Horst have made appearances prior to the Coronado Women Federated political club\u2019s forum at the Coronado Library.\n\nHealth care\n\nThroughout the evening, the candidates touched on many of the issues that have dominated, and at times, stalled in the House, including aspirations to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy initiative, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCanada said he would do away with the health insurance program, but he didn\u2019t know what alternative should be offered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I can replace it with yet,\u201d he said. But he added that he would like to eliminate penalties people who do not have health insurance pay.\n\nHorst said that he wants Obamacare replaced with six regional, member-owned exchanges that are similar in philosophy to credit unions. Members can pay into their policies and companies can contribute to their employee\u2019s accounts, and the exchanges will then pay for member\u2019s premiums.\n\nAtkinson said she would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act but only on the condition that there were provisions in place that ensures that people who receive insurance under the policy wouldn\u2019t suddenly find themselves without coverage.\n\nGitsham said that \u201cObamacare is a fraud on the taxpayer,\u201d and hits young people the hardest, and has caused their premiums to increase.\n\nAllvord said he wants free health care for everyone from conception until they are 25 years old, and once again after they start collecting Social Security. Between those milestones, they\u2019ll have to buy insurance policies on the open market. The policies will be free of restrictions, caps, and exclude limitations on pre-existing conditions.\n\nDefinition of marriage\n\nWhen polls open for the primary the country will be approaching the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that made state\u2019s bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional while saying that these couples had the right to marry.\n\nIn the wake of that ruling, Gitsham and Horst said the federal government should create a national definition of marriage.\n\n\u201cI believe that marriage is in fact defined through history and throughout our culture as between a man and a woman. That\u2019s what I believe in and that has always been the case, and that shouldn\u2019t be changed or redefined by anybody,\u201d Gitsham said.\n\nGitsham has previously sought support from advocates of same-sex marriage. Last year she received $2,700 from Ted Olson, the attorney that successfully argued that Proposition 8, the statewide initiative that banned same-sex marriage in California, violated the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Olson won on constitutional grounds in 2009 U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and the Supreme Court later upheld the lower court ruling on a standing issue but did not address the constitutionality of same-sex marriage.\n\nGitsham\u2019s campaign manager also said last year that his candidate planned to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization that advocates for LGBT rights.\n\nHorst and Allvord did not explain their positions on a federal definition of marriage; the question posed to candidates did not ask how the federal government should define marriage, but merely if it should define marriage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care, Social Security, immigration focus of forum Page 1 of 2", "og": {"site_name": "The San Diego Union-Tribune", "description": "Health care, Social Security, immigration focus of forum", "title": "Domestic policies focus of congressional forum", "url": "http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/apr/20/health-care-social-security-immigration-focus/", "image": "http://cdn.sandiegouniontrib.com/img/photos/2016/04/20/B8888594Z.1_20160420195745_000GAHGVB49.2-0_tx201.jpg?a7afd4f196cc87f88131a6d97e3ddf50b1644c7d", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 778414772, "app_id": 227086564005280, "pages": 133508396112}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msvalidate.01": "2AF9F2CAA01E4774AB920A8D645E9566", "google-site-verification": "JTkOa1fDuGoZnj1zAjCzaqA-xURAD0upoPOesFaeS3k", "verify-v1": "6ylWgY9aqB0mJpcLJKDC73u2SDU/3xlc3MH+PxXmLRY=", "\u201drobots\u201d": "\u201dnoodp\u201d", "y_key": "f9413f5ffc5479bd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "scott peters, jacquie atkinson, denise gitsham, terry allvord. mike canada, john horst, district 52, san diego politics, candidate forum, social security, immigration"}, "article_summary": "Canada said he would do away with the health insurance program, but he didn\u2019t know what alternative should be offered.\nBut he added that he would like to eliminate penalties people who do not have health insurance pay.\nBetween those milestones, they\u2019ll have to buy insurance policies on the open market.\n\u0097 All five Republicans trying to unseat Rep.
