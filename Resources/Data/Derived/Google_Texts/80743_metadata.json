Mark Twietmeyer of Trinity Lutheran Church unloaded a towering, wooden cross from his pickup truck and plunged it into the frozen shore of the Boulder Reservoir.\n\nWhen the shofar rang out at precisely 6:52 a.m., a crowd of worshippers, huddled in blankets, scarves and hats, had congregated for the annual Easter Sunrise Service. Trinity Lutheran Church has celebrated the holiday this way for the past 21 years.\n\n\u201cThis is such a cool tradition,\u201d said 19-year-old Mae Grigsby, who has attended the service every year since she was a child.\n\nAs Twietmeyer and the Rev. Martin Lettow, a preacher from Shepherd of the Hills Lutheran Church who co-led the service, began their message of hope and faith, the sun started to creep over the horizon. It was radiating light and warmth by the time the congregation had sung the final bars of the first hymn.\n\nArmed against the frigid wind with hot chocolate and extra quilts, many in attendance were honoring an Easter tradition.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the hope to bring more light into my life,\u201d said Petter Hagemark, a Shepherd of the Hills congregation member from Longmont. \u201cIt\u2019s a refreshing break from the norm.\u201d\n\nHagemark has been a part of the Shepherd of the Hills community for more than 20 years. His daughter Gabrielle, who was with him Sunday, spent most Easter mornings growing up worshipping at the reservoir.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s freezing,\u201d 19-year-old Gabrielle said. \u201cBut it\u2019s so nice when the sun comes up.\u201d\n\nThousands of worshippers were snowed out of the Easter Sunrise Service at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, which was canceled in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s blizzard.\n\nLettow said he thought the cancellation would draw more people to Boulder\u2019s small service, but the turnout was lower than in previous years. The 2015 service brought about 150 worshippers. This year, roughly 85 showed up.\n\n\u201cI think the weather psyched people out,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year, Easter was later, and it was a little warmer.\u201d\n\nKay Norby Fial, a 56-year-old Boulder resident, said the icy temperatures almost kept her from coming. But she didn\u2019t regret waking up early when she saw the clear skies and beaming sun.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect day for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis service brings a lot of meaning to the whole day.\u201d\n\nKaty Canada: 303-954-1043, kcanada@denverpost.com or @KatySusanna", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boulder churches honor Easter tradition with 21st sunrise service", "title": "Boulder churches honor Easter tradition with 21st sunrise service", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/27/boulder-churches-honor-easter-tradition-with-21st-sunrise-service/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327__Easter_Helenp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327__Easter_Helenp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-27T10:08:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T05:35:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When the shofar rang out at precisely 6:52 a.m., a crowd of worshippers, huddled in blankets, scarves and hats, had congregated for the annual Easter Sunrise Service.\nTrinity Lutheran Church has celebrated the holiday this way for the past 21 years.\nMark Twietmeyer of Trinity Lutheran Church unloaded a towering, wooden cross from his pickup truck and plunged it into the frozen shore of the Boulder Reservoir.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so nice when the sun comes up.\u201dThousands of worshippers were snowed out of the Easter Sunrise Service at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, which was canceled in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s blizzard.\nMartin Lettow, a preacher from Shepherd of the Hills Lutheran Church who co-led the service, began their message of hope and faith, the sun started to creep over the horizon."}
