In the southern hemisphere that means barbecues and beaches. In the northern hemisphere it\u2019s mulled wine and cozy fireplaces.\n\nBut for all of us, it probably means we\u2019ll be subjected to at least one ranting, fact-free sermon by a Typical Climate Change Denier (TCCD).\n\nYou know the drill. Make an offhand remark about unusual weather, and five seconds later someone\u2019s mouthing off about how the internet says that climate change is a bunch of rubbish.\n\nSo, when you\u2019ve been cornered by your TCCD, what do you do?\n\nAs many have said before, disagreements like this aren\u2019t resolved by barrages of facts and figures. But that doesn\u2019t mean you just have to walk away.\n\nInstead of providing you with yet another series of climate facts and figures (there are plenty of excellent examples of these already) we\u2019ve listed 12 tips, strategies and tactics for you to try out when you next feel inclined to engage a TCCD head on.\n\nGood luck! And remember \u2013 it\u2019s a party, so you know, have fun with it.\n\n1. Pick your audience\n\nMost TCCDs will not change their mind. It\u2019s cheaper \u2013 intellectually and socially \u2013 for them to stand their ground than it is to change their views. Actually, your arguing may even reinforce their beliefs.\n\nBut remember \u2013 you might convince their friends listening in.\n\nMatt Brown/Flickr , CC BY\n\n2. Find some common ground\n\nJust because your TCCD thinks they know better than pretty much all of science, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a bad person. They value things and are probably well-intentioned at heart.\n\nSo try finding out what they care about: democracy or economics, knitting or veggie gardening. You may even have some shared interests. You\u2019ll never get them to change their values, but you might be able to talk about climate change in terms of things they care about.\n\n3. Certainty isn\u2019t the issue\n\nYour TCCD may say we don\u2019t understand the climate change with 100% certainty, so we shouldn\u2019t do anything. They\u2019re right about the first point, but utterly wrong about the second.\n\nClimate science isn\u2019t 100% certain, but neither is medicine, the law, child-rearing or pretty much anything else. We make decisions without certainty every day.\n\nComplete certainty is pretty much never required for action.\n\n4. Talk in terms of risk and inaction\n\nAsk them this: \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, the majority of climate change scientists being wrong but we act anyway, or climate change deniers being wrong and we don\u2019t?\u201d\n\nChallenge them to be specific, to go beyond vague assertions of terribleness or repeating empty tabloid slogans.\n\n\n\n5. Compare the risk to something more tangible\n\nDo they trust doctors? Try saying: \u201cSo, have you ever taken a doctor\u2019s advice, like if they recommended you lose some weight or get that weird growth biopsied?\u201d\n\nDoctors rarely guarantee that bad things will happen if you ignore their advice, but it\u2019s pretty damned risky to gamble that they won\u2019t.\n\n6. Speaking of doctors and second opinions\n\nIt\u2019s not just one opinion here. Research says 97% of climate doctors believe the planet has a bad case of human-induced climate change, and the prognosis isn\u2019t great.\n\nWhile there is likely to be some wiggle room in the exact percentage, it\u2019s fair to say that consensus is very high.\n\nAnd if 97 (or even nine) doctors told you that you had life-threatening but treatable cancer, would you act? Or would you keep looking until you found one doctor who told you not to worry about it, that the cancer isn\u2019t serious, and that it\u2019s all just a medical conspiracy to sell you chemotherapy?\n\n\n\n7. The TCCD with an inkling of scientific knowledge\n\nThis trickster knows not all scientific discoveries were immediately accepted by mainstream science. Plate tectonics and the Earth orbiting the sun leap to mind.\n\nWhile scientific mavericks are few and far between, they do exist. But simply being a maverick doesn\u2019t make anyone right. Most of the time it just makes them wrong.\n\n\n\n8. Wait for them to say 'It\u2019s all a big conspiracy'\n\nSigh.\n\nThere are those who claim climate change is the lab-coat version of the John F Kennedy assassination or the moon landing \u201choax\u201d.\n\nReally?\n\nThe idea of an international conspiracy across dozens of disciplines, hundreds of institutions and thousands of individuals is honestly laughable.\n\nIf the world\u2019s climate scientists were so good at conspiracy, they\u2019d be better off using their astounding Machiavellian skills to rig an election or clean up on the stock market.\n\nAlso, anyone who actually uncovered such a scam would win all of the Nobel prizes at once.\n\n9. Climate scientists are in it for the money\n\nHave you seen the pay scale of a typical research scientist in Australia? Tell the TCCD to go to any university car park and count the luxury vehicles parked near science buildings. They won\u2019t even need all their fingers to keep track.\n\nA related gem is the line that Al Gore and co. are doing this because they invested in renewable energy companies and want to make money.\n\nOkay, what makes more financial sense?\n\ncreate a bogus scare requiring a global conspiracy of academics and scientists and grand appeals for huge amounts of controversial and untested R&D in countries all over the world and then wait for that to gain traction in financial markets and eventually drag in wads of cash. invest money in existing, lucrative and proved enterprises today and cash in right now.\n\n10. Why pick on climate science?\n\nThe odds are they will happily accept \u2013 even applaud \u2013 any science that isn\u2019t climate change related.\n\nAsk them if they accept gravity, nutrition, internal combustion engines or maths? If they say \u201cyes\u201d, probe them on why climate science is different. If they say \u201cno\u201d, back away slowly.\n\nInterestingly, TCCDs often endorse mitigation options that support business-as-usual use of fossil fuels, even while asserting human-induced climate change isn\u2019t happening. That\u2019s a fun little \u201cgotcha\u201d if you\u2019re in the mood.\n\n11. Scientists don\u2019t actually want it to be true\n\nChallenge them to find a single, legitimate source that shows a bona fide climate change scientist who is happy about what they are finding and what their findings mean.\n\nWe\u2019ve been working around such folks for years and have not even heard of one. Seriously, not one.\n\n12. CO2 isn\u2019t a pollutant\n\nThis is another claim touted by TCCDs \u2013 that CO2 itself isn\u2019t inherently poisonous. It\u2019s important for plants so therefore it can\u2019t be bad.\n\nTheir underlying logic is that you can never have too much of a good thing \u2013 ask them if they realize that\u2019s what they\u2019re arguing, then give them your best scornful school teacher stare.\n\nToo much of anything can be dangerous, hence the phrase \u201ctoo much\u201d. You can even be killed by drinking too much water.\n\nNow get back to the BBQ\n\nAnyone who\u2019s challenged a TCCD knows that trying to turn them is usually frustrating and annoying. They are rarely part of the solution and probably never will be.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean challenging them is always futile.\n\nYou can sometimes encounter someone who\u2019s genuinely interested in ground-truthing their position (yes, it does happen). You could also be inspiring nearby party-goers to think more \u2013 or differently \u2013 about the climate situation.\n\nIn the end, every little bit counts. If you have even a small influence in a positive direction, that\u2019s not a bad thing to come out of Christmas drinks. At worst, at least you have an opportunity to hone your debating (and trolling) skills.\n\nCheers and good luck!\n\nWill J Grant, Researcher / Lecturer, Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at Australian National University, owns shares in a science communication consultancy.
