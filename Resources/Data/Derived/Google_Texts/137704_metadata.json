Those deficits have contributed in the total national debt rising from $10.6 trillion in 2009 to more than $18 trillion.\n\nSEE ALSO: Conservative leaders to huddle in bid to coalesce around 2016 candidate: report\n\nMr. Obama also called attention to what he said was the fiscal prudence of former President Clinton, whose wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, embarked on her own presidential campaign this week.\n\n\u201cWhen Bill Clinton was president, the budget got balanced, and we had low deficits,\u201d Mr. Obama said, failing to mention that the books were balanced with the largest tax increase in U.S. history in 1993.\n\nThen Mr. Obama took a shot at his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush.\n\nSEE ALSO: IRS commish: Tax season \u2018better than anticipated\u2019 this year, despite Obamacare horror tales\n\n\u201cThen somebody else came in [after Mr. Clinton], and deficits started going up,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd then I came in and I inherited this huge recession that drove up the deficits.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t mention the $830 billion economic stimulus program of 2009 or the passage of Obamacare in 2010.\n\nThe president said in his current budget battle with congressional Republicans, lawmakers should accept his plan to grant expanded tax breaks for middle-class families that would be paid for by closing tax loopholes on wealthier households.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear a proposal from the House Republicans to reduce what we call the Trust Fund loophole, so that the top one-tenth of one percent are getting a tax break, literally fewer than 6,000 families benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even pay this tax until you\u2019ve got $5.5 million, or $11 million as a couple. You\u2019ve got to have some priorities here.\u201d\n\nThe president said wealthy friends of his such as billionaire Warren Buffett don\u2019t need a tax break.\n\n\u201cHe has too much money to spend \u2014 he can\u2019t spend it all,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWhy would we be giving him a tax break when there are a whole bunch of families who need help? It shouldn\u2019t even be a partisan issue, it\u2019s just a matter of common sense and fairness.\u201d\n\nCory Fritz, a top aide to Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to hold the event on Tax Day was ironic.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama should\u2019ve told Americans the truth about his latest budget plan,\u201d Mr. Fritz said. \u201cThe fact is, despite all the White House spin, even liberals say the president\u2019s proposal will mean higher taxes for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAcross the board, the president\u2019s policies are proving to be a bust for working families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama expressed amazement Wednesday that his opponents portray him as a tax-and-spend liberal, and he also gave a plug for the fiscal responsibility of the Clinton administration.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama expressed amazement Wednesday that his opponents portray him as a tax-and-spend liberal, and he also gave a plug for the fiscal responsibility of the Clinton administration.", "title": "Obama: I\u2019m not a \u2018tax-and-spend\u2019 liberal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/15/obama-im-not-tax-and-spend-liberal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/Obama.JPEG-0ad15.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/Obama.JPEG-0ad15.jpg", "description": "President Obama expressed amazement Wednesday that his opponents portray him as a tax-and-spend liberal, and he also gave a plug for the fiscal responsibility of the Clinton administration.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: I\u2019m not a \u2018tax-and-spend\u2019 liberal"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "President Obama expressed amazement Wednesday that his opponents portray him as a tax-and-spend liberal, and he also gave a plug for the fiscal responsibility of the Clinton administration.\n\u201cHe has too much money to spend \u2014 he can\u2019t spend it all,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nThen Mr. Obama took a shot at his predecessor, Republican George W.
