Council passed a 5.75 percent sales tax on gym memberships and fitness classes Tuesday, despite protest from fitness devotees who dubbed it the \u201cyoga tax.\u201d\n\nThe tax is supposed to partially offset the cost of D.C.\u2019s income tax cuts. Some are skeptical, including mayoral candidate David Catania who proposed an amendment that would expunge the gym tax from D.C.\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a penny-wise and pound-foolish proposition,\u201d Catania said as proponents of the amendment cheered in the chamber, reported the Washington Post. \u201cWe are looking at increased and deferred health costs in the long run.\u201d\n\nCatania\u2019s mayoral rival Muriel Bowser also supported the amendment, as did council member Jack Evans.\n\n\u201cTaxes impact business activity,\u201d Evans said, as reported by DCist. \u201cTo put a tax on fitness is going to hurt business.\u201d\n\nHowever, the tax had its backers, including Ed Lazere, executive director of the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, who pointed out to the Wall Street Journal that other beneficial goods are already taxed.\n\n\u201cIf I went out on the street today and said, \u2018Let\u2019s tax books,\u2019 people would be up in arms,\u201d he told the Journal. \u201cThey would be sending emails saying, \u2018You can\u2019t tax books! Do you want to discourage reading?\u2019 And I\u2019d have to remind them that we already do tax books.\u201d\n\nCurtis Dubay, a tax analyst at The Heritage Foundation, indicated the issue was often misunderstood in debate. \u201cIt is important to remember that this was part of a tax reform package that lowered other taxes and broadened the tax base,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they did was actually good tax policy because they are more broadly applying their sales to services. This wasn\u2019t a specific tax hike on fitness. Those that are saying it is are being disingenuous.\u201d\n\nD.C. mayor Vincent Gray opposes the tax, expressing his disapproval in a letter to Council chairman Phil Mendelson.\n\n\u201cI do not support a tax on healthier living,\u201d Gray wrote. \u201cWhatever modest amount of additional revenue we take in in the short term, we will end up paying far more in the long run if we tax fitness.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Catania\u2019s amendment didn\u2019t garner enough support to pass so D.C. gym-goers can expect the cost of their memberships to rise on October 1. Catania took to Twitter immediately following the vote, claiming that if elected mayor he will repeal the so-called \u201cwellness tax.\u201d\n\nThis article has been modified.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The D.C.
