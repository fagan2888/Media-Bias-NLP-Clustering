Reagan defeated Soviet communism and left us a safer world; Obama presided over the rise and metastasis of the Islamic State and left us a far more dangerous one.\n\nDomestically, Ronald Reagan told the American people: \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are \u2018I\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help.\u2019 \u201d Obama wanted to convince Americans that they were not terrifying. And the way he was going to do it was through the only great liberal legislative achievement of his presidency: Obamacare.\n\nHe failed. Even before he leaves office, Obamacare has begun unraveling.\n\nThe law was passed over the objections of a majority of Americans, it is still opposed by a majority of Americans \u2014 and their opposition has been vindicated. Last week, UnitedHealth Group announced that, after estimated losses of more than $1 billion for 2015 and 2016 under Obamacare, the company was pulling out of most of its ill-fated exchanges.\n\nIn fact, commercial insurers across the country are hemorrhaging money on Obamacare at alarming rates. Health Care Service Corp. (which owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliates in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas) has lost \u201cwell north of $2 billion\u201d in its first two years \u2014 twice as much as UnitedHealth. Highmark, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest Blue Cross plan, lost nearly $600 million in 2015. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina has projected it will lose more than $400 million in the first two years, and the company has said it may leave the exchanges entirely next year.\n\nThe president promised these insurers taxpayer bailouts if they lost money, but Congress in its wisdom passed legislation barring the use of taxpayer dollars to prop up the insurers. Without the bailouts, commercial insurers are being forced to eat their losses \u2014 while more than half of the Obamacare nonprofit insurance cooperatives created under the law failed.\n\nSo what happens now? Because commercial insurers are not going to keep bleeding cash to prop up Obamacare, they have three choices: 1) scale back coverage, 2) raise prices or 3) get out of the exchanges entirely. More and more are going to choose option 3.\n\nDoes this mean that Obamacare is finally entering its \u201cdeath spiral\u201d? Not exactly. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague Scott Gottlieb explains, while commercial insurers are starting to leave Obamacare, they are being replaced by Medicaid health maintenance organizations (HMOs) offering skimpy plans that mirror what they offer in Medicaid \u2014 our nation\u2019s emergency health insurance program for the poorest of the poor.\n\nThis is a catastrophe for people stuck in Obamacare. According to a 2014 McKinsey survey, about three-quarters of those in the exchanges were previously insured on commercial plans, either through their employers or the individual market. They were doing fine without taxpayer-subsidized insurance but were pushed into Obamacare. They now face rising premiums and smaller provider networks \u2014 and as commercial insurers flee, they will increasingly be stuck in horrible, Medicaid-style plans.\n\nThis is not what the president promised when he sold Obamacare to the American people.\n\nThe president promised Obamacare would provide \u201cmore choice, more competition, lower costs.\u201d Instead, Americans have less choice, less competition and higher costs. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, if UnitedHealth \u201cwere to leave the exchange market overall, 1.8 million Marketplace enrollees would be left with two insurers, and another 1.1 million would be left with one insurer.\u201d As more commercial insurers do the same, there will be even less competition \u2014 and higher premiums.\n\nThe president promised \u201cif you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\u201d But commercial insurers who stay in Obamacare are responding to massive losses by narrowing provider networks, with fewer doctors and hospitals to choose from. And those that quit are being replaced by Medicaid HMOs with even less doctor choice.\n\nThe president promised Obamacare would \u201clower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.\u201d But insurers are raising premiums instead to cover the massive losses, and even Marilyn Tavenner \u2014 the former Obama administration official who ran Obamacare \u2014 has predicted premiums will rise even further next year.\n\nAs they do, young, healthy individuals will be priced out of the exchanges \u2014 and the only people who will be able to afford Obamacare will be high-risk patients who qualify for federal subsidies. Without enough healthy people in the exchanges to pay for the sick ones, taxpayers will be stuck with more and more of the costs over time \u2014 a situation that is unsustainable in the long run.\n\nWith Obamacare, Obama wanted to restore America\u2019s faith in big government. Instead, the opposite has happened. Today, 69 percent of Americans say big government is \u201cthe biggest threat to the country in the future\u201d (ahead of big business or big labor). That figure, which is slightly down from 72 percent in 2013, is higher under Obama than it has been since Gallup began asking the question about 50 years ago. Obamacare has done more to discredit big government than 1,000 Reagan speeches ever did.\n\nThat, in the end, will be Obama\u2019s enduring domestic legacy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare has done more to discredit big government than 1,000 Reagan speeches ever did.", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "Obamacare has done more to discredit big government than 1,000 Reagan speeches ever did.", "title": "Obamacare and Obama's legacy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/obamacare_costs_regulation_affordable_care_act_shutterstock_900x557.jpg", "url": "https://www.aei.org/publication/obamacare-disaster-will-be-obamas-enduring-domestic-legacy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Historian David Maraniss notes, in Sunday\u2019s Post, that President Obama came to office with the goal of changing \u201cthe trajectory of America\u201d and leaving \u201ca legacy as a president of consequence,", "title": "Obamacare disaster will be Obama\u2019s enduring domestic legacy", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/obamacare_costs_regulation_affordable_care_act_shutterstock_900x557-242x150.jpg", "creator": "@AEI", "site": "@AEI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=953539392", "article": {"section": "Executive Branch", "tag": "AEI on Campus,healthcare,President Barack Obama,presidential legacy"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The president promised Obamacare would provide \u201cmore choice, more competition, lower costs.\u201d Instead, Americans have less choice, less competition and higher costs.\nIn fact, commercial insurers across the country are hemorrhaging money on Obamacare at alarming rates.\nThis is not what the president promised when he sold Obamacare to the American people.\nWith Obamacare, Obama wanted to restore America\u2019s faith in big government.\nWithout the bailouts, commercial insurers are being forced to eat their losses \u2014 while more than half of the Obamacare nonprofit insurance cooperatives created under the law failed."}
