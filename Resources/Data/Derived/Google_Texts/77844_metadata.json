If you see the logo, it's a spine with a pine tree on an island. This road is an extension of Pine Island Road. All our old patients, come out and see us,\" Rich said.\n\nRich offers services usual to chiropractic practices, have such as adjustments, as well as others. He treats personal injury patients and has a sub-company called Fast CDL Physical, which offers physicals to commercial drivers, one of the few he says that do that.\n\nAnother difference is that he uses an old-school approach, as evidenced by a sign in the office that reads \"No Obamacare, fair cash prices.\"\n\n\"I'll do a service and the fee is $30. You can't beat that. That's what the co-pay is. I'd rather not deal with insurance,\" Rich said. \"What you see is what you get. If you want to get better, this is the place.\"\n\nHe also doesn't spend money on those \"sign-guys\" who stand on the side of the road with a sign to drum up business. He has a \"skunk ape,\" a six-foot tall ape made out of foam that holds a sign.\n\nPine Island Chiropractic is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information or an appointment, call 282-0255.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Shell Factory & Nature Park, Lee County Schools, LCEC, Publix, Bealle\u2019s, LYNX Corporation, Lee County Parks & Recreation, Lee Memorial Hospital, Habitat For Humanity Southwest Florida", "description": "While it\u2019s been a few years since Pine Island Chiropractic has called Pine Island its home, it is very much alive and well and it has just relocated..."}, "article_summary": ",While it's been a few years since Pine Island Chiropractic has called Pine Island its home, it is very much alive and well and it has just relocated to North Fort Myers.\nPine Island Chiropractic is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information or an appointment, call 282-0255.\nCHUCK BALLARO Pine Island Chiropractic on Bayshore Road.\nThis road is an extension of Pine Island Road.\nArticle Photos Dr. Darrel Rich, with his \u201csign guy\u201d the \u201cSkunk Ape\u201d in front of Pine Island Chiropractic on Bayshore Road."}
