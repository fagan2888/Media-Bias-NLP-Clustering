Fox News host Mike Huckabee is claiming the American public should distrust statements made by President Obama and the federal government about the spread of Ebola because they have purportedly lied about the September 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

During the October 4 broadcast of Huckabee, the former Arkansas Republican governor and potential 2016 presidential candidate said that "the Ebola scare goes to the heart of a simple question: do you trust the government. Audience, do you trust the government?" After Huckabee's audience responded no, Huckabee replied: "And why would you? I mean remember these?" He then played clips of Obama talking about health care, the IRS, and then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's Sunday show comments about Benghazi. Huckabee contrasted the remarks with Obama's September 16 statement it was unlikely someone with Ebola would reach America but "we've taken new measures so that we're prepared here at home."

Huckabee concluded his Fox commentary by claiming he's "feeling a little sick myself. But it's not Ebola. I'm just sick of a government that I'm paying for telling me not to worry and just trust them. I wish I could, but if they repeatedly lie to me I just don't believe them anymore."
