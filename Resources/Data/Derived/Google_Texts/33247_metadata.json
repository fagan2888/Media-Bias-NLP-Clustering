Increased funding is available for state projects observing various updated criteria and conditions for such Medicaid eligibility systems.\n\nCMS\u2019 proposed rule modifies the regulatory definition of Medicaid mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems to actively incorporate Medicaid E&E systems. As a result, E&E systems will be associated with the enhanced federal financial participation (FFP), according to the Social Security Act.\n\nCMS additionally proposes to increase the federal matching rate for state E&E systems. Regarding the costs of such systems at a 90 percent federal matching rate for design and development activities, from 50 percent, and a 75 percent federal matching rate, from 50 percent, for maintenance and operations activities, enhanced FFP will be available via specific circumstances. Although the funding increase was initially supposed to expire at the end of this year, CMS proposes to stabilize and extend the aid.\n\nThere are two primary objectives for the supplemental time and additional funding as part of a state\u2019s mechanized claims processing system, according to CMS. First, states will hopefully more easily complete modernized systems. Second, such an initiative supports the structurally evolving elements of Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, and delivery system needs. Additionally, CMS proposes changes to the standards and conditions applicable to the inclusion of E&E systems.\n\nCMS proposes to assist states in permanently implementing and maintaining Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems. According to CMS, 9 states have \u201crelatively new\u201d E&E systems that do not need to be completely replaced. Such systems, however, do require modular improvements and upgrades, says CMS. It is expected these states will continue to implement these needed upgrades, according to CMS. All other states are expected to utilize the funding. As a result of the extended match rates, CMS additionally anticipates 28 states will retire their legacy systems.\n\nTime is of the essence. \u201cWe believe that most states have not had sufficient time to complete the total system replacement for both MAGI and non-MAGI eligibility functionality,\u201d confirms CMS within the proposed rule. \u201cWe assume that an additional 28 states will quickly move forward to retire their legacy E&E systems with ongoing 90 percent FFP for design and development.\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned news follows CMS\u2019 earlier intention to make the aid permanent via a proposal to establish a formal policy. Previously established data within this announcement was not quite accurate, as similar data has been adjusted to reflect vastly different numbers. Earlier estimates confirmed higher rates would cost the federal government over $1 billion between 2011 and 2015. More recent estimates confirm implementation of the proposed regulation will cost $3 billion between 2016 and 2025.\n\nThe push for modernization is real. According to CMS\u2019 proposed rule, \"Without ongoing enhanced federal funding, state Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems are likely to become out of date and would not be able to coordinate with, and further the purposes of, the overall mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems.\"\n\nCMS\u2019 financial contribution of $3 billion will likely help states build and upgrade their Medicaid enrollment systems which will improve the healthcare industry at large.\n\nCMS accepts public commentary on the proposed ruling until mid-June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released a proposed rule to extend access to enhanced federal financial participation for Medicaid E&E systems.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-extends-3b-medicaid-eligibility-and-enrollment-funding", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Cash.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "CMS Extends $3B Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment Funding"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released a proposed rule to extend access to enhanced federal financial participation for Medicaid E&E systems.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Cash.jpg"}, "title": "CMS Extends $3B Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment Funding", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda599\"", "article_summary": "Second, such an initiative supports the structurally evolving elements of Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, and delivery system needs.\nCMS\u2019 proposed rule modifies the regulatory definition of Medicaid mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems to actively incorporate Medicaid E&E systems.\nIncreased funding is available for state projects observing various updated criteria and conditions for such Medicaid eligibility systems.\nCMS proposes to assist states in permanently implementing and maintaining Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems.\nCMS\u2019 financial contribution of $3 billion will likely help states build and upgrade their Medicaid enrollment systems which will improve the healthcare industry at large."}
