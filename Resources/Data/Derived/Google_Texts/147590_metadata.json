Gyro sensors inside the robots allow them to stay upright while moving. At a demonstration in Tokyo, a troupe of 10 of the robots moved around in unison to form circles, squares and heart formations, to the bouncy accompaniment of J-pop music.\n\nThe robots act as a showcase of technologies with applications in devices ranging from digital cameras and cars to energy and health care, said Yuichi Kojima, Murata senior vice president, in an interview.\n\n\u201cThey are small girls, but they show what electronics can do,\u201d he said.\n\nTechnology that prevents the cheerleaders from careening into each other on stage could be used in automotive collision-avoidance systems and other autonomous driving controls, Murata said. Other sensors could be used in so-called wearable technology like the smart watches that mobile phone makers and other technology companies are introducing.\n\nThe robots use ultrasonic microphones and infrared sensors to share their positions. A central control system issues directions based on the signal from the robots, allowing them to dance in unison. Murata, which supplies parts to Apple and other smartphone makers, cooperated with researchers from Kyoto University, in the city where Murata is based, to develop the synchronization technology.\n\nThe balancing technology builds on Murata\u2019s earlier robots: the bicycle-riding Murata Boy, introduced in two versions in 1991 and 2005, and the unicyclist Murata Girl, first showcased in 2008.\n\nMurata Manufacturing Senior Vice President Yuichi Kojima with the Murata Cheerleader. Eric Pfanner/The Wall Street Journal\n\nBy combining a number of different sensor functions in one robot, Mr. Kojima said, the company aims to demonstrate that it is more than just a maker of discrete parts like capacitors\u2013tiny devices that store electronic charges in smartphones and other gadgets. Instead, the company wants to be known as a provider of \u201csolutions\u201d that can package different parts into modules that perform tasks like providing wireless connections in phones.\n\nThe Murata cheerleaders, which are about 36 centimeters, or 14 inches, tall, are not the only new robots on the scene here. Softbank Corp., the Japanese telecommunications giant, plans to make a humanoid robot called Pepper available in stores next year.\n\nBut Murata said it had no plans to sell robots, saying it remained focused on its core business in electrical components.\n\nThough the cheerleaders are intended to show customers the capabilities of the company\u2019s technology, Mr. Kojima said Apple has yet to get a demonstration.\n\nWhile the robots are made of metal and plastic, with hair fashioned from a sponge-like material, the group does have some characteristics that resemble real-life cheerleading squads. There are two backup members, for example.\n\n\u201cIf one gets sick, we can substitute her,\u201d said Koichi Yoshikawa, a spokesman for Murata.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Japanese Company Unveils Cheerleader Robots", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/09/25/japanese-company-unveils-cheerleader-robots/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ES144_Murata_P_20140925010134.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Japanese Company Unveils Cheerleader Robots", "article_section": "World", "author": "Eric Pfanner and John D'Amico", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-09-25T08:15:11-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/09/25/japanese-company-unveils-cheerleader-robots/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-18052", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/09/25/japanese-company-unveils-cheerleader-robots/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ES144_Murata_P_20140925010134.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article", "title": "Japanese Company Unveils Cheerleader Robots"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-18052", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-25T09:51:41-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc12a\"", "article_summary": "The Murata cheerleaders, which are about 36 centimeters, or 14 inches, tall, are not the only new robots on the scene here.\nMurata Manufacturing Senior Vice President Yuichi Kojima with the Murata Cheerleader.\nThe robots, which Murata showed off Thursday, balance on balls to move around and wave plastic pompons in the air.\nYoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty ImagesMurata Manufacturing Co., a Japanese maker of parts for smartphones and other electronics, has introduced what it describes as the world\u2019s first cheerleading robots.\nThe robots act as a showcase of technologies with applications in devices ranging from digital cameras and cars to energy and health care, said Yuichi Kojima, Murata senior vice president, in an interview."}
