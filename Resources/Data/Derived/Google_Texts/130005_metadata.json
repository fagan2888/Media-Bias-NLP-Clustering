A year earlier, a group of Boulder physicians who feared they would be without a hospital purchased a two-story house, with a sweeping verandah, on the northwest corner of Alpine Avenue and Broadway.\n\nNamed Boulder Hospital, the former home of the Hagman family was converted into a 15-bed hospital. Then the physicians deeded it to the community and formed the Boulder Community Hospital Association, but they needed funds for expansion. Citizens rallied to the cause.\n\n\"Hospitals have no holidays, nor can they declare a walk-out,\" the association's campaign chairman said from his office in the Hotel Boulderado. \"The work of healing the sick and alleviating pain is not only of prime importance but never-ending.\"\n\nThanks to successful fund-raising, the house-turned-hospital was enlarged again to accommodate 45 more beds. Another addition was built in 1925.\n\nMost of the doctors were general practitioners, adept at setting broken bones, amputating fingers and toes, delivering babies and treating infectious diseases such as diphtheria, smallpox and typhoid. Many still made house calls. Anesthetics were likely to be morphine, ether or chloroform.\n\nBy 1950, Boulder's population had almost doubled to 19,999, and the hospital was woefully inadequate for the influx of postwar newcomers and the new baby-boomer generation. The construction of an L-shaped wing in 1955 increased the hospital's capacity to 70 beds.\n\nThe standard fee, at the time, for delivering a baby, including prenatal care and a six-week check-up, was $75. An appendectomy was $150.\n\n\"No germ can thrive or be carried where it shouldn't in the new Community Hospital,\" reported the Camera, as its editors sang the praises of modern medicine. Reporters were sent to write stories on meals served on sterilized plates and sealed in stainless-steel containers.\n\nIn 1957, the original part of the hospital (including the Hagman house) was torn down and replaced with a series of remodels. In 1958, the hospital added 37 beds and included its first recovery room for surgery patients, as well as a pediatric isolation section for children with communicable diseases.\n\nThe hospital admitted its 100,000th patient in 1962. Cost of a private room at the time was $22. Another addition was built in 1967, followed by a $3.5 million expansion and modernization programs in 1972 and 1973.\n\nNine decades ago, the hospital's campaign chairman concluded his remarks by saying, \"Boulder's first line of defense is its facilities for the protection of the health of its people.\"\n\nHe'd probably say the same today, but he'd have to raise a lot more money.\n\nSilvia Pettem and Carol Taylor write about history for the Daily Camera.
