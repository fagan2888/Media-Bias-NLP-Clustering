And he began his improbable quest.\n\nSometimes people wait for their rightful moment in history; other times, they seize the moment.\n\nLast week, Webb seized the moment, announcing that he would run for president in 2016.\n\nWebb has never followed any drumbeat but his own, an attribute that soured him on both political parties. Yet it fits perfectly with the populism that drove Democrats out of office earlier this month.\n\nHe uniquely reflects Main Street's frustration with Washington.\n\nHe pushed back on Republicans in 2006, when dissatisfaction with George Bush's handling of the Iraq war led him to run and win \u2014 as a Democrat \u2014 that Senate seat in Virginia. By 2010 he was as dissatisfied as the rest of the country with Barack Obama's presidency and the Democratic Party, and he quickly decided after that year's wave election that he would not seek re-election to the Senate.\n\nIn short, his disconnect with Washington mirrors yours.\n\n\u201cIf he runs, it is probably because he thinks he is going to win,\u201d said Jarding, who served as Webb's senior adviser during the 2006 Senate race. \u201cHe is not a Don Quixote chasing windmills. Odds don't bother him. I think that is what makes him a more interesting candidate.\n\n\u201cThis is someone who believes passionately in what he believes. He is not tied to a talking-point message \u2014 he is authentic, competent, a fighter and, if ever there was somebody who will put a mirror to their soul and ask if this is the right thing to do, it is him.\u201d\n\nAmerica is in the midst of a growing populist movement that crosses parties and has yet to be identified by name or brand.\n\nOther populist movements, such as the Netroots in 2004-06 or the tea party in 2009-10, were hijacked by opportunists seeking to make a buck and to achieve fame off people's sentiments (or by the media, which categorized those movements as extreme in order to drive clicks and viewers). As a result, true believers on both sides were turned off to their movement's original core values.\n\nWebb possesses something that Washington has failed to provide for years at all levels of government: an aura of leadership.\n\nThe latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that nearly 60 percent of Americans believe our political and economic systems are barriers working against them. That alienation crosses all parties, races, ages and professions; whites, blacks, Hispanics, millennials, boomers, white- and blue-collar, high-tech and poor, all are fed up.\n\nThat is not a poll that helps establishment Washington. But it is one in which Webb could shine.\n\nWebb resigned as Ronald Reagan's Navy secretary in 1988 when he disagreed with budget cuts. He has criticized both parties, most recently Democrats; in his announcement, he did not indicate which party's nomination he will seek.\n\nHe brings a unique life experience to the race \u2014 and, if he runs as a Democrat, he gets an early jump as the anti-Hillary candidate, according to Democrat strategist Dane Strother: \u201cAs that candidate he will get more traction than most believe. He even might be able to catch lightning in a bottle.\u201d\n\nEither way, Jarding believes a Webb campaign would be good for American politics, because experts may look at it and say, \u201cWell, there's no path to victory\u201d \u2014 but voters are likely to react to it with interest, not with dismissal.\n\n\u201cThat dialogue is exactly what American politics is longing for and, with that, I don't underestimate his capacity for success,\u201d said Jarding.\n\n\u201cI think the climate is so ripe for a truth-teller, and Webb will give you the honest medicine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In late November 2005, legendary Democrat strategist Steve Jarding sat down with Jim Webb \u2014 author, filmmaker, decorated Vietnam veteran and former U.S. Navy secretary \u2014 to discuss a...", "title": "Reflecting frustration, Webb Eyes Presidency | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/11/23/reflecting_frustration_webb_eyes_presidency_124740.html", "image": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/rcp-home-logo-ss.png", "type": "article", "description": "In late November 2005, legendary Democrat strategist Steve Jarding sat down with Jim Webb \u2014 author, filmmaker, decorated Vietnam veteran and former U.S. Navy secretary \u2014 to discuss a...", "title": "Reflecting frustration, Webb Eyes Presidency | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Reflecting frustration, Webb Eyes Presidency | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Election 2016,Jim Webb,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Webb has never followed any drumbeat but his own, an attribute that soured him on both political parties.\nWebb possesses something that Washington has failed to provide for years at all levels of government: an aura of leadership.\nLast week, Webb seized the moment, announcing that he would run for president in 2016.\n\u201cI think the climate is so ripe for a truth-teller, and Webb will give you the honest medicine.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it, Steve, give me a number,\u201d Webb, frustrated by all the stalling, demanded."}
