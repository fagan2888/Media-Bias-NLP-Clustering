(AP) - Without Alex Olah, Northwestern is going to need a little bit more from the rest of its roster.\n\nOn Sunday, Bryant McIntosh delivered.\n\nMcIntosh scored a career-high 33 points and Northwestern rallied without Olah to beat Loyola Maryland 74-59 for its ninth straight win.\n\nScottie Lindsey added 14 points for the Wildcats (12-1), who set a school record with 13 home wins in a row.\n\nBut the victory was overshadowed by the news that Olah would miss the game with a left foot injury. More than an hour before the game, Northwestern announced the absence of the senior center, who sat on the Wildcats\u2019 bench wearing a walking boot on his left leg.\n\nNorthwestern coach Chris Collins said the team would take it \u201cday by day\u201d with Olah but confirmed he will miss the Wildcats\u2019 Big Ten opener Wednesday at Nebraska.\n\nCollins said Olah was fine after Northwestern\u2019s previous game - a win Monday over Sacred Heart - but felt worse in the ensuing days before getting an MRI on Saturday that revealed what Collins called a \u201cstress reaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll reevaluate after (Wednesday),\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe main thing is we don\u2019t want to do anything that\u2019s going to jeopardize. . We\u2019ve got 18 games left, so if it means we\u2019ve got to hold him out one or two extra games to get him back healthy, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\nOlah is averaging 12.8 points, including a team-high 21 points against Sacred Heart to go over 1,000 points for his career.\n\nWithout Olah, Loyola took a 9-0 lead to start the game before a Lindsey basket with 14:11 remaining gave Northwestern its first points. The Greyhounds led by as many as 14 during the first half.\n\nNorthwestern rallied in the second half and tied it at 42-all with 13:07 remaining on Aaron Falzon\u2019s 3-pointer. The Wildcats took their first lead on a McIntosh basket with 11:44 to play. A McIntosh layup with 7:12 to go pushed the Wildcats\u2019 advantage to 11 during a half when Northwestern switched to a zone defense and shot 65.6 percent from the field.\n\n\u201cThey went zone and we just didn\u2019t have an answer for it,\u201d Loyola coach G.G. Smith said. \u201cI thought the turning point in the game was not that we couldn\u2019t score against the zone - we couldn\u2019t get any stops.\u201d\n\nLoyola (1-10), which lost its eighth straight, was led by Andre Walker\u2019s 15 points and Franz Rassman\u2019s 11.\n\n\u201cBasically, you just can\u2019t get too high on a lead,\u201d Walker said. \u201cA lead is never safe, especially playing a Big Ten team.\u201d\n\nNorthwestern matched the school\u2019s best 13-game start, equaling the 1930-31 season. The Wildcats\u2019 12th regular-season win against non-conference opponents also matched a school mark, tying the 2009-10 team.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to carry that strong play into the conference season without two projected preseason starters. Vic Law hasn\u2019t played and will miss the entire season because of a torn labrum in his left shoulder.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we just talked about how the next guy up has to step up, and we all have to kind of collectively pick up what he brought to the table, which is going to be tough just because he did so much for us,\u201d McIntosh said.\n\n___\n\nTIP-INS\n\nLoyola: Sunday was Loyola\u2019s second game against a team from a power conference this season, following its Dec. 1 loss at Kansas. . The Greyhounds were on the road for the fifth time in six games.\n\nNorthwestern: The Wildcats improved to 2-0 all-time against Loyola. The previous meeting was a 66-60 win on Dec. 27, 2006 at Northwestern.\n\nMAKING THE DECISION\n\nWith Olah out, Northwestern took the redshirt off freshman center Dererk Pardon, who scored six points in 23 minutes. Pardon said he talked to his family about the choice, but it was ultimately his decision to play.\n\n\u201cI felt like I\u2019d let my team down if I didn\u2019t take off the redshirt,\u201d Pardon said. \u201cI wanted to be with those guys and live in this moment.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLoyola Maryland plays Wednesday at home against American.\n\nNorthwestern plays at Nebraska on Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Without Alex Olah, Northwestern is going to need a little bit more from the rest of its roster.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Without Alex Olah, Northwestern is going to need a little bit more from the rest of its roster.", "title": "Northwestern rallies in 2nd half to beat Loyola (Md) 74-59", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/27/northwestern-rallies-in-2nd-half-to-beat-loyola-md/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/27/loyola_md_northwestern_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/27/loyola_md_northwestern_basketball.jpeg", "description": "Without Alex Olah, Northwestern is going to need a little bit more from the rest of its roster.", "card": "summary", "title": "Northwestern rallies in 2nd half to beat Loyola (Md) 74-59"}, "Author": "BRIAN SANDALOW", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "EVANSTON, Ill.
