And when that person is Warren Buffett, the influential chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most successful companies \u2013 people listen no matter what he says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like that, of course. For the first 30 or 40 years of his career Buffett, 84, did not really go out of his way to cultivate a public personality or make political pronouncements that today tend to turn into instant fodder for the media and everyone else. He stuck to his financial knitting.\n\nRelated: Buffett Helps Burger King Avoid \u2018Mythical\u2019 Taxes\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing, observes Lawrence Cunningham, whose new book, Berkshire Beyond Buffett: The Enduring Value of Values plumbs the depths of the $300 billion conglomerate\u2019s corporate culture and the qualities of integrity, autonomy and \u201csense of permanence\u201d that Buffett and vice chair Charlie Munger have developed over the years.\n\n\u201cBerkshire is a gigantic diverse organization with many priorities and issues that have nothing to do with political discourse,\u201d said Cunningham in an interview with The Fiscal Times. \u201cBuffett has had a pulpit for years but didn\u2019t use it, until pretty recently. That\u2019s a wise model to follow. Modesty, reticence and circumspection are appealing traits in leaders. Those qualities allow the person to grow in the job and focus on business operations without distractions.\u201d\n\nCunningham, editor and publisher of The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America since 1997, says all of this is particularly important for succession. Whoever takes over Berkshire when Buffett steps aside \u201cshould begin as Warren did. Over time, as people succeed and mature, they earn the privilege of speaking out. It\u2019s always interesting then to hear them speak their minds and evaluate their positions.\u201d\n\nNot that anyone can easily replace the iconic Buffett. \u201cThe company cannot be replicated and the man cannot be replaced,\u201d Cunningham declares in his book. Yet it\u2019s also a company that \u201cpromises to survive the man\u201d because of its deeply ingrained and highly developed culture.\n\nRelated: Which Big Companies Keep Their Politics a Secret?\n\nNo successor has been publicly identified \u2013 as favorite a guessing game as that\u2019s been among Berkshire aficionados \u2013 but Cunningham emphasizes the well-known tenet that Buffett\u2019s job will be split three ways, into chairman, portfolio manager and chief executive.\n\n\u201cFor chairman, Warren has said publicly he\u2019d like that person to be a member of the Buffett family, and everyone understands that to be a reference to his son, Howard, who\u2019s been on the board since 1994. Howard has been there for 20 years and would primarily sustain the Berkshire culture, and I think he would be very good at that. He gets that.\u201d\n\nThe portfolio manager job may have several candidates, namely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. \u201cThese are two people Berkshire hired as co-managers of the common stock investments\u201d and they\u2019re being groomed, says Cunningham, to take over that part of Buffett\u2019s job, though it\u2019s going to be tough. \u201cIt\u2019s less and less easy to outperform the market.\u201d\n\nRelated: Buffett on the Biggest Money Mistake Parents Make\n\nThe third job of chief executive may be the hardest of all to fill, notes Cunningham. \u201cIt would be hard for even a person who\u2019s smarter than Warren, because he was there at every acquisition. He knows every bit of Berkshire history because he built the whole thing \u2013 no one has that information.\u201d\n\nWhoever will have the new job of overseeing \u201cthis galaxy is at a huge disadvantage compared to him,\u201d says Cunningham. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean someone else can\u2019t do it. But that person will not be able to do it as well as Warren automatically. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with skill sets. The key job will be to appreciate that the structure of the company is deeply autonomous with heavy decentralization, and the person in that job will not be in charge of operational decisions or even strategic decisions for the operating companies, but high-level oversight and a determination of what\u2019s to be done with the capital of each of the subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nBuffett has said that Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Matt Rose, who runs Burlington Northern Sante Fe (BNSF) railway, are \u201cextraordinary managers.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cproven successful managers at great industrial organizations and terrific leaders,\u201d says Cunningham.\n\nBerkshire has not absolutely identified the future leaders for good reason, says Cunningham. It\u2019s to \u201cdiscourage the notion there\u2019s an heir apparent. That\u2019s a business judgment that\u2019s totally fair and respectable. The company doesn\u2019t want to identify a number two. It wouldn\u2019t work at Berkshire. It\u2019s better for them to say, \u2018Look, when and if the time comes, it could be this person, it could be that person.\u2019 Decisions could also change over time depending on circumstances.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When the third richest person", "title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Secret Weapon for Success", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/12/Warren-Buffett-s-Secret-Weapon-Success", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062012_Warren_Buffett_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/12/Warren-Buffett-s-Secret-Weapon-Success", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062012_Warren_Buffett_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "When the third richest person", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf69b\"", "article_summary": "And when that person is Warren Buffett, the influential chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most successful companies \u2013 people listen no matter what he says.\n\u201cIt would be hard for even a person who\u2019s smarter than Warren, because he was there at every acquisition.\nWhoever takes over Berkshire when Buffett steps aside \u201cshould begin as Warren did.\nBut that person will not be able to do it as well as Warren automatically.\nBerkshire has not absolutely identified the future leaders for good reason, says Cunningham."}
