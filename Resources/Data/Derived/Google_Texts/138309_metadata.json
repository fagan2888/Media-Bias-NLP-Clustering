Sorto yearns for the day he can brush his own teeth, shave his own face, and \u2014 like most men \u2014 drink his own beer. Now with the help of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, Sorto is regaining his sense of independence and it all starts with the sip of a beer.\n\n\"I joke around with the guys that I want to be able to drink my own beer \u2014 to be able to take a drink at my own pace, when I want to take a sip out of my beer and to not have to ask somebody to give it to me,\u201d Sorto said in a statement. \u201cI really miss that independence. I think that if it was safe enough, I would really enjoy grooming myself \u2014 shaving, brushing my own teeth. That would be fantastic.\"\n\nThe Caltech researchers and their colleagues from Keck Medicine at the University of Southern California have implanted neural prosthetic devices in Sorto and fellow quadriplegics that allow them to control a robotic limb. While neuroprosthetics have been generally focused on the brain\u2019s movement center, the research team found they were able to achieve more efficient results by activating the area of our brains that controls our intent to move.\n\n\"I was surprised at how easy it was,\" Sorto added. \"I remember just having this out-of-body experience, and I wanted to just run around and high-five everybody.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "paralyzed, man, erik, sorto, takes, sip, his, beer, help, robotic, arm, and, brain, implants", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A paralyzed man was given the chance to sip his own beer, thanks to scientists at Caltech.", "title": "Brain-Operated Robotic Arm Allows Paralyzed Man To Drink Beer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/paralyzed-man-erik-sorto-takes-sip-his-beer-help-robotic-arm-and-brain-implants-334610", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/22/paralyzed-man-erik-soto-takes-sip-his-beer-help-robotic-arm-and-brain-implants.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A paralyzed man was given the chance to sip his own beer, thanks to scientists at Caltech.", "title": "Brain-Operated Robotic Arm Allows Paralyzed Man To Drink Beer [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/paralyzed-man-erik-sorto-takes-sip-his-beer-help-robotic-arm-and-brain-implants-334610", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/22/paralyzed-man-erik-soto-takes-sip-his-beer-help-robotic-arm-and-brain-implants.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/22/paralyzed-man-erik-soto-takes-sip-his-beer-help-robotic-arm-and-brain-implants.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-05-22T10:51:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T10:56:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A paralyzed man was given the chance to sip his own beer, thanks to scientists at Caltech."}, "article_summary": "Sorto yearns for the day he can brush his own teeth, shave his own face, and \u2014 like most men \u2014 drink his own beer.\nNow with the help of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, Sorto is regaining his sense of independence and it all starts with the sip of a beer.\nHaving been paralyzed from the neck down for over a decade ago following a gunshot wound, Erik Sorto has longed for the simple things in life many take for granted.\nI think that if it was safe enough, I would really enjoy grooming myself \u2014 shaving, brushing my own teeth.\n\"I remember just having this out-of-body experience, and I wanted to just run around and high-five everybody.\""}
