Sen. Lamar Alexander (R - Tenn.) accepts an award from The Boy Scouts in Knoxville on March 4, 2016.

(KNOXVILLE) U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., stopped in Knoxville on Friday night to be honored by the Boy Scouts of America. He received the first ever “Alumnus of the Year” award.

After the ceremony, he spoke to the media about the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

He has previously thrown his support behind Marco Rubio, and spoke Friday in thinly veiled comments about Donald Trump’s early lead.

“What I’m looking for is a conservative who can win us the election in November,” he said. “Doesn’t do us any good to nominate someone…someone who can’t win in November.”

He explained his fears that if the GOP nominee doesn’t win this fall, Hillary Clinton would not only win the election, but her nominations would control the Supreme Court and the Affordable Care Act would stay in place.

“I think we’re just a third of the way through the political season, and you don’t have the Super Bowl at the beginning of the season, you have it at the end,” he said.

When asked about the infighting within the party, he said he didn’t like the “mud-wrestling” that has been happening.

“I tuned in to the Republican debate, and I thought I tuned in to the mud wrestling channel,” said Alexander “I don’t like that. I think we want a president who acts like the president of the United States.”

He expressed his support again for Sen. Rubio, though he did mention he thought Gov. John Kasich was doing a good job, and reiterated that he thought the GOP should wait until every state has voted, then make a decision about a nominee.

“You don’t stop the football season a third of the way through, you shouldn’t stop the presidential race a third of the way through,” he said.
