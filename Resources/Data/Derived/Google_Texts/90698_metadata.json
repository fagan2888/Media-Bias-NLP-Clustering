Ted Cruz took a star turn Saturday night at the annual Gridiron dinner.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been thrown out of our Senate lunches, it\u2019s really nice to be invited to dinner,\u201d he said, one of several jokes playing on his status as one of the most despised men in Washington.\n\nHe recalled a showdown during a gun debate, when California Sen. Dianne Feinstein accused him of treating her like a sixth-grader.\n\n\u201cI was accused of acting like some pompous, condescending know-it-all. We\u2019re all familiar with the type, and at Harvard Law School there is even a word for it: alumni,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd then there was that overnight anti-Obamacare talkathon: \u201cTwenty-one hours and 19 minutes \u2026 hearing nothing but my favorite sound,\u201d Cruz said wistfully.\n\nCruz has cultivated an \u201coutsider\u201d image somewhat at odds with the annual gathering of the capital\u2019s political and journalism elite \u2014 a white tie and tails affair that features satirical songs performed by members of the Fourth Estate.\n\nBut with 640 or so Cabinet members, White House aides, diplomats and news media luminaries gathered in their finery, the Gridiron dinner provides a unique opportunity to shape one\u2019s reputation.\n\nCruz, who shows all the signs of someone planning to run for president, arrived with a reputation as an ambitious, unyielding purist, and a brilliant pot-stirrer. Serving as a featured speaker at the gala offered a chance to hit that head-on.\n\nOne year ago, as a freshman with all of two months\u2019 tenure in the Senate, Cruz had already made enough of a splash to merit a joke from President Barack Obama: \u201cIf Ted Cruz calls somebody a communist, then you know he\u2019s in my Cabinet.\u201d\n\nCruz has cemented his place in Washington. He is a force to contend with. Gridiron organizers invited him to represent Republicans at the group\u2019s 129th annual dinner. Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist delivered the Democratic speech, with Secretary of State John Kerry representing the administration.\n\nCruz ribbed the other VIPs.\n\nOn Kerry, he said, \u201cWhat a treat it must be for him to share the dais with one of only three senators who voted against his nomination.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Crist wrote in his memoir that he felt \u201cexcluded and unwanted, rejected by the Republican establishment.\u201d Said Cruz, after pausing for effect: \u201cIt spoke to me.\u201d\n\nCruz also joked about his Canadian dual citizenship.\n\n\u201cFrankly,\u201d he said, the first year in Washington has been so rough, \u201cthere have been moments when I wanted to self-deport.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCanadians are so polite, mild-mannered, modest, unassuming, open-minded. Thank God my family fled that oppressive influence before it could change me.\u201d\n\nThe show devoted an entire number to the Texas freshman: \u201cFlintstone Cowboy,\u201d to the tune of \u201cRhinestone Cowboy.\u201d\n\nI never lost one vote despisin\u2019\n\nWeasel words like \u201ccompromisin\u2019\u201d\n\nThe best baritone in the ensemble (a ringer from the United States Marine Band) played the senator, costumed in an orange Fred Flintstone outfit with oversized cowboy hat. The lyrics spoofed him as a caveman peddling an agenda sure to doom the GOP.\n\n\u2026 And with a load of backward thinkin\u2019\n\nA grand old party buys extinction\u2019\n\nWhile the name of Cruz goes down in pre-history\n\nGridiron president Clark Hoyt joked that Cruz only agreed to spend an evening with the liberal media he so despises because the alternative was worse: \u201cHot yoga with Mitch McConnell\u201d \u2014 the Senate Republican leader for whom Cruz has become a near-constant irritant.\n\nThe opening skit dramatized the infighting between the GOP old guard and tea party insurgents \u2014 depicted as a Downton Abbey wing in top hats and led by Karl Rove, and a Duck Dynasty wing in camouflage led by Rep. Michele Bachmann.\n\nA featured role at the dinner worked for Obama during his brief Senate tenure, and for many other up-and-comers through the decades.\n\nTwo years ago, Gov. Rick Perry \u2014 dusting himself off from his \u201coops\u201d-plagued presidential campaign \u2014 delivered a virtuoso performance of self-deprecation and wit that went a long way to resurrecting his battered image.\n\nSaturday night\u2019s skits ranged across the partisan and geopolitical landscape.\n\nEdward Snowden, the NSA contractor who fled to Moscow after exposing state secrets, was portrayed singing \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee Doodle leaker\u201d dressed as Uncle Sam.\n\nThe troupe, including cable news anchors and leading political columnists, depicted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as a highway worker, in a send-up of the traffic-as-payback scandal that has imperiled his presidential ambitions.\n\nAnother number marveled at Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 survival, despite the bungled rollout of Obamacare: \u201cI\u2019m still standing, though I launched a mess/Holding up the pieces of my job/with no thanks to the press.\u201d\n\nThe wits behind the libretto even scrambled to throw in a skit devoted to the late-breaking crisis in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, in padded Mr. Universe costume, sings a tune from the gay romp La Cage Aux Folles:\n\nI am what I am/I am half czar, half ol\u2019 Joe Stalin. \u2026 Crimea is mine/it\u2019s a no-brainer.\n\nFor him, there was no rebuttal.\n\nFollow Washington Bureau Chief Todd J.
