(Photo: Dan Young/Gannett Wisconsin Medi)\n\nKristi Lenzo always wanted to be a nurse.\n\nAs she completes her clinical training in the neonatal intensive care unit at Ministry Saint Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield, the Mid-State Technical College student looks forward to the day when she is finished with her education and is officially a certified nurse.\n\n\"I really enjoy working in the NICU ... just taking care of people and helping others,\" Lenzo said.\n\nAs a soon-to-be nurse, she is entering a field with abundant job opportunities, experts say.\n\n\"There's growth in all areas of health care,\" said Tony Violetta, director of human resources at BayCare Clinic in Green Bay. \"Within our industry, there's going to be growth within really every aspect.\"\n\nVioletta said a small part of the growth can be attributed to the Affordable Care Act, which has given more people access to health care. More is due to the state's aging population.\n\nSALARY INFORMATION: How much can you make in the health care field? Read down to the bottom to find out!\n\nHe said the state has seen shortages in medical specialists, mostly in primary care. With that comes in a shift in the industry in which people are relying more on mid-level providers like physician assistants and nurse practitioners.\n\nVioletta said the growth that results from increased use of health care services is not only in jobs directly related to patient care. Positions are also available in information technology, finance, marketing and communications.\n\nThe aging population means not only more are using health care in Wisconsin, but more people leaving the field.\n\nSPECIAL SECTION: State of Opportunity\n\n\"A lot of the nurses and other clinical staff are reaching that retirement age and so, we're having to re-infuse our workforce with other professionals,\" said Ben Shuda, recruitment manager for Ministry Health Care, a Catholic health care system with locations throughout Wisconsin. \"We hire for a variety of positions from degreed positions, which require many years of training, licensure and certification to other support departments such as IT or human resources, which may require some amount of education and some amount of certification.\"\n\nSurgical technician Sue Erickson does online training in a surgical suite at the ambulatory surgery center at the Marshfield Clinic on April 29.

More than half of all reported vacancies were for registered nurses.\n\nSteve Rush, vice president of workforce and clinical practice for the Wisconsin Hospital Association, said nurses are the largest number of health care workers in hospitals.\n\n\"Even though the vacancy rate is hovering just under 5 percent, it still accounts for a lot of open positions, because there's a lot of nurses hired,\" Rush said.\n\nTraining for jobs takes place largely in educational programs, experts say. Many jobs that pertain to patient care require academic degrees that vary in the length of the program.\n\n\"There's just about every level,\" Violetta said.\n\nSpecialists can require more than a decade of training, while some nursing degrees take about two years to earn. Many programs also require training in the field.\n\nStudents in the nursing program at Mid-State Technical College, for example, complete clinical work at agencies near the college to get experience in providing care.\n\n\"Students are out on the job working,\" said Sue Akey, a nursing instructor at MSTC. \"That, by itself, just kind of is a capstone, (it) pulls it together. Many of these people are offered jobs or at least encouraged to interview at the same time.\"\n\nThe program prepares students to work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, insurance companies and jails.\n\nWith the numerous positions in the health care field comes a wide range of financial prospects for the different occupations.\n\n\"Compensation pretty much follows how much time is invested in the education, to a large degree,\" Violetta said.\n\nHe said pay for specialists can vary, however, because physicians are in a better position to dictate their work schedule.\n\n\"A doctor who prefers work-life balance over really getting out there and working 70 hours weeks, even if they're in the same specialty, there's going to be a pretty big disparity,\" he said.\n\nScience education\n\nExperts recommend people who are considering health care careers get a good education in science as preparation for the field.\n\n\"Get a good, strong core science education that is applicable to different degrees,\" Rush, a former nursing educator, said. \"You need those strong, core science courses.\"\n\nStudents can also get experience by volunteering or job shadowing in a health care facility.\n\n\"Anything that you can do to expose yourself to the health care industry, whether that be taking health care classes in high school or even volunteering at a hospital or clinic would definitely be helpful to get you jump started into that type of career,\" Shuda said.\n\nWisconsin health care jobs, median salaries\n\nPharmacist \u2014 $126,200\n\nFamily and general practitioners \u2014 $180,290\n\nPhysician assistant \u2014 $91,880\n\nPhysical therapist \u2014 $79,320\n\nRegistered nurse \u2014 $63,260\n\nNurse practitioner \u2014 $89,440\n\nMedical and clinical laboratory technologist \u2014 $56,860\n\nDental hygienist \u2014 $64,180\n\nRadiologic technologist \u2014 $53,520\n\nEmergency medical technician and paramedic \u2014 $28,220\n\nPharmacy technician \u2014 $28,750\n\nMedical records and health information technician \u2014 $35,760\n\nHome health aide \u2014 $22,270\n\nNursing assistant \u2014 $25,770\n\nDental assistant \u2014 $35,380\n\nMedical assistant \u2014 $31,350\n\nSource: Department of Workforce Development\n\nSari Lesk writes for Stevens Point Journal Media.
