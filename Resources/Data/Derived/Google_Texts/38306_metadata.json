Weather-related school cancellations tend to raise anxieties about whether we're a nation of wimps. During President Obama's first winter in Washington, he complained when his daughters' school closed for bad weather: \"We're going to have to apply some flinty Chicago toughness to this town.\" In response to this latest round of school closings, a Virginia mom sighed, \"Hasn\u2019t anyone heard of gloves, scarf and a hat when it\u2019s cold?? Just bundle up\u2014people do it all over the world. We are such wimps to cancel school.\"\n\nA story about a teacher assigned to a one-room schoolhouse in South Dakota in the 1880s will confirm suspicions that America has gone soft when it comes to dealing with the cold. The story is from These Happy Golden Years, the second-to-last book in Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved \"Little House\" series about growing up on the American frontier. It describes the protagonist, a 15-year-old teacher named Laura, traveling a half a mile in the snow to get to school:\n\nThere had been a snowstorm in the night. She had to break her path to the schoolhouse again. The early sunshine was faintly pink on miles of pure snow and every little shadow was thin blue. As Laura plunged and plowed through the soft drifts, she saw Clarence breaking a path for Tommy and Ruby behind him. They floundered to the school-shanty's door at the same time. Little Ruby was covered from head to foot with snow, even her hood and her braids were snowy. Laura brushed her and told her to keep her wraps on until the room was warmer. Clarence put more coal on the fire while Laura shook her own wraps and swept the snow through the cracks between the floorboards. The sunshine streaming through the window made the shanty look warm, but it was colder than outdoors. But soon the good stove's warmth made their breaths invisible; it was nine o'clock, and Laura said, \"School will come to order.\"\n\nThe first thing to point out is that there is no pause between \"There had been a snowstorm in the night\" and \"She had to break her path to the schoolhouse again.\" No moment to wonder whether school would be called off, whether she'd be able to spend the day at home by the fire. School was happening.\n\nAnd then there's the description of the journey itself: Laura and her students didn't have the benefit of snowplows or sidewalk salt to clear their path to school the morning after a storm. They had to break their own ways through untouched snow. And when they arrived at school, what did they find? A room that was even colder than the frigid outdoors.\n\nWhat happened next is equally surprising to a modern reader. Two students came in a few minutes after Laura called class to order. She had to decide whether to penalize them for being tardy:\n\nMartha and Charles came in panting, three minutes late. Laura did not want to mark them tardy; they had to break their path, the whole mile. A few steps in deep snow are easy, and fun, but breaking a path is work that grows harder with every step. For a moment Laura thought of excusing Martha and Charles, this one time. But that would not be honest. No excuse could change the fact; they were tardy. \"I am sorry I must mark you tardy,\" she said. \"But you may come to the stove and get warm before you take your seat.\"\n\nMartha and Charlie were three measly minutes late after walking a whole mile through deep snow. But even these heart-wrenching circumstances weren't enough to turn this young teacher from her commitment to honesty. She marked them tardy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A story from one of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s \"Little House\" books proves we&#39;ve all gone soft.", "author": "Eleanor Barkhorn", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A story from one of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s \"Little House\" books proves we&#39;ve all gone soft.", "title": "School Wasn't Canceled for Bad Weather in 1882", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/Old_Schoolhouse_South_Freeport_ME/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/school-wasnt-canceled-for-bad-weather-in-1882/282913/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2ba\"", "article_summary": "But soon the good stove's warmth made their breaths invisible; it was nine o'clock, and Laura said, \"School will come to order.\"\nDuring President Obama's first winter in Washington, he complained when his daughters' school closed for bad weather: \"We're going to have to apply some flinty Chicago toughness to this town.\"\nLaura did not want to mark them tardy; they had to break their path, the whole mile.\nIn response to this latest round of school closings, a Virginia mom sighed, \"Hasn\u2019t anyone heard of gloves, scarf and a hat when it\u2019s cold??\nMartha and Charlie were three measly minutes late after walking a whole mile through deep snow."}
