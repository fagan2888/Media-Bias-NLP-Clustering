The smiling, cartoon faces of Tampa Bay icons such as Hulk Hogan, Bob Martinez, Pam Iorio and the Gonzmart and Straz families no longer will adorn the walls.\n\n\u201cWe are just heartbroken,\u201d said Gypsy Tweed, a St. Petersburg resident and regular customer at the Palm.\n\nShe and her husband were members of the restaurant chain\u2019s 837 Club, but they did not earn the 15,000 rewards points needed to get their faces on the wall. But, Tweed said, she did get the three-pound lobster for her birthday when the couple went for a goodbye dinner at the Palm on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice place, nice environment,\u201d Tweed said about the restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating that it\u2019s closing.\u201d\n\nThe Palm, part of a national chain of upscale steakhouses, opened at WestShore Plaza in 2001. But more steak and seafood restaurants have moved into the area in recent years, providing stiff competition for the Palm and leading to a decision by the restaurant\u2019s corporate headquarters to pull out of Tampa.\n\nThe original restaurant opened in 1926 in New York City, near the King Features Syndicate on Second Avenue. In exchange for meals, artists would draw portraits on the walls. It became a tradition in all of the 30 Palm restaurants, including two in London and Mexico City.\n\nWhen a new restaurant opens, 200 or so local celebrities are immortalized on the walls, and more go up as time goes on, according to the Palm website.\n\nThe Tampa restaurant had several thousand faces on the walls. Other \u201ccelebrities\u201d who have had their caricatures drawn include Jill and Scott Kelley, Dwight Gooden and The Tampa Tribune\u2019s Steve Otto. Others include George Steinbrenner, Jeb Bush, Will Ferrell and Billy Mays.\n\nRegular customers could get their faces printed on the walls by accruing the required points as a member of the 837 Club by special invitation from the general manager.\n\nThe Palm has been \u201cslammed\u201d during the past week as customers have come to bid farewell to the restaurant and the faces on the walls, said general manager Mark Colbath.\n\nSome came to take photographs with their caricatures, he said. One even brought a professional photographer.\n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s no way to remove the caricatures from the walls without damaging the plaster, he said, and he needs to leave the building in good shape. There\u2019s no word on what will replace the Palm.\n\n\u201cI wish I had this business every week,\u201d Colbath said. \u201cThe restaurant wouldn\u2019t be closing.\u201d\n\nEbehrman@Tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7691\n\nTwitter: @LizBehrmanTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 23 Mar 2014 13:31:53 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 A little piece of local history soon will be erased.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A little piece of local history soon will be erased.", "title": "Hundreds of celebrity caricatures to disappear as Palm closes", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/south-tampa/hundreds-of-celebrity-caricatures-to-disappear-as-palm-closes-20140323/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140323/ARTICLE/140329670/AR/0/AR-140329670.jpg", "height": 445}, "updated_time": "2014-03-23T13:52:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A little piece of local history soon will be erased.", "title": "Hundreds of celebrity caricatures to disappear as Palm closes", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140323/ARTICLE/140329670/AR/0/AR-140329670.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-23T13:31:53Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-23T13:52:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0974\"", "article_summary": "After the Palm restaurant closes Monday, the walls of the steakhouse \u2014 famous for the colorful caricatures of celebrities and loyal customers \u2014 will be repainted.\nIt became a tradition in all of the 30 Palm restaurants, including two in London and Mexico City.\n\u201cWe are just heartbroken,\u201d said Gypsy Tweed, a St. Petersburg resident and regular customer at the Palm.\nOther \u201ccelebrities\u201d who have had their caricatures drawn include Jill and Scott Kelley, Dwight Gooden and The Tampa Tribune\u2019s Steve Otto.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating that it\u2019s closing.\u201dThe Palm, part of a national chain of upscale steakhouses, opened at WestShore Plaza in 2001."}
