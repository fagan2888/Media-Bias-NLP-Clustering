The fact that most are being upheld is a good sign that the industry is doing a reasonably good job with utilization review, but the frictional costs associated with (utilization review) have been a little more than we expected.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking during the California Workers' Compensation & Risk Conference in Dana Point, California, last week, Dawn Watkins, Los Angeles-based director of integrated disability management at the Los Angeles Unified School District, said the school district has felt the effect of the new workers comp law in several ways.\n\n\u201cEven though I represent an employer, we are happy to see the increase in benefits for injured workers. We want them to have the benefits that they need,\u201d Ms. Watkins said. \u201cFor us, (utilization review) has worked.\u201d\n\nInitially following last year's new law, litigation from claimant attorneys representing aggrieved workers \u201cdropped like a rock,\u201d Ms. Watkins said. While litigation now is climbing again, it's \u201cnot at the rates we saw before,\u201d she said.\n\nKevin Confetti, San Francisco-based director of workers compensation systems and operations and employment practices liability at the University of California, said it's too soon to tell the true outcome of the legislation, noting that some of the law's more controversial aspects likely will be tested in court.\n\n\u201cWorkers compensation reform is long-tail in California and it's always been that way,\u201d Mr. Confetti said. \u201cI think the ultimate result of the cost savings from (the independent medical review) process is in the future. So for me, the jury is still out.\u201d\n\nIrrespective of its long-term fate, last year's law has new penalties about which employers need to be aware, said Edward Canavan, Los Angeles-based vice president of workers compensation practice and compliance at Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc.\n\nFor example, the law mandates that medical provider networks hire medical access assistants, and if a medical access assistant fails to respond to an injured worker's query in one business day, an employer can be fined.\n\n\u201cYou have to make sure that your medical access assistant is really engaged,\u201d Mr. Canavan said. \u201cThere are a lot of serious penalties here.\u201d\n\nWhile the law's impact on the workers compensation market is direct, effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are largely indirect.\n\nMore people gaining access to health insurance under ACA may exacerbate the doctor shortage already affecting the workers compensation market, said Kimberly George, Chicago-based senior vice president and senior health care adviser at Sedgwick.\n\n\u201cThe ACA was designed to address access,\u201d Ms. George said. \u201cWhat does that mean for workers compensations in terms of the physician, nurse practitioner and physician assistant population? Will there be enough providers to treat our patient population?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "DANA POINT, Calif. \u2014 Legislative actions at the state and federal level will continue to define the California workers compensation market for years to come, according to experts monitoring the effect of recent workers comp reforms in the state.In California, the enactment of Senate Bill 863...", "title": "2013 California workers comp reforms will define market for years to come - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20140914/NEWS08/309149978", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "DANA POINT, Calif. \u2014 Legislative actions at the state and federal level will continue to define the California workers compensation market for years to come, according to experts monitoring the effect of recent workers comp reforms in the state.In California, the enactment of Senate Bill 863...", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "2013 California workers comp reforms will define market for years to come - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2324\"", "article_summary": "DANA POINT, Calif. \u2014 Legislative actions at the state and federal level will continue to define the California workers compensation market for years to come, according to experts monitoring the effect of recent workers comp reforms in the state.\n\u201cI think the ultimate result of the cost savings from (the independent medical review) process is in the future.\nIndependent medical review \u201chas been a little different than we expected,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWorkers compensation reform is long-tail in California and it's always been that way,\u201d Mr. Confetti said.\n\u201cThere are a lot of serious penalties here.\u201dWhile the law's impact on the workers compensation market is direct, effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are largely indirect."}
