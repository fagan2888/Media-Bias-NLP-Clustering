A Utah woman was arrested on murder charges on Sunday after the police discovered the bodies of seven babies stuffed in cardboard boxes in the garage of her former home.

The woman, Megan Huntsman, 39, who lived in the Utah home until three years ago, gave birth to the babies between 1996 and 2006, investigators believe.

Officers responded to a call Saturday from Ms. Huntsman’s estranged husband about a dead infant at the home in Pleasant Grove, 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, said Capt. Michael Roberts of the Pleasant Grove police. The officers discovered the six other bodies.

Captain Roberts declined to comment on a motive or on what Ms. Huntsman said during an interview with investigators. He said that the estranged husband, whose name was not released, lived with Ms. Huntsman when the babies were born but was not considered a person of interest.

“We don’t believe he had any knowledge of the situation,” Captain Roberts said. Asked how the husband could not have known about the bodies if he lived in the house, he replied, “That’s the million-dollar question. Amazing.”

The bodies were sent to the Utah medical examiner’s office for tests, including one to determine the cause of death. DNA samples taken from Ms. Huntsman and her husband were expected to determine whether the two were the parents, as investigators believe.

The house, in a middle-class neighborhood, is owned by the husband’s parents, and the man was cleaning out the garage when he made the discovery.
