If you were Henry or Clement Studebaker, you would create an empire that would last more than 115 years.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 1852, with that small startup capital, the two Studebaker brothers opened H & C Studebaker, a blacksmith shop, in South Bend. It was located on what is now the corner of Michigan Street and Jefferson Boulevard.\n\nOriginally from Pinetown, Pa., young Clement learned the blacksmithing trade in the shop of his father, a German immigrant. Henry and Clement\u2019s company started out small, with the brothers shoeing horses and making metal parts for wagons.\n\nThe 1850s were the peak of the California Gold Rush, and in 1853, younger brother J. M. Studebaker went west in search of his fortune. While he didn\u2019t find any gold, John did save up a good amount through his skill as a wagon maker. When he returned to South Bend five years later, he bought out Henry\u2019s share of the company and used his savings to expand the business.\n\nAnother brother, Peter Studebaker, worked as a merchant in Goshen, and by 1860, he had opened the company\u2019s first \u201cshowroom.\u201d Jacob, the final Studebaker brother, joined the family business shortly after, and in 1868, Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Co. was formed.\n\nEmerging from humble beginnings, the company became the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of farm wagons and horse-drawn buggies. It didn\u2019t stop there, though, becoming the only carriage company to transition successfully to the automobile business.\n\nThe earliest Studebaker automobiles were electric, debuting in 1902. The company\u2019s first gasoline model was available in 1904. For almost a decade, the company continued to manufacture horse-drawn carriages as well as electric- and gasoline-powered automobiles.\n\nIn 1911, the Studebaker Corp., as it was then known, stopped building electric cars, and in 1920, production of horse-drawn vehicles also ceased. Iconic cars such as the Champion, Gold Hawk and Avanti rolled off the assembly line until Studebaker ceased U.S. production in 1963.\n\nTo learn more about the Studebaker company or family, visit the Studebaker National Museum.\n\nIf you would like to donate photographs of South Bend\u2019s automotive history or will allow a digital copy of your image to be made, contact The History Museum at 574-235-9664 or the Studebaker National Museum at 574-235-9714.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "What could you accomplish with $68 to your name?
