(Photo: Nathan Phelps/Press-Gazette Media)Buy Photo\n\nMy son Alex and I were invited to go to the Packers/Bears game by my daughter's longtime Green Bay fan boyfriend, Jason. Neither my son nor I have ever been in Green Bay, so we looked forward to it with some apprehension as we know how Green Bay fans are treated here in Chicago.\n\nThree blocks from the stadium I twisted my back and had trouble walking. Luckily Alex and Jason are two big guys, each grabbing one of my arms and helping me the rest of the way. Upon entering the stadium an employee saw I was having trouble and hurried over to me with a much welcome wheelchair. He pushed me onto an elevator in my Bears jersey and hat.\n\nThere was another man in a wheelchair, that he appeared to need daily, dressed in his Packers jersey and hat. I asked, how you doing? He said better than you, I am a Packers fan. Everyone on the elevator laughed the whole ride.\n\nI was wheeled as close as possible to my seat. where I had to take one step at a time. We were eight rows up on the 30-yard line behind the Bears. All the way down, Packers fans offered me their arms and hands to help me to my seat. As there are no backs to the seats, I had trouble sitting up straight. Not two minutes into the game a Packers fan gave me the chair that hooks on to the seat.\n\nI don't think I have ever seen such kindness at any sporting event, and there was no doubt I was a Bears fan. I want to thank everyone in Green Bay for their kindness, even the next day. I will be sure to tell everyone I know this story. It made a painful day, in more ways than one, a day to remember in human kindness.\n\nVince Slisz, Orland Park, IL\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1qQ0k5i", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I don't think I have ever seen such kindness at any sporting event", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "I don't think I have ever seen such kindness at any sporting event", "title": "Bears fan treated with grace at Lambeau", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/11/22/bears-fan-treated-grace-lambeau/19414973/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I don't think I have ever seen such kindness at any sporting event", "title": "Bears fan treated with grace at Lambeau", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b4c2f7dba502368c31e7ec7de55d79069902d3b6/c=200-0-1130-930&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/11/22/B9315228362Z.1_20141122174438_000+G8M964L68.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd26a\"", "article_summary": "Neither my son nor I have ever been in Green Bay, so we looked forward to it with some apprehension as we know how Green Bay fans are treated here in Chicago.\nI don't think I have ever seen such kindness at any sporting event, and there was no doubt I was a Bears fan.\nBuy Photo A group of Chicago Bears fans wearing team-themed wrestling masks walks around the Lambeau Field parking lot before the game.\nNot two minutes into the game a Packers fan gave me the chair that hooks on to the seat.\n(Photo: Nathan Phelps/Press-Gazette Media)Buy PhotoMy son Alex and I were invited to go to the Packers/Bears game by my daughter's longtime Green Bay fan boyfriend, Jason."}
