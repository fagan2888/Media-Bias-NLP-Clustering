The state\u2019s Department of Health Care Services and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), described it as a way to \u201chelp those eligible receive coordinated medical, behavioral health, and long-term institutional, and home-and community-based services through a single organized delivery system.\u201d\n\nMore than 450,000 senior adults and disabled residents from eight counties who are covered under both Medicare and Medi-Cal, known as dual eligibles, will receive or already have been informed about the transition. More than 200,000 Los Angeles County residents have been targeted for the transition, and enrollment is set to begin on July 1. Those who live in San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties will begin their transition on May 1.\n\nBut several groups, including the Los Angeles County Medical Association, the Los Angeles Podiatric Medical Society and at least six other nonprofit organizations, have voiced their concern to the state, saying the notices sent to those who are eligible are inadequate and confusing, and there are no forms that clearly give patients the right to opt out.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the materials sent out, it requires a high level of reading skill to recognize you have an option,\u201d said Dr. Marshall Morgan, president of the Los Angeles County Medical Association.\n\n\u201cThey need to make the opt-out issue very clear,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cA lot of these people are not in the position to understand they have the ability to stay with their doctors and providers. A lot of people are going to be passively moved into this new system. On the one hand, the patients won\u2019t be able to access the doctors they are seeing. On the other hand, doctors and podiatrists will be unable to take care of those patients, and it will be an emotional financial blow to both of them.\u201d\n\nMorgan and others said they also are concerned with the staggered way the program is starting. Enrollments were set to begin on April 1 in all eight counties. But there have been some bumps along the way. In Los Angeles, L.A. Care was unable to take some patients because of an issue with Medicare, according to a document on the Cal MediConnect site. The start date was pushed back to July 1.\n\nOfficials from the California Department of Health Care Services said integrating Medicare and Medi-Cal for dual eligibles has long been a goal of the medical community and the program is ready to go everywhere except in Orange County. But DHCS officials also acknowledged they have received letters of concern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe continue to work with stakeholders, counties, and health plans to improve the managed care enrollment process for members,\u201d DHCS said in a written statement. \u201cWe will use the valuable information we gain from meeting with these parties to ensure all members have the necessary information they need to make the right decision for their integrated care.\u201d\n\nThe statement also referred to an opt-out form that would be included with the letters.\n\nIn February, six groups \u2014 California Health Advocates, Disability Rights California, Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, National Health Law Program, National Senior Citizens Law Center and the Western Center on Law and Poverty, sent a letter to the state saying the program should be postponed until the letters and forms are changed, and the process refined.\n\n\u201cPushing forward in the face of inadequate notices and enrollment systems and an unprepared call center deprives beneficiaries of the right to make an informed choice and meaningfully participate in their healthcare, one of the main goals of the Coordinated Care Initiative,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nOther concerns remain, including the scope of the project.\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be a demonstration project to see if it will work,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Halperin, president of the Los Angeles Podiatric Medical Society. Halperin cares for patients with diabetes and circulation problems. Disruption in their care means ulcers and wounds could fester, resulting in amputation.\n\n\u201cThey were only supposed to try this with a small fraction of people, but it\u2019s basically throwing the majority of the dual eligible overboard without knowing the outcome,\u201d Halperin said. \u201cWho did they pick on? The most vulnerable of patients. They are the ones who have been financially fragile.\u201d\n\nOne of Halperin\u2019s patients, Maria Morales, said her experience with changing insurers illustrates how her quality of care has changed. A former dual eligible, Morales said she suffers from diabetes and arthritis, and had been happy with her doctors when she had Medi-Cal and Medicaid. But a woman representing an insurance company who came to Morales\u2019 apartment complex last year where many seniors reside, told them they had to replace Medi-Cal with a health plan as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI asked her, \u2018Will I keep my doctors?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes, nothing will change, you will keep your doctors\u2019,\u201d Morales, 77, of Los Angeles said. \u201cBut instead, I was sent to clinics very far away. I had such magnificent doctors and then they sent me off to doctors who didn\u2019t know me or my case.\u201d\n\nOne of the newer doctors diagnosed Morales with a tumor in her uterus, but Morales said there have been no examinations or surgeries planned.\n\n\u201cNow (the insurer) is sending me bills and letters charging me and I don\u2019t understand what they want,\u201d Morales said. \u201cI not only feel sick. But I feel angry. I\u2019m stressed. Who knew that such a thing could happen?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of elderly and disabled Californians will be pushed into managed health care plans soon under a state pilot project, but doctors\u2019 groups and patient advocates have found a number of problems with the program that could threaten care f", "title": "More than 200,000 Los Angeles County residents to be forced into managed health care", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20140316/more-than-200000-los-angeles-county-residents-to-be-forced-into-managed-health-care", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140316/NEWS/140319549/AR/0/AR-140319549.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "999px"}, "type": "article", "title": "More than 200,000 Los Angeles County residents to be forced into managed health care"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Thousands of elderly and disabled Californians will be pushed into managed health care plans soon under a state pilot project, but doctors\u2019 groups and patient advocates have found a number of problems with the program that could threaten care f", "title": "More than 200,000 Los Angeles County residents to be forced into managed health care", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20140316/more-than-200000-los-angeles-county-residents-to-be-forced-into-managed-health-care", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140316/NEWS/140319549/AR/0/AR-140319549.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Health News, Breaking teaking Health, LA Daily News Top Story", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Health News, Breaking teaking Health, LA Daily News Top Story"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01a7\"", "article_summary": "More than 200,000 Los Angeles County residents have been targeted for the transition, and enrollment is set to begin on July 1.\n\u201cI asked her, \u2018Will I keep my doctors?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes, nothing will change, you will keep your doctors\u2019,\u201d Morales, 77, of Los Angeles said.\nIn Los Angeles, L.A.
