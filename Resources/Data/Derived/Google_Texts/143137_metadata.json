That\u2019s less than a third of the OECD men\u2019s average of 141 minutes a day.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s neighbors China and Japan also ranked near the bottom.\n\nBreaking down the numbers, South Korean men spend just 21 minutes on chores and 10 minutes on child care each day. Travel and shopping accounted for the rest of the time.\n\nCompare that to Danish men, who topped the list in terms of gender egalitarianism, spending just over three hours a day on housework and childcare, followed by Norwegian and Australian men. (Denmark, incidentally, has a birthrate so low that it\u2019s taken to incentivizing people to have sex while on vacation.)\n\nAmerican men also fall short of the OECD average, spending 82 minutes a day on chores and 19 minutes on childcare. The average woman across OECD nations does 273 minutes of unpaid work every day.\n\nBut before you get riled up against male sloth, consider that South Korean men also work some of the longest paid hours in the OECD. Each day they spend 422 minutes in \u201cpaid work or study,\u201d which includes the developed world\u2019s hardest average commute: 74 minutes. The only groups clocking more time in paid work or study are Mexican men (468 minutes) and Japan\u2019s long-suffering salary men (471 minutes).\n\nThe developed world paid work average is 325 minutes per day for men and 212 for women. That means Korean men clock about twice as much time in paid work as the average woman, and nearly 100 minutes more than the average man in OECD nations.\n\n\u201cI get home from work at midnight, and I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t even figure out how to do the chores,\u201d laments Yoon Jung Hyun, 50, a retired soldier who works two jobs every day as a bus driver and restaurant server. \u201cMy wife understands, and she works shorter hours and handles the housework. What else are we supposed to do in this situation?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study shows men in South Korea spend just 45 minutes on household chores", "title": "The developed world\u2019s least helpful husbands", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new study shows men in South Korea spend just 45 minutes on household chores", "title": "The developed world\u2019s least helpful husbands", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/06/what_country_has_the_worlds_most_lazy_husband_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/shutterstock_181136801.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study shows men in South Korea spend just 45 minutes on household chores", "title": "The developed world\u2019s least helpful husbands", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/shutterstock_181136801.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Geoffrey Cain", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Asia, chores, Gender Inequality, GlobalPost, Housework, South Korea", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6050\"", "article_summary": "Each day they spend 422 minutes in \u201cpaid work or study,\u201d which includes the developed world\u2019s hardest average commute: 74 minutes.\nThe developed world paid work average is 325 minutes per day for men and 212 for women.\nBreaking down the numbers, South Korean men spend just 21 minutes on chores and 10 minutes on child care each day.\nTake comfort from South Korean wives, who have it worse.\nThe only groups clocking more time in paid work or study are Mexican men (468 minutes) and Japan\u2019s long-suffering salary men (471 minutes)."}
