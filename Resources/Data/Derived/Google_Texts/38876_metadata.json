Now employees record time worked using biometric time clocks and computer apps; jobseekers log on to the company website to apply for employment; and the use of web portals is prevalent.\n\nWhile technology remains the biggest change over the years, Ceci Miles Mulvihill, the company\u2019s president and CEO, says keeping up with regulations and compliance issues is a constant challenge.\n\nLately, the Affordable Care Act \u2013 also known as the ACA or Obamacare \u2013 has been a major focus for RMPersonnel, along with making sure temporary employees have access to health insurance.\n\nBecause the rules for Obamacare differ depending on how many employees a company has, RMPersonnel decided to create a separate holding company, RMP Temps, that would allow a different health plan for temporary employees.\n\nThen there are the recent changes for how regulations from OSHA \u2013 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \u2013 are applied to the temp industry. Temp companies like RMP are now considered just as responsible for on-the-job injuries as the client where workers are assigned.\n\n\u201cWhen an employee gets hurt, they look at both of us to ensure that employee has a safe working environment,\u201d Mulvihill says. \u201cWe had to inform our clients of the change and work with them to provide a comprehensive safety program.\u201d\n\nOne of RMPersonnel\u2019s clients says their focus on safety has been beneficial to their clients.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re strong on safety-related issues and make sure our environment is safe for all of our employees,\u201d says Sergio Casta\u00f1eda, operations manager for Halla-Visteon Climate Group.\n\nSince its founding in 1990, RMPersonnel has grown from $10 million in revenue to $35 million, Mulvihill said, with more than 1,200 temp employees working in El Paso and Laredo on any given day. More than 150 employers contract with RMP for either temp services or PEO \u2013 professional employer organization to manage their entire HR duties \u2013 or both.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about hard work, showing up and learning from your failures,\u201d says Mulvihill, the company\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nShe credits RMPersonnel\u2019s steady growth to the solid business reputation established over the years and the Miles name. Referrals and word of mouth drew clients to the business, many from the maquila industry and relationships established by her father, Rudolph Miles, through his successful customs brokerage business.\n\nMiles launched RMPersonnel in 1990. Over the years, he transferred control to Mulvihill and her four sisters. Today, Mulvihill and one sister own interests in the business.\n\nInitially, Mulvihill\u2019s experience with what\u2019s called a PEO was limited. A PEO shares responsibility for a client\u2019s employees, becoming their employer of record for tax and insurance purposes.\n\nShe had worked in the family business at a young age and got a taste of human resources working at the Popular Department Store while in college.\n\nBut her first professional job was teaching fourth and fifth grade at Crockett Elementary. She left the classroom to have a baby and never returned, realizing the business world was her true calling.\n\n\u201cMy passion has been finding employment solutions for clients,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen RMPersonnel opened in 1990, the company offered clients the PEO service, which includes payroll, workers comp, employment taxes, HR, benefits and all levels of staffing assistance. Later, they ventured into the temporary business as clients increasingly asked for short-term employment services.\n\n\u201cWith PEOs, you are the back office,\u201d she says. \u201cWe save them time on employment issues so it allows clients to grow their business and not have to worry about those issues. They normally do not have HR departments, so we become that.\u201d\n\nHalla-Visteon Climate Group has been using RMPersonnel\u2019s services for more than two decades.\n\n\u201cWhen you have someone taking care of the personnel issues, you can focus on productivity,\u201d Casta\u00f1eda says. \u201cRMPersonnel has helped us maintain costs and stay at a competitive level.\u201d\n\nMulvihill says RMPersonnel\u2019s strengths come from the longevity of its 33 employees and a company culture that relies on teamwork and professionalism.\n\nThe company has three locations: its headquarters on Montana at Raynolds, a satellite office on Doniphan Drive and another in Laredo. Mulvihill\u2019s daughter, Amber Vargas, is operations manager.\n\n\u201cOur employees have great energy,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are so fortunate to have employees who are always looking out for the best interest of the client.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead 25 years, Mulvihill expects RMPersonnel to grow into other Texas cities.\n\n\u201cI foresee that the biggest percentage of our business will come from the warehousing and distribution centers, as well as manufacturing plants,\u201d she says. \u201cThis has been our mainstay for the first 25 years and, most likely, will continue to dominate our client base. However, I also foresee expansion into other fields that are more clerical in nature, such as providing staffing for medical offices and retail.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "From how employees log the hours they work to how they apply for jobs, RMPersonnel has seen many changes in its 25 years in business.", "title": "25 years of personnel issues, more changes ahead", "url": "http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_c69aa16e-2f00-11e5-81f8-27f77b7556b7.html", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/48/048e9106-2f01-11e5-8c36-dbb79ac077ea/55ad298046543.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "From how employees log the hours they work to how they apply for jobs, RMPersonnel has seen many changes in its 25 years in business.", "fb": {"app_id": 172555339466240}, "keywords": "local_news", "news_keywords": "local_news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4ed\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe save them time on employment issues so it allows clients to grow their business and not have to worry about those issues.\nA PEO shares responsibility for a client\u2019s employees, becoming their employer of record for tax and insurance purposes.\nFrom how employees log the hours they work to how they apply for jobs, RMPersonnel has seen many changes in its 25 years in business.\n\u201cWhen you have someone taking care of the personnel issues, you can focus on productivity,\u201d Casta\u00f1eda says.\n\u201cWe had to inform our clients of the change and work with them to provide a comprehensive safety program.\u201dOne of RMPersonnel\u2019s clients says their focus on safety has been beneficial to their clients."}
