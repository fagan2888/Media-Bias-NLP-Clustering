It\u2019s very important to use birth control correctly or it could result in injury or worse, pregnancy.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for women to reconsider the method of birth control they are using or will choose to use.\n\nAs many women hurriedly jump to use the pill, there are other options available, other methods just as, if not more, effective and with less maintenance.\n\nA birth control method that works more than 99 percent of the time is making a comeback after disappearing from America in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe intrauterine device, better known as the IUD, was the contraceptive of choice for 6.4 percent of American women aged 15-44 from 2011 to 2013, according to a report published Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe IUD is a small, T-shaped device implanted in the uterus. It\u2019s not as popular as the other contraceptives offered for women such as the pill or condom, but it\u2019s definitely returning as one of women\u2019s top choices, increasing 83 percent, according to the aforementioned report.\n\nIUD use is just easier.\n\nThere\u2019s no certain time of day that it needs to be taken and it\u2019s pain-free. With this contraceptive there\u2019s virtually no maintenance, allowing women to forget about it and carry on with their daily routines.\n\nThe IUD gives women the protection they need during the time they probably need it most.\n\nThose who are on the pill have to commit to taking it each day at the same time or they\u2019ll compromise the protective agent in the pill.\n\nIt sucks having to remember to do this one little but extremely important thing each and every day. Women are bound to forget at least once and that\u2019s not safe.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that health insurance cover all types of birth control at no cost is expected to accelerate adoption of IUDs.\n\nThe price for an IUD implantation is more than $1,000, which is a possible reason why many women opt out of using this method of birth control. But it\u2019s worth every penny if it means preventing an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nThe IUD is almost as effective as sterilization, but it\u2019s not permanent. After having the device implanted while in a physician\u2019s office, a woman doesn\u2019t have to take any further actions to prevent pregnancy throughout the 3-to-10-year lifespan of the IUD.\n\nThis is ideal because now the woman doesn\u2019t have to worry about any complications and there is always the option of having it removed, if one chooses to do so.\n\nThe device fails less than one percent of the time, compared to nine percent for the pill, 18 percent for male condoms and 24 percent for the rhythm method, CDC data shows.\n\nIt\u2019s time for ladies to think about their other options when it comes to birth control.\n\nThere is a better way to prevent pregnancy without committing to the pill every day.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.dailytitan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4253230816_0e36b94e44_z-100x60.jpg", "description": "Fifty-one percent of pregnancies are unplanned and 95 percent of those pregnancies result from not using or misusing birth control, like forgetting to take the pill every day at the [\u2026]", "title": "IUD prevents pregnancy and is a better alternative than the pill"}, "description": "Fifty-one percent of pregnancies are unplanned and 95 percent of those pregnancies result from not using or misusing birth control, like forgetting to take the pill every day at the [\u2026]", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd919\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s very important to use birth control correctly or it could result in injury or worse, pregnancy.\nThere is a better way to prevent pregnancy without committing to the pill every day.\nA birth control method that works more than 99 percent of the time is making a comeback after disappearing from America in the 1980s and 1990s.\nIt\u2019s time for ladies to think about their other options when it comes to birth control.\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for women to reconsider the method of birth control they are using or will choose to use."}
