Roberts Jr. was its unlikely savior. In a spectacular display of spot-welding, the chief justice joined fellow conservatives on some points and brought liberals on board for others. Roberts was the only member of the court to endorse the entire jerry-rigged thing, and even he made sure to distance himself from the substance of the law. (\u201cIt is,\u201d he wrote, \u201cnot our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\u201d) Still, his efforts rescued President Obama\u2019s signature achievement on grounds that many had dismissed as an afterthought.\n\nAs long as Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is on the court, he will most often be the decider when the justices split along their familiar ideological fault lines. But, slowly and quietly, Roberts is the one trying to build its legacy. He sees it as somehow exempt from the partisan fugue that long ago enveloped Washington. Justice Stephen G. Breyer has worried that the public might see him and his colleagues as \u201cnine junior-varsity politicians\u201d; public approval of the Supreme Court is falling. But while all of the justices bristle at the notion of a political court, the eponymous head of the Roberts court has the most to lose. After all, its decisions cannot be respected if the court is not respected. \u201cIt is a very serious threat to the independence and integrity of the courts to politicize them,\u201d Roberts said at his 2005 confirmation hearings.\n\nRoberts, 60, jokes about the \u201codd historical quirk\u201d that gives the chief justice only one vote. But he has learned to use the tools that come with the job: He shapes the discussion at conference; he writes the court\u2019s opinion, or assigns it strategically, when he is in the majority; he\u2019s happy to settle for nonthreatening, incremental changes that may bloom later into something more. And last term, what Roberts has described as the chief justice\u2019s \u201cparticular obligation to try to achieve consensus\u201d paid off. The share of unanimous decisions soared to 66 percent, a level not seen since the 1940s. The share of 5-to-4 decisions, high during Roberts\u2019s tenure compared with those of other chief justices, fell to 14 percent, the lowest since he joined the court.\n\nAnd then here comes Obamacare II. In King v. Burwell , to be argued Wednesday, plaintiffs say the text of the law must be interpreted in a way that would neuter it, canceling health insurance subsidies for about 7.5 million Americans in at least 34 states. Can Roberts\u2019s portrayal of the Supreme Court as above politics survive another round with the most partisan issue of the decade?\n\nRoberts, of course, has not ceased to be a conservative. Before Obamacare \u2014 or since \u2014 it\u2019s hard to think of a case in which he has not voted the way conservative activists had hoped when they recommended him to President George W. Bush. The Roberts court has been described as the most pro-business in history. Its liberals complain that consumers are on a losing streak and that the court has imposed new roadblocks for those trying to prove discrimination.\n\nAnd when the issue is important to the chief justice, or when there seems to be no chance for compromise, he has been decisive. In a suite of cases, for instance, the court has systematically dismantled campaign finance restrictions, calling them hostile to free speech rights \u2014 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission being the most famous of several 5-to-4 votes. Roberts wrote the majority opinion in the most recent, which featured the Republican National Committee as a plaintiff.\n\nHe has also forcefully opposed the government\u2019s use of racial classifications, and he wrote to strike down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts, unlike Kennedy or even Justice Antonin Scalia, had never been the lone conservative to join the court\u2019s liberals to make a majority in a major case \u2014 until the Affordable Care Act.\n\nYet chief justices tend not to see the court as a vehicle for advancing their unadulterated ideas. A transformation came over Roberts\u2019s predecessor and mentor, William H. Rehnquist, after becoming chief. As an associate justice, Rehnquist wrote so many solo dissents that his clerks awarded him a Lone Ranger doll. But like chief justices before him, in his new role he felt a responsibility to guard the court\u2019s precedents and image. The most famous example is his metamorphosis on the Miranda rule, requiring police officers to read suspects their rights. For years, Rehnquist had denounced the rule as constitutionally unsound. But after his ascent he voted to uphold it, saying the warnings \u201chave become part of our national culture.\u201d\n\nRoberts came to the court as chief, so there is no similar evolution to judge. But those who know him say his vision of the responsibilities of the chief is paramount. \u201cAssociate Justice Roberts would be much closer to Scalia than Chief Justice Roberts is in terms of their approach to cases,\u201d says one lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he argues Supreme Court cases. Anticipating this approach, Roberts pledged himself to the principle of stare decisis at his confirmation hearings and preached a gospel of judicial modesty, saying he came with \u201cno agenda.\u201d\n\nWhile he can\u2019t change Washington\u2019s partisan warfare, Roberts does what he can to avoid becoming a weapon in it, those who know him say. Unlike his colleagues, he does not give interviews. He avoids partisan gatherings such as the Federalist Society\u2019s annual gala (where Scalia and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. take turns providing the after-dinner remarks) or the American Constitution Society (where Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor have been honored). Even the bipartisan Gridiron Dinner, where the nation\u2019s political elite gather for gentle roasts, may have proved too much for Roberts: There\u2019s always a seat at the head table for the chief justice of the United States, but this one hasn\u2019t attended since 2009.\n\nHis protection of the court\u2019s image extends to his colleagues. In the first Affordable Care Act case, conservative activists and pols demanded that Justice Elena Kagan recuse herself because of her work as Obama\u2019s solicitor general, while liberal groups called for Thomas to step aside because his wife is a prominent conservative activist. Roberts, without specifically mentioning either, tried to shut down those complaints in his annual \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d report that year. \u201cI have complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are jurists of exceptional integrity and experience whose character and fitness have been examined through a rigorous appointment and confirmation process.\u201d\n\nBut the consensus compulsion is clearest when the court issues narrow opinions. With Obamacare, for instance, Roberts bobbed and weaved, agreeing with conservatives that Congress had exceeded its power to regulate interstate commerce but also siding with liberals to save the individual mandate by calling it a tax. In the last term, narrow rulings made it possible for the court to unite, at least on the bottom line, in striking down abortion-clinic buffer zones in Massachusetts and rejecting efforts to restrict class-action suits alleging security fraud.\n\nHis efforts are not universally revered. \u201cJohn Roberts, Thy Name Is Traitor,\u201d one conservative news site blared after the Obamacare decision. Glenn Beck offered T-shirts with Roberts\u2019s smiling face and the word \u201cCOWARD\u201d underneath. John Yoo, a former Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration, wrote that this coming week\u2019s challenge gives Roberts a chance to \u201catone.\u201d Scalia, a frequent Roberts ally, once mocked Roberts\u2019s \u201cfaux judicial modesty.\u201d And in last term\u2019s case on the buffer zones, he dismissed the chief\u2019s majority opinion as \u201cSomething for Everyone.\u201d\n\nRoberts insists that the nation\u2019s poisonous political climate, rather than anything the justices have done, is to blame for damage to the court\u2019s reputation. But he lives in a universe with a gridlocked Congress, a combative president who calls out the court at his State of the Union address and colleagues identified as often by party affiliation as by their judicial philosophies. \u201cToday\u2019s partisan split, while unprecedented, is likely enduring,\u201d says a study of the court by professors Neal Devins of William & Mary and Lawrence Baum of Ohio State. \u201cA five-member Democratic Court will reach sets of decisions that are quite different from those of a five-member Republican Court.\u201d\n\nPerhaps then political tensions are simply inescapable. But paradoxically, the court is hard to characterize precisely because of its close balance. The Roberts court has found rights for Guantanamo detainees; ruled that the Second Amendment secures an individual right to keep guns; handed gay rights activists some of their most important victories; drastically cut back on the ability of legislatures to restrict campaign contributions; and narrowed the options for punishing juvenile defendants. Alternating liberal and conservative victories on this term\u2019s two most important cases \u2014 gay marriage and health care \u2014 offer similar chances for \u201cbalance\u201d when the justices complete their work this June.\n\nThe court\u2019s conflicting messages usually depend on Kennedy siding either with the conservative justices or the liberal ones. But about two-thirds of the time, the Reagan appointee finds his natural home on the right. And while such snapshots can be misleading, in the last term Roberts agreed with Kennedy more than any other justice did. Kennedy was on the winning side in more opinions than any of his colleagues; Roberts was right behind.\n\nThis hardly means that either side sees the court as a neutral arbiter. Most liberal analysts praised Roberts\u2019s first Obamacare decision, but some forecast that his reasoning would be used to secure conservative victories in the future. Others speculated that it gave Roberts \u201ccover\u201d to move on to issues about which he felt more strongly. They felt vindicated a year later when he sided with his conservative colleagues and wrote the 5-to-4 opinion striking down a crucial component of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nRoberts appears to know this. At an appearance at the University of Nebraska law school last fall, he talked about how gridlock between Obama and congressional Republicans means collateral damage for the nine justices, too. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to spill over and affect us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not Democrats and Republicans in how we go about it, and in nine years I\u2019ve never seen any political issue like that arise between us.\u201d He worried that the near-party-line confirmation of \u201csomebody as eminently qualified as our newest member,\u201d Kagan, could suggest that people perceive the court, too, as a political body.\n\nIt is a perception that, despite Roberts\u2019s zealous labors, the court could soon reinforce, at least on the left. \u201cA 5-to-4 decision invalidating the premium tax credits\u201d in King v. Burwell \u201cwould seriously call into question the legitimacy of the court,\u201d Tim Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor and health-care expert, said in a video distributed by the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be [decided] pretty transparently for political reasons.\u201d\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nFive myths about King v.
