A lot depends on how producers and consumers react to the new bargain price.\n\nRelated: Why Oil Prices Are Headed Below $35 a Barrel\n\nIf you'd like to try come up with your own forecast, here's what you'll need to keep in mind:\n\nWhy are oil prices falling so far so fast?\n\nJust like a hot ticket on Stubhub, the global price of oil is set by middlemen who broker sales based on supply and demand. Lately, they've got a lot of unsold product to deal with. Simply put, the world is awash in oil.\n\nOn the demand side, the growth in consumption has been slowing\u2014for several reasons. First, much of the developed world is now seeing the payoff from investment in alternatives like natural gas and renewables. Consumption has also been dampened by widespread improvements in fuel efficiency in houses, cars, commercial buildings, airplanes, industrial equipment\u2014you name it. Those investments in efficiency were driven by high fuel costs.\n\nGasoline consumption in the U.S., for example, peaked in the summer of 2007 and began falling as car buyers switched to higher-mileage cars. More recently, the growth in demand has been winding down as the global economy\u2014with the exception of the U.S.\u2014continues to slow down.\n\nRelated: How Plunging Oil Prices Could Create Economic Upheaval\n\nOn the supply side, meanwhile, U.S. producers have come on strong with major new supplies that no one expected. After declining for decades, U.S. producers of so called tight oil\u2014long thought to be too expensive to produce\u2014ramped up new technologies like horizontal drilling to boost output. Last year, the U.S. produced 14 million barrels per day, more than Saudi Arabia or Russia, according to the EIA data.\n\nBut what happened to OPEC? Doesn't it control oil prices?\n\nOPEC's capacity to \"set\" global prices was always limited. Even in its heyday, the cartel had trouble agreeing on production cutbacks. But by cutting production, OPEC \"swing producer\" Saudi Arabia maintained a fairly effective floor on prices for many years.\n\nBut the Saudis now appear to have a different strategy for regaining control of the oil market. Saudi oil is among the cheapest to produce, so by letting prices crash, they're apparently hoping to restrict supplies by putting higher-cost producers out of business.\n\nIs the plan working?\n\nIt may be. After holding steady, the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation began falling last month, and several major Western oil producers announced plans to cut back on drilling and exploration projects. That may be why oil prices bounced up a bit in the last few weeks.\n\nRelated: 5 Issues That Could Impact Oil Prices in 2015\n\nSo does that mean oil prices are going back to where they came from, above $100 a barrel?\n\nFor that to happen, supplies would have to tighten up quickly. In the short run, that doesn't appear to be happening, according to oil analysts at Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. Overproduction has created a large stockpile of unsold oil that will continue to weigh on prices even as some high-cost production is shut down.\n\n\"The question here is whether the market will run out of storage space before the delayed reaction from non-OPEC producers succeeds in slowing global supply,\" the analysts wrote in a recent report.\n\nThe analysts said the Saudis new ploy has left the global oil market in \"uncharted territory.\" A lot depends on just how many producers cut back. Many countries that depend heavily on oil revenues, for example, may continue to produce at below cost just to keep the money flowing. The PIW analysts expect non-OPEC production will continue to grow by 1.16 million barrels per day\u2014while demand rises by only 800,000 barrels a day. That's hardly a formula for higher prices.\n\nThat's good, right? Doesn't everybody want cheaper oil?\n\nIf you're an oil producer, not so much. For countries around the world\u2014or U.S. states\u2014that rely heavily on oil revenues to pay the bills and create jobs, lower crude prices are inflicting varying degrees of economic pain.\n\nFor consumers, the lower prices is like a tax cut, freeing up money for savings or spending on other goods and services. That's good for economic growth, which is one reason the U.S. economy is expected to do relatively well this year.\n\nIt remains to be seen, though, how consumers respond to the new oil price bargains. If they skip the investment in fuel efficiency\u2014and go back to gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, for example\u2014that demand side of the equation will start rising faster.\n\nAnd that could have a big impact\u2014even as big as the Saudis production gamble\u2014on where oil prices are headed.\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\nRead more in CNBC:\n\nLet's get digital!
