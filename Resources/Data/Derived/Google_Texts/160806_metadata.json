I usually do play the game the right way. Yesterday I slipped and I messed up. I apologize. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nArenado\u2019s grounder, on a check swing in the fourth inning against Pittsburgh, sent a ball hopping about 10 feet.\n\nHe had already grounded out in the second inning. But this one bobbled off the glove of Pirates pitcher Charlie Morton, and Arenado had a chance to beat out the throw.\n\nBut with Morton behind him, Arenado didn\u2019t see it. And he ran through first at less than full pace. Weiss yanked Arenado from the game and replaced him with Charlie Culberson at third base.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about playing the game hard and playing the game right. And how important that is,\u201d Weiss said Friday. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019ve been getting your (butt) kicked for a while. It\u2019s even more important then. It\u2019s imperative.\u201d\n\nArenado talked to Weiss on Saturday and said he understood and accepted his benching.\n\n\u201cI messed up. I didn\u2019t play the game the right way at that point,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cHe had the absolute right to do that. I shouldn\u2019t be playing the game that way. There was just a lot of frustration and emotion been going on lately since I\u2019ve been playing.\u201d\n\nArenado is hitting .281 since returning July 3 from a broken hand.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been back on the field, I feel I haven\u2019t been where I want to be as a hitter,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. And obviously, as a team we haven\u2019t been playing well. Last two games we have. But it\u2019s frustrating when you\u2019re not playing well and the team\u2019s not playing well. It kind of wears you down.\n\n\u201cBut, ultimately, there\u2019s no excuse for not running hard. That was something I learned.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nolan Arenado is apologetic after his benching by Rockies\u2019 Walt Weiss", "title": "Nolan Arenado is apologetic after his benching by Rockies\u2019 Walt Weiss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/26/nolan-arenado-is-apologetic-after-his-benching-by-rockies-walt-weiss/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140726__nolan-arenadop1.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140726__nolan-arenadop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-26T19:29:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:44:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe talk a lot about playing the game hard and playing the game right.\n\u201cI let my emotions get the best of me yesterday,\u201d Arenado said before Saturday\u2019s game.\nA contrite and embarrassed Nolan Arenado on Saturday explained his benching by Rockies manager Walt Weiss after the Gold Glover failed to run out a groundball against the Pirates the night before.\nI didn\u2019t play the game the right way at that point,\u201d Arenado said.\nI usually do play the game the right way."}
