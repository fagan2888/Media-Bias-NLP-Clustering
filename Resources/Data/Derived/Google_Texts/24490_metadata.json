But now, a new study has shed some light on the source of that sound.\n\nTaking advantage of a rare opportunity to observe the brain of someone with tinnitus \u2014 this person had to undergo surgery for epilepsy \u2014 researchers from the University of Iowa and Newcastle University discovered that the condition affects areas of the brain beyond the primary auditory cortex. They found this person\u2019s brain was also active in the areas involved with the broader perceptions of noises, including those that control attention, memory, and emotion, New Scientist reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re walking home on a dark night and you can hear every little flicker of sound that would normally go unnoticed,\u201d Will Sedley, of the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle, told New Scientist. \u201cMaybe in people with tinnitus, the \u2018high alert\u2019 activity somehow kicks in, gains access to wider perception networks in the brain, and is difficult to dislodge.\u201d\n\nIn other words, tinnitus may occur when the brain amplifies sounds that normally wouldn\u2019t enter our consciousness.\n\nThe researchers discovered this while conducting invasive electrode monitoring in a 50-year-old epileptic man who also happened to have tinnitus in both ears due to hearing loss. Awake during the surgery, the man had recording electrodes placed in various parts of his brain to identify the source of his seizures.\n\nMeanwhile, Sedley\u2019s team tested the man\u2019s tinnitus by measuring brain activity while suppressing it with white noise for 30 seconds, and then allowing it to return \u2014 after about 10 seconds of turning off the white noise. The man was also asked to rate the loudness of the tinnitus before the white noise was turned on, right after it was turned off, and about 10 seconds later. They did this several times over the course of two days before concluding brain activity was more widespread. Even when they played a sound mimicking tinnitus, it was perceived in a centralized area.\n\n\u201cWe now know that tinnitus is represented very differently in the brain to normal sounds, even ones that sound the same,\u201d Sedley said in a press release, while noting this may be the reason why current treatments aren\u2019t always effective.\n\nCurrently, the most effective treatment for tinnitus is acoustic neural stimulation, in which a device alters the brain\u2019s waves and eases the constant sound. Besides that, however, counseling and sound generators don\u2019t actually treat the problem, and instead rely on teaching a person how to cope with the ringing. The new study offers new insight into the way tinnitus works, and may eventually lead to more effective treatments, Sedley said.\n\nSource: Sedley W, Gander P, Kumar S, et al.
