Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n3 On the Shameful and Skewed \u2018Redskins\u2019 Poll\n\n4 Clinton Needs Sanders Supporters to Win, But Sanders Needs Clinton Supporters to Change the System\n\n5 Benjamin Netanyahu Just Formed the Most Right-Wing Government in Israeli History\n\nLast year, home care aides were among the many low-wage workers who joined fast food workers at Fight for 15 rallies in at least 19 cities. The Fight for 15 movement, spearheaded by fast-food workers and backed by SEIU, was a natural ally for home care workers, says Massachusetts home care worker Kindalay Cummings-Akers: \u201cWe figured, there\u2019s a lot of low-wage workers out that can\u2019t survive off of $8, $9, $10 an hour, so we all might as well just go out there together, make it a national fight.\u201d Now that her union has won $15 an hour, she adds, \u201cthe fight\u2019s not over.\u2026 this shows that if we can do it, other people can do it too.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, while the new wage agreement is a step forward\u2014and is coupled with other benefits like job training\u2014the low-wage home care workforce still faces socioeconomic challenges. Reflecting national trends, surveyed personal care workers cited low compensation as a major problem that factored into some workers\u2019 desire to leave the job: Roughly two-thirds expressed frustration about not being paid according to their time spent in the job. Other common complaints included a lack of paid sick leave and not being paid fairly according to skill level.\n\nLiving wages help stabilize the workforce and improve the overall level of care. Research on San Francisco home care workers found that each added dollar on the base wage boosted workforce retention by 17 points, and retention rates jumped 39 percent to 74 percent \u201cfollowing significant wage and benefit increases.\u201d Other research points to unionization itself as a boost to job and workforce quality.\n\nBut the Massachusetts victory only underscores the plight of many other home care workers across the country, who remain exempt even from the federal base wage (dependent instead on state wage standards or just the whim of employers). The Obama administration recently moved to amend federal regulations to extend wage protections to home care workers, but the rule has been thwarted by litigation brought by the industry.\n\nIn addition to supporting the ongoing expansion of public healthcare under the Affordable Care Act, the recent Supreme Court ruling affects home care workers more directly. While the consumer base grows for community-based services, many home care workers themselves may gain access to coverage, since a large portion of them earn poverty wages and are themselves uninsured.\n\nAs workers campaign to extend the $15 wage floor to other sectors, it\u2019s also spreading a vision of a care economy that treats both providers and consumers with dignity.\n\nCummings-Akers, who plans to keep organizing for fairer wages for all workers and expansion of state-sponsored Medicare programs, wishes more politicians saw what she deals with at her client\u2019s home, where she often volunteers extra time to ensure that he and his partner are fed well and comfortable. Won\u2019t policymakers want the same when they get older? \u201cThat\u2019s a question they should ask themselves: Do I want someone [caring for me, who is] being paid well\u2026and is happy and not miserable?\u2026 When you\u2019re not happy at your job, you don\u2019t really give your best.\u201d\n\nIn her everyday work, she says, \u201cI love my job, I love what I do, and I\u2019m going to give my best. But I\u2019m going to fight for what I deserve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SEIU_Wage_cc_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Chen", "description": "Healthcare workers in Massachusetts got good news twice this past week.
