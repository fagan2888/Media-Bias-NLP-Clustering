Young American consumers are likely to blindly grab any package labeled \u201corganic,\u201d despite being confused on what they are actually buying. A survey conducted by brand consultancy BFG found nearly 70 percent of people were buying organic food, but only 20 percent of those buyers were able to define what \u201corganic\u201d actually meant.\n\n\u201cWhat I think we\u2019re seeing in grocery stores is that consumers are ultimately idealists,\u201d BFG CEO Kevin Meany told Fast Company. \u201cThey desire honesty. They want to believe. They trust the label, and they\u2019re willing to pay more based on that for something like \u2018all-natural,\u2019 even though they\u2019re not totally sure what it means.\u201d\n\nOut of the 300 respondents surveyed, more than half of them said they were \u201cconcerned but confused\u201d because they weren\u2019t really sure what they were purchasing. Unfortunately, many grocery chains like Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s have taken advantage of general consumer ignorance. They\u2019ve battled dozens of lawsuits over their incorrect or questionable use of the label \u201call natural,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d and, of course, \u201corganic.\u201d\n\nTo set the record straight: Organic produce is grown without the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms (GMO), or ironizing radiation. Organic animal meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from animals that were not given antibiotics or growth hormones. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn\u2019t regulate the terms used to label food, and the broad lackadaisical freedom from which companies profit of off is manipulative. Being healthy, or at least attempting to be healthy, is trendy right now, and the food industry is well aware of it.\n\nThere\u2019s even a \u201cComing Clean Campaign\u201d launched by the Organic Consumers Association. It asks both consumers and retailers to take action by buying and selling USDA organic seal products that ensure food and personal care and cosmetic products are what they claim to be. It\u2019s the right of a consumer to understand what he's buying. The organic marketplace has profited substantially from its labeling and has grown into a successful $25 billion industry over the past decade.\n\nBut maybe buyers aren\u2019t as na\u00efve as the seller would like to believe. According to the survey, more than 70 percent said they agreed certain food labels were meaningless. However, 37 percent said they still trusted the labels\u2019 promises of what was inside the product. When they asked consumers how they felt about GMOs, 59 percent of respondents said they were concerned about GMOs, but only 32 percent were able to define what a GMO was. A GMO is a food altered inside of a laboratory. Scientists will remove a gene or two out of its DNA in order to make the food resistant to pesticides or juicier, redder, or bigger.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a constant throughout all this, and it\u2019s indulgence,\u201d Meany said. \u201cOf the two extremes, indulgence [can be] super clean foods, organic, locally sourced. And on the other side, there\u2019s just, \u2018I\u2019m going to Carl\u2019s Jr. and get a thick burger and love it.\u2019 They\u2019re both basically consumer indulgences and marketers are smart.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "americans, buy, organic, non, gmo, food, without, knowing, what, it, means, thanks, marketing", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Most people don't know what a GMO or an organic food item is, but they buy it anyway.", "title": "Do You Know What Organic Or GMO Means?
