The \u201cBrian Shaw\u201d center/point guard/small forward/shooting guard.\n\nThe \u201cBrian Shaw\u201d player.\n\nJust exactly who is it?\n\nThe reality is, no one knows. The Nuggets coach has no track record of picking players, having input on personnel decisions or having even the smallest hand in the construction of an NBA roster.\n\nShaw was part of a team as a player that he eventually became an assistant for, the Los Angeles Lakers. When he joined the Indiana Pacers as an assistant, they already had Paul George, Roy Hibbert, Lance Stephenson and David West.\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nBut Shaw\u2019s big role is on the horizon.\n\nThe Nuggets appear headed down the road to rebuilding, and we should all pay close attention. That\u2019s because clarity on just what the ideal team is for Shaw, general manager Tim Connelly and club president Josh Kroenke will be at hand.\n\nFrom the point guard all the way to the center. From the bench to the players who are leaders. From shooters to the hustle players. From the smallest to the tallest. From the most athletic to those who prod along. From playmakers to specialists.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to matter. It will all mean something. The process will too. Go with draft picks or free agents? Become bad to become good? Or try to make shrewd moves to cushion that process?\n\nShaw is fond of saying he only coaches the players given to him, and to a certain extent that is true. But don\u2019t be fooled into believing Shaw will have no voice in the Nuggets\u2019 personnel. No one knows what a team needs more than its head coach. Furthermore, Shaw has a vision of how he wants the Nuggets to operate on the court, and there are specific players who fit the mold.\n\nAnd the information-seeking Connelly won\u2019t do anything without getting input from Shaw first.\n\nIf we\u2019re putting the pieces together, the biggest clues are what Shaw said at the start of his Nuggets tenure. He said he wanted to play inside-out, smash-mouth basketball. Expect the Nuggets to get to that. They\u2019re already grooming a young bruiser in rookie center Jusuf Nurkic, who delights in crushing players setting a screen as much as he does in pinning and mauling a defender on post-up plays. Overseas, power forward Joffrey Lauvergne has a reputation of being attracted to physicality. The Nuggets will want as much of that on their roster as possible.\n\nBut beyond that, things are a mystery. The moves the Nuggets make, starting with the next eight months, will be their most significant since the Denver franchise was building around a young Car- melo Anthony after the 2003 draft.\n\nIt will truly be the Nuggets\u2019 build.\n\nThen we will know what they\u2019re really thinking.\n\nThen we will know what a \u201cBrian Shaw\u201d player and team actually are.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Brian Shaw\u2019s vision will show in Nuggets\u2019 rebuilding", "title": "Dempsey: Brian Shaw\u2019s vision will show in Nuggets\u2019 rebuilding", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/03/dempsey-brian-shaws-vision-will-show-in-nuggets-rebuilding/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141109__brian-shawp1.jpg", "height": 408}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141109__brian-shawp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-03T18:57:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T04:09:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The \u201cBrian Shaw\u201d player.\nThe \u201cBrian Shaw\u201d power forward.\nThen we will know what a \u201cBrian Shaw\u201d player and team actually are.\nThe \u201cBrian Shaw\u201d center/point guard/small forward/shooting guard.\nShaw was part of a team as a player that he eventually became an assistant for, the Los Angeles Lakers."}
