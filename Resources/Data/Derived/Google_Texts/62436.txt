According to a report from the Washington Post, Pearson, the world’s largest education company, is monitoring social media during administration of the PARCC.

The reason for this is to monitor any security breaches and “ensure fairness” according to the report and a spokesperson from Pearson.

The report states that news of the monitoring surfaced after a superintendent of New Jersey’s Watchung Hills Regional High School District sent a letter to her colleagues about an incident pointed out to her by a test coordinator, in which a student allegedly tweeted about a test question.

Superintendent Elizabeth C. Jewett called this monitoring “disturbing,” according to the report.

The email she sent was initially posted by Bob Braun, a former reporter, education editor and senior columnist at the Star-Ledger, on his website, according to the report.
