He and his wife, Lynne, have retired to a farm in Northeast Mississippi.\n\nImagine that the decision of the Supreme Court was not ObamaCARE, but ObamaCAR. It might have been.\n\nIn the bailout of General Motors the Obama administration chose to reorganize the bankrupt auto company by stiffing its creditors and bondholders leaving a very big company owned largely by the taxpayers and the autoworker\u2019s union.\n\nThe Democrats owned both houses of Congress and the White House. They could have crammed through a partisan law mandating that every American own a car.\n\nThey would not be so gauche as to argue on behalf of profits for the taxpayer. They might say that the Emergency Medial Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 mandating that emergency rooms treat everyone regardless of citizenship, legal status of ability to pay was meaningless if the afflicted party had no transportation to get to the hospital.\n\nWe could call it ObamaCAR. It would save lives as well as help the taxpayer and the unions. Failing to buy a car would result in a fine to be levied by the IRS.\n\nTo be fair to the poor a subsidy would be provided based on income. The subsidy would only apply to purchases from dealerships willing to let the federal government set the terms of the sale.\n\nThe language limiting the subsidy to approved dealerships was repeated nine times in the bill without ambiguity. Early drafts of the IRS rule-making also reflected the limits.\n\nWhen Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy Emily McMahon discovered the limitation she instructed the staff to ignore it. Henceforth all drafts of the IRS rules were written to include all auto purchases.\n\nThus the law was amended without burdening the Congress and a $700 billion entitlement was created out of thin air.\n\nThe law clearly would have a broad impact on the society and the economy. Many people, who have never before been able to afford a car would now have one with the taxpayer\u2019s help.\n\nUntold numbers of lives would be saved with the ability to transport Grandma to the emergency room without delay. ObamaCAR eliminated the anxiety about deaths due to unmet transportation needs.\n\nThere would, of course, be legal challenges questioning the government\u2019s authority to mandate that we buy any product irrespective of good intentions.\n\nPublic life attracts people who almost always desire to \u201cdo good.\u201d Judges are no exception.\n\nFor Chief Justice John Roberts that desire to do good seems to be driven by a desire to satisfy the appetite of a Congressional majority that has prevailed in a democratic process.\n\nRather than strike down ObamaCAR as an affront to the Commerce clause, Roberts would ignore an entire year and a half of debate and discussion, in which it was promised repeatedly that the fine was not a tax. \u201cWe\u2019ll just call it a tax,\u201d Roberts said. There. That settles that.\n\nWhen the newly created $700 billion entitlement was discovered another challenge rose.\n\nRoberts would, of course, conclude that the Congress\u2019 good intentions were more expansive than the words they wrote to define them.\n\nRoberts wrote: \u201cCongress wrote the law to improve (auto dealer) markets. Not to destroy them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps he slept through that debate in which the majority wanted to outlaw the dealerships entirely and to have \u201csingle payer\u201d auto sales to be delivered by a government bureaucracy that would treat everyone fairly and equally.\n\nProminent Democrats said then, and repeat now, that the ultimate goal is to end the private auto dealer market and the outrageous profits of the dealerships.\n\nThe votes weren\u2019t there to stiff the auto dealers so a compromise was reached to allow private dealerships to continue under strict federal rules.\n\nRoberts concluded that the words, \u201cthose dealerships approved under the law\u201d really meant \u201cthose dealerships operating legally under the laws of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Roberts chose to interpret the words as he did can be understood in the context of his desire to genuflect before the legislating mob. He decided that they just wanted to do the most good for the most people.\n\nWhen John Roberts was testifying at his Senate confirmation he said that judges are referees. They call balls and strikes. They don\u2019t pick up the bat and swing at a pitch. In two out of two court challenges of Obamacare, Roberts stepped up to the plate and took a huge cut at the ball.\n\nAnd missed.\n\nIn his defense it has been said that he believed that the Bush v. Gore decision put the court in a political place that had diminished its stature. As Chief Justice he sees himself as a protector of the reputation of the Court.\n\nHe whiffed that one too.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
