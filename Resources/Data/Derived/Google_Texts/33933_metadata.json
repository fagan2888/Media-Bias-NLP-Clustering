BeautifulPeople.com\n\nSort of like a posh Manhattan club, there\u2019s now an online dating website that only allow gorgeous people to join. It\u2019s called BeautifulPeople.com, and it\u2019s so elitist and competitive that people are actually getting plastic surgery and undergoing extreme makeovers to try to get in.\n\nIf you want to apply, you have to be beautiful \u2014 and should have a series of professionally done photographs highlighting your model physique, perfectly made-up face, and impeccable style. Current members judge and rate you based on your level of beauty, then decide whether or not to let you in. Millions of people have, in fact, been rejected by the dating site \u2014 which consists of about 800,000 elite members \u2014 according to Life&Style.\n\nWould you really go to this far to change yourself to find love? #Matrimony #Marriage #Love #Dating #Beautiful http://t.co/42AmJEe40w \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Pure Ishq (@PureIshq4u) December 11, 2014\n\nDoes all of this sound superficial? Definitely \u2014 but the members don\u2019t think so. \u201cI think that everyone wants to be with someone that they\u2019re attracted to, and there\u2019s nothing superficial about that,\u201d one member told the Daily Mail in a video interview. \u201cWith Beautifulpeople.com, we just removed the first hurdle, because everyone is beautiful.\u201d\n\nPlenty of the 7.5 million people rejected since the start of the site in 2003 have re-applied again \u2014 many up to 4 times or even 20 times in the hopes of improving their appearance and getting accepted. There\u2019s no limit to the amount of times you reapply. The managing director of the site, Greg Hodge, told the Daily Mail that \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just down to straightening your teeth, curbing your appetite, grooming yourself with a little more care and getting down to the gym.\u201d He adds that the site even has a mentoring service to help people improve their looks and get guidance by beauty experts and stylists.\n\n\u201cMany people write us off as a heartless, lookist dating community that exists to alienate the aesthetically disadvantaged,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true. We want to encourage people to make the best of themselves. We get more excited about successful transformation stories than any other application and our members who transform themselves tell us how our rejection letter was the best thing that could have ever happened to them \u2014 and that we\u2019ve positively enhanced their lives.\u201d\n\nRegardless of Hodge\u2019s words, it\u2019s still a site that focuses solely on looks and not brains, personality, or talent. Improvement and taking care of yourself is one thing, but getting plastic surgery done to alter your natural looks in order to be accepted into an elite club doesn\u2019t exactly sound like the best way to meet a life-long partner.\n\nAnd though the site boasts that you\u2019ll \u201cmeet REAL beautiful people who actually look in real life as they do online,\u201d remember that beauty \u2014 and makeup \u2014 is only one tiny sliver of a person.\n\nBut that probably won\u2019t stop the site from existing and be valued by people who are in the fashion or beauty industry. \u201cWith every club in the world, there\u2019s a requirement to join,\u201d one member told the Daily Mail. \u201cWith Beautiful people, you\u2019re required to be beautiful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "beautifulpeople.com, beautiful people, elite dating site", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A dating site that only allows beautiful people to join claims it helps people improve their looks, but how superficial is it really?", "title": "Would You Undergo Plastic Surgery Just To Find A Mate?
