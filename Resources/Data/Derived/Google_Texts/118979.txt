The New York Post dedicated its Sunday edition to welcoming Chelsea Clinton’s daughter Charlotte to the world in probably the most unique way possible.

The covered dubs the newest addition to the Clinton family a “party pooper” and “another liberal crybaby for Dem Clintons.”

On Friday night, Chelsea Clinton gave birth to her first daughter Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky with husband Marc at about 7pm, and she promply announced the news on Twitter the Facebook the following day.

New grandmother Hillary also expressed her excitement on social media, dubbing herself and grandpa Bill “over the moon to be grandparents.”

Of course, Bill couldn’t resist sharing some baby pictures of his own on Twitter. He and the New York Post actually chose the same photo.

Just look at that smile. Hopefully, he is putting all that grandfatherly advice from pal President Bush to good use.
