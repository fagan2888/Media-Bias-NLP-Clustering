The Affordable Care Act does allow exemptions for religiously affiliated institutions like Notre Dame, to not provide birth control to employees if it is morally opposed, but the government would reimburse those employees to get the services elsewhere.\n\nThe Catholic university in South Bend filed the injunction after claiming the law violates its freedom to practice religion without government interference.\n\nChief Judge Philip P. Simon of the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana in South Bend wrote in his opinion:\n\n\u201cNotre Dame wants to eat its cake, and have it still, at the expense of Congress, administrative agencies, and the employees who will be affected. Notre Dame is free to opt out of providing the coverage itself, but it can\u2019t stop anyone else from providing it. But that is essentially what Notre Dame is requesting. Notre Dame is not being asked to do or say anything it doesn\u2019t already do, and wouldn\u2019t do regardless of the outcome of this case; the only thing that changes under the healthcare law is the actions of third parties. Notre Dame can\u2019t claim to be \u201cpressured\u201d to do something it has done, will do, and would do regardless of the contraception requirement.\u201d\n\nAfter Simon\u2019s ruling, Notre Dame filed an appeal Monday to U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge rejected Notre Dame's request for an injunction to the contraceptive clause of the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "A federal judge rejected Notre Dame's request for an injunction to the contraceptive clause of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Judge Rejects Notre Dame Contraceptive Lawsuit | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/judge-rejects-notre-dame-contraceptive-lawsuit-60542/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/basilica.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/basilica.jpg", "title": "Judge Rejects Notre Dame Contraceptive Lawsuit", "site": "@wfiunews", "card": "summary", "description": "A federal judge rejected Notre Dame's request for an injunction to the contraceptive clause of the Affordable Care Act."}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1", "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0535\"", "article_summary": "Notre Dame can\u2019t claim to be \u201cpressured\u201d to do something it has done, will do, and would do regardless of the contraception requirement.\u201dAfter Simon\u2019s ruling, Notre Dame filed an appeal Monday to U.S.\nA federal judge rejected Notre Dame\u2019s request for an injunction that would block the \u201ccontraceptive mandate\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\nNotre Dame is free to opt out of providing the coverage itself, but it can\u2019t stop anyone else from providing it.\nBut that is essentially what Notre Dame is requesting.\nPhoto: Kymberly Janisch (Flickr) The contraceptives mandate has been particularly controversial in South Bend, Ind., the home of the University of Notre Dame."}
