We use it but don\u0092t manage it. My interest in it may differ from yours. But if we don\u0092t cooperate, the resource may go away and we\u0092re both hurt. What is it?\n\nGroundwater.\n\nTwo months into 2015, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) causes head scratching. Water managers and policy makers are unsure how to get to first base.\n\nThe SGMA, which took effect January 1, requires that groundwater sustainability plans be adopted for priority groundwater basins in California. Of the state\u0092s 515 groundwater basins, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) ranks 127 as \u0093high\u0094 or \u0093medium\u0094 priority basins. These priority basins account for 96 percent of California\u0092s annual groundwater pumping, and supply 88 percent of overlying populations.\n\nThe bottom line is that California\u0092s population growth, coupled with that pesky multi-year drought, pitch one-two strikes that stress out the aquifers.\n\nSGMA requires that by 2017, local groundwater sustainability agencies are identified to manage groundwater. By 2020, basins experiencing overdraft must have a plan that demonstrates sustainable groundwater use.\n\nThe issues are difficult for laypersons to latch onto. First, understanding hydrogeology and interpreting groundwater data requires the complex review of reports, charts, maps, and computer models. It\u0092s pure fun for science geeks, but dry as unbuttered popcorn for those of us with normal brainpower. Second, the process to form new governmental agencies is about as sexy as pocket lint.\n\nHere\u0092s the big picture\n\nCalifornia\u0092s total water supply, according to DWR, is approximately 43 million acre-feet per year (an acre-foot of water is roughly 326,000 gallons, the amount of water consumed by a suburban family household). An acre-foot of water would cover a baseball field four inches deep.\n\nThirty-nine percent of California\u0092s total water supply -- 16 million acre-feet -- is water pumped out of the ground. The balance includes surface water collected mostly from within the state\u0092s borders. Nine percent of California\u0092s total supply is imported from the Colorado River.\n\nIn December 2014, the California Department of Finance reported the state\u0092s population as nearly 39 million. That\u0092s enough to make California the world\u0092s 35th largest country, if it were a country. But growth is hardly stopping in the Golden State.\n\nBy 2020 the population forecasted to gain another 1.7 million. By 2060 California\u0092s population may reach 52 million, which exceeds the present day population of South Korea. Analysts can predict population growth far easier than meteorologists can predict when droughts end. Meteorologists may have more success forecasting tornadoes. Meanwhile, State groundwater elevations drop to historic levels.\n\nCalifornia has regulated surface water rights since 1914. Over the last century, however, groundwater management has remained largely unregulated with the exception of several southern California regions that govern its use through basin adjudications -- legal decisions. Through the SGMA, local leaders get the first try at creating new governing agencies to manage their respective groundwater basins. If locals cannot solve problems, the state will intervene.\n\nThe North Valley approach \u0096 or approaches\n\nNorthern Sacramento Valley water managers proceed with caution as other groundwater users in California race to aquifer bottoms. The Sacramento River Hydrologic Region, which includes portions of Sacramento, Yuba, Butte, Tehama, Shasta, Glenn, Colusa and Yolo counties, provides about a fifth of California\u0092s total water supply. Fewer than 6 percent of the state\u0092s population lives here. According to DWR, about a third of the Sacramento River Hydrologic Region\u0092s water portfolio is groundwater. Among the tasks for managing Northern Sacramento Valley aquifer basins is getting started.\n\n\u0093Setting up these new groundwater sustainability agencies may challenge some areas,\u0094 says Scott Matyac, water resources manager for the Yuba County Water Agency. \u0093We\u0092re poised well in Yuba County. Our agency is governed by a seven-member board which includes five county supervisors and two at-large directors.\u0094\n\nYuba County Water Agency operates hydroelectric facilities on the Yuba River east of Marysville and provides agricultural irrigation water.\n\n\u0093We\u0092ve successfully managed the north and south Yuba groundwater basins,\u0094 says Mr. Matyac. \u0093We\u0092ve installed dedicated monitoring wells and report basin characteristics to the state. Through groundwater substitution transfers (when surface water is transferred to downstream users and groundwater irrigates local crops instead) we\u0092ve exercised the aquifers and have a good understanding of basin sustainability. For Yuba County, creating a groundwater sustainability plan is more of an evolution than revolution. Plus our board is well aware of land use issues. We\u0092ll schedule public meetings to discuss the SGMA\u0092s opportunities and challenges.\u0094\n\nFurther north, in Butte County, water governance becomes more complex. Home to the State Water Project\u0092s Lake Oroville, Butte County reaches east into the Feather River and Butte Creek watersheds and sprawls west across the valley floor. The Sacramento River generally marks the western political border.\n\n\u0093We have several options for new groundwater sustainability agencies,\u0094 says Paul Gosselin, director of Butte County\u0092s Water and Resources Department. \u0093Local water districts could become their own agencies or multiple agencies can develop their plans and coordinate data sharing. Butte County\u0092s groundwater management plan includes basin management objectives (BMOs) based upon historic low groundwater levels. But we\u0092re grappling with hydrologic boundaries within Butte County. What we need is consistency in methods. The connectedness of our aquifer is widespread. We need to better understand the science to make management decisions.\u0094\n\nTed Trimble, general manager of Western Canal Water District, says groundwater management is necessary but expresses concern. Western Canal WD is located within Butte County\u0092s valley floor. His district\u0092s territory extends west across the Sacramento River into Glenn County. Western Canal WD\u0092s surface water, from Lake Oroville, irrigates 58,000 irrigable acres.\n\n\u0093Just look at the Central Valley,\u0094 Mr. Trimble sighs, \u0093especially where groundwater overdraft has damaged a basin\u0092s ability to rebound.\u0094\n\nWestern Canal WD shares similar soil features \u0097 adobe clay \u0097 with neighboring districts that surround the agricultural communities of Richvale, Biggs, and Gridley, valley towns adjacent to state Highway 99. The soils and climate are perfect for rice crops. Flood irrigation also recharges the basin. After dewatering fields for harvest, fields are re-flooded to decompose rice stalks. The area, a Pacific Flyway, attracts migratory birds.\n\nNorth of Western Canal WD, orchards dot agricultural parcels that ultimately merge into the community of Durham, four miles south of Chico. These areas, and Chico, rely entirely on groundwater.\n\n\u0093One concern we have is how Butte County addresses BMOs,\u0094 says Mr. Trimble. \u0093Groundwater levels in my district are generally shallower than in other areas of Butte County. As a percent change in groundwater elevations, we can absorb more fluctuation than other areas. If a larger groundwater sustainability agency included us, how much flexibility would we have to change our standards because of drought or surface water curtailments from Lake Oroville? Sustainability for us is likely to be different from Butte County\u0092s or Chico\u0092s. How are we to coalesce around the use of a common resource? We have different economic interests and views on sustainability. Legislation is needed but the governance may be tricky.\u0094\n\nDan McManus, of DWR\u0092s Northern Regional Office in Red Bluff, understands the concern. A geologist, Mr. McManus recently introduced SGMA to the Butte County Water Commission. \u0093Groundwater is best managed at the local or regional level,\u0094 he says. \u0093DWR can provide technical support as agencies desire it.\u0094\n\nThe journey north from Butte County into Tehama County on Highway 99 crosses over valley pastures that blend into groves of orchard crops. On clear days Mt. Lassen (elevation 10,463 feet) stands out 50 miles away. Mill Creek and Deer Creek, spring-run Chinook salmon runs, slice through the valley portion of Tehama County before joining the Sacramento River. Sparsely inhabited, Tehama County\u0092s entire population would not even fill the San Francisco 49ers\u0092 Levi Stadium to capacity.\n\nTehama County Flood Control and Water Resource Manager Ryan Teubert, contemplates. \u0093I expect we\u0092ll coordinate with the shared basins that border Butte and Glenn Counties. But we\u0092re unsure how to do that.\u0094\n\nNorth of Tehama County, California\u0092s fifth highest mountain lies smack ahead. Mt. Shasta\u0092s (elevation 14,179 feet) volcanic peak is usually snow covered year-round. Snowmelt contributes to rivers named the Pit, McCloud, and the Sacramento, their flows eventually impounded by Shasta Dam. A keystone for the Central Valley Project, the dam\u0092s outflow generates hydroelectric power and provides irrigation water.\n\nShasta County\u0092s largest city, Redding, uses mostly surface water for its potable supply but also groundwater. The city, Shasta County Water Agency, and the Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation District (ACID) actively participate with a dozen other agencies through the Redding Water Council.\n\n\u0093Redding Basin water users have a good start for managing groundwater,\u0094 says Stan Wangberg, ACID\u0092s general manager. \u0093Transitioning from a groundwater management plan to a groundwater sustainability plan should be a bit easier for us.\u0094\n\nACID has surface water rights and provides agricultural irrigation water diverted from the Sacramento River. Mr. Wangberg continues, \u0093Our aquifer is in excellent shape and we continue to learn how it performs. We\u0092ve recently conducted groundwater substitution transfers and all of our wells recovered. We actually recharge the basin and contribute more water than is extracted. In our area, the Sacramento River is a gaining stream. With a full basin, groundwater flows into the river. But with controlled pumping and monitoring, we can open up aquifer capacity.\u0094\n\nAnd how do you get to first base with SGMA?\n\n\u0093The first step is to define the basin. Tehama and Shasta Counties may have different views. We\u0092ll seek community opinion through public outreach,\u0094 says Mr. Wangberg.\n\nAnd what about private pumpers [individual groundwater users] who don\u0092t want to participate? \u0093That\u0092s a challenge,\u0094 Mr. Wangberg admits. \u0093If private pumpers won\u0092t cooperate, they\u0092re subject to state oversight. We want folks to buy into this process.\u0094\n\nInterstate 5 from Shasta County to Sacramento is a straight 160 mile shot. Road warriors may hardly notice the meandering Sacramento River which intermittently crosses beneath I-5 as it flows toward the Capitol, after weaving past Glenn, Colusa and Yolo counties. The Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District, a Central Valley Project contracting water agency, balances agricultural needs with surface and groundwater.\n\n\u0093We need common vision to be successful with SGMA,\u0094 says Thad Bettner, general manager for the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District. \u0093The 2017 deadline sounds far off but it\u0092s actually a tight schedule. At least everyone here is open to communicating. I think the county\u0092s water and technical advisory committees will bring good ideas. We\u0092re curious to see how the counties we operate in (Glenn and Colusa) react.\u0094\n\nGlenn County Water Resources Coordinator Lisa Hunter, sheds some light. \u0093We briefed our Board of Supervisors and their direction was to continue educating the public on SGMA,\u0094 she says. \u0093We have a good group of folks and may need to coordinate at some level. Glenn County doesn\u0092t want anyone to be left out but we\u0092re not necessarily the lead, nor do we want to be perceived as taking over. It\u0092s too early to say what a groundwater sustainability agency, or agencies, will look like.\u0094\n\nMuddy waters clear if unstirred. But it takes time and patience to wait it out. As for waiting out the drought, Mr. Wangberg sums it best. \u0093Without sustainability we\u0092re on a dead-end road. We\u0092ll crash. We\u0092re all in this together. We need to protect the resource for future needs.\u0094\n\nAbout the writer\n\nEric Miller is based in Chico and serves on the Butte County Groundwater Technical Advisory Committee and the Chico Urban Water Committee.
