An open textbook is a textbook that can be accessed by the public for free and is legal to download, print and redistribute. Colleges in the program can be of any size, from community colleges to universities, but every college that receives funds would be required to submit a report on how effectively the program saved students\u2019 money.\n\nSenators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Al Franken (D-MN) and Angus King (I-ME) and Representatives Rub\u00e9n Hinojosa (D-TX) and Jared Polis (D-CO) introduced the bill to Congress Oct. 8.\n\n\u201cCollege would be a lot easier if I had access to textbooks, something I don\u2019t have because they\u2019re too expensive for a student paying for college on her own,\u201d said Kate Williams, a sophomore studying life sciences. \u201cI\u2019m already paying thousands for tuition. I don\u2019t have the resources to pay hundreds more for books and access to online homework and honestly shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the average student\u2019s budget for books is about $1,200 annually due to the rapid inflation of textbook prices. In 10 years, between 2002 and 2012, college textbook prices rose 82 percent, according to the U.S Government Accountability Office. According to University of Michigan economics professor Mark J. Perry, the costs of textbooks have risen 812 percent since 1978.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that our college students are taking on more debt than ever while also working more and more hours to stay afloat,\u201d said Franken in the official press release about the bill. \u201cBy expanding access to free online textbooks, our bill would help address this problem and allow students and families to keep more of their hard-earned money.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, one of the main supporters of the act, the use of open textbooks reduces the average cost of course material for a student by 80 percent and can reduce the cost of course material entirely. On its website, SPARC supplies a list of other Open Educational Resources, or OERs, including lesson plans, tests, software, videos, games and even full courses.\n\nAccording to Anthony Sanders, associate director of NCSU Bookstores, NCSU Libraries already has a grant-funded program in place with the goal of reducing the cost of attendance.\n\n\u201cThe effect [of the Affordable Textbook Act] on NC State Bookstores would not change the mission of the store\u2019s function of providing information to students regarding the course materials that are required for their classes,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cOur mission as established by provisions in the HEOA is to provide course material information whether these materials must be purchased or can be accessed through an open source platform.\u201d\n\nSanders went on to say that he could consider OERs a positive development but that they also can lead to several problems, including the quality control involved in offering something for free and the problem of relying on grant money for OERs long term.\n\n\u201cThe shortcoming of established programs is what happens when the grant money runs out?\u201d Sanders asked. \u201cHow are OER materials kept up to date in the long term?\u201d\n\nProblems like this could explain why bills on the affordability of college have had trouble in Congress before, including the Affordable College Textbook Act itself. The bill is on its second run after it was presented to Congress back in 2013 by Durbin, but failed to gain any traction and was referred back to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\nHowever, some textbook bills have been met with success, such as the Higher Education Opportunity Act, a bill passed in 2008 known as HEOA that provides financial aid for disabled students and requires the Government Accountability Office to report on college textbooks pricing and provide data to the public.\n\nSeveral colleges across the country have already begun experimenting with OER use. Supported by a grant from Durbin, the University of Illinois began offering a free introductory textbook that covered 11 different broad interest topics. South Florida Community College also began offering free online textbooks on certain subjects such as physics or biology through a company called OpenStax, a nonprofit digital distributor of open textbooks. OpenStax biology textbooks were introduced to University of Georgia last year and were estimated to have saved $100 each for more than 2,000 students.\n\nAnother benefit to open textbook services like OpenStax is that they can be edited by teachers on the spot. A teacher can even customize a textbook for his or her area of a specific class as well as correcting spelling or grammatical errors on the spot instead of waiting for the next edition to have the right information.\n\nThere are several other publishers of open textbooks in the United States, including the Boston-based company Boundless and the MIT-run OpenCourseWare. To afford to offer open textbooks, publishers of OERs often offer hard copy editions of their textbooks for money. Some, like OpenStax, are able to run because of donations from foundations such as 20 Million Minds and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe Affordable College Textbook Act is attempting to make this practice more common by offering grants to colleges that use OERs to help make up the lost revenue from book sales.\n\n\u201cWhen buying a textbook becomes a barrier to education, you know something has to be changed, and that\u2019s exactly what we want to achieve with the Affordable College Textbook Act,\u201d said Hinojosa in the bill\u2019s official press release.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Technician", "description": "The Affordable College Textbook Act addresses problems students have with rising textbook costs year after year and, if passed, will provide grant money to colleges who create or expand open textbook programs.
