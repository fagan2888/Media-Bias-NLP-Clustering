Florida Governor Rick Scott may have just ordered coffee when he visited his local Gainesville, Florida Starbucks, but he also got a grande-sized confrontation to go!

On Tuesday, the politician received a piping hot reception during a trip to the coffee chain when a woman called him out for refusing to expand Medicaid to low-income residents!

The Republican was a bit caught off guard when a caffeinated patron called him an "asshole" in a heated exchange, saying:

"You cut Medicaid, so I couldn't get Obamacare. You're an asshole. You don't care about working people. … You should be ashamed to show your face around here."

Last year, Scott vocally opposed Obamacare, arguing the state could not "take on even more federal programs." And clearly, that firm stance didn't sit well with the residents who could greatly benefit from the Medicaid expansion.

According to Stephen Bender, who shot and uploaded the confrontation, the woman — whom he identified as Cara Jennings — began by questioning why the governor signed a bill that "strip[s] women of access to public health care."

And after Scott responded by saying he helped create 1 million jobs in the state — she totally went off, shouting at the politician until his team left the building!
