Soderberg was tagged as Colorado\u2019s No. 2 centerman and would log significant minutes on the power play and penalty kill \u2014 while the four young return pieces from the Sabres would become building blocks for the future.\n\nMonday against the Jets at the MTS Centre, Soderberg shined in leading Colorado to another Central Division triumph.\n\nSoderberg scored during a delayed penalty and assisted on Jarome Iginla\u2019s power-play goal in the Avs\u2019 2-1 win. Both goals from the visitors came in the second period, when the Avs produced 16 shots and overcame a shoddy start in front of goalie Semyon Varlamov (36 saves).\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\nWinnipeg scored its goal with 41.6 seconds remaining on a 6-on-5 attack. About five minutes earlier, Jets leading scorer Blake Wheeler had a shot clang off Varlamov\u2019s right post.\n\nVarlamov was in goal what Soderberg was at the other end: clutch.\n\n\u201cI think we played a strong game,\u201d said the softspoken Soderberg, who logged 17:30 of ice time. \u201cWhen you get a lead, it\u2019s so much easier. You can stay patient and wait for their mistakes. That\u2019s what we did tonight.\u201d\n\nThe visitors improved to 10-3-1 in hockey\u2019s toughest division and 3-0 against the Jets.\n\nHad Winnipeg (21-22-3) won, it would have tied Colorado (23-21-3) with 47 points. Instead, the Avs increased their lead to four points over the Jets and leapfrogged Nashville for the last wild-card playoff position in the Western Conference.\n\n\u201cFour-point games have been good for us so far,\u201d said Avs coach Patrick Roy, referring to divisional games. \u201cWe need to continue this.\u201d\n\nSoderberg scored his ninth goal of the season 1:16 into the second penalty on a 6-on-5 attack after the Jets committed a penalty and Varlamov skated off for an extra attacker. Colorado doubled its lead at 19:42 of the period when Iginla took Soderberg\u2019s cross-ice pass and buried a snap shot behind rookie goalie Connor Hellebuyck for the veteran\u2019s 602nd career goal.\n\n\u201cThey all feel good,\u201d Iginla said after being asked how 602 felt. \u201cWhen you get a power-play goal and are able to go into the third 2-0 in a big game, it felt good as a group. In the third, we know what we had to do \u2014 a good push and hold them off.\u201d\n\nWhen Iginla scored, Winnipeg\u2019s Blake Wheeler was serving an interference minor for a blind-side hit on Cody McLeod against the boards. Iginla\u2019s goal \u2014 the 184th power-play tally of his career \u2014 made him the 18th highest goal-scorer of all time. He was in a tie for Jari Kurri at 601.\n\nThe Avalanche was outshot 16-8 in the third period and 37-34 overall, but it recorded 21 of the game\u2019s 29 blocked shots.\n\nSoderberg and wingers Gabe Landeskog and Blake Comeau combined for nine shots.\n\n\u201cOur entire team played really well tonight,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat (Soderderg) line played solid, and I used them a lot in our zone in penalty killing. They had a lot of ice time, and I thought they responded well to that challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Avs host Buffalo at the Pepsi Center on Wednesday in the first game between the teams since their big trade last summer.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @MikeChambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carl Soderberg, Jarome Iginla score goals as Avalanche beats Jets", "title": "Carl Soderberg, Jarome Iginla score goals as Avalanche beats Jets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/18/carl-soderberg-jarome-iginla-score-goals-as-avalanche-beats-jets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160118__avs-goalp1.jpg", "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160118__avs-goalp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-18T20:34:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:34:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Soderberg scored during a delayed penalty and assisted on Jarome Iginla\u2019s power-play goal in the Avs\u2019 2-1 win.\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba \u2014 Two days before Ryan O\u2019Reilly\u2019s reunion in Denver, Carl Soderberg on Monday further proved his value as O\u2019Reilly\u2019s replacement.\nMonday against the Jets at the MTS Centre, Soderberg shined in leading Colorado to another Central Division triumph.\n\u201cWhen you get a power-play goal and are able to go into the third 2-0 in a big game, it felt good as a group.\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike ChambersWinnipeg scored its goal with 41.6 seconds remaining on a 6-on-5 attack."}
