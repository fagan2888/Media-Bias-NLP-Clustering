Most kids look forward to that annual trip to Staples, but there are many parents who can't afford a place to live, let alone new school supplies for their kids. Volunteers of America is giving people a way to help homeless children through its Operation Backpack campaign.\n\nVOA is urging those who are able to fill a backpack with school supplies, which will be given to a homeless child before school starts in August. The backpack and school supply drive runs from July 14 through August 8 with drop-off centers at every Duane Reade across all five boroughs. You can even buy the school supplies at Duane Reade and drop it off in the donation box while you're there.\n\nThe VOA's goal is to give out 16,500 new backpacks with school supplies and distribute them to every child in the New York City shelter system in mid-August.
