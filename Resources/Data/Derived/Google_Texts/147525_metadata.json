Despite advocacy groups\u2019\n\nIncreasing pressure on federal regulators to ramp up protections, very little has been done.\n\nDigital phone hacking has been going on for years, but with the help of the Internet, hackers are more easily able to break into company phone systems and quickly bilk them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent phone charges. Last year, the swindle cost victims nearly $5 billion\u2014a major jump from $1 billion in 2011, The New York Times reported.\n\nRelated: The Caller ID Scheme You Must Know About\n\nAccording to telecommunications fraud experts, the scheme involves premium rate phone numbers\u2014the 1-900 numbers used for psychic or sexual chat lines that charge callers more than $1 per minute.\n\nHackers lease these numbers then break into a business\u2019s phone system\u2014usually a small business that doesn\u2019t have advanced security software. Using high-speed computers, they make hundreds of calls to the pay lines simultaneously- driving up the bill. The hackers then rake in a cut of the charges\u2014up to 24 cents per minute per call.\n\nIn one instance, \u201chackers broke into the phone system of Foreman Seeley Fountain Architecture, a small Georgia-based architecture firm, and made $166,000 worth of calls from the firm to premium-rate telephone numbers in Gambia, Somalia and the Maldives,\u201d The Times noted. The complaint filed with the Federal Communications Commission said it would have taken the company 34 years to run up those charges, based on its average phone bill. Though most companies settle these charges with their phone provider, it often entails an expensive and lengthy legal process\u2014sometimes costing thousands of dollars.\n\nThis type of fraud is so widespread that U.S. officials have even suggested that the scheme has been used to fund terrorist activities. In 2011, the FBI arrested four people for hacking into AT&T customers\u2019 servers and defrauding businesses out of more than $2 million. That money was allegedly directed to a Saudi Arabian militant group that U.S. officials say financed the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. AT&T eventually reimbursed all consumers.\n\nRelated: 4 Scams Consumers Must Avoid\n\n\u201cPremium rate numbers are begging to be used for fraud,\u201d Jim Dalton, founder of TransNexus, an Internet calling management software company, said in a statement on the company\u2019s website. \u201cThe premium rate number business model made sense before VoIP technology was available. Now, a whole eco-system has evolved that makes traffic pumping fraud to premium rate numbers an easy endeavor for anyone.\u201d\n\nThe FCC has set up guidelines about how to govern these numbers\u2014since they are so vulnerable to fraudulent use. Consumers can submit complaints on the regulators\u2019 website. Still industry groups don\u2019t think the agency has gone far enough in protecting against these kinds of schemes.\n\nRoberta Aronoff, the executive director of the Communications Fraud Control Association works directly with federal agencies like the FBI to help catch fraudsters. Aronoff\u2019s organization routinely flags numbers suspected of being part of the scheme\u2014into a fraud management system so carriers can block them.\n\nStill, lawmakers and advocates say the FCC should do more. Last year, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called on the FCC and tech industry to increase fraud protections within cell phone companies\u2014after a handful of small businesses in New York were slapped with fraudulent phone charges.\n\nRelated: Duped! The 5 Worst Recession Scams\n\n\u201cDozens of New York small businesses have fallen prey to these hackers through their voicemail systems, and are often forced to cover the cost for weeks-worth of overseas calls,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cThe telecom industry and the Federal Communications Commission must do more to detect these fraudsters, to stop or prevent the deceptive charges as quickly as possible, and to protect small business owners from the financial impact.\u201d\n\nSince then, however, there has been little movement on any type of federal regulation or industry-wide policy aimed at dealing with these schemes. Still, it continues hampering small businesses. The FCC could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s relentless,\u201d TransNexus\u2019s Dalton told The New York Times. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize their phone is a six-figure liability waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A broad phone hacking scheme targeting vulnerable small businesses is costing victims", "title": "Is a $5 Billion Phone Hacking Scam Too Small to Nail for the FCC?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/20/5-Billion-Phone-Hacking-Scam-Too-Small-Nail-FCC", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/20/5-Billion-Phone-Hacking-Scam-Too-Small-Nail-FCC", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A broad phone hacking scheme targeting vulnerable small businesses is costing victims", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A broad phone hacking scheme targeting vulnerable small businesses is costing victims billions of dollars each year.\nLast year, the swindle cost victims nearly $5 billion\u2014a major jump from $1 billion in 2011, The New York Times reported.\nHackers lease these numbers then break into a business\u2019s phone system\u2014usually a small business that doesn\u2019t have advanced security software.\nStill, it continues hampering small businesses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s relentless,\u201d TransNexus\u2019s Dalton told The New York Times."}
