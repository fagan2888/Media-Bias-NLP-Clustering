He is very cool tempered. He would often caution us not to get caught up in whatever the fight of the moment. Now, I think that\u2019s a strength. But it also can sometimes mean you\u2019re going to lose the fight of the moment in the media.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip below, via CNN:\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former White House Press Secretary and current CNN contributor Jay Carney described his former boss' media habits on Reliable Sources Sunday morning, telling", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/carney1.jpg", "title": "Jay Carney: Obama Doesn\u2019t Watch Cable News, \u2018Is Aware\u2019 of Fox"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former White House Press Secretary and current CNN contributor Jay Carney described his former boss' media habits on Reliable Sources Sunday morning, telling host Brian Stelter that President Barack Obama maintains awareness of cable news' outrages du jour but keeps far away from them.", "title": "Jay Carney: Obama Doesn't Watch Cable News, 'Is Aware' of Fox", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/carney1.jpg", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-10-26T13:21:42+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6b72\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s a voracious consumer of the printed word, even the electronic printed word,\u201d Carney said, listing a series of print and web publications like the New York Times and Politico.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hyperventilate about the political crises of the moment,\u201d Carney said.\n\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t watch cable news.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention Fox News\u2019 website,\u201d Stelter pointed out.\nBut he maintains a healthy distance.\u201dCarney also addressed the new Bloomberg Businessweek cover, which shows Obama cool \u2014 some might say too cool \u2014 to the challenges of his presidency.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be accurate to say that by not watching cable news he\u2019s not aware of what the political fight of the day is."}
