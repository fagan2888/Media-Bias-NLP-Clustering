Did you get the memo?: "Work too many hours at Staples, and you might get fired"—because of Obamacare.

A number of Staples store managers are now threatening to discipline part-time workers—"up to and including termination"—if they clock in for more than 25 hours on the job per week, a new report reveals.

Those draconian threats at the office-supply store giant coincide with the start in January of Obamacare regulations that require large employers to offer affordable health insurance coverage to employees who work 30 hours or more per week, or pay a fine of up to $3,000 per worker.

While Staples denies the new threats that could send workers dusting off their resumes have any connection with the Affordable Care Act, employees who spoke with BuzzFeed News suggested there was a clear link.

"Before January, it was a smack on the wrist if anyone went over 25 hours—they got an email scolding them saying, 'You went over 25, try not to do that,' a Staples employee told BuzzFeed News, which first reported the threats of termination.

"But now it's become really serious...they've threatened to write up managers and every person that goes over 25 hours."
