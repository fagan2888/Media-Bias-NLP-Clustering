The deal, according to Lars Dalgaard, an Andreessen Horowitz partner, was unusually competitive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a deal like this,\u201d Mr. Dalgaard said. \u201cThe top five firms all asked me personally whether they could get a chance to get in.\u201d\n\nInvestors, Mr. Dalgaard said, were looking for \u201cevery creative way in the world to try to get a piece of it,\u201d including by asking to buy out seed investors in the company.\n\nIn addition to Andreessen Horowitz, investors in the financing round included the investment firms Maverick and Venrock. Zenefits, which is based in San Francisco, did not disclose the valuation at which it raised the money. The latest financing round brings its total amount of money raised to $17.1 million.\n\nThough the human resources business may seem \u201cboring,\u201d it is ripe with opportunity, especially in relation to small and midsize businesses, said Parker Conrad, the chief executive of Zenefits. The Affordable Care Act, for one, is poised to created a flood of additional compliance tasks for companies, he said.\n\n\u201cWe see this opportunity to be the service that automates and mechanizes all of that for small businesses,\u201d Mr. Conrad said.\n\nZenefits offers free software to companies. It makes money primarily as an insurance broker by selling health insurance plans to businesses. The company says that, from its start in early 2013 through the end of November, it has doubled the number of employees using its service every six weeks.\n\nA larger rival, Workday, has been a stock market darling since its initial public offering in 2012. The stock, which had its debut at $28 a share, closed at $93.15 on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Dalgaard, the Andreessen Horowitz partner, is joining the board of Zenefits in connection with the investment. The founder and former chief executive of the human resources software company SuccessFactors, Mr. Dalgaard is seen by Zenefits as a valuable adviser.\n\nThat may help explain why Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s bid in the financing round was the lowest among the lot.\n\n\u201cWe feel there should be a price for the support function that we offer,\u201d Mr. Dalgaard said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140122143836, "BN": "dealbook", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/dealbook", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/dealbook/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 22, 2014", "org": "Andreessen Horowitz;Venrock Associates", "keywords": "Cloud Computing,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Human Resources,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,Venture Capital,Andreessen Horowitz,Venrock Associates,Financial Services,Technology,Venture Capital", "GBLC": "Financial Services;Technology;Venture Capital", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/dealbook/Andreessen Horowitz Invests in Human Resources Firm Zenefits ( 20140122 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "William Alden", "SCG": "Dealbook", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "William Alden", "byl": "William Alden", "twitter": {"description": "The start-up, whose cloud-based software helps small businesses manage compliance and human resources-related tasks, said on Wednesday that it had raised $15 million in a financing round.", "title": "Andreessen Horowitz Invests in Human Resources Firm Zenefits", "url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/andreessen-horowitz-invests-in-human-resources-firm-zenefits/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/23/business/dbpix-conrad/dbpix-conrad-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "site": "@dealbook", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002665108, "description": "The start-up, whose cloud-based software helps small businesses manage compliance and human resources-related tasks, said on Wednesday that it had raised $15 million in a financing round.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 22, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Venture Capital", "published_time": 1390419516, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-22T19:55:10-05:00"}, "utime": 20140122195510, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140122, "pdate": 20140122, "des": "Cloud Computing;Health Insurance and Managed Care;Human Resources;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Small Business;Venture Capital", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/23/business/dbpix-conrad/dbpix-conrad-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "DealBook", "description": "The start-up, whose cloud-based software helps small businesses manage compliance and human resources-related tasks, said on Wednesday that it had raised $15 million in a financing round.", "title": "Andreessen Horowitz Invests in Human Resources Firm Zenefits", "url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/andreessen-horowitz-invests-in-human-resources-firm-zenefits/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/23/business/dbpix-conrad/dbpix-conrad-videoSixteenByNine600-v2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/andreessen-horowitz-invests-in-human-resources-firm-zenefits/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Andreessen Horowitz Invests in Human Resources Firm Zenefits", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/23/business/dbpix-conrad/dbpix-conrad-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc24a\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Dalgaard, the Andreessen Horowitz partner, is joining the board of Zenefits in connection with the investment.\nIn addition to Andreessen Horowitz, investors in the financing round included the investment firms Maverick and Venrock.\nThe deal, according to Lars Dalgaard, an Andreessen Horowitz partner, was unusually competitive.\nThe founder and former chief executive of the human resources software company SuccessFactors, Mr. Dalgaard is seen by Zenefits as a valuable adviser.\n\u201cWe feel there should be a price for the support function that we offer,\u201d Mr. Dalgaard said."}
