But Fox News hosts and amateur sociologists Harris Faulkner and Andrea Tantaros know from Faulkner\u2019s twitter feed that it\u2019s at least partly President Obama\u2019s fault.\n\nWe have long documented Faulkner\u2019s record of slyly acting as a Republican mouthpiece. Here she did it by just happening to single out an anonymous tweeter, \u201cLove USA 4\u201d (I could not find the account) from her Twitter feed and validating it. After noting that a trend toward delaying marriage might be part of the reason, Faulkner announced:\n\nI'm looking at my Twitter feed. Love USA 4 says, \"Couples no longer are getting married for one reason only.\u201d She (the tweeter) says. \u201cThe White House administration punishes married through the purse. Singles do better financially.\u201d\n\nYes, who needs research when you have Twitter?\n\nCo-host Andrea Tantaros, who once urged people to \u201cdo me a favor\u201d and punch an Obama supporter \u201cin the face,\u201d quickly agreed. \u201cOf course! Look at ObamaCare! It is much cheaper to be single or to get divorced. And there\u2019s actually something called the ObamaCare divorce\u2026\u201d\n\nKirsten Powers called this out, laughing: \u201cOK! This is not Obama\u2019s fault!\u201d\n\nBut \u201cPunch\u201d Tantaros was not to be dissuaded.\n\nKirsten, you \u2013 come on. I mean, you can laugh about it. But they are disincentivizing marriage through the policies that Washington put out because if you get people to separate, then women \u2013 The Life of Julia, remember that? - become more dependent on the government. It is cheaper under ObamaCare to not be married.\n\nPowers said this is a \u201ctrend\u201d that \u201chas been going on for a long time, now. Even the show\u2019s #OneLuckyGuy, Jonah Goldberg (no Obama fan) agreed that while there are marriage penalties, \u201cit\u2019s a much larger trend.\u201d\n\nWatch the discussion below and do note how Powers is the only co-host whose dress is not hiked up.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "QhD+brJX7+nKTrF/6Cz+Uoggih7Mlr8ooWyPvt7qaQ0=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/outnumbered_hosts_blame_drop_in_marriages_on_obama_09192014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Outnumbered Hosts Blame Drop In Marriages On Obama"}, "Title": "Outnumbered Hosts Blame Drop In Marriages On Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3d5\"", "article_summary": "But Fox News hosts and amateur sociologists Harris Faulkner and Andrea Tantaros know from Faulkner\u2019s twitter feed that it\u2019s at least partly President Obama\u2019s fault.\nAfter noting that a trend toward delaying marriage might be part of the reason, Faulkner announced:I'm looking at my Twitter feed.\nHere she did it by just happening to single out an anonymous tweeter, \u201cLove USA 4\u201d (I could not find the account) from her Twitter feed and validating it.\nCo-host Andrea Tantaros, who once urged people to \u201cdo me a favor\u201d and punch an Obama supporter \u201cin the face,\u201d quickly agreed.\nLove USA 4 says, \"Couples no longer are getting married for one reason only.\u201d She (the tweeter) says."}
