The truce, set to kick in midnight on Saturday.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand : \u201c[W]hile the agreement may succeed in establishing a cease-fire by mid-February, it is likely to leave Russia and the separatists it supports holding the upper hand in eastern Ukraine for months, if not longer.\u201d\n\n* Confirmed : \u201cThe Senate on Thursday easily approved President Barack Obama\u2019s pick to head the Pentagon, confirming the fourth secretary of defense in six years. In a 93 to 5 vote, the Senate approved Ashton Carter to head the Department of Defense to help lead the U.S. response to Islamic extremists, Russian-back militants in Ukraine, and an end to the war in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nAn overdue law : \u201cPresident Obama signed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act Thursday that will provide $22 million to help boost programs that look to reduce the veteran suicide rate that has climbed to 22 veterans each day.\u201d\n\n* More on this in the morning: \u201cThe same federal judge who last month struck down Alabama\u2019s same-sex marriage ban has ordered a probate judge to begin issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples.\u201d\n\n* Afghanistan : \u201cThat night the Afghans and Americans got their man, Abu Bara al-Kuwaiti. They also came away with what officials from both countries say was an even bigger prize: a laptop computer and files detailing Qaeda operations on both sides of the border.\u201d\n\n* An important speech : \u201cIn a rare move by a top Justice Department official, F.B.I. Director James Comey on Thursday addressed the tenuous relationship between law enforcement and many African Americans, acknowledging \u2018hard truths\u2019 about the current state of race relations and policing.\u201d\n\nSome eight million metric tons of plastic waste makes its way into the world\u2019s oceans each year, and the amount of the debris is likely to increase greatly over the next decade unless nations take strong measures to dispose of their trash responsibly, new research suggests.\u201d Scary stuff : \u201c\n\n* Gail Collins : \u201c[The Affordable Care Act] is apparently working better than any of us imagined\u2026. Really, Obamacare is terrific. You can tell by looking at the people who are against it.\u201d\n\n* Watching this really was a little creepy: \u201cAs a lawmaker addressed his colleagues about legislation on Capitol Hill Tuesday, at least one congressman appeared to have his mind on other matters. Video captured by C-SPAN shows Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) winking at the camera and apparently texting during a speech by his colleague on the House floor on Tuesday.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Today's edition of quick hits.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/thursdays-mini-report-21215", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Today's edition of quick hits.", "title": "Thursday's Mini-Report, 2.12.15", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/thursdays-mini-report-21215", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/maddow_theminireport_general.png?itok=yLUr4wsw", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Thursday's Mini-Report, 2.12.15", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/thursdays-mini-report-21215", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/maddow_theminireport_general.png?itok=HBMEr8oq", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Today's edition of quick hits."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-12T17:30:54-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Today's edition of quick hits.", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Thursday's Mini-Report, 2.12.15", "published": 1, "date": "02/12/2015 17:30:54 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/thursdays-mini-report-21215"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd168c\"", "article_summary": "winking at the camera and apparently texting during a speech by his colleague on the House floor on Tuesday.\u201d\nReally, Obamacare is terrific.\nVideo captured by C-SPAN shows Rep.
