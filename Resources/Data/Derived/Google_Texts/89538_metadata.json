While the offer has been on the table since Obamacare passed in 2010, just 29 states and Washington, D.C. have opted to expand their Medicaid programs with mostly federal dollars so far.\n\n\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has made clear that the federal government cannot compel states to administer federal programs, and [centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019] recent decisions to deny unrelated federal health care funding based on a state\u2019s non-expansion of Medicaid constitutes unlawful coercion,\u201d the 10 attorneys general wrote.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency which runs both Obamacare and Medicaid, told Florida earlier this year that it would no longer fund a Low Income Pool through Medicaid unless Florida expanded its full Medicaid program under Obamacare\u2013 a change that allows those earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line to seek the taxpayer-provided coverage.

In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision in the Affordable Care Act that said the federal government could cease providing any Medicaid funding to states that turned down the expansion was unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court said that it is up to the states to decide whether to expand their Medicaid programs,\u201d Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt said Tuesday. \u201cThe federal government may provide incentive for expansion, but it may not punish states for declining expansion by withdrawing unrelated financial support for other programs.\u201d\n\nThe 10 states \u2013Texas, Kansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Utah\u2013 are asking Congress to investigate CMS\u2019s actions. The Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on the matter Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFlorida has sued CMS for unlawful coercive expansion of the state\u2019s Medicaid program and Texas and Kansas are providing amicus support in that litigation,\u201d the letter concludes. \u201cWhile CMS\u2019 unlawful action will play out in the court system, we welcome assistance from Congress in reigning-in CMS, an agency insistent on trampling the rights of our sovereign states to make critical policy decisions regarding Medicaid, and in terminating funding for critical health services, imperiling the lives of our most vulnerable citizens.\u201d\n\nEncouraging more states to adopt the Medicaid expansion has been a pet project of new Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. While Democratic-led states have typically gotten onboard with the expansion, most Republican-led states continue to oppose broadening the welfare program, with some notable exceptions, such as Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
