Rapid weight loss doesn\u2019t give the skin much time to shrink back to its usual tautness, so loose skin remains. But for John Glaude, the loose skin that resulted from his 160-pound weight loss over the course of seven months isn\u2019t something to run from.\n\nGlaude sometimes hides his excess belly skin under his waistband and wears pants over shorts, but he knows the skin is a sign of accomplishment. In a recent vlog post, he encouraged people to adopt the same mentality. \u201cI want people watching this video to understand that you should never let loose skin or anything else stop you from going for your dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my dreams are to be very happy in my skin.\u201d\n\nIn the post, Glaude takes off his shirt on-camera for the first time. Generally, he says, he tries to minimize the amount of exposure his excess skin gets, because he knows it\u2019s less than ideal. As part of his transformation, he wanted to break that mindset, both for himself and for the people watching who may be on a similar journey.\n\n\u201cLoose skin and all, I\u2019m happy with where I\u2019ve come from and where I am at now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is who I am, and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "john, glaudes, loose, skin, after, weight, loss, 160, pounds, isnt, holding, him, back", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Losing 160 pounds in seven months left John Glaude with a lot of excess skin.
