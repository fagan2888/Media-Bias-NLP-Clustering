That\u2019s left many fast-growing suburban districts scrounging for cash, while poorer - and often shrinking - districts in many urban and rural areas get more money to serve students in poverty and those learning English.\n\nRevenue projections indicate the Republican-dominated Legislature won\u2019t have much additional money to work with as it puts together a new two-year state budget by the end of April. And other education items will be competing for funding, including Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s proposal to lift the cap on the state\u2019s private school voucher program and increase funding for charter schools.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, says all those education plans \u201ccould be pretty expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just doubt there\u2019s going to be enough money to take every education initiative that everybody is going to come up with and make it work,\u201d Kenley said. \u201cIt all depends on having the money.\u201d\n\nSpending on K-12 education makes up nearly half of the current year\u2019s $15 billion state budget. But tax revenues are projected to grow just 2.4 percent during the new budget\u2019s first year and 3.2 percent in the second year.\n\nThat could create challenges for legislative leaders as they try to boost the base per-student funding enough to close the gap and address Pence\u2019s call to expand the voucher program that currently serves 30,000 students. Currently, vouchers are capped at $4,800 per elementary school pupil.\n\nLeaders of some urban and rural districts worry that they\u2019ll end up being hurt.\n\nMany districts can\u2019t absorb funding cuts without hurting school programs and their ability to help attract businesses, said Robert Haworth, superintendent of the Elkhart Community Schools in northern Indiana.\n\nThe 13,000-student Elkhart district is among the better funded in the state, with more than half its students qualifying for the federal free lunch program. It also has a large Hispanic immigrant population, with Haworth saying much of its additional funding goes toward teaching English to about 4,000 students.\n\n\u201cThe narrowing of that gap is not served by bringing those that have greater funding down, it\u2019s by creating a floor in funding that no school district should fall below,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the opposite end of the scale among Indiana\u2019s nearly 300 districts is Hamilton Southeastern Schools in suburban Indianapolis, where state funding has fallen by $300 per student since 2009, according to district Chief Financial Officer Mike Reuter.\n\nThe district, which has grown 50 percent over the past decade and now has some 21,000 students, has some third- and fourth-grade classes with more than 30 pupils and a single teacher, Reuter said.\n\nResidents approved a property tax increase in 2009 to provide extra money, and the district has sold some property to make ends meet. But Reuter said school programs will start to suffer without more money from the state.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to keep up with what we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand that other districts need money, too, but don\u2019t leave us behind.\u201d\n\nPolitics could enter the funding debate, as Republicans largely represent the state\u2019s suburban and rural districts, while most of the badly outnumbered Democratic legislators are from urban areas.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson, said he worries that revamping the funding system will pit school districts against each other and end up hurting urban districts that are struggling to improve student performance.\n\nLanane said he also is concerned about proposals to take away authority from Democratic state schools Superintendent Glenda Ritz and called Pence\u2019s push for removing the cap on state voucher payments a \u201crisky proposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just headed down this idea of vouchers and now to say we want to increase it even more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ought to put the brakes on it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana lawmakers could face a prickly debate as they aim to tighten up funding differences between the state's school districts during the General Assembly session that starts Tuesday.", "Author": "TOM DAVIES", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Indiana lawmakers could face a prickly debate as they aim to tighten up funding differences between the state\u2019s school districts during the General Assembly session that starts Tuesday.", "title": "Indiana legislators eye school funding revamp", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/3/indiana-legislators-eye-school-funding-revamp/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/e6cb46aa802f35006a0f6a706700b15b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/e6cb46aa802f35006a0f6a706700b15b.jpg", "title": "Indiana legislators eye school funding revamp", "description": "Indiana lawmakers could face a prickly debate as they aim to tighten up funding differences between the state's school districts during the General Assembly session that starts Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Indiana lawmakers could face a prickly debate as they aim to tighten up funding differences between the state\u2019s school districts during the General Assembly session that starts Tuesday.\n\u201cThe narrowing of that gap is not served by bringing those that have greater funding down, it\u2019s by creating a floor in funding that no school district should fall below,\u201d he said.\nMike Pence\u2019s proposal to lift the cap on the state\u2019s private school voucher program and increase funding for charter schools.\nSenate Minority Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson, said he worries that revamping the funding system will pit school districts against each other and end up hurting urban districts that are struggling to improve student performance.\nMany districts can\u2019t absorb funding cuts without hurting school programs and their ability to help attract businesses, said Robert Haworth, superintendent of the Elkhart Community Schools in northern Indiana."}
