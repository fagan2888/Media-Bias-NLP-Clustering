Hamline Ave., has been sold to Walgreen\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt was the right business decision but will never be the right heart decision,\u201d co-owner Richard Zunker said. \u201cI would have preferred to have stayed here for the next 20 years.\u201d\n\nThe pharmacy closed on Wednesday, April 27, but the store will be open through the end of May to liquidate its stock of greeting cards, giftware and medical supplies. Zunker and partner Robert Koziol do not own the building, but have a lease that runs through November.\n\nKoziol is planning to retire but Zunker, who is 48, is taking a position at a friend\u2019s pharmacy in Blaine.\n\nZunker and Koziol bought Blomberg\u2019s from Julie Johnson and Norma Nisle eight years ago. They were the fourth owners of the pharmacy, which opened in 1943. Zunker and Koziol also owned Erickson Drug in Lakeville, which they also sold to Walgreen\u2019s.\n\nClosing Blomberg\u2019s wasn\u2019t an easy decision, Zunker said, but with customers being pressured by insurance companies to get their prescriptions filled through mail order and the increased paperwork resulting from the federal Affordable Care Act, small independent drugstores are being squeezed, he said. Insurance companies are offering \u201czero co-pays,\u201d something his store and other independents can\u2019t offer.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that large chains have moved in and the \u201cyounger generation doesn\u2019t see the value in small independents,\u201d Zucker said.\n\nErickson Drug was the last independent drugstore in Dakota County, \u201cand that\u2019s a pretty big county,\u201d he said. \u201cSooner or later all that will be left are big chains. I guess all good things must come to an end.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thank everybody for the business they have given us over the years, but it wasn\u2019t enough because of factors out of my control and out of the patients\u2019 control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "A fixture in Falcon Heights and the Como Park neighborhood for more than 70 years, Blomberg Pharmacy, 1583 N.
