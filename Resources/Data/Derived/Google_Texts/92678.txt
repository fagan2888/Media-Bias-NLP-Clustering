The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently launched the Prevention of HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STDs, and TB through Health Care website. This online resource is intended to help state, tribal, local, and territorial public health agencies, community- and faith-based organizations, and other partners leverage changes in the health system to strengthen the delivery of HIV, viral hepatitis, STDs, and TB preventive services. This new website addresses three primary areas of focus:

Each of these topic areas offers information to help guide development of approaches to strengthen prevention program objectives through the provision of health care. In-depth information is provided regarding current and foreseeable changes to the health system; implications of these changes for public health program objectives; and resources to improve access to and use of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, STD, and TB preventive services.

To supplement this content, the website also includes:

Preventive Service Tables – a set of tables to share information on program-specific preventive services available without cost-sharing.

Resources – a list of online references related to health system changes and the relevant partners and players.

Supporting Health Departments – Next Steps – a concept plan to identify opportunities to assist in strategy development.

Updates to the Web site will be ongoing. Users can sign-up to be notified of future website updates by subscribing to Prevention Through Health Care (PTHC) email updates .

I hope you will take time to visit the site and that you find it useful in helping you navigate the changing health system.
