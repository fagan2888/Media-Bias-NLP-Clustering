Marina, who sought the country\u2019s highest office after the death of her running mate in August, ultimately fell short, coming in third in voting this week behind Dilma and A\u00e9cio Neves, who now enter a runoff. But the achievements of Dilma, Brazil\u2019s first female president, and Marina, who would have been Brazil\u2019s first black female president, do not reflect broader gains by women in the general election on Sunday. In this year\u2019s presidential, gubernatorial, and legislative races, the number of female candidates for the first time reached 30 percent\u2014the level defined by a quota law, implemented in the mid-1990s, that specifies the minimum percentage of each gender who must be on party lists in legislative elections. Still, these candidates didn\u2019t win their races in similar numbers; women will occupy only 10 percent of seats in the new National Congress, or only six more seats than the total following the last two elections. No woman was elected as a state governor, though one is competing in a second round of voting in Roraima state. In the last election in 2010, two women were elected governor. All this at a time when women voted in unprecedented numbers, representing 52 percent of the 143 million Brazilians who went to the polls this week. Related Story When Presidential Candidates Have to Please Priests What explains the gulf between female candidates and female office-holders? Some critics of the quota law argue that while it incentivizes women to enter politics and obligates political parties to invest a small portion of government-allocated funds in recruiting and designing programming for female candidates, those candidates themselves then often receive little financial support. \u201cParties receive donations and choose in which candidates they will invest this money. And most of [these candidates] aren\u2019t women,\u201d said Celi Pinto, a political-science professor at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (in Brazil, donations can go to parties or individual candidates). \u201cThe quotas have never been a threat to men\u2019s power in politics.\u201d\n\nIn fact, while women on average hold 25 percent of parliamentary seats in Latin America and the Caribbean (the highest regional average in the world), that figure hovers around 10 percent in Brazil. On the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)\u2019s ranking of 189 countries by female representation in parliament, Brazil ranks 131st, with women holding 9 percent of seats in the country\u2019s lower house as of 2010 (women held 16 percent of seats in the upper house). The questions and challenges surrounding quotas are at the center of the debate about how best to build more democratic, representative nations. Roughly 45 countries have introduced electoral gender quotas by law, and political parties in dozens more have adopted voluntary quotas (the United States, which ranks 85th on the IPU\u2019s gender-equity list, is not one of them). But these measures\u2014which vary from carving out a certain number of seats for female lawmakers to mandating a particular percentage of female candidates\u2014are controversial. In 2012, for instance, the IPU attributed an increase in women\u2019s political participation around the world to these policies. \u201cNine out of the top 10 countries which witnessed the highest growth in the number of women MPs in their lower house of parliament had used quotas,\u201d the organization noted. \u201cConversely, seven out of the nine lower houses of parliament that witnessed an actual decrease in women MPs had not used any quotas.\u201d But the IPU also recognized the limitation of quotas, writing that they need to be \u201caccompanied by sanctions for non-compliance,\u201d and that \u201cwomen candidates should be placed in winnable positions on party lists.\u201d As the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Isobel Coleman has written, \u201cQuotas bring women\u2019s voices into political systems where they are otherwise excluded, short-cutting a process that can naturally take generations.\u201d Yet \u201cother factors\u2014like strong political will, enabling women\u2019s freedom of movement, and networks of support for female candidates\u2014significantly strengthen\u201d their effectiveness. \"The quotas have never been a threat to men\u2019s power in politics.\" That effectiveness is very much in doubt in Brazil. The country\u2019s quota law, which initially mandated that only 20 percent of candidates be female, was instituted in 1995 and inspired by calls for quotas at the UN\u2019s Fourth World Conference on Women that same year. According to the Brazilian feminist group CFEMEA, which monitors women\u2019s issues in Congress, women constituted just over 5 percent of the chamber in 1989. Between 1945 and 1982, that figure was below 2 percent.\n\nLuiza Erundina, 79, remembers what it was like to be the first woman elected mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, in 1988. \u201cI was discriminated [against] even inside my party because I\u2019m a woman, a leftist, and from the northeast [one of Brazil\u2019s poorest regions],\u201d she told me. Erundina, who this year served as Marina Silva\u2019s campaign coordinator and was reelected for another term in the Chamber of Deputies, said that Brazil\u2019s campaign-finance system is corrupt and beholden to special economic interests, and that its male-led parties are sexist. In 2002, she tried to pass legislation that set aside 30 percent of each party's candidate-recruitment ads and candidate-training funds for women. Ultimately, the government agreed in 2009 to a limit of 10 percent and 5 percent for these activities, respectively. Erundina has also proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would guarantee one leadership position for a woman on each major congressional committee. Seven years after it was first introduced, the measure has yet to be voted on. One of the few women who has a top party position is Miguelina Vecchio, vice president of the leftist Democratic Labor Party. In June, she threatened to sue her own party unless it geared 10 percent of its recruitment ads toward women, in accordance with Brazilian law. \u201cParties choose women [candidates] with no real intention to be politicians, only to make sure that the votes will go to men,\u201d she said. This year, Vecchio unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. Two days ahead of the vote, I spoke with her by phone while she was traveling to a rally in a city that was almost 190 miles from her hometown, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul state, in southern Brazil. \u201cHow would I pay for the gas I\u2019m using for this trip if I didn\u2019t have the party\u2019s support?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhen I ran for the first time, in 1992, for city council, I didn\u2019t even have a car and did the campaign using public transportation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an electoral crime what parties do to women here\u2014including my party,\u201d she added. In her opinion, 30 percent of legislative posts, not ballot lists, should be reserved for women.\n\nFemale candidates who are recruited merely to fulfill the quota rather than run a serious campaign are known in Brazil as \u201corange candidates\u201d\u2014a term with murky origins\u2014and in March Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello, the president of the Superior Electoral Court, publicly acknowledged their existence. He requested that regulatory bodies be empowered to sue and sanction parties that don\u2019t abide by the quota law. The Court also put out a TV ad to encourage women to register as candidates. The narrator\u2019s voice switches from male to female midway through the ad to emphasize that women\u2019s voices should be heard. Women aren\u2019t the only underrepresented demographic group in Brazilian politics. There are no legally mandated quotas, for instance, for black or indigenous candidates. This year, Brazilians of African descent\u2014which includes those who identify as black or mixed-race, and who make up 51 percent of the population\u2014accounted for 55 percent of all voters. The election marked the first time that the Superior Electoral Court asked candidates to disclose their race, and 41 percent of candidates declared that they were of African descent. But, like women, these candidates are unlikely to be represented in government to the same degree. Official data on the number of self-declared black candidates elected in this year\u2019s election has yet to be released, but in 2012 only two of 81 senators and 43 of 513 deputies considered themselves of African descent. That translates to just under 8 percent of lawmakers in Congress. Brazil, which imported some 4 million Africans as slaves and was the last country in the Americas to outlaw slavery, has instituted quotas for blacks in realms other than politics. In 2004, for example, universities began pursuing affirmative-action policies; now quotas for black, indigenous, and poor Brazilians at public universities add up to 50 percent of the student body. Starting this year, 20 percent of all new federal jobs in government or government-affiliated companies will be designated for Brazilians of African descent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "30 percent of Brazilian candidates must be women.
