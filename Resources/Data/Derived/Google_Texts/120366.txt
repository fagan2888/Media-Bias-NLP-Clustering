MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — As the new year began at midnight, so did benefits for thousands of Minnesotans who signed up for MNsure.

But people were signing up until the deadline passed at midnight for Minnesota’s online health insurance exchange. It left some people unsure if they completed the process in time. MNsure has had several problems with it’s website from the start this fall.

People signing up last minute shared frustrations online. Looking at MNsure’s Facebook page, frustrated comments came in from people claiming to have been on hold for more than three hours and then hung up on. Others complained the website was still not working.

MNsure officials have faced a lot of heat for problems with the exchange and internal leadership since this fall, when it began under the Federal Affordable Care Act.

Late last week, 50,000 people had completed applications to buy private health plans but hadn’t completed enrollment because of website problems or if they just didn’t continue on in the process. Close to 20,000 people had completed enrollment as of Dec. 27, 2013.

Thousands more Minnesotans have until March 31 to sign up, so they aren’t penalized for not having insurance. State officials have encouraged people to sign up before the January 1 deadline to kick off the New Year with insurance.
