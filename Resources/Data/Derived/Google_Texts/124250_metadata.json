The 6-foot-5, 315-pound lineman was done for the night and CSU coach Jim McElwain said after the game that Sambrailo had a medial collateral ligament injury, wouldn\u2019t require surgery, and would be out \u201cat least three weeks.\u201d\n\nSophomore Nick Callender, from Hayward, Calif., replaced him.\n\nThe Rams opened up front with Sambrailo, senior guard Mason Myers, redshirt freshman center Jake Bennett, sophomore guard Fred Zerblis and sophomore right tackle Sam Carlson. So Sambrailo\u2019s exit left the Rams with a senior, three sophomores and a freshman up front.\n\nThat\u2019s the line that was entrusted to both create running room for Hart and his relief, junior college transfer Treyous Jarrells, and to give quarterback Garrett Grayson time to throw. Ultimately, Hart (22 carries, 139 yards) and Jarrells (17 carries, 121 yards) combined for 260 yards while sharing the running back duties, as CSU rebounded from a 17-7 deficit to take the Rams\u2019 second victory over CU in Jim McElwain\u2019s three seasons as head coach.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how proud I am of our offensive line,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cI think they took the game over. Let\u2019s give credit to Nick Callender, who came in for Tyler Sambrailo, who\u2019s a great player, and we didn\u2019t miss a beat.\u201d\n\nIn what seemed to be an acknowledgment that he was the only running back among the Rams\u2019 top four to go through spring ball and he was listed as the starter in the preseason depth chart, converted defensive back Jasen Oden Jr. started in the running back spot. But before he had a carry, Hart came on for the Rams\u2019 third play and gained seven yards on a third-and-14.\n\nBy halftime, Hart \u2014 already an Alabama graduate but still only in his junior season of eligibility \u2014 had provided hints of what was to come. He had 58 yards on 10 carries, including an 8-yard touchdown run.\n\nCSU didn\u2019t completely abandon the plan to spread the workload, though, also using Jarrells to spell Hart. And it worked.\n\nHart and Jarrells \u201cwere pretty good,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cI thought Dee maybe missed a couple where he should have picked his legs up and finished, which I\u2019ve seen him do before. \u2026 I felt really good about our running back situation, and they didn\u2019t disappoint.\u201d\n\nMcElwain called the win \u201chuge \u2026 I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am for the people of Colorado State University and those kids in that locker room.\u201d Yet he seemed surprisingly somber or at least low-key about the win. Asked about that, he said, \u201cI\u2019m excited. This is great. It\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d\n\nHart said of he and Jarrells as a two-man running back combination: \u201cI played against Trey in high school and to compete against him and then have him come here as a one-two punch against Colorado, that was great. That was a great victory.\u201d\n\nHart also was impressed with the Rams\u2019 offensive line. \u201cNick stepped up,\u201d he said. He added that the win \u201cgives us a lot of confidence. We have a lot of young guys up front that stepped up and they did a great job. Just for the CSU program as a whole and for the school, it was just a great start for the 2014 season.\u201d\n\nJarrells said, \u201cMe and Dee have been talking about this since camp. We\u2019re both from Florida and I feel like he\u2019s an older brother for me. He\u2019s coached me up for a lot of things and we said we were going to make it happen this year.\u201d\n\nJarrells also praised the offensive line. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good guys up front,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re nasty.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dee Hart plays big role in first game with CSU", "title": "Dee Hart plays big role in first game with CSU", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/29/dee-hart-plays-big-role-in-first-game-with-csu/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140829__20140830_B8_SPXXPHOTOPAGEp1.jpg", "height": 503}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140829__20140830_B8_SPXXPHOTOPAGEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T22:51:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:03:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd409c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how proud I am of our offensive line,\u201d McElwain said.\nHe\u2019s coached me up for a lot of things and we said we were going to make it happen this year.\u201dJarrells also praised the offensive line.\nThat was a great victory.\u201dHart also was impressed with the Rams\u2019 offensive line.\nCSU didn\u2019t completely abandon the plan to spread the workload, though, also using Jarrells to spell Hart.\nBut before he had a carry, Hart came on for the Rams\u2019 third play and gained seven yards on a third-and-14."}
