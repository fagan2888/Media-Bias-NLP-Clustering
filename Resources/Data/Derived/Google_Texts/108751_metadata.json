But \u201cwhen you mention health care and part-timers and retirees, any of that, it really hits everybody.\u201d\n\nShe and fellow Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) members are out in front of stores asking D.C.-area shoppers to sign a pledge not to cross picket lines at Safeway and Giant if they strike.\n\nThey\u2019re fighting to keep everyone on their health care plan. The 17,000 workers have twice extended their contract to keep bargaining; it\u2019s now set to expire December 20.\n\n\u201cIt was a subject that everybody understood,\u201d Sigouin said. \u201cThey all had a story to tell if you gave them a minute, about their mother or father that lost benefits, or didn\u2019t have them.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say, \u2018I know so-and-so who works at Walmart, so let me sign that card.\u2019\u201d\n\nObamacare: What to Watch Out For A new report from the Labor Campaign for Single Payer explains the top 10 bugbears unions should guard against when bargaining health care\u2014including the \u201cWalmart loophole,\u201d private exchanges, exclusion of immigrants (even those with papers), and more. Read details on all 10 here.\n\nIt\u2019s the hot topic in grocery bargaining this year: with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance exchanges opening up an alternative route to coverage, will employers succeed in kicking part-timers and retirees off their plans?\n\nAfter what Local 919 President Mark Espinosa called \u201cthe most difficult, complex negotiations I have been part of in my entire labor movement career,\u201d 40,000 Stop & Shop workers in five New England UFCW locals agreed in March to exclude employees working less than 30 hours a week from their Taft-Hartley health fund.\n\nIn return the company is giving the part-timers cash to buy coverage on the exchanges and contributing to individual health savings accounts, and the locals are offering workshops to guide members into the new system.\n\nBut other grocery locals, such as Sigouin\u2019s Local 400, are refusing to dump part-timers. Their brothers and sisters at area Krogers fended off similar concessions earlier this year.\n\nTwenty-one thousand Seattle-area workers came within two hours of striking at Safeway, QFC, Albertson\u2019s, and Fred Meyer, before they won a no-concession contract October 21, keeping everyone\u2019s benefits intact.\n\nSome 5,500 Stop & Shop workers in the New York metro area\u2019s Local 1500 authorized a strike October 28 over the same issue. At press time they hadn\u2019t walked yet, but might anytime. And health coverage for part-timers is a top issue in Local 1262\u2019s talks with Stop & Shop and ShopRite in New Jersey and New York, too.\n\nAlready many grocery workers are part-time, including nearly 13,000 of the 17,000 Safeway and Giant workers in D.C.\n\n\u201cLots of people, Giant has cut their hours back to five hours or less a day,\u201d said deli manager Michele Hepner. \u201cThey\u2019re not making people full-time anymore.\u201d\n\nFor Mary Ann Schroeder, a 20-year Safeway meatwrapper in Seattle, that\u2019s part of why the issue was worth striking over. \u201cIt\u2019s a larger problem than it looks,\u201d she said, because if employers had succeeded in making under-30-hour workers still cheaper to hire by eliminating their insurance, \u201ceverybody would have ended up with under 30 hours eventually.\u201d\n\nWhose Fault? It\u2019s because of Taft-Hartley benefit funds that so many part-timers in grocery have health coverage to begin with. Such a fund, jointly administered by employers and unions, creates a pool of members (workers, their dependents, retirees, and in some industries even out-of-work union members) big enough to act as its own insurance company. Is the push to shrink the health plan rolls just the usual employer opportunism, or is the Affordable Care Act to blame? A little of each. The ACA will increase the plans\u2019 cost of offering insurance. It bans lifetime caps on benefit payouts, for instance, and requires plans to allow adult children up to age 26 as dependents. It also creates new fees for insurers, including the Taft-Hartleys. More important, depending on family income, a part-time worker might be eligible for a government subsidy to help pay for coverage on the exchange. But the subsidy can\u2019t be used to keep them on the union plan. \u201cThat\u2019s the outrage the Taft-Hartley plans are having,\u201d said Mark Dudzic of the Labor Campaign for Single Payer. \u201cIf they throw these people out of their plans and have to go to the exchanges they\u2019ll be eligible for subsidies\u2014but if they continue to cover them through the plan, they get no subsidies.\u201d The same might be true even of full-time workers, whose wages can be pretty low the first few years. But workers with fewer than 30 hours a week have the bulls-eye on them first, because the ACA mandates no financial penalty to the employer for not insuring them. Neither does it require coverage for retirees and spouses. \u201cSo we have to think of a penalty for any wrong thing that anyone can come up with, to prevent it from happening?\u201d asked Seattle meatwrapper Mary Ann Schroeder. Maybe so. UFCW is backing federal legislation, the Part-Time Worker Bill of Rights, that would impose a pro-rated penalty for employers who don\u2019t provide health benefits for workers under 30 hours. The bill has made no headway in Congress. \u2014Alexandra Bradbury\n\nHepner has worked at Giant for 38 years. \u201cWhen I started, my dad said, \u2018Giant\u2019s a good company with excellent benefits,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAt 18 I said, \u2018What\u2019s a benefit, Daddy?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe found out when her husband fell out of a tree. \u201cHe was in shock trauma for months. I didn\u2019t pay one cent. My dad said, \u2018That\u2019s your benefits that I was trying to explain to you about.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow her own daughter is full-time at Giant, too\u2014and Hepner wishes she could tell her the same.\n\nYOU\u2019RE ON YOUR OWN\n\nGiant and Safeway want to push not only part-timers but also retirees and working spouses off Local 400\u2019s plan.\n\nBecause prior contracts introduced tiers, only those hired in 1983 or before are eligible for retiree medical\u2014but those folks have been counting on it their whole careers. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken little 10-cent, 25-cent raises all these years to maintain that,\u201d said Sigouin, who just missed the cut-off. She started 28 years ago.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of retirees that are calling me and begging me, \u2018Please don\u2019t let us lose everything we have,\u2019\u201d said Hepner. \u201cWe built the company. We made it what it is today\u2026. Several have called and said, \u2018Do I need to go look for new health care?\u2019\u201d\n\nWould it be such a disaster to switch over to the exchanges? The bottom line will vary from person to person, since eligibility for subsidies depends on family size and spouse income.\n\nThat\u2019s the heart of the problem, says Mark Dudzic of the Labor Campaign for Single Payer, which just released a report on bargaining under the ACA.\n\n\u201cThe traditional union model is a solidarity model for benefits: everybody\u2019s covered under equal terms and conditions,\u201d Dudzic explained. \u201cThe ACA accelerates the move to a consumer-driven model, where everyone\u2019s on their own to cut the best deal they can with limited resources.\u201d\n\nAlso, \u201cthere is no exchange in Virginia, and the federal one doesn\u2019t seem to be working real well right now,\u201d Sigouin pointed out.\n\n\u2018HOT TO GO\u2019\n\nHealth care isn\u2019t the only trendy takeaway grocery employers are pushing. The chains in both Seattle and D.C. proposed getting rid of premium pay for Sundays and holidays\u2014an idea that made workers\u2019 blood boil.\n\nBut Seattle workers held the line and took no concessions. It came down to proving to management that \u201cwe were totally prepared to strike,\u201d said Schroeder, a member of her workplace contract action team.\n\nShe and her co-workers held button-wearing days, informational pickets, a near-unanimous strike vote, and signed everyone up for picket shifts. \u201cPeople were hot to go,\u201d she said.\n\nThe other key was rousing public support. As in D.C., workers leafleted stores and gathered shoppers\u2019 pledges. Other unions and community groups joined rallies and even volunteered to help strikers with practical tasks, like driving kids to doctor appointments if picket duty interfered.\n\n\n\n\n\nA clever visual aid spotlighted the drama over the final days of bargaining. When it gave the 72-hour strike notice, the union set up a huge tablet with the numerals \u201c7\u201d and \u201c2\u201d at a park in downtown Seattle. Each hour someone would flip the page, ticking down the hours till the deadline. 71... 70...\n\n\u201cThe cameras were on it all the time,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIt was on all the local news. So it wasn\u2019t just happening to us, it was happening to everybody.... The whole city knew.\u201d\n\n05... 04... 03... The countdown stopped at 02.\n\nIn an October 30 push, D.C.-area workers donned Rosie the Riveter polka-dot scarves (it was almost Halloween) and talked with shoppers at 30 stores.\n\nThey asked customers to hand the pledge card to a manager or cashier on their way out. Thousands have done so, Local 400 says\u2014especially when the ask comes from a checker they recognize.\n\nAll the years the company has been insisting checkers greet shoppers and call them by name, \u201cit\u2019s coming back to bite them a bit,\u201d Hepner said, \u201cbecause now they\u2019re our customers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://labornotes.org/sites/dc.lndev.opa.labornotes.org/files/logo_with_slogan.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2631\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s because of Taft-Hartley benefit funds that so many part-timers in grocery have health coverage to begin with.\nUFCW is backing federal legislation, the Part-Time Worker Bill of Rights, that would impose a pro-rated penalty for employers who don\u2019t provide health benefits for workers under 30 hours.\nAnd health coverage for part-timers is a top issue in Local 1262\u2019s talks with Stop & Shop and ShopRite in New Jersey and New York, too.\nBut workers with fewer than 30 hours a week have the bulls-eye on them first, because the ACA mandates no financial penalty to the employer for not insuring them.\nIs the push to shrink the health plan rolls just the usual employer opportunism, or is the Affordable Care Act to blame?"}
