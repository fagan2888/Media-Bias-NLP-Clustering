Hauser, deputy assistant secretary for program operations at the DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration, said at a daylong Investment Company Institute conference focused on the rule. \u201cWe don't view the enforceability of that promise or of the commitment as a problem. We view that as critical to these rights meaning anything.\u201d Rights without associated remedies that customers can enforce aren't rights at all, he said.\n\nThe changes that the DOL made from the proposed rule to the final, as well as forthcoming subregulatory guidance, should help with operations and implementation, he said.\n\nHauser also expressed confidence that the industry is innovative enough to quickly adapt to the new regulation.\n\nThe rule was released April 6 (67 PBD, 4/7/16). The effective date is April 10, 2017, and the compliance date is Jan. 1, 2018.\n\n\u201cMy belief\u2014and we'll be watching very closely how this all plays out\u2014is that there is enough creativity, there's enough competitive drive, that this industry is going to continue to deliver advice to their customers in a competitive and effective way\u201d while hewing to the best-interest standards set out by the fiduciary rule, Hauser said.\n\nHauser also urged all industry members to ask questions as soon as possible. \u201cWe'd rather get advice out early than have you build out your systems and then have us say, no, that doesn't comply,\u201d he said.\n\nSubregulatory guidance will probably come in the form of questions and answers, which could be rolled out as the DOL is able to address them, Hauser said.\n\nThe DOL has taken a similar strategy in providing guidance on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the industry's first objective will be compliance, and creativity and innovation will have to follow, Robert H. Dearman Jr., vice president of Lansing, Mich.-based Jackson National Life Insurance Co., told Bloomberg BNA at the conference.\n\nThe DOL \u201cis hoping we will innovate, but don't pretend that the purpose of the rule is to get innovation,\u201d he said. The primary goal, as Hauser and other DOL officials have emphasized, is that customers get financial advice that is in their best interest, Dearman said.\n\nMore Questions Than Answers\n\nOne of the questions on most audience members' minds appeared to be the rule's definition of \u201creasonable compensation.\u201d\n\nThe concept of \u201creasonable compensation\u201d isn't new, Hauser said. \u201cWhat's surprising to me in the comments is that this has been in\u201d the Employee Retirement Income Security Act since the law was enacted, he said.\n\nIn the preamble to the rule's best-interest-contract exemption, the DOL said \u201creasonable compensation\u201d is already required under ERISA Section 408(b)(2) and tax code Section 4975(d)(2) of service providers, including financial services providers, regardless of whether they are fiduciaries.\n\nIn response to audience questions, Hauser said the DOL isn't attempting to become a rate-setting agency, determining on its own what is reasonable. The rule is intended to deal with outliers, and act as a constraint on abusive practices, he said.\n\nThis answer by Hauser drew skepticism from Daniel R. Kleinman, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP in Washington. Advisers will have to puzzle out which metrics and comparisons to use to determine reasonable compensation. \u201cYou heard Tim say they're not in the business of setting those, but they'll definitely tell when it's wrong,\u201d Kleinman said.\n\nThe advisory industry can also help the DOL by supplying possible answers, Hauser said. For example, supervision of advisers' compliance with the rule will require that firms have in place strong and thorough policies and procedures regarding incentive structures, Hauser said. He said the DOL has approached several industry groups for exemplars of best practice policies and procedures, but has received no feedback yet.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sean Forbes in Washington at sforbes@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jo-el J.
