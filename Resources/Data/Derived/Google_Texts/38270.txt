An East Mississippi man is the prime suspect in a stabbing in West Alabama.

The stabbing happened across from Kinterbish Junior High School in Cuba around 9:30 Wednesday night. It occurred near a store that is now closed.

Lee Thomas Williams of Cuba suffered multiple stab wounds to the neck area. The 24-year-old was initially hospitalized in critical condition but later died of his injuries.

Sumter County Sheriff Tyrone Clark says there is a male suspect. However, because a warrant was not immediately issued his name was not available for publication. The sheriff says an investigation continues into the motive.
