We all do strange things with our bodies when nobody is looking. Sometimes that means learning what a scab tastes like or whether you can bite off the nail on your big toe. Controversial opinion: Picking your nose and eating it is not as gross as people make it out to be. It's really no different from swallowing mucus when you have a cold; it's the same stuff, just a little more dried. We're not here to judge anybody.

Having dispensed with the pleasantries: WTF IS ANN WAGNER DOING IN THIS VIDEO?

In a Vine captured by user Chuck Westover, Wagner — the U.S. representative for Missouri's 2nd congressional district — prepares to speak with Missouri GOP Chairman John Hancock on his Fox TV show. As Westover starts his lead-in, Wagner runs her thumb and forefinger along her nostrils, snorts a little, then brings her forefinger back up to her mouth, sticks it pretty far into her mouth, and gives it a nice long slurp. Watch below.

*Has co-sponsored a bill to Proud to cosponsor @RepDianeBlack's #HR3134, which would #DefundPlannedParenthood! https://t.co/LMv44IshhX — Ann Wagner (@RepAnnWagner) July 22, 2015 " target="_blank">defund Planned Parenthood.

*Hates Obamacare.

*Is one of Wall Street's most reliable lackeys, having sponsored legislation that would prohibit the SEC from requiring companies to disclose their political contributions in addition to many other laws that generally make banks less accountable to the public.

*Is one of the leading recipients of political donations from the payday-lending industry.

Again: No judgment. Just a suggestion to Wagner that she take care of this kind of business off camera next time.
