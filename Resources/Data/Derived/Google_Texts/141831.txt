TICONDEROGA — Superintendent Dr. John McDonald said what many school administrators and number-crunchers are thinking when it comes to the 2016-17 budget.

“Two percent should mean two percent.”

As voters prepare to go to the polls to vote on the Ticonderoga Central School District adopted spending plan with 1.14 percent tax levy increase, the district was given a state tan levy cap number of 1.14 percent, well below the two percent number which is usually associated with the Gov. Andrew Cuomo-led legislated action.

Both Ticonderoga and Hague residents are expected to see a 1.1 percent increase in the estimated tax rate per $1,000 of assessed property value (see box).

“I think the state needs to take a look at the tax cap formula,” McDonald said. “A lot of the expenses in our budget we have very little or no control over, like Affordable Care Act fees. We received a reduction in ERS and TRS (retirement system), but because of that they are not accounting those as an exemption in the tax cap.”

Despite the struggles, McDonald said the district was able to get some additions into the budget, including a new teacher in the middle school, a four-station lift system in the bus garage.

Some of the additions come, in part, to the savings the district expects to see as it transitions to solar power.

“We are estimating $30,000 in savings from solar, but it will be based on how soon we are able to get onto the new grid,” McDonald said. “We also saw some savings in fuel over the past year.”

McDonald said enrollment will remain about even between the 2015-16 and 16-17 school years, but there is an increase in special education services, which will cause a pinch on the budget.

“Our increase in special education exceeds what our state aid increased by,” McDonald said. “Full aid for special education students comes the following year, so you run into a cash flow problem.”
