Rand Paul (R-KY) a Tea Party conservative and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) a liberal Democrat rarely see eye-to-eye on political matters. But they appear to be in full agreement on an issue that could prevent what President Obama believes is a crowning achievement in foreign policy in his second term.\n\nPaul formally announced his campaign for the 2016 presidential election on Tuesday; Schumer is the anointed next leader of the Senate Democrats. Both men support legislation that would grant Congress the authority to review and potentially block the tentative agreement struck by the Obama administration and Iran on limiting Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nRealted: Obama\u2019s Good First Step in Iran Leaves More to be Done\n\nPresident Obama has pledged to consult with Congress on the framework before the final agreement is struck in June. But he\u2019s repeatedly signaled he intends to make the final decision on whether to move ahead. Lawmakers of both parties are concerned Obama may be too eager to sign a far-reaching agreement with a longtime enemy that is still listed on the U.S. State Department\u2019s terror list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for Republicans and Democrats who don\u2019t want to give the president kind of a blank check on the Middle East to come together and form [a] bipartisan alliance,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg, a congressional expert and editor of the Rothenberg Political Report.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to instinctively oppose most of what [Obama] proposes,\u201d he added. \u201cThey need some Democrats willing to make the White House make the case that this is a good deal for the U.S. and for Israel \u2013 one of our top allies.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Turns to Corker to Sell His Iranian Nuke Deal\n\nThe preliminary deal reached in Lausanne, Switzerland last week essentially would block Iran from moving ahead on a program of uranium enrichment and developing a nuclear weapon for 15 years. It would also gradually lift the sanctions that have hobbled Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nObama has called this a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d to curb the spread of nuclear weapons in a volatile region. Yet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and many U.S. Republican lawmakers say the early deal is seriously flawed and could allow Iran to eventually develop a nuclear weapon that could be used against Israel.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week will begin debating a bill co-authored by Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NY). It would give Congress 60 days to review a final agreement before allowing a phase-out of the sanctions.\n\nSchumer, an influential voice in the Iran nuclear debate who represents a large Jewish constituency, signaled this week that he was strongly supporting passage of the bill despite Obama\u2019s opposition.\n\nRelated: The Biggest Obstacle to Rand Paul\u2019s 2016 Campaign\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration, and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future,\u201d Schumer told Politico. \u201cI strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the Corker bill which would allow that to occur.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the libertarian Paul, who is struggling to overcome a reputation as an isolationist, declared his support for the Corker bill when he launched his campaign on Tuesday for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cConservatives should not succumb to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow succeed at building nations abroad,\u201d Paul said in attacking Obama\u2019s defense policies. \u201cI envision an America with a national defense unparalleled, undefeatable, and unencumbered by overseas nation building.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky senator insisted any Iran nukes deal must be approved by Congress.\n\nRelated: Rubio Suggests Obama Is Letting Iran Dictate U.S. War Policy\n\n\u201cI will oppose any deal that does not end Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and have strong verification measures,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI will insist any final version be brought before Congress. The difference between President Obama and myself is that he seems to think you can negotiate from a position of weakness.\u201d\n\nThe spectacle of Schumer and Paul singing from the same political hymnal on the Iranian deal cannot be good news for the White House. While the administration insists the framework would thwart Iran\u2019s progress toward a nuclear weapon for a decade or more, many lawmakers fear it would only postpone Iran\u2019s success in acquiring those weapons. Meanwhile, Iran would restore its economy and be able to extend its influence in the region.\n\nSchumer quietly signed onto the Corker-Menendez two weeks ago, but said little while he and the rest of Congress awaited the outcome of the nuclear talks. Now that summaries of the framework have been released \u2013 with some glaring differences in interpretation \u2013 Schumer\u2019s emphatic statement that Congress has an important role to play becomes more significant, as Politico has noted.\n\nRelated: Chuck Schumer: 15 Things You Didn\u2019t Know\n\nIn short, Schumer \u2013 tapped by Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada to succeed him as Democratic leader in 2017 \u2013 signaled to fellow Democrats that it\u2019s safe to endorse the review bill.\n\n\u201cHis motives are going to be different from Rand Paul or Ted Cruz or most other Republicans, but I think there is nervousness on the part of some Democratic Jews that the president is too willing to accept Iranian promises,\u201d said Stuart Rothenberg. \u201cThey want to make sure we\u2019ve got a good deal \u2013 both for U.S. interests but also to make sure that the president\u2019s overall approach is reasonable. [They want] a long-term delay in Iran\u2019s ability to get a weapon and a clear warning signal if Iranians are proceeding toward firing a weapon.\u201d\n\nA dozen Democratic senators have either co-sponsored Corker\u2019s bill or indicated they could support it. With presumably all 54 Republicans in favor, that would put the measure just one vote shy of a veto-proof majority. Three other Democrats \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 reportedly are open to the possibility of voting for the bill.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.
