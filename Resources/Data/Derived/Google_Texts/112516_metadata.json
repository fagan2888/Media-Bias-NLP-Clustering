June 30 will be the end of Greece\u2019s current bailout plan, and there will be no more bailout money available under any terms.\n\nSo it seems that after several years of \u201ckicking the can down the road,\u201d and postponing making the hard decisions, the Greece bailout crisis will finally run out of road on June 30. And whatever the outcome, it\u2019s certain to be very unpleasant.\n\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras was defiant and bitter in a speech he gave to Greece\u2019s parliament on Friday:\n\nTime is not only running out for us, it is running out for everyone. [\u2026] The proposals submitted by lenders are unrealistic. The Greek government cannot consent to absurd proposals. [\u2026] I would like to believe that this proposal was an unfortunate moment for Europe, or at least a bad negotiating trick, and will very soon be withdrawn by the same people who thought it up. [\u2026] We don\u2019t just need an agreement, we need a definitive solution, both for Greece and for Europe, that will finally end the talk of a Greek exit from the eurozone. [\u2026] The fiscal strangulation of a country is a moral issue that conflicts with Europe\u2019s founding principles \u2013 which raises well-founded questions on Europe\u2019s future.\n\nTsipras called on opposition parties to support him in the ongoing negotiations. The far left factions in his own Syriza party have already indicated that they won\u2019t support any plan that calls for any austerity.\n\nTsipras\u2019s predecessor, center right New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, responded by telling the prime minister that he had \u201csome nerve\u201d asking for support at this time. He accused Tsipras of mishandling the negotiations and tipping Greece back into recession. \u201cYou have totally destroyed the country and isolated us,\u201d he said. Kathimerini and Guardian (London)\n\nSpeculation grows about China\u2019s purpose in giant government hacking breach\n\nChinese hackers are suspected in a massive breach compromising the computers at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Department of the Interior. The personal information of 4 million U.S. current and former federal employees were compromised in the breach. The OPM is the human resources department for the federal government, and so every government agency is potentially affected. The data goes back to 1985.\n\nAs usual, the Chinese feigned outrage at anyone who could suspect them of such a thing, and complained that any such accusation would be \u201cirresponsible and unscientific.\u201d\n\nThe perpetrators are believed to be the same Chinese hackers behind the Anthem health insurance data breach in March, where 80 million current and former customers of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans had their personal information compromised, including birthdates, addresses, and social security numbers.\n\nAssuming that the Chinese are the perpetrators, questions are being raised about what they are planning to do with all this data. The Chinese now have a massive data base of detailed personal information on tens or hundreds of millions of Americans. What are they going to do with this?\n\nIf the Chinese want to penetrate another company, they can use detailed information from the files to craft personalized phony messages to trick workers. These are called \u201cspear phishing\u201d messages. A worker receiving such a message might think it is from a family member and click on something in the message that infects their computer, or which gives the hacker access to the other data bases in the company network. With this technique, the Chinese can penetrate one company after another, using the information gathered from one breach to gain access to perpetrate the next breach.\n\nIt is not known how certain government officials are that the Chinese government is the perpetrator. It is possible that they know with 100% certainty based on NSA data. However, even if they\u2019re that certain, they couldn\u2019t say so because they would be accusing China of an act of war, and a response would be required.
