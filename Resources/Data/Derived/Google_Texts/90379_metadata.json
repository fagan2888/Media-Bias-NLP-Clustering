One additional document is highly suspect, likely an outright fabrication to give the rest of the memos some kind of sinister intent which they don\u2019t have by themselves. Not helping the matter one bit is how Desmogblog (the web site Ross Gelbspan founded, as he says 8 seconds into this interview) was the first organization to break the memo leak news, and how one person points out that \u201conly 38 minutes elapsed between Gleick\u2019s Epson Scan metadata timestamp and DeSmogBlog\u2019s posting of the files.\u201d Surely this would have been news that should have been sent first to an established news outlet such as the New York Times.\n\nThe Intermountain Rural Electric Association (IREA) memo leak of 2007\n\nOf all people to comment on this situation, Ross Gelbspan\u2019s blog post at Desmogblog described how the IREA memo was \u201cdubbed a \u2018Vampire Memo\u2019 because it resurrects an earlier campaign which was discredited and abandoned in the mid 1990s.\u201d He\u2019s speaking of his favorite Western Fuels ICE campaign memo set with the \u201creposition global warming as theory rather than fact\u201d phrase that carried him into a second career. True, it was cut short by Western Fuels after a very brief time, but the jury is certainly out on whether it was discredited. But one of the other odd things about Gelbspan\u2019s efforts to tell the story of the IREA memo is how he linked to a full context scan of it at his Desmog piece. He\u2019s never done the same with the ICE memos. Since the ICE memos are hardly different than the IREA memo \u2013 all describing little more than forming and implementing a science-based rebuttal to Al Gore\u2019 politicized version of global warming \u2013 Gelbspan\u2019s show of the IREA memo is strangely self-defeating.\n\nThe Exxon / CEQ memo leak of 2001\n\nIn this one, the controversy was over an Exxon representative\u2019s suggestion to the George W. Bush administration that Dr. Robert Watson ought to be kicked out of the IPCC and how \u201clobbyists for energy companies and auto manufacturers\u201d were \u201cexpected to press the administration to endorse Dr. Pachauri.\u201d That\u2019s the same Rajendra Pachauri that Ross Gelbspan mentioned in a 2002 interview about the Exxon memo, where he said the Bush administration \u201csupported the nomination of Dr. Pachauri, who is not a scientist.\u201d (full text here, where Gelbspan also suggested Pachauri\u2019s oil industry ties would make him an ally of the Bush Administration). Gelbspan flip-flopped in 2007, labeling him a \u2018leading scientist\u2019, (full text here) despite the fact that Dr Pachauri only has a Master\u2019s and a PhD degree in Industrial Engineering. As for the Exxon memo itself, enviro-activists portray it as having evil intent, but an objective reading of it instead draws attention to potential bias of particular people and situations that were worthy of more scrutiny.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute memo leak of 1998\n\nRight off the bat, the API memos were hardly different than the IREA or Western Fuels one, when we see the way the NY Times described IREA as, \u201ca campaign to recruit a cadre of scientists who share the industry\u2019s views of climate science and to train them in public relations so they can help convince journalists, politicians and the public that the risk of global warming is too uncertain to justify controls on greenhouse gases.\u201d The problem here is how the NYT had it backwards, it was industry who learned about and then shared the views of the skeptic scientists. But beyond that, the NYT not only failed to establish any intent to direct the skeptics to lie, it also launched into a swipe at skeptics over the Oregon Petition Project, which was also the target of smear efforts at that time by the old Ozone Action group\u2026. the very same group where Gelbspan had a most troubling association.\n\nThe original Western Fuels Association memo leak of 1991.\n\nThis one is what my work is all about, because among all those other so-called \u2018leaked memo scandals\u2019, this is the only one having any plausible wording which could be interpreted as evidence of a sinister directive prompting skeptic scientists to knowingly lie about global warming: the infamous \u201creposition global warming as theory rather than fact\u201d phrase, along with the related \u201colder, less educated men and young, low-income women\u201d words \u2013 the latter of which seen in Al Gore\u2019s 1992 book being a big problem when Gore later says Gelbspan discovered the plot behind this memo set. It gets one step worse with the single line of disclosure Gelbspan offered only one time about \u201cAn official of the campaign denies that strategy of targeting selected groups was ever implemented.\u201d If that strategy was never implemented, did the original leaker of the ICE memos fail to mention it to the people receiving the leaked memos? And did Al Gore know of this situation before he mentioned those phrases in his 1992 book?\n\nAll five of these leaked memo situations share the same problem: they\u2019re literally nothing more than guilt-by-association, when it comes to portraying skeptic climate scientists as paid industry shills. All show and no go.\n\nThere is one more thing to consider here, in light of the 2012 Heartland Institute memo leak apparently being so devoid of damaging material that a false cover memo had to be fabricated to give the whole thing some punch. How do we know the original Western Fuels Association memo leak didn\u2019t fall under that same fate?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/11/the-non-smoking-gun-leaked-memos-pattern/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/exxon-mobil-earnings-2.gi_.top_.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "The \u2018Non-smoking Gun\u2019 Leaked Memos Pattern"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf351\"", "article_summary": "How do we know the original Western Fuels Association memo leak didn\u2019t fall under that same fate?\nThe Heartland Institute memo leak of 2012The genuine leaked memos offered no more than an insight into the Heartland Institute\u2019s budget for material they use to tell skeptic climate scientists\u2019 side of the issue.\nAll five of these leaked memo situations share the same problem: they\u2019re literally nothing more than guilt-by-association, when it comes to portraying skeptic climate scientists as paid industry shills.\nThe original Western Fuels Association memo leak of 1991.\nBut one of the other odd things about Gelbspan\u2019s efforts to tell the story of the IREA memo is how he linked to a full context scan of it at his Desmog piece."}
