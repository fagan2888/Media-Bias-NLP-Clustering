Santa Clause made a visit to Wichita on Sunday afternoon to help with the 35th annual Wichita Toy Run.

The event brought out an estimated 2,000 bikers with toys they wanted to donate to children.

The toy run started at Lawrence-Dumont Stadium, where all the bikers were checked in. From there, they took off to Broadway St. and headed for the Kansas Pavilions where they could drop off the toy they wanted to donate.

Event organizers think this might be the largest turnout they have ever had.

"There are so many of us that there are going to be a whole lot of kids that will be real happy," Jerry Silver said. He has attended the toy run for almost 25 years.

The past two years the actually motorcycle ride was cancelled for safety concerns,. This years event had a police escort and some roads were shut down so the bikers could safely caravan to the Pavilions.
