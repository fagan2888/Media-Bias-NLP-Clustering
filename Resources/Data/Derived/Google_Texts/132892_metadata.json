I say that is irrelevant. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) legislated quality reporting and pay-for-performance, which requires that the risk adjustment be reported on a sixth criteria. Specifically, does the diagnosis carry weighted value for the required risk adjustment on the basis of poor outcomes, including having a high likelihood of increased costs associated with the long-term management of a condition, increased risk for (frequent) readmission, significant potential impact for future healthcare needs, and most importantly, increased risk of mortality?\n\nA look into every value-based reimbursement model currently in practice and/or underway requires reporting on this sixth form of criteria. The language in the PPACA legislated it as the law. In a great many cases, a diagnosis will have significant impact for the required risk adjustment and will in fact be a diagnosis that the patient carries, yet it will not meet the \"resource used during three days\" criteria.\n\nThe larger-scale value-based purchasing rationale does not dictate that the risk adjustment should/would in any way be based on or impacted by the particular amount of resources utilized in a single (or multiple) inpatient stay. The methodology and research that justifies the methodology is weighted on a statistical analysis of the long-term risk stratification associated with simply having those conditions present.\n\nSo the question I pose to you is this: How can the federal government in one law require the use of such reporting in order to effectively communicate the risk required in the reimbursement methodology they are imposing while simultaneously denying reimbursement on a line-item basis for doing the very thing they told us to do \u2013 and all on the grounds of a criteria that (as a matter of fact) isn't even part of the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAllen R.
