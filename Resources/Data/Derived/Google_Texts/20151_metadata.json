LGBT advocates will likely be pushing for a comprehensive non-discrimination bill with protections in employment, housing, credit, education, federal programs and public accommodations, while anti-gay groups may push religious liberty legislation to provide carve-outs in civil rights law for people and businesses objecting to same-sex marriage.\n\nGroups that work on LGBT issues say the extent to which they\u2019ve met with McConnell has been minimal in the eight years that he\u2019s led the Republican caucus in the minority.\n\nChris Hartman, executive director of Fairness Kentucky, said his organization met once with McConnell staffers in 2011 for about 30 minutes on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping the senator would respond to his constituency\u2019s desires, which is to have legal discrimination protection for LGBT people, but, of course, he has not done so,\u201d Hartman said.\n\nHartman said his group hasn\u2019t made an attempt to meet with staffers beyond that initial meeting, but, by casting a vote against ENDA last year, added the senator \u201chas been clear on his stance toward non-discrimination protections.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that he\u2019ll soften his stance on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cThe simple anti-discrimination law is bipartisan; there are supporters on both sides of the aisle. In Kentucky, 77 percent of registered Republicans support anti-discrimination protections. There\u2019s no reason the senator shouldn\u2019t be leading the nation toward greater and fuller acceptance of all people, and especially Kentuckians who lack those protections.\u201d\n\nGregory T. Angelo, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, said interaction between his organization and McConnell\u2019s office has \u201cbeen minimal\u201d because previously Democrats have controlled the Senate, but he expects that to change.\n\n\u201cAny communication with his office will only occur after gay advocates and allies achieve some form of consensus on ENDA or similar civil rights legislation, as I would not want to present mixed messages on this critical issue given the importance of GOP support in any potential vote,\u201d Angelo said.\n\nDon Stewart, a McConnell spokesperson, said he doesn\u2019t handle the senator\u2019s scheduling, but his office \u201chas had regular meetings with Kentuckians representing the LGBT community.\u201d\n\nMcConnell scored a \u201c0\u201d on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s legislative scorecard for the 113th Congress. Some highlights over his career in the Senate: Voting in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment and against hate crimes protection legislation, \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n\nIn addition to voting in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, McConnell signed a friend-of-the-court brief in 2013 urging the Supreme Court to uphold the law.\n\nGiven his record, one question that has emerged is whether McConnell will bring up anti-gay legislation now that he sets the schedule for the Senate floor.\n\nHartman said he thinks that would be unlikely given Republican reluctance to take on such issues in recent years when they were in charge of one-half of Congress.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine it would be one of the Senate\u2019s priorities given the economic work they have to do, addressing student loan debt, certainly they\u2019re all going to be grinding their gears on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine taking away LGBT rights would be a Senate priority for the new majority leader.\u201d\n\nWith respect to controlling the way his Republicans voted on LGBT issues, McConnell has a mixed record. The Republican leader whipped at least one of the votes on \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal, urging his members to reject open military service. But there\u2019s no evidence McConnell whipped the Senate vote on ENDA, when 10 Senate Republicans voted in favor of the bill.\n\nDavid Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, said despite McConnell\u2019s record, his organization holds out hope he\u2019s willing to work on LGBT issues.\n\n\u201cLGBT equality should be a bipartisan issue,\u201d Stacy said. \u201cAlthough Sen. McConnell has had a long record opposing LGBT equality, times are changing, his caucus is changing, and most importantly the consensus view of the American people now supports full equality for LGBT Americans. As majority leader, Sen. McConnell has both an opportunity and a responsibility to lead the Senate in a way that reflects the views of the majority of Americans. We hope he will rise to that challenge.\u201d\n\nAnother question that arises when examining McConnell\u2019s relationship with the LGBT community: Is he gay? Twice married, McConnell divorced his first wife in 1983, and is now married to former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nMcConnell was the subject of an investigation by Mike Rogers, a gay activist and blogger known for outing anti-gay politicians. In 2008, Rogers made public his six trips to the state and called on the senator to answer questions. Rogers declined to comment for this article.\n\nAt issue is McConnell\u2019s discharge from the Army after less than a year of military service in 1967, which Rogers has suggested took place because of homosexual conduct. While McConnell was ostensibly discharged for an ocular condition, Rogers said in 2008 that the senator\u2019s military record information under \u201cTranscript of Court Martial\u201d was marked \u201cnot on file,\u201d when other sections were marked \u201cn/a.\u201d Rogers also said records show a flurry of calls from the office of the late Sen. John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky in the days immediately preceding McConnell\u2019s discharge, but those calls stopped abruptly afterward.\n\nHartman said \u201cthe senator hasn\u2019t said anything to me\u201d about his sexual orientation, but in the end it shouldn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cIn the LGBT movement, we\u2019re pretty clear that folks are who they say they are, and they are the sexual orientation and gender identity they say they are,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cIf nothing else, having been in politics and in the Senate for so long, I\u2019m certain the senator knows what bullying looks like and what marginalization looks like, and I would hope that creates a sense of sympathy and empathy for those who are marginalized based upon who they are, or whom they love or what they fight for. I think the senator would want to try to protect all of those folks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LGBT groups from extending an olive branch in hopes Mitch McConnell will work with them in his role in charge of the U.S Senate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "LGBT groups from extending an olive branch in hopes Mitch McConnell will work with them in his role in charge of the U.S Senate.", "title": "Despite record, LGBT advocates reserve judgment on McConnell", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/11/Mitch_McConnell_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2014-11-20T16:52:02-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/11/20/mcconnell/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LGBT groups from extending an olive branch in hopes Mitch McConnell will work with them in his role in charge of the U.S Senate.", "title": "Despite record, LGBT advocates reserve judgment on McConnell", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/11/Mitch_McConnell_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "U.S. Senate", "published_time": "2014-11-20T05:46:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-20T16:52:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, Mitch McConnell, gay legislation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0167\"", "article_summary": "David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, said despite McConnell\u2019s record, his organization holds out hope he\u2019s willing to work on LGBT issues.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine taking away LGBT rights would be a Senate priority for the new majority leader.\u201dWith respect to controlling the way his Republicans voted on LGBT issues, McConnell has a mixed record.\nBut there\u2019s no evidence McConnell whipped the Senate vote on ENDA, when 10 Senate Republicans voted in favor of the bill.\n\u201cAlthough Sen.
