ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) â€” Jason Day turned his fortunes quickly with a birdie and a clutch par save from the bunker on the final two holes to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Sunday.

Day closed with a 2-under 70 for a one-shot victory over Kevin Chappell, who looked as if he would finally win in his 150th career start.

Day was one shot behind and facing two of the toughest holes at Bay Hill. He hit his tee shot on the par-3 17th to 12 feet and made it for birdie, and then got up-and-down from just under 100 feet away in a bunker to win by one shot.

Chappell made bogey on the 18th hole and shot 69.

Troy Merritt and Henrik Stenson both faltered late and tied for third.
