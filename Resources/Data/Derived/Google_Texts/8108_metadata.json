(AP) \u2014 Cape Cod is seeing a lot more of some singularly welcome tourists: endangered right whales enticed by the fine dining possibilities of its plankton-rich bay.\n\nExperts tracking the majestic marine mammals \u2014 among the rarest creatures on the planet \u2014 say nearly half the estimated global population of 500 or so animals has been spotted in Cape Cod Bay over the past few springs.\n\nThey\u2019re back again in what looks like record numbers, thrilling amateur photographers and scientists still anguishing over their future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather extraordinary and somewhat mind-blowing,\u201d said Charles \u201cStormy\u201d Mayo, a senior scientist and director of right whale ecology at the federally-funded Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales have foraged for centuries in Cape Cod Bay, where their numbers were decimated by whalers who hunted them for their oil and plastic-like baleen bone.\n\nBut until recently, they were seldom spotted in the bay. For a stretch in the late 1990s, fewer than 30 whales were sighted each year, said Mayo, who\u2019s been surveying them and their ecosystem since 1984 by boat and plane.\n\n\u201cThere has been a huge pulse in numbers in the past few years,\u201d said Amy Knowlton, a scientist with the New England Aquarium\u2019s Right Whale Research Project.\n\n\u201cRight whales are probably scouting for food all the time. Maybe when one of them finds it, they call their friends,\u201d she said.\n\nEach whale has a unique marking on its head, and researchers use those to identify and catalog individuals. The Aquarium, which also closely monitors the population, gives specific animals amusing names such as Kleenex, Snotnose and Wart.\n\nRight whales spend most of their time in the western Atlantic, and many are believed to congregate in the Gulf of Maine. They\u2019re rarely seen north of the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada\u2019s Maritime Provinces. A few venture as far south as coastal Florida and Georgia, mainly females giving birth to calves \u2014 something scientists say doesn\u2019t happen often enough.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Extremely rare whales make big showing in Cape Cod Bay", "author": "William J.
