It was violent,\" said a Reuters witness. \"They attacked ex-opposition members as they arrived. One had to be saved from the crowd by security forces.\"\n\nMost of the participants in the talks, including foreign ambassadors, had already arrived at the Laico Hotel in the capital Ouagadougou when the incident occurred.\n\n\"I am with my colleagues. We are okay. We have not been taken hostage. We are free,\" France's ambassador to Burkina Faso Gilles Thibault said via his Twitter account.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Ouagadougou also announced that its ambassador was safe.\n\nSenegal's President Macky Sall, the current chairman of West Africa's regional bloc ECOWAS who is leading the mediation efforts, later left the hotel.\n\nIt was unclear if the negotiations, which were meant to be attended by, among others, members of the civil society, political parties and the military, would go ahead in spite of the violence.\n\nAnti-coup demonstrators had been grouping across the street from the hotel on Sunday morning ahead of the meeting when members of the RSP presidential guard arrived and began beating them, another witness said.\n\nThey sought refuge inside the hotel grounds, but more presidential guards, some wearing balaclavas hiding their faces, arrived shortly after and fired shots in the air to disperse them. The soldiers were accompanied by the pro-coup demonstrators who then stormed the lobby of the hotel.\n\nThe witnesses said they recognized several of the pro-coup protesters as militants from the Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the former ruling party under ex-president Blaise Compaore.\n\nCompaore was ousted last year in a popular uprising by those opposed to his attempts to change the constitution and extend his 27-year rule. The country had since been headed by a transitional government charged with organizing next month's elections.\n\nGeneral Gilebert Diendere, Compaore's former spy chief and right hand man, said he carried out the coup over plans to disband the presidential guard and because several of the former president's allies were barred from taking part in the polls.\n\nBenin's President Thomas Boni Yayi, who has been mediating in the crisis alongside Senegal's Sall, said on Saturday that the talks were expected to lead to the reinstatement of President Michel Kafando's interim government on Sunday.\n\n(Additional reporting by Joe Penney; Writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Clelia Oziel)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Pro-coup demonstrators in Burkina Faso on Sunday stormed a hot", "title": "Burkina Faso coup supporters attack hotel hosting mediation talks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/20/Burkina-Faso-coup-supporters-attack-hotel-hosting-mediation-talks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/burkina-army_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/20/Burkina-Faso-coup-supporters-attack-hotel-hosting-mediation-talks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/burkina-army_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Pro-coup demonstrators in Burkina Faso on Sunday stormed a hot", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Pro-coup demonstrators in Burkina Faso on Sunday stormed a hotel due to host talks aimed at restoring a civilian interim government and attacked participants arriving for the meeting, witnesses said.\nMost of the participants in the talks, including foreign ambassadors, had already arrived at the Laico Hotel in the capital Ouagadougou when the incident occurred.\nSenegal's President Macky Sall, the current chairman of West Africa's regional bloc ECOWAS who is leading the mediation efforts, later left the hotel.\nGeneral Gilebert Diendere, Compaore's former spy chief and right hand man, said he carried out the coup over plans to disband the presidential guard and because several of the former president's allies were barred from taking part in the polls.\nAnti-coup demonstrators had been grouping across the street from the hotel on Sunday morning ahead of the meeting when members of the RSP presidential guard arrived and began beating them, another witness said."}
