Amid all the furor over the Obamacare rollout is one overlooked characteristic: its Ponzi scheme essence. Unlike conventional or what I will call "vertical" Ponzi schemes — a la Bernard Madoff and R. Alan Stanford — that fleece subsequent investors to cover the unachievable returns promised to earlier investors, Obamacare's abuse is mostly "horizontal."

Obamacare's financial viability hinges on a massive, compulsory wealth transfer from younger healthy Americans, who are required to pay higher health insurance premiums, to older more medically needy Americans, who will pay lower premiums. If insurance companies' assumptions underlying the premiums they charge are correct, the Ponzi-like wealth transfer from young to old should occur in the same time period, or "horizontally."
