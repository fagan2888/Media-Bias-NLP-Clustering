It didn\u2019t take long for Douglas to realize that the man, fresh out of treatment, was his second heroin overdose that day.\n\n\u201cYou just drive away and go, \u2018Well, here we go again,'\u201d says the veteran cop.\n\nIn Butler County, Ohio, heroin overdose calls are so common that the longtime EMS coordinator likens the situation to \u201ccoming in and eating breakfast \u2014 you just kind of expect it to occur.\u201d A local rehab facility has a six-month wait. One school recently referred an 11-year-old boy who was shooting up intravenously.\n\nSheriff Richard Jones has seen crack, methamphetamine and pills plague his southwestern Ohio community but says heroin is a bigger scourge. Children have been forced into foster care because of addicted parents; shoplifting rings have formed to raise money to buy fixes.\n\n\u201cThere are so many residual effects,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all paying for it.\u201d\n\nHeroin is spreading its misery across America. And communities everywhere are indeed paying.\n\nThe death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman spotlighted the reality that heroin is no longer limited to the back alleys of American life. Once mainly a city phenomenon, the drug has spread \u2014 gripping postcard villages in Vermont, middle-class enclaves outside Chicago, the sleek urban core of Portland, Ore., and places in between and beyond.\n\nIt remains a small part of America\u2019s drug problem; cocaine, Ecstasy, painkillers and tranquilizers are all used more, and the latest federal overdose statistics show that in 2010 the vast majority of drug overdose deaths involved pharmaceuticals, with heroin accounting for less than 10 percent.\n\nBut heroin\u2019s escalation is troubling. Last month, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the 45 percent increase in heroin overdose deaths between 2006 and 2010 an \u201curgent and growing public health crisis.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, there were an estimated 373,000 heroin users in the U.S. By 2012, the number was 669,000, with the greatest increases among those 18 to 25. First-time users nearly doubled in a six-year period ending in 2012, from 90,000 to 156,000.\n\nThe surge is easily explained. Experts note that many users turned to heroin after a crackdown on prescription drug \u201cpill mills\u201d made painkillers such as OxyContin harder to find and more costly. Whereas a gram of prescription opiates may go for $1,000 on the street, that same gram of heroin will sell for $100, authorities say.\n\nIt\u2019s killing because it can be extremely pure or laced with other powerful narcotics. That, coupled with a low tolerance once people start using again after treatment, is catching addicts off guard.\n\nIn hard-hit places, police, doctors, parents and former users are struggling to find solutions and save lives.\n\n\u201cI thought my suburban, middle-class family was immune to drugs such as this,\u201d says Valerie Pap, who lost her son, Tanner, to heroin in 2012 in Anoka County, Minn., and speaks out to try and help others. \u201cI\u2019ve come to realize that we are not immune. \u2026 Heroin will welcome anyone into its grasp.\u201d\n\nIN MINNESOTA: TAKING THE MESSAGE TO THE MASSES\n\nThe night before Valentine\u2019s Day, some 250 people filed into a Baptist church in Spring Lake Park, Minn., a bedroom community north of Minneapolis that brags of its \u201csmall-town charm and friendly folks.\u201d There were moms and dads of addicts, as well as children whose parents brought them in hopes of scaring them away from smack.\n\nFrom the stage, Dan Douglas gripped a microphone as a photograph appeared overhead on a screen: A woman in the fetal position on a bathroom floor. Then another: A woman \u201con the nod\u201d \u2014 passed out with drug paraphernalia and a shoe near her face.\n\nDouglas didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cYou just don\u2019t win with heroin,\u201d he declared. \u201cYou die or you go to jail.\u201d\n\nIt was the third such forum held over two weeks in Anoka County, which encompasses 440 square miles of urban neighborhoods, rural homesteads and suburban centers that are home to nearly 340,000 souls. Since 1999, 55 Anoka County residents have died from heroin-related causes. Only one other Minnesota county reported more heroin-related deaths \u2014 58 \u2014 and it has a population three-and-a-half times greater than Anoka\u2019s.\n\nIn 2009, when Douglas began supervising a drug task force, authorities were focused on stamping out meth labs. Heroin, with its dark and dirty image, just wasn\u2019t a concern. Then investigators noticed a climb in pharmacy robberies and started finding Percocet and OxyContin during routine marijuana busts.\n\nAs prescription drug abuse rose, so, too, did federal and state crackdowns aimed at shutting down pill mills and increasing tracking of prescriptions and pharmacy-hopping pill seekers. Users turned to heroin.\n\n\u201cIt hit us in the face in the form of dead bodies,\u201d says Douglas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how bad it was until it was too late here in our community.\u201d\n\nDouglas says authorities are doing what they can: educating doctors about the dangers of overprescribing painkillers, holding events where residents can dispose of prescription opiates, and aggressively trying to get drugs off the street. But, he says, \u201claw enforcement cannot do this alone.\u201d\n\nThe idea for the forums came not from police but rather from Pap, a third-grade teacher whose youngest son died of a heroin overdose.\n\nTanner was an athlete who graduated from high school with honors. In the fall of 2012, he was pursuing a psychology degree at the University of Minnesota, and dreamed of becoming a drug counselor. He had not, to his mother\u2019s knowledge, ever used drugs, and certainly not heroin.\n\nThen one day Tanner\u2019s roommates found the 21-year-old unconscious in his bedroom.\n\nAmid her grief, Pap realized something needed to be done to educate others. She met with county officials, and the community forums began soon after. At each, Pap shared her family\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cOur lives have been forever changed. Heroin took it all away,\u201d she told the crowd in Spring Lake Park.\n\nDouglas says most heroin-related deaths he has seen involve victims who struggled with the drug for years. The detective usually tries to shield his own boys, ages 7 and 11, from what he sees on the job. But after meeting parents like Pap, Douglas shared his heroin presentation with his oldest son, complete with the sobering pictures.\n\n\u201cCould I still be blindsided? Absolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to be for lack of information on my part. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to scare my kid. I don\u2019t want to scar my kid. But I sure as hell don\u2019t want to bury him.\u201d\n\nIN OHIO: OD ANTIDOTE HELPS SAVE SOME\n\nBrakes screech. The hospital door flies open. A panicked voice shouts: \u201cHelp my friend!\u201d Medical technicians race outside with a gurney. An unconscious young man is lifted aboard, and the race is on to stop another heroin user from dying.\n\nIt\u2019s known as a \u201cdrive-up, drop-off,\u201d and it\u2019s happened repeatedly at Ohio\u2019s Fort Hamilton Hospital. The staff\u2019s quick response and a dose of naloxone, an opiate-reversing drug, bring most patients back. But not all. Some are put on ventilators. A few never revive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly had our share of deaths,\u201d says Dr. Marcus Romanello, head of the ER. \u201cAt least five died that I am acutely aware of \u2026 because I personally cared for them.\u201d\n\nRomanello joined the hospital about two years ago, just as the rise of heroin was becoming noticeable in Hamilton, a blue-collar city of 60,000 people. Now it seems to be reaching into nearly every part of daily life.\n\n\u201cIf you stood next to somebody and just started a conversation about heroin, you\u2019d hear: \u2018Oh yeah, my nephew\u2019s on heroin. My next-door neighbor\u2019s on heroin. My daughter\u2019s on heroin,'\u201d says Candy Murray Abbott, who helped her own 27-year-old son through withdrawal.\n\nAbbott and childhood friend Tammie Norris, whose daughter was also a heroin user, decided last year to bring attention to the problem in their hometown, using Facebook to organize poster-waving demonstrations by everyone from recovering addicts to parents and grandparents of children who died of overdoses.\n\nNorris could only shake her head at the surge in attention to heroin after Hoffman\u2019s death. \u201cWell, duh,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s been happening to our kids every day \u2014 and nobody sees it.\u201d\n\nA couple decades ago, the big problem in Hamilton was cocaine. That shifted to prescription drug abuse, which morphed into heroin as pharmaceuticals grew harder to come by. Now heroin-related deaths have more than tripled in Butler County, where Hamilton is the county seat. There were 55 deaths last year, and within one two-week period, the city\u2019s emergency paramedic units responded to 18 heroin overdoses. Once, they had five overdose runs in a single day.\n\nUsers run the gamut, says EMS veteran Jennifer Mason \u2014 from streetwalkers to business executives. They die in cars, public parks, restaurant bathrooms, a university building. Mason has found people turning blue with needles still in their arms.\n\nSojourner Recovery Services, an addiction treatment organization in Hamilton, has a six-month waiting list for beds for male addicts.\n\nRomanello\u2019s hospital saw 200 heroin overdose cases last year, and countless related problems: abscesses from using unsterile needles, heart-damaging endocarditis and potentially fatal sepsis infections.\n\nOverdose patients usually bounce back quickly after given naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan. It works by blocking the brain receptors that opiates latch onto and helping the body \u201cremember\u201d to take in air.\n\nAt least 17 states and the District of Columbia allow Narcan to be distributed to the public, and bills are pending in some states to increase access to it. Attorney General Holder has called for more first responders to carry it. Last month, Ohio\u2019s Republican governor signed into law a measure allowing a user\u2019s friends or relatives to administer Narcan, on condition that they call 911.\n\nRomanello says his patients are usually relieved and grateful by the time they leave his hospital. \u201cThey say, \u2018Thank you for saving my life,\u2019 and walk out the door. But then, the withdrawal symptoms start to kick in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would think that stopping breathing is hitting rock bottom,\u201d adds Mason. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that fear of dying. You\u2019ve blocked the heroin, and they have to have it. They go back out to get more. You haven\u2019t fixed their addiction.\u201d\n\nIN OREGON: A FORMER ADDICT FIGHTS BACK\n\nBefore 9 o\u2019clock every weekday morning, the secret to one of the most successful drug rehabilitation clinics in Portland, Ore., waits behind a locked door. Meet David Fitzgerald, leader of the mentor program at Central City Concern, which claims a 60 percent success rate for treating heroin addiction.\n\nThe lock, Fitzgerald says, is a necessity because his addicts will take every opportunity offered, including early access to the \u201cmentor room.\u201d\n\nInside, the walls are covered in photos, including a collage from last year\u2019s group picnic. Recovering addicts smile and hold plates of food. Seven months later, Fitzgerald looks over the faces. Are they all still sober? Are they all still alive?\n\n\u201cMost of them,\u201d he says. \u201cNot all.\u201d\n\nHeroin cut a gash through the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s. Then prescription pills took over until prices rose. Now the percentage of those in treatment for heroin in Oregon is back up to levels not seen since the \u201990s \u2014 nearly 8,000 people last year \u2014 and the addicts are getting younger.\n\nCentral City\u2019s clients reflect that. In 2008, 25 percent of them were younger than 35. Last year that went to 40 percent.\n\n\u201cA lot of them aren\u2019t ready at a younger age,\u201d Fitzgerald says. \u201cThe drug scene, it\u2019s fast \u2026 it\u2019s different. It\u2019s harder than it was.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald, 63, speaks with a laconic prison patois, a reflection of 20-plus years incarcerated, all the while addicted to various drugs. The worst was heroin. In 1997 he got sober, and in 1999 he joined Central City Concern, then a burgeoning outfit.\n\nFitzgerald saw that the usual path for treating addiction wasn\u2019t working. Addicts were processed through detox for seven or eight days, then handed a list of tasks that included finding work, meeting with a probation officer, and locating the drop site for their daily food box.\n\n\u201cLike they\u2019re going to do any of that,\u201d Fitzgerald scoffs. \u201cFirst thing they do is see somebody they know, get that fix.\u201d\n\nCentral City Concern instead accompanies clients to housing appointments, keeps their daylight hours filled with to-dos and requires they spend idle hours at the facility, where they also sleep.\n\nIt\u2019s a bare-bones staff operating on a razor-thin budget, and the crop of younger addicts presents a new problem: finding appropriately aged mentors to match them with. But Fitzgerald has hope in 26-year-old Felecia Padgett, who remembers clearly the first time she fired heroin into her veins.\n\n\u201cI heard one time somebody say it\u2019s like kissing God,\u201d says Padgett. \u201cIt is. It\u2019s like getting to touch heaven.\u201d\n\nPadgett\u2019s six-year tumble involved, in order: heroin smoked, heroin shot intravenously, homelessness, one overdose, two close calls, a suicide attempt, arrest, jail, arrest, jail, arrest, jail and, finally, a one-shot, last-chance stop at Central City.\n\nBefore sobriety, she found herself selling to people younger than herself, suburban kids rolling up in their parents\u2019 cars.\n\nFitzgerald doesn\u2019t yet have money to pay her, and Padgett herself is still in recovery. But she, and others like her, may play a crucial role in confronting the problem as the face of Portland\u2019s heroin addiction gets younger.\n\nFitzgerald knows that many of the clients he sees at 25 may be back in rehab at 35, but he tries to remain optimistic that some of what they learn at Central City will, ultimately, make a difference.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about all you can do,\u201d he says, \u201chope some of it sticks.\u201d\n\nOhio\u2019s heroin problem at a glance\n\nIn and around Cleveland, heroin-related overdoses killed 195 people last year, shattering the previous record. Some Ohio police chiefs say heroin is easier for kids to get than beer.\n\nThe number of heroin-related overdose deaths went to 426 in 2011, up from 338 the previous year, part of a trend that police and counseling agencies have been warning about for several years. In 2004, 5.8 percent of Ohio drug users named heroin as their drug of choice; that rose to 12.5 percent in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chronicle-Telegram", "description": "On a beautiful Sunday last October, Detective Dan Douglas stood in a suburban Minnesota home and looked down at a lifeless 20-year-old \u2014 a needle mark in his arm, a syringe in his pocket.
