These patients received prescription drug coverage through CVS/caremark, the pharmacy benefit management business of CVS Health.\n\nOut of the two narrow network and three non-network plans analyzed, individuals enrolled in narrow-network plans had greater increases in medication-possession ratio than those in non-network plans.\n\nAdditionally, there was an even greater impact on adherence when there were 90-day prescription programs also in place.\n\n\"Despite common concerns that narrow pharmacy networks reduce access, we believe they can actually help encourage plan members to establish a pharmacy home where patients with chronic diseases can receive coordinated care and effective medication adherence support,\" study author William H. Shrank, M.D., senior vice president and chief scientific officer of CVS Health, says in an announcement.\n\nBased on the results, the authors write that health plans and payers should consider narrow network pharmacy benefit designs, as they allow members to optimize drug adherence and reduce overall healthcare costs. Many insurers already have embraced narrow networks in their health plan offerings, as a recent report found that 41 percent of silver plans on Affordable Care Act exchanges had small or extra-small networks.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the JAMA study (subscription required)\n\n- check out the CVS Health announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMarketing narrow network health insurance plans\n\nNarrow network plans offer same quality as other plans\n\nMore consumers enrolling in narrow network health insurance plans", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though there are growing concerns about narrow or preferred pharmacy networks, a CVS Health Research Institute study\u00a0published\u00a0in\u00a0JAMA\u00a0Internal Medicine\u00a0finds that such networks actually improve members' medication adherence.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Though there are growing concerns about narrow or preferred pharmacy networks, a CVS Health Research Institute study\u00a0published\u00a0in\u00a0JAMA\u00a0Internal Medicine\u00a0finds that such networks actually improve members' medication adherence.", "title": "Study: Narrow pharmacy benefit networks improve medication adherence", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/study-narrow-pharmacy-benefit-networks-improve-medication-adherence/2015-09-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Financial Management,medication adherence,narrow networks,narrow pharmacy networks,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Financial Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Though there are growing concerns about narrow or preferred pharmacy networks, a CVS Health Research Institute study published in JAMA Internal Medicine finds that such networks actually improve members' medication adherence.\nFor more:- here's the JAMA study (subscription required)- check out the CVS Health announcementRelated Articles:Marketing narrow network health insurance plansNarrow network plans offer same quality as other plansMore consumers enrolling in narrow network health insurance plans\nBased on the results, the authors write that health plans and payers should consider narrow network pharmacy benefit designs, as they allow members to optimize drug adherence and reduce overall healthcare costs.\nThese patients received prescription drug coverage through CVS/caremark, the pharmacy benefit management business of CVS Health.\nOut of the two narrow network and three non-network plans analyzed, individuals enrolled in narrow-network plans had greater increases in medication-possession ratio than those in non-network plans."}
