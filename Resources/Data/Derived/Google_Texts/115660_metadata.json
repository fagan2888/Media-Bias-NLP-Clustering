One sailed wide, but the other found the back of the net only for Higuain to be called offsides. His celebration was short lived.\n\nArgentina's captain and four-time player of the year Lionel Messi also sent a first half attempt within inches of finding the net.\n\nThe New York Times wrote this about Messi's performance:\n\n\n\nMessi is often praised as the best player in the world, but he has struggled to gain universal acclaim in Argentina, where he will forever be compared with Diego Maradona \u2014 who, of course, delivered a World Cup title in 1986. This was seen as Messi's opportunity to cement his legacy, but along with most of his teammates, he was never quite sharp enough in what was surely the biggest game of his life.\n\n\n\nGermany didn't fare much better. A header from Benedikt H\u00f6wedes bounced off of the post toward the end of the first half and the game remained scoreless as the teams marched off the field.\n\nAnd that's how it stayed for the second half and the first part of extra time; both teams fighting hard to gain ground as time ticked away.\n\nIt seemed like the game was headed toward a penalty shootout, as several games of this World Cup did, until Germany's Mario G\u00f6tze, in the 113th minute of time, chested down an Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle cross before volleying it past Argentina goalie Sergio Romero to win and take home the victory.\n\nThe win makes Germany four-time World Cup champions, but it is the first win as a unified nation. The victory also gives them the honor of being the first European team to win the title on South American soil.\n\nThis is the second time Germany has defeated Argentina for a World Cup title, having done so in 1990, the last time they won.\n\nBelow is an archive of the game as it happened:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Sports", "description": "In a tense match that saw a lot of action but no score for more than 90 minutes of play, Germany was finally victorious over Argentina to take home the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/germany-wins-world-cup-over-argentina-late-game-goal", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201407/331210664.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In a tense match that saw a lot of action but no score for more than 90 minutes of play, Germany was finally victorious over Argentina to take home the", "title": "Germany Wins World Cup Over Argentina With Late-Game Goal"}, "org_id": 1, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Steve Mullis", "wordCount": 471, "dc": {"title": "Germany Wins World Cup Over Argentina With Late-Game Goal"}, "nid": 25217, "datePublished": "2014-07-13", "story_id": 330725264, "keywords": "soccer, world, sports", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce608\"", "article_summary": "This is the second time Germany has defeated Argentina for a World Cup title, having done so in 1990, the last time they won.\nThe win makes Germany four-time World Cup champions, but it is the first win as a unified nation.\nIn a tense match that saw a lot of action but no score for more than 90 minutes of play, Germany was finally victorious over Argentina to take home the 2014 World Cup title on Sunday with a 1-0 win.\nThe victory also gives them the honor of being the first European team to win the title on South American soil.\nThe New York Times wrote this about Messi's performance:Messi is often praised as the best player in the world, but he has struggled to gain universal acclaim in Argentina, where he will forever be compared with Diego Maradona \u2014 who, of course, delivered a World Cup title in 1986."}
