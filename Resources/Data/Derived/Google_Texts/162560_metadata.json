Credit: Coffeemill/www.shutterstock.com Teen pregnancy is a public health problem in the United States. According to 2010 estimates, girls aged 15-19 years accounted for 614,000 pregnancies in the US. An additional 11,000 pregnancies were recorded in girls younger than 14. This translates to a rate of 126.6 pregnancies per 1,000 sexually active teens.\n\nAs high as these numbers seem, they actually show a reduction in the teen pregnancy rate from previous years. But they also show that we still have substantial work to do to bring down the teen pregnancy rate in the US.\n\nThe CHOICE project\n\nThe Contraceptive CHOICE project at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri provided about 10,000 sexually active women aged 14-45 with reversible contraception \u2013 in other words everything but sterilization \u2013 at no cost for two to three years. About 1,400 teenagers participated in the study.\n\nOver the course of the project, we evaluated the impact of reducing barriers to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) on pregnancy and abortion rates in St Louis. We set out to eliminate the most common barriers when it comes to LARC: education, access and cost.\n\nWomen were educated about all methods of reversible contraception, with LARC methods emphasized. LARC include IUDs and implants, like Implanon or Nexplanon. They are more effective than other popular forms of reversible contraception, like the birth control pill, because they do not rely on patients remembering to use them correctly.\n\nThe failure rate of IUDs and implants is less than 1%, compared with the pill, patch or vaginal ring, which range from 4-9%. Despite this, in the US they are not as widely used as other forms of reversible contraception.\n\nMore LARC, fewer pregnancies\n\nThe project's findings were astonishing. About 72% of the 1,400 teens in the study chose a LARC method. This is especially significant as only 4.5% of the general teen population reports using a LARC method. In fact, the teens in the study chose LARC methods at nearly the same rate as older women.\n\nThere\u2019s more to contraception than the pill. Credit: Point Fr/www.shutterstuck.com\n\nAmong the teens in our study using a LARC method the annual pregnancy rate was 34.0 per 1000 and the birth rate was 19.4 per 1000, a dramatic reduction compared to the national average of 126.6 pregnancies per 1000 sexually active teens.\n\nThis change can be attributed in large part to the high up take of LARC methods. How did the CHOICE project get so many teens to use LARC?\n\nEducation\n\nComprehensive counseling about contraception takes time. We found that most women had never heard of intrauterine devices or implants. And for those that had, the level of misinformation was enormous. Most women over-estimated the effectiveness of the pill, patch and ring, while under-estimating the effectiveness of LARC methods.\n\nThis misinformation can come from family and friends, but it can also come from clinicians. Some teens said they had been told by a clinician in the past that they could not have a LARC method. And some clinicians are biased towards other forms of contraception, like the birth control pill. There is a perception that teens are not good candidates for LARC despite the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Medical Eligibility Criteria for contraceptive methods.\n\nThis often stems from memories of the Dalkon Shield, a poorly designed IUD introduced in the 1970s that was associated with infection and infertility. Today's IUDs have been in use for more than 20 years and studies have demonstrated a record of safety.\n\nAccess\n\nThere is also a perception that teens will not want these methods, or won't be satisfied with them and ask to have them removed not long after they are inserted. These devices are an expensive upfront cost for clinics. And some clinicians have expressed concerns about \"wasted resources\" in a population that may ask have to their LARC removed after experiencing side-effects, like irregular bleeding.\n\nBut in our study, we found that continuation and satisfaction rates among the teen users were high: 82% and 75% at 12 months. This is similar to rates in older women using the same methods.\n\nAdditionally many clinicians express concerns with placing LARC on the same day it is requested. This fear is often rooted in the clinician's comfort in reliably ruling out pregnancy on that day.\n\nThe CDC has guidelines to help clinicians rule out pregnancy before placing a LARC. Same day insertion of LARC, just like prescribing quick start short-acting contraceptive practices, has been shown to increase the number of women who actually get the birth control option they want. Requiring multiple visits poses a barrier for teens who are often reliant on others for transportation.\n\nCost\n\nDespite the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, women and teens in the United States still face cost barriers to accessing contraceptive services. Large numbers of women and teens remain uninsured, and provisions of the law mean that some women have to pay for some portion of their method out-of-pocket or have no coverage for certain methods.\n\nPrivacy is another concern. For insured teens who can access contraceptive and family planning services without parental consent, as is true in about half the states, the potential for unintentional disclosure through an \"explanation of benefits\" remains a major concern and barrier.\n\nIf clinicians don't talk to teens about these contraceptives, this can severely limit access to what appears to be the best strategy thus far to prevent and reduce unintended pregnancies. Clinicians must address their own biases about teens and contraception.\n\nExplore further: Long-acting contraception methods reduce repeat abortions", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Teen pregnancy is a public health problem in the United States.
