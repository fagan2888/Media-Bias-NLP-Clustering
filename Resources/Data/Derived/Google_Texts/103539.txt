As I was researching for this week’s exclusive interview with 401k Averages Book co-editor David Huntley (see it here: “Exclusive Interview: David Huntley Explains Fees Just One Component of Value,” FiduciaryNews.com, May 19, 2015), I stumbled upon something I wrote when I first reviewed the book in 2011:

“Over the next year or so, fee disclosures will become the trending topic among 401(k) plan sponsors and fiduciaries. It will be tempting to overweight this parameter, but proper fiduciary due diligence requires one to focus on what really matters to the beneficiary. Fees may matter (and, in certain circumstances like index fund expense ratios, they will matter). However, in some cases – like overall investment returns – fees may be of lesser concern.”
