Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced on Friday that he had accepted an invitation from the Vatican to attend a conference next week hosted by the pope himself that will focus on social, economic and environmental issues.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019s \u2018Great Society\u2019 Plan Could Add $15 Trillion to the Debt\n\nThe topics are tailor-made for the Democratic presidential contender who has pinned his White House hopes on a message of economic fairness and other pocket-book issues.\n\n\u201cI am a big, big fan of the pope,\u201d Sanders said Friday during an interview MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to inject this sense of morality into how we do economics ... and we need that absolutely desperately.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Sanders will attend the Catholic Church\u2019s annual Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences conferences and deliver a speech on April 15. The 74-year-old said he would he would talk about how to create a moral economy during his overseas visit.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Big Risk Sanders and Clinton Are Taking as They Trade Insults\n\nSanders will give his address just four days before the crucial New York primary on April 19. The democratic-socialist, who has beat frontrunner Hillary Clinton in seven of the last eight contests, is hoping to use his recent momentum to pull off a stunning upset in Clinton\u2019s adopted home state and keep his campaign competitive in the race for delegates.\n\nWhat had been a mostly civil competition has taken a nasty turn in the last few days, with each candidate questioning the others qualifications for the presidency. Sanders seems to be backing down in that argument, for now, but the fracas could be a sign of more personal, bruising attacks to come between the two rivals before the Democratic National Convention this summer.\n\nRelated: How Voter Anger Finally Erupted and Gave Us Trump and Sanders\n\nThe news of Sanders\u2019 invitation came the same day Pope Francis called for a church that was less strict and more compassionate toward \u201cimperfect\u201d Catholics, including those who are divorced or been remarried.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful His Holiness is worried about injecting the papacy into the 2016 presidential election. In February he suggested Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is \u201cnot Christian\u201d for his idea to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants.\n\nThe real estate mogul responded in kind, saying: \u201cFor a religious leader to question a person\u2019s faith is disgraceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo leader, especially a religious leader, has the right to question another man\u2019s religion or faith,\u201d he said at a campaign event. Trump then accused the Mexican government of \u201cusing the pope as a pawn.\u201d\n\nAt a brief press conference in New York on Friday Sanders said he hoped to meet the pontiff during his visit.\n\nHowever, such a meeting wouldn\u2019t be without its tensions, according to Sanders. He said the two disagree on a host of topics, including gay rights.\n\nStill, Sanders said he admires the pope for talking about the \u201cworship of money, the greed that\u2019s out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Is Pope Francis \u201cFeeling the Bern?\u201d", "title": "Is Pope Francis a Bernie Bro?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/08/Pope-Francis-Bernie-Bro", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-vatican_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/08/Pope-Francis-Bernie-Bro", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-vatican_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Is Pope Francis \u201cFeeling the Bern?\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI am a big, big fan of the pope,\u201d Sanders said Friday during an interview MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\nStill, Sanders said he admires the pope for talking about the \u201cworship of money, the greed that\u2019s out there.\u201d\nThe real estate mogul responded in kind, saying: \u201cFor a religious leader to question a person\u2019s faith is disgraceful.\u201d\u201cNo leader, especially a religious leader, has the right to question another man\u2019s religion or faith,\u201d he said at a campaign event.\nSen.
