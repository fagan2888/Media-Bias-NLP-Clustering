The legal brawl it unleashed gives a rare glimpse into just how antagonistic the business of health care can become these days.  Last summer, just shy of its 65th birthday, East Texas Medical Center filed a lawsuit in state district court in Smith County alleging that Aetna Health, Cigna Healthcare and, especially, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas have plunged the hospital into financial jeopardy by repeatedly shutting it out of the most common and popular group health insurance networks.  The 502-bed main hospital in Tyler, which serves as the mother ship of a system of rural hospitals and clinics, is the only full-service, nonprofit hospital in all of Texas that has been involuntarily shut out of statewide preferred provider networks, the hospital contends.  Both inside and outside of Texas, health care experts say it is extraordinary for a hospital to resort to legal action to be put in a broad network, but it goes to the heart of how important such a designation has become.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the normal fight,\u201d says Stacey Pogue, a senior policy analyst focused on health care for the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin.  How are they going to afford to travel? asks Sam Williams, a 72-year-old Tyler retiree who received a new kidney almost three years ago at ETMC and receives follow-up care from a specialist several times a month.  The case has taken on the feel of a grudge match, and emotions are running high as it heads for trial later this year.  Desperation drives people and institutions to take drastic actions, says Gerald Kominski, director of the University of California, Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research.  Carroll says ETMC has been trying for years to be included in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield PPO network serving employer-sponsored group plans, without success and without ever being told why.  The closest to an explanation came from a Blue Cross and Blue Shield executive who testified that the existing network of patient care is fine and had been approved by the Texas Department of Insurance.  ETMC is included in Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s health maintenance network offered by some employers and on the federal exchange mandated by the Affordable Care Act.  Last year, not long after the lawsuit was filed, two of the nation\u2019s leading credit rating firms, Moody\u2019s Investor Service and Fitch Ratings, downgraded ETMC\u2019s rating and assigned a negative outlook.  Hospital officials are hopeful the insurer will cover any treatment as everyone waits for trial.", "vf": {"section": "business", "unique_id": "premiummysa-article-6889835"}, "author.name": "By Jenny Deam, Houston Chronicle", "og": {"site_name": "San Antonio Express-News", "description": "TYLER \u2014 In this place of tall pines and fried catfish, where the Texas twang rolls sweet and slow, a hometown hospital took a swing at three of the nation\u2019s largest insurers.
