Small group plans are still under review.\n\nFlorida Blue chairman and CEO Pat Geraghty made it clear that following the health law is what led to the cancellations.\n\n\u201cFlorida Blue has been an advocate for our members, and we complied with the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which called for the inclusion of essential health benefits in all individual plans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe notified impacted members and offered them the option of comparable and compliant plans giving them access to a wide variety of choices to meet their individual health care needs.\u201d\n\nFlorida Blue is a not-for-profit, policyholder-owned, tax-paying mutual company, according to its website. It has about 4.3 million customers and is a licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association \u2014 a group with funding ties to Obamacare sign-up group Enroll America.\n\n\n\nOther state insurers are on board, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.\n\n\u201cMost health insurers in Florida have already voluntarily extended coverage for affected policyholders through 2014. However, for those companies that did not, the Office pledges to work with any company that chooses to continue coverage in accordance with the President\u2019s transitional policy, and to facilitate the continuation of coverage for Floridians,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nBut whether affected Floridians can pay the same premium rate is unclear.\n\nKaren Ignagni, CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cChanging the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers.\u201d\n\nOther aspects of Florida\u2019s health-care system appear to need fixing, too.\n\nOnly 3,751 Floridians selected an insurance plan through the state Obamacare health exchange in October, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data. Florida has 3.5 million uninsured people.\n\nBut even if the healthcare.gov website is fixed, adding large amounts of newly insured patients will only exacerbate an existing shortage of doctors.\n\nIn an email, the Florida Department of Health told Florida Watchdog the state lacks an estimated 890 primary care physicians. That may not sound like a lot, but each of these missing doctors would serve dozens of would-be patients, and the current shortages are concentrated in low-income and rural areas, places where people will be added to the rolls.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Department Health is working with our partners to help make sure there are physicians to serve Floridians in every community,\u201d spokesman Nathan Dunn said.\n\nThe doctor shortage in Florida is far more severe when adding missing dental and mental health physicians to the primary care void, according to HHS figures\n\nFor lawmakers and interested parties, the solution, not surprisingly, is more spending.\n\n\u201cDue to the leadership of Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature, $80 million is available for graduate medical education through the new Statewide Residency Program,\u201d said Dunn.\n\nThe Florida Medical Association, a powerful lobbying group, wants more money for medical schools, forgiveness of medical student loans and higher Medicaid reimbursements for physicians.\n\nMany doctors won\u2019t treat Medicaid patients because the program pays roughly 59 cents on the dollar.\n\nFlorida Watchdog contacted the Agency for Health Care Administration for comment but was instead forwarded a list of Medicaid Provider Fee Schedules.\n\nHealth care is already the largest state budget expense, and Medicaid spending cost taxpayers $21 billion last year.\n\nFlorida taxpayers might also be on the hook for more when federal Medicaid reimbursements end, in part, at the end of 2014 \u2014 the same time hundreds of thousands of newly extended individual and small group insurance policies expire.\n\nScott, who supported the Obamacare Medicaid expansion \u2014 though he actively opposes the health law in general \u2014 predictably released a statement Thursday blasting the president\u2019s \u201cpatchwork\u201d fix.\n\n\u201cThe patchwork changes President Obama announced to his healthcare law today amount to nothing more than kicking the can down the road for 300,000 Florida families who are losing the insurance plans the President told them they could keep. What happens to these families in a year?,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid the partisan retort, Scott, a former health care industry executive, may have correctly stated, \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s changes to his own law will likely be the first of many.\u201d\n\nContact William Patrick at wpatrick@watchdog.org or follow Florida Watchdog on Twitter at @watchdogfla Like Watchdog.org?
