Some 1,500 buses will help move protesters into position.\n\nPolice will deploy 4,000 officers including in the regional capital Barcelona, where anti-independence protesters calling for Spanish unity are also seeking permission to rally.\n\nCatalan activists say they are organising 110 smaller human chains in advance of September 11, with rallies in Australia, Africa, Asia, including one at the Great Wall of China, and the Americas.\n\nThe protest is an attempt to emulate the 1989 Baltic Way chain that called for the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania during the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"There are big countries and small countries in the world, some industrialised and some not, and they all survive,\" said economics professor Antonio Argandona of the IESE Business School in Barcelona.\n\n\"So, can Catalonia survive? Yes, in the sense that it has a sufficiently solid economy to find its way,\" he said, warning however that it would still carry a price.\n\n\"It all depends on how a possible independence with Madrid is negotiated.\"\n\nMas has said he supports the protest but will not join in himself, out of respect for his role as political leader of all Catalans, including those that want to remain part of Spain.\n\n...,/.,", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Europe", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-06 03:19:25 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Hundreds of thousands of Catalans
