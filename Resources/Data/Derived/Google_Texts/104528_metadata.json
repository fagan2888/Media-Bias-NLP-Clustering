Phone lines jammed for the popular new health insurance co-op in Lewiston. Overall, it took people longer to sign up for health insurance than it did to fly cross-country, and the process was about as frustrating.\n\nAnd those were the lucky ones. Many very poor Mainers couldn\u2019t get insurance, period.\n\nAll from health care reform that no one completely understood.\n\nSince then, a lot has changed. And a lot has stayed the same.\n\nMore than 40,000 Mainers have gotten insurance through the marketplace, 90 percent of them with a federal subsidy to help pay for it. But the very poorest still don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nHospitals, doctors and others in health care are changing the way they do business, focusing more on cost, quality and keeping people healthy. At the same time, hospitals and clinics still are having trouble paying for growing demands on charity care.\n\nInsurance sign-ups are quicker, easier, less frustrating (Woo!). But people are still confused (Groan.).\n\nThat\u2019s where we come in.\n\nLast year, the Sun Journal and the Bangor Daily News joined forces to bring you ACA 101, a big look at the big law. There were tips. There were resources. There were examples featuring the characters of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d (Because that\u2019s just how we roll, yo.)\n\nThis year we bring you ACA 201, a look at how Maine has fared in the year since health insurance became mandatory for most Americans and a gander at what Mainers can expect in Year Two and beyond.\n\nAlso, more tips. More resources. And some profiles of real Mainers dealing with real insurance issues. Sorry, \u201cGrey\u2019s.\u201d\n\nFirst up: What\u2019s changed. What\u2019s not. What\u2019s love got to do with it.\n\nWell, that\u2019s new\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as the ACA or \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. It was controversial then and is controversial now.\n\nThe law phased in sizable changes to health care, including requiring insurers to provide some preventative care for free and prohibiting them from placing lifetime caps on insurance coverage (2010), requiring insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium dollars on medical claims rather than overhead such as office space and the corporate jet (2011), requiring that consumers be given easy-to-understand summaries about a health plan\u2019s benefits and coverage (2012), and creating health insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges, where people can buy their own insurance and use federal subsidies to help pay for it (2013).\n\nOne of the biggest changes came in 2014. That\u2019s when most Americans were required to have health insurance.\n\nEach state, plus Washington, D.C., handled the ACA a little differently. For 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 17 created their own marketplaces while 34 relied on the federal marketplace or a federal-state partnership.\n\nBy the end of this past August, 28 states, including D.C., had expanded Medicaid to cover very poor people who wouldn\u2019t get a federal subsidy under the program, while two states were discussing expansion. Twenty-one states didn\u2019t expand.\n\nMaine went with the federal marketplace and didn\u2019t expand Medicaid.\n\nA year or so ago, more Mainers started buying their own insurance. A lot more. Between 2013 and 2014, the number of Mainers covered by an individual insurance plan \u2014 rather than insurance from work or through the government \u2014 doubled, from about 32,000 to about 64,000.\n\nDespite the challenges signing up this past year \u2014 the federal marketplace website all but imploded at one point \u2014 the marketplace proved a popular way for Mainers to buy that insurance, often at the urging of health care advocacy groups. Or friends.\n\n\u201cI think it was the folks in either Eastport or Harrington, working with the lobstering community, they were getting a lot of push back by people that didn\u2019t like Obamacare. They finally got one of the community lead lobstermen, convinced him to sign up. And boy, when he signed up, it was just like the tipping point,\u201d Wendy Wolf, CEO of the Maine Health Access Foundation, said. \u201cAll of a sudden people there were willing to try it because he was a trusted voice in the community.\u201d\n\nMore than 40,000 Mainers signed up for insurance through the marketplace. The vast majority \u2014 90 percent \u2014 got a subsidy to help pay for it.\n\nThe average subsidy: $344 a month. Average insurance cost after that subsidy: $99 a month.\n\n\u201cWe have heard from assisters of people literally breaking into tears when they sign up and find out they have a $20-a-month premium, because for 20 years they haven\u2019t been able to afford insurance,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nAnd many seemed to be using the insurance.\n\n\u201cWe noticed, anecdotally in the clinic here, people showing up, saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got that new insurance and I want to get caught up (with medical care) now,'\u201d said Mike Murnik, medical director for the Blue Hill Memorial Hospital Family Medicine Practices in Blue Hill.\n\nAlso for the first time, Mainers had a new choice for insurance: a co-op. And for the first time in a long time, the majority didn\u2019t choose Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\n\nEight out of 10 Mainers who signed up for insurance through the marketplace bought a plan from Maine Community Health Options, the new co-op based in Lewiston. And 57 percent of all individual health plans in Maine, whether they were sold on or off the marketplace, went to MCHO.\n\nThe ACA did more than change insurance. With a mix of grants and penalties, it also encouraged changes in health care.\n\nIn Maine that has meant doctors, hospitals and insurers focusing more on cost, quality of care and keeping people healthy \u2014 and out of the hospital.\n\nMainers were more likely this past year to have their medical care overseen by a team \u2014 doctor, nurse, social worker, counselor and others \u2014 rather than a single doctor alone. Community doctors and hospitals were more likely to communicate about a shared patient, an effort to coordinate care and cut down on the number of people who ended up back in the hospital because no one was keeping tabs on them after their brain surgery or broken leg or heart attack.\n\nDoctors also were more likely this past year to junk the old \u201cfee-for-service\u201d way of medicine in favor of \u201cvalue-based\u201d programs. Old way: The insurance company pays the doctor as you go, if you go. New way: Doctors and hospitals contract with insurance companies for a set amount of money to keep you healthy.\n\nIf they do a good job \u2014 you\u2019re happy and healthier and costs are down \u2014 doctors get to keep some of that savings. If they don\u2019t do a good job \u2014 say, a diabetic patient ends up in the hospital more this year because the doctor hasn\u2019t been monitoring the patient well \u2014 the doctor and the hospital end up eating the extra expense.\n\nIt can be a good incentive for doctors that gets better care for patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned not only with what happens within the walls of a practice or hospital, but if somebody goes to a nursing home, somebody\u2019s in home health, that whole gamut. You\u2019re interested in what\u2019s happening to the patient across the whole spectrum,\u201d said Mike Donahue, vice president for network development and accountable care organization activity at Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems and its Beacon Health.\n\nBeacon Health, a group started by EMHS and including more than a dozen hospitals statewide \u2014 including Central Maine Healthcare\u2019s hospitals \u2014 started doing value-based contracts in 2012. About 12,000 patients were involved then. Today, 100,000 are involved. The number is expected to keep growing in 2015.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been an instant success. EMHS was hit with a $3 million penalty from the federal government in 2013 for failing to save enough money on Medicare patients.\n\nBut patients give the program high marks. And the new pay way seems to be working in other ways. Or at least helping.\n\nAt EMHS, readmission rates \u2014 the percentage of people who end up back in the hospital after they just got out \u2014 dropped from 11.5 percent in the first few months of 2012 to 1.7 percent in the first few months of 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of testimonials from patients that, \u2018Without this program I was going to the (emergency department) 15 times a year,\u2019\u201d Donahue said. \u201cPatients have said, \u2018This really changed the quality of my life.\u2019\u201d\n\nSame old, same old\n\nBut not everything has changed.\n\nAlthough more than 44,000 people in Maine have signed up for insurance through the marketplace and the number of Mainers covered by individual policies has doubled, it\u2019s unclear whether Maine actually has more insured people. And if it does, whether it has a lot more or just a few.\n\nThat\u2019s because the state didn\u2019t expand its Medicaid program, MaineCare, to cover people living below the poverty line. Experts say those people \u2014 who, if they\u2019re living alone, made less than $11,450 this past year \u2014 can\u2019t get federal health insurance subsidies and probably can\u2019t afford to spend $300 a month or so to buy insurance on their own. So they likely weren\u2019t added to the insured column.\n\nAlso, the state tightened MaineCare eligibility in recent years. And in January, it started cutting 22,000 Mainers from the insurance program altogether. Experts say those people probably can\u2019t afford to buy insurance on their own either.\n\nBut Gov. Paul LePage, who strongly supported tightening MaineCare eligibility and not expanding MaineCare, has said the ACA itself may have caused an increase in the uninsured.\n\n\u201cAlthough the employer mandate was delayed until after the election, there have been many stories about adjustments companies are making to avoid costly mandates or penalties. These changes could have affected the 60 percent of Mainers receiving insurance through their employer,\u201d LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said in September. \u201cWe also know that more than 10,000 private health insurance plans in Maine were canceled because of Obamacare mandates.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Census said Maine was one of only two states to see more uninsured people between 2012 and 2013, before the ACA\u2019s insurance mandate kicked in. A Gallup poll, however, found that between 2013 and the first half of 2014, the number of uninsured Mainers dropped, from about 16 percent to about 13 percent.\n\nSo where does Maine stand now, a year after the ACA\u2019s insurance mandate kicked in?\n\nExperts say 2014 Census data will be the best way to gauge, but those numbers won\u2019t be out until next September. They predict fewer uninsured people, but not the kind of drop other states have seen.\n\nThey point to a July report from the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute that said the uninsured rate has dropped 37.7 percent in states that expanded Medicaid and 9 percent in the states that didn\u2019t.\n\nAnother aspect of health care in Maine that hasn\u2019t changed since the ACA: patient debt and hospital charity care for people without insurance.\n\nBoth continue to climb.\n\n\u201cWe saw people roll off insurance that were Medicaid (recipients) and not see a big increase in enrollees,\u201d said Joe Wood, who deals with finances at St. Mary\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Lewiston. \u201cWhat it\u2019s meant to us is a struggle financially this year.\u201d\n\nFor the first 10 months of 2013, St. Mary\u2019s spent $18.9 million on charity care and bad debt. For the same period in 2014, it spent about $20.6 million, an increase of $1.7 million, or about 9 percent.\n\nIt has been a problem at Central Maine Healthcare, too, where bad debt and charity care are up $5 million from 2013 to 2014, a 10 percent increase.\n\nAt MaineHealth, the state\u2019s largest health care organization, 2014 figures aren\u2019t available yet. But based on what its hospitals have seen, \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate that it\u2019s going to go down, I can say that,\u201d said Katie Fullam Harris, MaineHealth\u2019s senior vice president for government relations.\n\nAlso unchanged for some Mainers: uncertainty.\n\nWill the state expand MaineCare, find some alternative that helps insure very poor people or keep the status quo? How will businesses respond when they\u2019re required to offer health insurance \u2014 or pay the penalty \u2014 starting in 2015? Will the U.S. Supreme Court kill the whole ACA thing next summer by nixing subsidies in states that use the federal marketplace \u2014 including Maine?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n\u201cPeople are just waiting for the next shoe to drop,\u201d said Patrick Marvin, policy analyst for the Maine Heritage Policy Center.\n\nLove and hate\n\nFour-plus years after it was signed and a year after the insurance mandate kicked in, people tend to both love and hate the law.\n\nLove the subsidies, hate being forced to buy insurance. Love that insurance companies must cover people with pre-existing conditions, hate that their old high-deductible, limited insurance plan wasn\u2019t acceptable under the law. Love that shots, cancer screenings and other preventative care is free, hate that it\u2019s free only to people who have insurance.\n\nOr they love it/hate it simply depending on the name.\n\n\u201cIf you ask somebody if they like Obamacare they may say no. And if you ask somebody what they think of the ACA, they\u2019ll have a positive opinion of it,\u201d said Ray Hurd, a regional administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the 900-plus-page law, and all the stuff that goes with it, is so confusing.\n\n\u201cI think we generate our own confusion. The Affordable Care Act is so complex with everything it covers that it\u2019s hard to really understand all the pieces,\u201d Hurd said.\n\nInsurers have tried to help some. Anthem this year added more popular plan options, simplified its co-pay structure and tweaked plan names to put deductible and co-insurance information right up front so the names are easier to understand. It\u2019s too soon to tell whether the new names will clear up a lot of confusion, though, since plan names have gone from \u201cAnthem Silver Guided Access with HSA\u201d to \u201cAnthem Silver X HMO 3500/20.\u201d (Anthem officials say people like the change so far.)\n\nIn general, advocacy groups, hospitals and others, including insurance companies, have focused on getting people to understand one basic piece: You need insurance. A media blitz this fall \u2014 Internet, radio, TV and print \u2014 urged Mainers to look at their insurance options and subsidy possibilities.\n\nThey say the effort has helped. So has old-fashioned word-of-mouth. They\u2019re seeing more interest, particularly in the Lewiston-Auburn area, where sign-ups were sluggish a year ago.\n\nBut still.\n\n\u201cMost people are still unaware of the marketplace and really unaware of the fact that they can get financial assistance that can make health insurance affordable,\u201d said Wolf at the Maine Health Access Foundation. \u201cWe have seen that over and over and over again, both nationally and here in Maine.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also unaware that come tax time this spring, there\u2019s a penalty for not having had insurance in 2014. And it\u2019s not nothing. Although $95 has been the figure most touted, it\u2019s actually $95 per adult (and $47.50 per child) or 1 percent of household income for the year, whichever is greater. Note the \u201cwhichever is greater\u201d part.\n\nThat penalty goes up significantly next year. And again the year after that.\n\nLove it or hate it, you still have to deal with it.\n\nThose who have used the marketplace say it\u2019s working better now. Signups are taking an hour or an hour and a half compared with five or six hours or more. Renewals are taking just 30 minutes or so.\n\nAt least, experts say, those people who want to shop for insurance on the marketplace can.\n\n\u201cThank God healthcare.gov is really working pretty smoothly,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThey\u2019ve all said it\u2019s just like night and day compared to last year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A little over a year ago, things weren\u2019t going very well for the Affordable Care Act.
