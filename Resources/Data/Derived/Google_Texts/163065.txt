A person driving a Chevrolet Silverado drove through a red light and slammed their vehicle into a Subaru in Aurora Friday night, killing the driver of the Subaru, police say.

Aurora detectives are investigating whether the driver of the SUV was intoxicated, according to a news release by Sgt. Craig Baumfalk. The driver of the SUV received only minor injuries.

“Alcohol appears to be a contributing factor in the crash,” Baumfalk said in the news release.

A preliminary investigation showed that the Subaru was going north on South Blackhawk Street at about 8:30 p.m. and made a left turn onto westbound East Iliff Avenue at the same time that the driver of the SUV ran a red light on westbound East Iliff Avenue.

The SUV “T-boned” the Subaru, causing extensive damage to both vehicles, according to Baumfalk.

The driver of the Subaru was taken to a hospital and was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

The names, genders and ages of the two people involved in the crash have not been identified.
