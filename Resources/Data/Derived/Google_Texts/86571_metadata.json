Besides the de rigueur mockery of a partisan foe, these barbs focus on Speaker Boehner\u2019s decision earlier this year to effectively fire Issa as the lead investigator into the Benghazi affair and replace him with a \u201cselect committee,\u201d led by Rep. Trey Gowdy, that will theoretically do a better job of finally unearthing proof that President Obama valued an election-year talking point about al Qaeda in retreat over the lives of four American citizens. Issa was reportedly unhappy about the committee\u2019s formation and, with evident schadenfreude, progressives could see why.\n\nYet as tempting as it may be to deride Issa for his Benghazi blunders, an under-appreciated development from earlier this week shows that when it comes to the second of Issa\u2019s dual obsessions, the supposed partisan bullying of conservatives by the Obama IRS, the House Oversight Committee Chairman has been a smashing success. Not in regard to uncovering evidence of a concerted plot to thwart right-wingers, of course \u2014 as is the case with Benghazi, there\u2019s no \u201cthere\u201d there for Issa to find \u2014 but in terms of the Republicans\u2019 ultimate goal, weakening the besieged agency\u2019s ability to regulate campaign finance to the point of near-nonexistence.\n\nThe story is told in a report released on Tuesday by the Center for Public Integrity, a left-leaning investigative journalism nonprofit. In brief, the CPI\u2019s research finds that the IRS, never quite capable of keeping up with political activists and donors\u2019 efforts to circumvent campaign finance laws through tax-exempt \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofits, all but declared it wouldn\u2019t even try after Republicans said the agency was making conservative groups jump through hoops while giving liberal ones the go-ahead. They were wrong on both counts \u2014 liberals and conservatives, both, were asked to provide further information (while also being allowed to continue their work as if they had already been approved) \u2014 but it hardly mattered. The coverage of the disproven allegations dwarfed that of their refutation and Democrats \u2014 already loath to defend most individual government agencies, much less the never-popular IRS \u2014 concluded it would be better to just move on than go to bat for the taxman.\n\nThinking in the short-term, as politicians are wont to do, letting what Paul Waldman cleverly called the IRS \u201cscandalette\u201d fade from the front-pages made sense. Democrats were already facing a tough election, and there was little reason to believe that talking about the IRS instead of jobs or wages or contraception would be the best way to inspire Democratic voters \u2014 who are notoriously uninterested in midterm contests \u2014 to hit the polls. But as the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Michael Hiltzik noted in a recent Op-Ed, what makes sense for Democrats in 2014 is very different from what makes sense for progressive politics in the years to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conventional wisdom says the GOP congressman is a failure.
