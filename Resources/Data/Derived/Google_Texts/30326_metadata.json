(Photo: CHRISTI PEACE/Staff photo)Buy Photo\n\nThe first time 11-year-old Hannah Faruolo saw the American flag and its 50 stars, she said she knew her dream of having a family was coming true.\n\nLiving in a Korean orphanage until she was 6, the flag became a symbol of the family she had always wished for.\n\nSo when Hannah, who was indeed adopted by a Toms River family, was asked to write about what the flag meant to her, her mother Dana Faruolo, advised her to \u201cwrite with your heart and that\u2019s how you\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nHer mom was right. Hannah\u2019s personal essay about the flag and family was this year\u2019s winner of PNC Bank\u2019s \u201cAmerican Patriot Essay Contest.\u201d She was one of nearly 5,000 students from grades 2 to 12 who entered the annual essay contest which asked what the American flag meant to them.\n\nWinning the contest meant that a hot air balloon would be brought to her school. And so, on Wednesday, her fourth-grade classmates excitedly gathered behind Cedar Grove Elementary School, hoping to see Hannah go up in a hot air balloon.\n\nHannah said that she wanted to tell her story in the essay because the American flag \u201cis a personal symbol for everybody.\u201d For her, it signified that she was an American and finally had a family.\n\nWhile living in the orphanage, Hannah was taught a little bit about the American culture and language by a woman who was adopting one of the other children at the time. Hannah said she remembers being shown the American flag and its many stars, and thinking about how people wished upon stars.\n\nDana Faruolo explained that her family adopted Hannah after learning about the orphanage from her uncle who was stationed in Korea at the time. Her uncle had visited the orphanage and gotten close to Hannah, so he was able to send the Faruolos pictures and information about her once the family decided to adopt her.\n\nIt took two years to finalize Hannah\u2019s adoption. So when Hannah finally got to meet Dana Faruolo, she enthusiastically greeted her by calling her \u2018mom\u2019 in Korean.\n\nHannah and her new family then flew on a 16 hour flight back to America, and Dana Faruolo explained that Hannah was exhausted and disoriented when they finally got off the plane.\n\n\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t know what was happening,\u201d Hannah explained. But then she \u201csaw the giant flag ... with the stars and stripes, and knew I was home.\u201d\n\nHannah\u2019s current teacher, Nicholas Liguori, has had his classes participate in the contest for the past 10 years. He said it was \u201coverwhelming\u201d for him and all of the students when they found out that Hannah won the essay contest.\n\nThe annual contest was started more than a decade ago when PNC Bank wanted to do something after the tragedy of 9/11 and was inspired by a hot air balloon that looked like the American flag. The bank has teamed up with QuickChek for the past 12 years to allow the essay winners to ride in a hot air balloon.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating a true patriot among patriots,\u201d said Joseph Whall, senior vice president of PNC Bank, about Hannah.\n\nUnfortunately for Hannah, it was too windy for a hot air balloon ride on Wednesday. The balloon was staked to the ground and blown up so Hannah, her siblings and her friends could all play inside. They ran and rolled around in the large, colorful, tent-like structure before the event concluded.\n\nSince Hannah is the grand-prize winner, she and her family will get VIP passes to the QuickChek NJ Festival of Ballooning, which takes place the weekend of July 24.\n\nAt the festival, Hannah will get to meet one of the musical guests and ride in a hot air balloon. Her teacher, school principal and 23 classmates will also get passes to attend the festival as well.\n\n\u201cI feel so happy to have won the contest,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to go up in a hot air balloon.\u201d\n\nHannah\u2019s essay\n\n\u201cThe American flag is a personal symbol. I love that I live in a country where you\u2019re free to believe however you want. I was born in Korea and lived in an orphanage until I was six. During adoption, I learned about the country and culture I was going home to. The first time I saw the American flag, I thought the stars meant my dream of having a family was coming true because I had wished upon them. Getting off the airplane I remember seeing the stars and stripes and I knew I was home. I was an American.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1MONhGQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "An 11-year-old girl adopted from Korea wins the PNC Bank \u201cAmerican Patriot Essay Contest.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "An 11-year-old girl adopted from Korea wins the PNC Bank \u201cAmerican Patriot Essay Contest.\u201d", "title": "Fourth-grader wins hot air balloon ride", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/toms-river-area/toms-river/2015/06/18/american-patriot-essay-hannah-faruolo/28922639/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An 11-year-old girl adopted from Korea wins the PNC Bank \u201cAmerican Patriot Essay Contest.\u201d", "title": "american patriot essay hannah faruolo", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc4235dabf7a4b15246264b066cb46431d87e6a3/c=0-1162-2988-4150&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/18/AsburyPark/B9317755144Z.1_20150618221617_000_GALB3TSSF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Hannah\u2019s personal essay about the flag and family was this year\u2019s winner of PNC Bank\u2019s \u201cAmerican Patriot Essay Contest.\u201d She was one of nearly 5,000 students from grades 2 to 12 who entered the annual essay contest which asked what the American flag meant to them.\nBuy Photo Hannah Faruolo plays with her friends Stephanie Maulshagen and Mackenzie O\u2019Connor inside a hot air balloon Wednesday.\nHannah said she remembers being shown the American flag and its many stars, and thinking about how people wished upon stars.\nHe said it was \u201coverwhelming\u201d for him and all of the students when they found out that Hannah won the essay contest.\nAt the festival, Hannah will get to meet one of the musical guests and ride in a hot air balloon."}
