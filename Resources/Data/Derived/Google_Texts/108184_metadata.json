Ask them why they hate the Affordable Care Act, and they\u2019ll say it costs too much.\n\nAll of which led to yesterday, when House Republicans voted to make the deficit larger and raise the price tag on \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nIt was just a couple of weeks ago that Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) complained that the ACA\u2019s price tag is \u201c skyrocketing .\u201d That, of course, is the exact opposite of the truth \u2013 the cost of the law has fallen five times in five years. But the complaint itself is ironic given how eager congressional Republicans are to make the law cost more on purpose. USA Today reported on a little-noticed House vote yesterday:\n\nThe House on Thursday easily backed repeal of a tax on the medical device industry. But President Obama has threatened to veto the bill, which would add more than $24 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years. With not all House members voting Thursday, that chamber\u2019s 280-140 vote fell one vote shy of a veto-proof majority to repeal the tax, which helps pay for the expansion of health insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nHow would Republicans pay for the tax cut? They wouldn\u2019t \u2013 the GOP plan is to just add the costs to the deficit they sometimes pretend to care about.\n\nThe bill now heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has identified this as one of his top priorities for the year.\n\nRepublicans not only want to make the ACA more expensive and increase the deficit; they consider this important.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the may very well get their wish \u2013 Roll Call reported that there\u2019s enough Democratic support for repealing the medical device tax that, in the event of a White House veto, Congress may be able to override President Obama and scrap the tax policy.\n\nAll of this might happen without any real explanation from Republicans as to (a) why they don\u2019t even try to pay for their priorities; (b) why they want Obamacare to be more expensive; and (c) why they so routinely forget to pretend to care about the deficit.\n\nAs for how this relatively obscure policy became such an important GOP goal, the New York Times published a good editorial on this a couple of years ago.\n\nEver since Congress included a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices in President Obama\u2019s health care reform law in 2009, there has been a forceful and well-financed campaign to repeal the tax \u2013 waged, naturally, by the medical device industry. It has donated generously to lawmakers and candidates, taken them on tours of their plants and spent tens of millions in lobbying. [\u2026] The tax, which applies to devices like artificial joints, pacemakers, wheelchairs and gloves, is expected to raise about $29 billion over 10 years. It is one of several sources of new revenue in the health care law that will pay for the expansion of health coverage to 30 million uninsured people, many of them poor. The industry claims the tax will hurt demand for its products, but, in fact, sales of these devices, which are not purchased directly by consumers, are unlikely to be affected by price, especially by a small tax increase. As more people receive health coverage that pays for devices, the industry will more than make up the cost of the tax.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "How would Republicans pay for their latest tax cut?
