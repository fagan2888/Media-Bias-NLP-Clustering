Schocket is a professor of history and American culture studies at Bowling Green State University and author of \u201cFighting over the Founders: How We Remember the American Revolution.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more American than Fourth of July cookouts, fireworks \u2014 and political speeches, especially as we enter another presidential campaign season. For politicians, nothing suits the holiday better than invocations of our nation\u2019s Founders. Not all such exclamations are cut from the same red-white-and-blue cloth, however. Pay close attention as the candidates praise the \u201cSpirit of \u201976,\u201d and you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re not taking a break from partisan rhetoric, but engaging in politics at its most elemental level. Here\u2019s a guide to some founding-related phrases and what they really mean today.\n\n\u201cFounding Fathers\u201d\n\nNothing says \u201cI\u2019m a conservative\u201d more than this phrase. That\u2019s because it evokes an image of rich white guys who didn\u2019t like taxes (until they had to wage a war, in which case they raised them to levels unimagined under British rule, but that\u2019s another story). Warren G. Harding coined the term, and since 2000, it has been used almost exclusively by Republicans. The more conservative the candidate, the more likely you\u2019ll hear it. Rand Paul, George Pataki, Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rick Perry have all flogged the Founding Fathers. But don\u2019t expect to hear this from Hillary Clinton: She uses \u201cFounders\u201d instead.\n\n\u201cA more perfect union\u201d\n\nThis is the liberal response to \u201cFounding Fathers.\u201d From the Constitution\u2019s preamble, the phrase originally expressed the hope that the Constitution would be an improvement over its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation. Today, liberals use it to imply that the nation and perhaps even the Constitution weren\u2019t immaculately conceived and stand in need of reform. You\u2019ll encounter it especially when politicians want to take on large issues such as race or the increasingly prominent role of big money in politics. Expect to hear this from Clinton and especially openly liberal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has used it before to celebrate Independence Day.\n\n\u201cCreated equal\u201d\n\nA phrase from the Declaration of Independence, which asserts \u201cthat all men are created equal\u201d and \u201cendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,\u201d including \u201cLife, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d This may be a big one this year as candidates take on economic inequality, racial inequality or both. Democratic candidate Martin O\u2019Malley used the phrase when announcing his candidacy, perhaps to help place himself to Clinton\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cA [fill in the blank] Bill of Rights\u201d\n\nWhen candidates want to drape stars and stripes over a plan to address an issue and make some innovation look as though it should be permanent, this is how they do it. The \u201cBill of Rights\u201d refers to the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, of course, including cornerstones of American civic life such as freedom of speech, worship, assembly; the right to bear arms; the right to a jury trial; and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. In recent elections, candidates have proposed a credit card bill of rights, a privacy bill of rights, veterans\u2019 bills of rights (including one in 2008 courtesy of current Republican hopeful Huckabee), a military family bill of rights, a crime victims\u2019 bill of rights, and even worker and shareholder bill of rights. One that probably won\u2019t come up now that Obamacare has fundamentally altered the debate over health care: a \u201cpatients\u2019 bill of rights,\u201d versions of which were backed by numerous presidential candidates from 2000 to 2008.\n\n\u201cOur sacred Honor\u201d\n\nThe Declaration of Independence closes with its signers pledging \u201cour Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor,\u201d no small matter given that, had the Revolution failed, they all likely would have been executed for treason. \u201cHonor\u201d resonates more with men than with women, and more with conservatives than liberals, and the \u201csacred\u201d part catches the ear of evangelical voters. Today the phrase gets used to imply that liberal officeholders are staining the nation\u2019s reputation. It was often brought up in the 1990s by Republicans angry about Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky; don\u2019t be surprised to hear it this year from Republicans attacking Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. Cruz spoke this phrase when he announced his 2016 candidacy.\n\nOf course, many Americans will be treated to an entire reading of the Declaration of Independence instead of a candidate\u2019s speech. But if so, don\u2019t despair: This guide won\u2019t expire, and you\u2019ll have 493 days to consult it during the 2016 presidential election campaign.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "andrew schocket, founding fathers, fourth of july 2016 election", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Referencing the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution is more about politics than patriotism.", "title": "What candidates really mean when they invoke the \u2018Founding Fathers\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-candidates-really-mean-by-founding-fathers/2015/07/03/7b0444f4-1e9c-11e5-aeb9-a411a84c9d55_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/07/03/Editorial-Opinion/Images/146392708.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-candidates-really-mean-by-founding-fathers/2015/07/03/7b0444f4-1e9c-11e5-aeb9-a411a84c9d55_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "andrew schocket, founding fathers, fourth of july 2016 election", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "7b0444f4-1e9c-11e5-aeb9-a411a84c9d55", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Referencing the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution is more about politics than patriotism."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6a8\"", "article_summary": "The more conservative the candidate, the more likely you\u2019ll hear it.\nRand Paul, George Pataki, Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rick Perry have all flogged the Founding Fathers.\nOf course, many Americans will be treated to an entire reading of the Declaration of Independence instead of a candidate\u2019s speech.\nHere\u2019s a guide to some founding-related phrases and what they really mean today.\nDemocratic candidate Martin O\u2019Malley used the phrase when announcing his candidacy, perhaps to help place himself to Clinton\u2019s left."}
