They also need to have strong integration with other community organizations and a governmental endorsement.\n\nThe program goes beyond traditional arts organizations to include architects, restaurateurs, specialty retailers and others who help define a community\u2019s identity.\n\nSpurred in part by the 2013 opening of the West Rail Line and anchored by the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design, Marino said a new generation of entrepreneurs are being drawn to the energy and potential of the area, the epicenter of which is Colfax Avenue and Teller Street.\n\nOne of those entrepreneurs is architect and artist Faye Crowe, who relocated her home and office to the area from Golden to get an early foothold in the district.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic environment to be associated with,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cYou can walk and bike anywhere, then you have the light rail to get a straight shot right into Denver.\u201d\n\nOr take the Edge Theatre Company, which relocated to the district into a larger venue last year and saw an 80 percent increase in show attendance from 2012.\n\n\u201cMoving here has allowed us to do bigger and better shows, and this year we were selected by Westword Magazine for best season by a theater company,\u201d said Rick Yaconis, the Edge Theatre executive director.\n\nAll told, there was 248 creative jobs in the district in 2013, up 25 percent from the year before; the 40 West website lists 20 art galleries.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t count artists who live in the area or the peripheral businesses popping up as an arts ecosystem continues to take hold in the corridor, Marino said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a creative hum that\u2019s attracting a whole supply chain \u2026 metal working, graphic design, shipping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an integral part of what\u2019s becoming a complete transformation of west Colfax.\u201d\n\nAustin Briggs: 303-954-1729, abriggs@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Creative district label cements place of 40 West Arts in Lakewood", "title": "Creative district label cements place of 40 West Arts in Lakewood", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/08/creative-district-label-cements-place-of-40-west-arts-in-lakewood/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__20140710_A4_ZAA1040WESTp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__20140710_A4_ZAA1040WESTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T17:00:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:34:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAKEWOOD \u2014 It took more than being at the forefront of a thriving arts hub for 40 West Arts to be certified as a creative district last month.\nBeing centered on the west Colfax corridor, 40 West also has a unique history and story to tell: the crossroads of 1950s car culture and modern day light rail transit.\nAll told, there was 248 creative jobs in the district in 2013, up 25 percent from the year before; the 40 West website lists 20 art galleries.\n\u201cWe will automatically be on the short list for where people want to relocate their business to \u2026 cafes, brewpubs and coffee shops,\u201d said 40 West director Bill Marino.\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing a great job promoting transit-oriented development and bringing a new generation of artists to live and work in the area.\u201dColorado Creative Industries along with the Boettcher Foundation, announced June 20 the certification of four new creative districts, including 40 West."}
