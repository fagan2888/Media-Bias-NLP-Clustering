A Hillsborough County teacher was arrested on drug possession charges Friday night after a search of her home yielded marijuana, paraphernalia and cash, according to authorities.

Tracy Eubanks Domante, 4314 W. Barcelona St., is charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell, possession of hashish with intent to sell, possession of drug paraphernalia, child neglect and maintaining a dwelling for drug use/storage/sales, police said.

Domante is a teacher at Seffner Elementary School.

About 11:55 p.m. Friday, members of the Tampa Police Department used a search warrant to enter Domante’s home. Investigators found 270 grams of marijuana, 119 grams of hashish oil, several pipes and bongs as well as other paraphernalia.

Investigators also found more than $3,700 in cash at the home, police said.

The majority of the drugs and cash were found inside Domante’s bedroom.

The charge of child neglect charge stems from Domante allowing her son, a minor, to use marijuana and be in the proximity of drug use/sales, police said.

Domante was released Saturday after posting an $11,000 bond.
