The assertion, if true, would dramatically escalate the nuclear challenge from one of the world\u2019s most isolated and dangerous states. In an announcement, North Korea said that the test had been a \u2018complete success.\u2019 But it was difficult to tell whether the statement was true. North Korea has made repeated claims about its nuclear capabilities that outside analysts have greeted with skepticism.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n--\u201cThe North\u2019s announcement came about an hour after detection devices around the world had picked up a 5.1 seismic event along the country\u2019s northeast coast. It may be weeks or longer before detectors sent aloft by the United States and other powers can determine what kind of test was conducted.\u201d http://goo.gl/5wjYfx\n\n--Per AP: \u201cThe White House says it can't confirm a North Korean nuclear test, but said the U.S. would condemn any violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\u201d http://goo.gl/OymPyx\n\n--Republicans quickly jumped on North Korea\u2019s claims. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), running for the GOP presidential nomination, said late Tuesday: \"I have been warning throughout this campaign that North Korea is run by a lunatic who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by. If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy.\u201d\n\n--And Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who chairs a Senate subcommittee overseeing East Asia, said he was monitoring the situation, and added: \u201cEvents like this are a symptom of a failed foreign policy. The Obama Administration\u2019s stance on Russia, Syria, and especially Iran have sent a clear message to dictators and despots around the world: if you act badly enough, for long enough, this Administration will reward your behavior.\u201d\n\nGOP RUSHES FOR GUN RESPONSE \u2013 The Hill\u2019s Scott Wong and Cristina Marcos: \u201cCongressional Republicans are scrambling for a way to halt President Obama\u2019s new unilateral actions on gun control. One powerful appropriator, Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas), has threatened to block federal funding for the Department of Justice unless the president\u2019s actions are reversed. But last year\u2019s trillion-dollar spending deal already funds the department through September, limiting the GOP\u2019s leverage.\"\n\n--\u201cThe courts are another option. GOP lawmakers are expected to sue to stop Obama\u2019s gun control proposals from taking effect \u2026 Republicans could force a showdown with Democrats sooner by trying to attach a provision rolling back the gun actions to important legislation \u2026 Several House Republicans are expected to introduce legislation to combat the executive actions in the coming days, though Obama certainly would veto such bills.\u201d http://goo.gl/QTEJOr\n\n@JohnCornyn: Do POTUS's tears flow from frustration with his inability to build consensus on mental health and violence solutions? We can show him a way.\n\n--Burgess Everett writes for POLITICO on how Obama\u2019s gun actions are putting moderates in a squeeze: http://goo.gl/j0iKZc. And the BBC breaks down what Obama\u2019s executive actions actually do: http://goo.gl/l0meGb\n\n--And a sneak peek: Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) will roll out legislation later today that would boost funding for mental health and behavioral health services nationwide.\n\nSTEVE ISRAEL CALLS IT QUITS \u2013 Newsday of Long Island, N.Y. has the scoop: \u201cRep. Steve Israel (D-Huntington) won\u2019t seek re-election to a ninth term in November in order to spend more time writing his second book \u2026 The Democrat, who has held the seat since 2000, said in a statement, \u2018It is time for me to pursue new passions and develop new interests, mainly spend more time writing my second novel.\u2019 He said he is \u2018looking forward to spending more time home and frequenting my beloved New York diners. Simply put, it\u2019s time to pass on the torch.\u2019\u201d http://goo.gl/WQttsI\n\n--In an interview with NYT\u2019s Carl Hulse, Israel also added relentless fundraising as another reason he chose to retire: \u201cI don\u2019t think I can spend another day in another call room making another call begging for money \u2026 I always knew the system was dysfunctional. Now it is beyond broken.\u201d http://goo.gl/HzHIFU\n\n--Israel\u2019s first book, \u201cThe Global War on Morris,\u201d currently ranks 85,000th on Amazon\u2019s bestseller list.\n\nTRANSITIONS \u2013 Dale Neugebauer, who served as chief of staff to Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) for 15 years, has retired from federal service. \u201cIt's been a great privilege and I've been fortunate to work with extraordinary people,\u201d he says. Veronica Wong is Issa\u2019s new chief.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY, Jan. 06, 2016 and you\u2019re reading The Huddle, where I\u2019m taking over Huddle for the rest of this week from Rachael Bade, just because I love you Huddle readers so much. As always, I\u2019m at skim@politico.com or on Twitter at @seungminkim.\n\nMy new followers include @JamesPindell and @Grei_sa.\n\nTODAY IN CONGRESS \u2013 The House is in at 10 a.m., with votes expected around 2:15 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. and then again from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Lawmakers will pass the Senate\u2019s version of the Obamacare reconciliation bill (read the CNN preview of the vote here: http://goo.gl/pIQH7R) and they\u2019ll also take up the SCRUB Act. The Senate is still snoozing.\n\nAROUND THE HILL \u2013 Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republican leaders will hold a news avail after their conference meeting at 10 a.m. in HC-8. House Dem Caucus Chair Xavier Becerra and Reps. Joe Crowley, Mike Thompson, Kathy Castor, Mark Pocan and Pete Aguilar will hold a post-caucus presser on gun control at 10 a.m. in HVC-210 alcove.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Reps. Chris Van Hollen, Jan Schakowsky, Jerrold Nadler, Diana DeGette, Suzan DelBene and Bonnie Watson Coleman will hold a news conference responding to the GOP Obamacare bill at 11:30 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Reps. Tim Huelskamp, Jim Jordan and Raul Labrador will host their monthly Conversations with Conservatives at noon in 2237 Rayburn.\n\nOBAMA RAIDS TRIGGER DEM BACKLASH \u2013 The intraparty split over the Obama administration\u2019s immigrant raids spilled into full view this week, as I write this morning for POLITICO: \u201cDemocrats and immigrant-rights groups have turned against the Obama administration in an uproar over recent deportation raids, likening the president to bombastic GOP front-runner Donald Trump and warning him that the controversial strategy will tarnish his legacy on immigration.\u201d\n\n--\u201cRep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.) urged the administration to halt the raids, calling them a \u2018cruel reminder of a discredited policy.\u2019 The Congressional Hispanic Caucus will discuss the raids at its weekly meeting Thursday. And advocates, who held a strategy call Tuesday, want a meeting with Johnson and are demanding more information, including whether the immigrants targeted in the raid have lawyers. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the sole Latino Democrat in the Senate, criticized the administration\u2019s \u2018harsh tactics\u2019 in a statement to POLITICO.\u201d http://goo.gl/52U2GM\n\nHALEY TO DELIVER GOP REBUTTAL \u2013 The State of Columbia, S.C.: \u201cS.C. Gov. Nikki Haley, coming off a year where she gained national attention for her handling of the Charleston church slayings, will deliver the Republican response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address on Jan. 12. Haley is calling her nationally televised speech from Columbia an \u2018address\u2019 rather than a \u2018response,\u2019 as the political counterpoints have been called since they began in 1966. Haley is the first South Carolinian to deliver the State of the Union response.\u201d http://goo.gl/mVEf0b\n\nCONGRESS LIFTS FUNDING BAN FOR NEEDLE EXCHANGES \u2013 From Buzzfeed\u2019s John Stanton: \u201cIn the waning days of 2015, congressional Republicans agreed to essentially end their decades-long opposition to federally funding state and local needle exchange programs, slipping a repeal of the ban into the end of the year omnibus spending measure with virtually no fanfare.\u201d\n\n--\u201cThe decision \u2014 purportedly spearheaded by House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers and backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both from Kentucky, as well as West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who is on the Appropriations Committee \u2014 came in response to a massive HIV/AIDS outbreak in Indiana, as well as their home state\u2019s decision to implement its own exchange to combat growing heroin use. Rogers and Capito spokespeople did not return requests for comment, but a McConnell aide acknowledged that Rogers pushed for it and that McConnell ensured the language got in the bill.\u201d http://goo.gl/1fzSev\n\nIMPORTANT PAUL RYAN BEARD UPDATE \u2013 From the AP: \u201cFor House Speaker Paul Ryan, it's bye-bye beard. The Wisconsin Republican has been sporting a \u2018hunting beard\u2019 since Thanksgiving, but he appeared clean shaven on Tuesday as the House returned to business \u2026 One of the last two speakers to sport a beard was Joe Cannon of Illinois. The Republican led the House from 1903-11. Another bearded Republican, Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts, led the House from 1919-25.\u201d http://goo.gl/Q1OaBO\n\n--Ryan also chats with Roll Call\u2019s Alex Gangitano for the paper\u2019s Take Five feature, where the speaker says of what he missed about Washington while home over the break: \u201cNot a lot.\u201d http://goo.gl/hc8sg5\n\nTUESDAY\u2019S TRIVIA WINNER \u2013 No one got it, so I\u2019m asking it again.\n\nTODAY\u2019S TRIVIA \u2013 The Teapot Dome scandal marks the last time Congress detained someone pursuant to an investigation, after the Senate issued an arrest warrant for David Stewart of Standard Oil. Instead of \"Congress jail,\" where was Mr. Stewart held? The first person to correctly answer gets a mention in the next day\u2019s Huddle.
