His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nPresident Barack Obama and his socialist cabal, supported by the mainstream media, has perpetrated the world\u2019s biggest Ponzi scheme. It\u2019s crippling the U.S. economy, bankrupting the middle class, and driving up the national debt. It is known as Obamacare.\n\nLet\u2019s call it by its real name: \u201cObamafraud.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s call it by its real name: \u201cObamafraud.\u201d Share:\n\nWe\u2019ve been scammed. We\u2019ve been lied to and defrauded. While exploding health insurance premiums for small business and middle class Americans are bringing the economy to a virtual standstill, Obamacare exchanges and cooperatives are going bankrupt, costing taxpayers billions.\n\nSo far Obamacare exchanges have gone bust in Nevada, Vermont, Oregon and Hawaii. If Obamacare has run through every federal dollar in small, ultra-liberal states like Hawaii and Vermont, what hope is there for the rest of the nation?\n\nObamacare co-ops are even worse, collapsing and failing at a rate of almost 50 percent. Co-ops have failed in Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah. That\u2019s just about half of the 23 co-ops. Many more are on the brink of collapse. Taxpayers will lose billions of dollars.\n\nBut on a personal level, the story is even worse. Like millions of Americans my healthcare premiums have skyrocketed from $500 per month to well over $1,500. For Obama voters, I\u2019ll keep it simple: that means my rates have TRIPLED because of Obamafraud.\n\nBut that\u2019s only the start. My co-pays have doubled; my deductible is massive; my family\u2019s prescriptions are barely covered. One recent emergency room visit cost a co-pay of $500, plus $2,500 in other uncovered costs. That\u2019s WITH insurance that costs well over $1,500 per month.\n\nObama calls me \u201crich.\u201d I earn a high income and my family is healthy, yet these healthcare costs are draining my budget and crowding out all other expenses. In response my family is cutting spending dramatically. Do you have any idea what this means? Multiply this disaster happening to millions of middle class families, and it\u2019s clear why the economy is in freefall. Jobs will be lost by the millions. GDP is already at a standstill.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the REAL story of Obamafraud: the world\u2019s biggest scam and Ponzi scheme that the mainstream media calls a \u201csuccess.\u201d\n\nObama and the media claim millions of new signups. They call that \u201ca great achievement.\u201d Really? Let\u2019s apply the Obamafraud story to the private sector. Assume you own a car company and you offer 50 people who don\u2019t have cars free cars and 20 percent take you up on it. Is that \u201ca great achievement?\u201d\n\nObama offered free or greatly discounted health insurance and a few million people are taking him up on it. WOW! He\u2019s like \u2026 Moses!\n\nWhat if you ban the style of cars that 50 car lovers are already driving and then offer free replacement cars and they take them. Is that \u201ca great achievement?\u201d\n\nObama banned the insurance policies of millions of Americans, then told them they had to get a new one or face penalties. Is a combination of people accepting free stuff and other people getting new Obama-approved insurance policies because Obama took their old policies away \u201ca great achievement?\u201d WOW. Obama is so talented!\n\nWhat about the cost? If you spend $1 billion of other people\u2019s money on an auto factory, then sell $1 million worth of cars, is that a \u201csuccess?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Obama did. He spent and lost a few billion dollars of other people\u2019s money building a defective web site, then fixing it, then hiring thousands of overpaid bureaucrats and IRS employees to oversee it all, then billions more on wasted taxpayer loans to co-ops that are all going bankrupt.\n\nWho pays for it? YOU \u2013 with higher premiums, higher taxes and massive new national debt. Obama has wasted billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money. WOW, what a talented man.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse.\n\nWhat if each of the 50 people who loves cars, spent $25,000 on their old cars. But now, after Obama banned the old style they need to spend $50,000 each on new cars. They\u2019d never waste $50,000 unless they were forced at gunpoint. In this private sector example, they\u2019d be forced at gunpoint by mafia thugs. But in real-life Obama just uses the IRS and government thugs to force you to buy something you don\u2019t want, or need.\n\nWe were forced to throw away perfectly good $25,000 cars. Now we\u2019re broke and heavily in debt because you made us spend $50,000 on a new car we never wanted or needed. What \u201ca great achievement.\u201d\n\nBut, there\u2019s more!\n\nWhile you made everyone buy new cars, you also ruined the entire auto industry, so many carmakers have decided to retire, or go out of business. So now, people are walking around with \u201cthe right\u201d to free cars but there are no cars for them.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Obama did.\n\nHe forced people to sign up for free healthcare, but doctors are leaving in droves. They want nothing to do with Obamacare. So you\u2019ve got \u201cfree healthcare.\u201d Hooray! Unfortunately there\u2019s no one to provide it. You\u2019ll be stuck in long lines for years to get your \u201cfree stuff.\u201d Is that \u201ca great achievement?\u201d\n\nObama gave away free healthcare to poor people who never had a policy and calls that \u201can achievement\u201d because they took it. Then he banned the average middle class American\u2019s health insurance policy. They were forced at gunpoint to buy a new one. Now he claims \u201csuccess\u201d because they did s o- all because he ruined their perfectly good old policy.\n\nAnd to pay for it all, he\u2019s charging middle class Americans double or triple. By the time they add in deductibles and co-pays, they may be paying quadruple. They pay because they have no choice- there\u2019s a gun to their head. But they are left with no money, so they stop buying other things. So the economy is crippled.\n\nWorst of all, Obama has badly damaged the quality of the U.S. healthcare system. Doctors are leaving in droves while millions of new patients are being added to the system. The result will be gridlock and bankruptcy.\n\nOr haven\u2019t you heard the British government-run healthcare system is insolvent and on the verge of collapse and bankruptcy? By 2020 it will be forced to close 20 percent of its hospitals. At this moment patients wait up to eight hours for ambulances. British doctors call the government-run system \u201cworse than communist China.\u201d Now Obama has brought this train wreck to America. It costs far more, but delivers nothing but misery, disaster and bankruptcy.\n\nSince it cost the taxpayer billions, Obama\u2019s definition of \u201csuccess\u201d must be called DEBT. We pay for all this by piling up massive national debt that will someday soon turn America into Greece. And it\u2019s all achieved through extortion and media coverup. It\u2019s organized crime, sanctioned by government.\n\nObamacare isn\u2019t a \u201csuccess\u201d or a \u201cgreat achievement.\u201d It\u2019s a con job. A scam. A Ponzi scheme. The murder of the middle class.\n\nIt\u2019s OBAMAFRAUD.\n\nIt\u2019s time to throw everyone involved in the sale of ObamaFraud in prison. Let\u2019s start with the architect, Jonathan Gruber, and start moving up the food chain. It should end with the man it\u2019s named after \u2013 Barack Hussein Obama.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
