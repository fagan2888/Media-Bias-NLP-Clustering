Canfield is an Ohio cancer survivor who wrote in 2009 about being forced to drop her health insurance after she could no longer afford the monthly premium.\n\nAfter arriving in Tennessee, Obama made room in his limousine for Kelly Bryant, of Nashville, who wrote about finding affordable insurance under the law to treat her breast cancer.\n\nHello there! President Obama appeared at a Tennessee cancer survivor's front door and gave the woma, Kelly Bryant, a ride to an event on Wednesday\n\nNew friends: Obama is seen holding an umbrella over Bryant on Wednesday outside her Nashville residence\n\nConversation: Bryant has said she and the president had a 'normal chit chat' in the ride over\n\nHe picked Bryant up on the way to the event, hugged her and even held an umbrella to shield her from a pounding rain.\n\nAccording to the Tennessean, Obama said at the event held at Taylor Stratton Elementary School: 'It was so close to the school. Might as well swing by and get her.'\n\nBryant said to introduce the president, referring to her note: 'I never imagined in my wildest dreams that anyone would read it, let alone him.\n\n'I am living proof of a president who listens and cares about the American people.'\n\nShe was quoted by the Columbia Daily Herald as saying of her treatment: 'The second time around was a tougher treatment regimen and a surgery which would have made it impossible for me to work full-time.\n\n'With the help of healthcare.gov and the Affordable Care Act, I was able to find high-quality insurance that I could afford.\n\n'It was a comfort to me and my family knowing I can concentrate on getting better and not losing everything in the process.'\n\nBryant told the Tennessean she and the president had a 'normal chit chat' in the ride over.\n\nShe told the newspaper: 'He's such a friendly, laid-back guy. As soon as you get in his presence, you're comfortable.'\n\nThe Tennessean reported that Bryant and Obama discussed tea, coffee, and NHL ice hockey during the car trip.\n\n'I guess just being Southern, we're always taught to write thank-you notes,' Bryant told the newspaper.\n\nBryant told the Tennessean that Obama praised her yard and gave her a hug upon meeting her.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, the president signed a 2008 inauguration invite for Bryant.\n\nObama's choice to visit Tennessee was deliberate.\n\nThe state's Republican governor, Bill Haslam, tried to expand Medicaid under the health care law to cover more than 200,000 state residents \u2014 only to be stymied by state legislators of his own party.\n\nSpeaking out: Bryant said Wednesday: 'I am living proof of a president who listens and cares about the American people'\n\nTopics: Bryant and Obama discussed tea, coffee, and ice hockey during the car trip\n\nFresh off a Supreme Court victory, Obama said Wednesday in Tennessee that he's 'feeling pretty good' about the state of his health care law and pleaded for bipartisan cooperation on ways to make it work even better.\n\nObama said he wants to refocus the debate on improving health care quality, expanding access and eliminating waste now that the high court has upheld a key element of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n'I'm feeling pretty good about how health care is going,' Obama said before he removed his suit jacket and answered questions about health care from Tennesseans seated at tables in an elementary school cafeteria.\n\nObama argued to his audience \u2014 and during a Twitter question-and-answer session immediately after the event \u2014 that health care coverage rates could be vastly improved if more governors and lawmakers would accept the federal government's offer of billions of dollars of federal money to pay to expand Medicaid to cover millions more low-income Americans in their states.\n\nAbout 20 states, most of them led by Republican governors and including some heavily populated places like Florida and Texas, have refused to expand Medicaid. Obama has accused them of losing sight of what's good for their constituents.\n\n'I think because of politics not all states have taken advantage of the options that are out there,' he said. 'Our hope is that more of them do.'\n\nThe Supreme Court handed Obama a major victory on health care last week when it upheld federal financial aid to millions of low- and middle-income Americans to help pay for insurance premiums regardless of where they live.\n\nPresident Barack Obama walks in the rain to pick up Kelly Bryant at her home in Nashville, Tenn., Wednesday, July 1, 2015, en route to Taylor Stratton Elementary School\n\nPresident Barack Obama takes off his coat before speaking at Taylor Stratton Elementary School\n\nObama declared immediately after the ruling that the law is 'here to stay.' He cited progress under its provisions but said more work was needed to 'make health care in America even better.' In Nashville, he talked about making sure people know about the law's benefits, including free preventive care, help for seniors on prescription medication and prohibitions on insurers denying coverage based on a prior illness.\n\nWhile Obama talked up what he says is good about the law, the law's Republican opponents highlighted what they say is bad about it.\n\n'The latest Supreme Court ruling won't change Obamacare's multitude of broken promises, including the one that resulted in millions of Americans losing the coverage they had and wanted to keep,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Wednesday. 'And the ruling won't change the skyrocketing costs in premiums, deductibles, and co-pays that have hit the middle class so hard over the last few years.'\n\nAsked about the lack of Medicaid expansion in Tennessee, Obama lamented the politics he said are at play and urged lawmakers to find a 'uniquely Tennessee solution.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Obama,shows,outside,cancer,survivor,s,door,gives,lift,sent,thank,note,Affordable,Care,Act", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3148106/Obama-shows-outside-cancer-survivor-s-door-gives-lift-sent-thank-note-Affordable-Care-Act.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama went to Kelly Bryant's Nashville house before speaking at Taylor Stratton Elementary School on Wednesday.", "title": "Obama shows up outside breast cancer survivor's door", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3148106/Obama-shows-outside-cancer-survivor-s-door-gives-lift-sent-thank-note-Affordable-Care-Act.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/03/06/2A30657900000578-0-image-a-53_1435900793508.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3148106/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3148106/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3148106, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Obama,shows,outside,cancer,survivor,s,door,gives,lift,sent,thank,note,Affordable,Care,Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-07-03T05:23:36.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Dailymail.com+Reporter", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T07:35:09.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Obama shows outside cancer survivor s door gives lift sent thank note Affordable Care Act"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "President Obama went to Kelly Bryant's Nashville house before speaking at Taylor Stratton Elementary School on Wednesday.", "title": "Obama shows up outside breast cancer survivor's door", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3148106/Obama-shows-outside-cancer-survivor-s-door-gives-lift-sent-thank-note-Affordable-Care-Act.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/03/06/2A30657900000578-0-image-a-53_1435900793508.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "President Obama went to Kelly Bryant's Nashville house before speaking at Taylor Stratton Elementary School on Wednesday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb148\"", "article_summary": "He cited progress under its provisions but said more work was needed to 'make health care in America even better.'\nAsked about the lack of Medicaid expansion in Tennessee, Obama lamented the politics he said are at play and urged lawmakers to find a 'uniquely Tennessee solution.'\nAfter arriving in Tennessee, Obama made room in his limousine for Kelly Bryant, of Nashville, who wrote about finding affordable insurance under the law to treat her breast cancer.\n'I guess just being Southern, we're always taught to write thank-you notes,' Bryant told the newspaper.\nBryant told the Tennessean that Obama praised her yard and gave her a hug upon meeting her."}
