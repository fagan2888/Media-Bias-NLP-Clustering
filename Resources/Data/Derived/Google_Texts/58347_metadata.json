The proposed extension passed late Thursday afternoon, but still has to go on to the U.S. Senate for its approval.\n\nMCHC said if federal funding isn\u2019t approved soon, clinics that depend on the monies as FQHCs, could be severely affected as early as Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the health center, but closures are a possibility,\u201d said MCHC spokeswoman Jendi Coursey.\n\nMCHC and other local FQHC clinics mostly provide care to those who don\u2019t have health insurance or can\u2019t afford health care, Coursey said, who also pointed out the last time that significant funding cuts were made was in 2009, which led to the eventual closure of the Potter Valley Community Health Center.\n\nAdditionally, FQHC clinics qualify for reimbursement related to Medicare and Medi-Cal, including other benefits, for providing services to underserved populations, according to Coursey.\n\n\u201cMCHC is relatively large, as FQHCs go, but we worry about smaller FQHCs like the Anderson Valley Health Clinic or Mendocino Coast Clinics,\u201d said MCHC Chief Operating Officer Carole Press in a statement. \u201cThey depend on this funding to keep their doors open.\u201d\n\nSome doctors also directly benefit from FQHCs as part of the National Health Service Corps initiative to hire medical professionals while forgiving some medical school debt in return for working in underserved locations, Coursey said.\n\nMCHC Chief Executive Officer Linnea Hunter said besides providing health care for patients, regardless of their ability to pay, clinic providers funded as FQHCs also provide education on how to manage chronic conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you have diabetes,\u201d Hunter stated. \u201cWe provide nutritional education and encourage patients to get regular blood tests to keep the diabetes under control, because our reimbursement from the federal government depends, in part, on our patients staying healthy.\u201d\n\nAlthough Thursday\u2019s approval by the House was a step forward in securing funding, FQHC providers across the nation are anxiously awaiting a final decision as the calendar continues its push to Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cThis particular decision in Washington D.C. could have a very direct impact locally,\u201d Press stated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mendocino Community Health Clinic group, which provides
