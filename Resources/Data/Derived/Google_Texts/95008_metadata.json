It was in February 2009 that Rick Santelli delivered his famous rant on CNBC, and a few days later, a group calling itself the Tea Party Patriots was organized.\n\nToday the conventional wisdom is that the tea-party movement is exhausted. Polls are cited showing that only one-quarter of Americans express approval of the Tea Party. Democrats run ads claiming their opponents are tea-party radicals.\n\nMany Republicans argue that tea-party candidates have lost winnable Senate races, cementing the Democratic majority there rather than overturning it.\n\nThere is something to these lines of attack, but it misses a larger picture.\n\nI have likened the contemporary tea-party movement to the peace movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Both began as critics of the more like-minded party: Peaceniks excoriated Lyndon Johnson; the Tea Party decried George W. Bush. Both targeted politicians of both parties.\n\nBut both groups soon became mono-partisan, working within one major party. The peace groups secured the Democratic presidential nomination for George McGovern in 1972 and, more successfully, generated support for the young liberals who swept to control in the congressional elections of 1974.\n\nThe peace movement permanently changed the character of the Democratic party. For half a century, starting in 1917, Democrats were the party more inclined to support military interventions. In the almost half-century since then, Democrats have been consistently the more dovish party.\n\nThe tea-party movement has had a similar effect on the Republican party so far. We shall see if it proves as permanent.\n\nLike the peace movement, the tea-party movement brought hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people into political activity, people with strong convictions, not on peripheral, but on fundamental issues of public policy. The peace movement supplied energy and enthusiasm plainly lacking in the Democratic party in 1969 and the Tea Party did the same for the Republican party in 2009.\n\nSuch surges into politics will bring in many wackos, weirdos, and wannabes. But they also include many solid citizens and some with finely honed political instincts.\n\nBoth movements supported primary challengers against contrary-minded incumbents or favorites of party insiders. Some of those challengers \u2014 most notably Sharron Angle in Nevada and Christine O\u2019Donnell in Delaware \u2014 then lost winnable general-election races.\n\nBut the tea-party movement also supported some politically gifted challengers \u2014 some with considerable political experience (Marco Rubio in Florida, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania), some with none at all (Ron Johnson in Wisconsin), and some with insider connections among conservatives (Mike Lee in Utah, Ted Cruz in Texas).\n\nOn policy, the tea-party movement has had a significant impact as well. It contributed to Republican unanimity against Obamacare and against tax-rate increases.\n\nPresident Obama predicted that his reelection would \u201cbreak this fever\u201d of Republican opposition to his policies. Republicans would acquiesce in what Obama seems to regard as commonsense expansions of government.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened. Instead, policy has moved in the other direction. Republicans were willing to accept the sequester, despite spending cuts, and then to have it only tweaked slightly in the Ryan-Murray budget agreement.\n\nIncome-tax increases have been avoided on all but couples making $450,000 annually. The result is what liberals call \u201causterity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Obama has been repealing and revising Obamacare, whether the Constitution gives him authority or not. His signature law is disintegrating.\n\nSo Republicans, though controlling only the House and squabbling over tactics, have shifted the vector of national policy. They have had even more policy success in many of the majority of states with Republican governors and legislatures.\n\nTea-party spokesmen are, unsurprisingly, dissatisfied with the results \u2014 as peace advocates often were by policies of even Democratic administrations. But in American politics, policy success is never complete and almost always unsatisfactory to principled purists.\n\nPolitical reporters chronicling the exhaustion of the tea-party movement focus on the apparent weakness of primary challenges to incumbent Republican senators and congressmen. None currently seems seriously endangered except possibly 36-year Mississippi senator Thad Cochran.\n\nThe tea-party movement continues to be frustrated by a politics-driven Internal Revenue Service and the intractability of Obama and Senate Democrats.\n\nBut Republicans have a solid chance to win a Senate majority, and Obama\u2019s approval is stuck in negative territory. Big-government liberalism, hailed as the wave of the future in 2009, now seems widely discredited.\n\nThe tea-party obituaries, like Mark Twain\u2019s, are premature.\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a9 2014 The Washington Examiner.
