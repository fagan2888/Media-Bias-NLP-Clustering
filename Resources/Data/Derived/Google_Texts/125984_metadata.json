However, even if you do have coverage, it\u2019s still important to review your current plan and reevaluate your health care needs. Your needs and your family\u2019s needs may have changed since last year, and there may be a better plan available to you on the Marketplace.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the 7.1 million people who purchased coverage through the Marketplace last year, or you purchased coverage through your state-based marketplace or the GoHealth Marketplace, you may have the option to passively re-enroll by taking no action. Be warned, though: doing so might mean missing out on significant savings, ending up with a different plan that you don\u2019t choose yourself, and even losing access to your current doctor. It\u2019s important to evaluate your needs and browse plans before making your final decision.\n\nUpdate Your Information\n\nEnrolling through a private exchange like GoHealth means that you\u2019ll have access to tax subsidies to reduce your monthly premiums. Tax subsidy eligibility is based on your household income and household size, so it\u2019s important that all of your personal and household information is updated to get the most accurate estimate. Even the smallest of changes can affect the subsidy you receive.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Health insurance open enrollment, health insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health insurance open enrollment, health insurance", "generator": "Drupal 7", "description": "Review Your Current Health Insurance Plan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4351\"", "article_summary": "Review Your Current Health Insurance PlanIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, Open Enrollment is the time to explore your options and find the best coverage.\nHowever, even if you do have coverage, it\u2019s still important to review your current plan and reevaluate your health care needs.\nTax subsidy eligibility is based on your household income and household size, so it\u2019s important that all of your personal and household information is updated to get the most accurate estimate.\nYour needs and your family\u2019s needs may have changed since last year, and there may be a better plan available to you on the Marketplace.\nUpdate Your InformationEnrolling through a private exchange like GoHealth means that you\u2019ll have access to tax subsidies to reduce your monthly premiums."}
