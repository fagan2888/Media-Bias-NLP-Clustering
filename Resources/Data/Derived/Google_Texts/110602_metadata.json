Greg Walden, R-Ore., has good news to deliver at Saturday\u2019s town hall in The Dalles about progress to rename the local veterans\u2019 clinic after a soldier who earned the Medal of Honor for heroism in Korea.\n\nThe town hall will be held in Wasco County will be held at 8:30 a.m. on May 21 at the Fort Dalles Readiness Center, 402 E. Scenic Drive.\n\nEarlier this year, Walden introduced a bill to change the name of The Dalles Community Based Outpatient Clinic at 704 Veterans Drive to the Loren Kaufman Clinic.\n\nKaufman was killed in action on Feb. 10, 1951, and laid to rest at the Willamette National Cemetery.\n\nHe was born and raised in The Dalles and spent three years in combat during World War II before serving in Korea.\n\nIn 1950, Kaufman twice charged enemy lines while firing his rifle, throwing grenades, using his bayonet and seizing an unmanned machine gun to fight off the enemy.\n\nFor those actions, he was posthumously awarded the nation\u2019s highest military honor.\n\nThis is Walden\u2019s third try at getting a bill to rename the clinic through Congress, an effort that is supported by the entire Oregon delegation and major veterans\u2019 organizations, such as the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard on this plan to honor a local hero and we\u2019re looking forward to getting this done so he can be properly recognized,\u201d said Andrew Malcolm, press secretary for Walden.\n\nAt the town hall, Walden will also provide an update about legislation that forces the U.S. Forest Service to complete a land exchange on Mount Hood. He is also striving to combat the growing opioid epidemic and obtain job-creating grants to grow rural economies. Walden, whose Second Congressional District spans 70,000 square miles and 20 of Oregon\u2019s 36 counties, has held 10 town halls in 2016.\n\n\u201cI rely on these visits as one way to help me stay in close touch with local communities, and they\u2019re where I get my \u2018to do\u2019 list to take back to our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d he stated in an announcement about the town hall.\n\nAlso on his discussion list is last week\u2019s judicial ruling in favor of the House in a lawsuit against the Obama Administration\u2019s alleged improper use of taxpayer dollars under Obamacare.\n\nIn November 2014, the suit was filed in response to the administration\u2019s use of taxpayer dollars to make payments to insurance companies on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGOP leaders believe that is an over-reach of the president\u2019s authority as the constitution gives Congress the responsibility of making budget decisions.\n\n\u201cThis administration has repeatedly expanded executive power and flouted basic constitutional principles,\u201d said Walden following that ruling.\n\n\u201cThis decision sends a clear message to the administration: they must follow the constitution and respect the role of Congress. This is a big step forward toward reining in the administration and protecting Congress\u2019 power to decide how federal tax dollars should be spent. I am pleased that the court followed the plain meaning of the constitution and upheld the rule of law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "6F0F769B18C1F1E5145E5D36120FA2DD", "google-site-verification": "dr1NYOQ7L4IbMMoa9sXvO5M_zmQUi6VBoRGJSuF4BSg", "og": {"url": "http://www.thedalleschronicle.com/news/2016/may/19/walden-hosts-td-town-hall/", "type": "article", "title": "Walden hosts TD town hall"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "description": "U.S. Rep.
