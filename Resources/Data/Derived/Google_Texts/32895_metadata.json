But Roberts and the majority determined that this standard should not apply. That ambiguity aside, the statute compels the IRS to issue tax credits in every state.\n\n\u201c\u2018In extraordinary cases, however, there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation,\u2019\u201d the opinion reads. \u201cThis is one of those cases. The tax credits are among the Act\u2019s key reforms, involving billions of dollars in spending each year and affecting the price of health insurance for millions of people. Whether those credits are available on Federal Exchanges is thus a question of deep 'economic and political significance' that is central to this statutory scheme; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly.\u201d\n\nThe ruling thus combines a standard textualist mode of interpretation\u2014a view to the statute\u2019s full context to determine the meaning of isolated provisions\u2014with a common sense analysis of the law\u2019s structure into a mode of interpretation you might call heurism. Congress wrote a law that authorizes subsidies everywhere both because the law says so, but also because Congress obviously didn\u2019t write a law that with the capacity to self-destruct.\n\nThat the Affordable Care Act survived this challenge isn\u2019t a surprise. After oral arguments in March, some of its most confident detractors walked away assuming that the Court would uphold the subsidies. But it was widely suspected that the opinion would expose a new thread for conservatives to pull. According deference to the Obama administration would allow a Republican president to revisit the issue and void the subsidies unilaterally. On another reading, the Court could have determined that the challengers interpretation of the ACA confronted states in such an onerous decision that it amounted to unconstitutional coercion, and thus invited new challenges to different laws that empower the federal government to apply pressure to states.\n\nThe opinion the Court actually wrote turns out to be perfectly stitched.
