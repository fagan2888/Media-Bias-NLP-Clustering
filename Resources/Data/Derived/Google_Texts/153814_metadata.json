Here are some of the developments in these races over the weekend: In Kentucky, a Bluegrass Poll (robo-poll with live cell calls) found Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell leading GOP challenger Matt Bevin by 20 points among Republican likely voters, 55%-35%, coming close to our NBC-Marist result from last week (McConnell 57%, Bevin 25%). Also while not explicitly saying he\u2019d back McConnell in a general election if he wins the primary, Bevin pretty much implied it by saying he\u2019s never supported a Democrat over a Republican. \u201cI see no chance of that starting any time in the foreseeable future, including in this race.\u201d\u2026 In Georgia, GOP Senate front-runner David Perdue is up with a new ad slamming Jack Kingston's \"big spending experience\" in Washington and depicting the congressman as an infant. Also in Georgia, Perdue and Karen Handel both said they will not support McConnell as party leader, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. And in Oregon, the GOP Senate primary is being colored by a last-minute report that front-runner Monica Wehby \u201cwas accused by her ex-boyfriend last year of \u2018stalking\u2019 him, entering his home without his permission and \u2018harassing\u2019 his employees according to a Portland, Oregon police report.\u201d\n\nGetting out over our skis\n\nA little Monday morning rant: One of our chief complaints about the state of American politics and political journalism in particular is how everyone is getting WAY AHEAD of themselves. For starters, there is so much focus and attention on 2016 (Is Hillary healthy? Is Jeb going to run? Is Julian Castro going to be Hillary\u2019s running mate?) when there are no declared candidates and when we still have about six months to go before the 2014 midterms. Another example is the practice of news organizations and pollsters using likely voter models to describe an election environment before Memorial Day when many Americans haven\u2019t even begun to tune in to the general election. (A tip: There is no such thing as a likely voter six months before a general election, and if you think there is one, you\u2019re likely cooking the books. Our rule is to always begin introducing likely voter models after Labor Day.) A third example of everyone getting ahead of themselves is all the coverage of what a Republican-controlled Senate might look like come 2015. We understand the temptation here: When the current political stories seem boring, or when you have to feed the 24-7 beast, it\u2019s easy to jump ahead. And your First Read authors are plenty guilty in writing about 2016 and what a GOP Senate might look like next year. But it\u2019s also important for everyone to realize what we\u2019re doing here and what some of the unintended consequences might be of covering news cycles a year or two early. Of course, if 2014 and 2016 bore you, here\u2019s a good primer on the 2018 California Democratic gubernatorial primary.\n\nTapping the breaks on Julian Castro and 2016\n\nOver the weekend, NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker and Katie Wall confirmed that San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro -- who delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic convention -- is the favorite to become the next HUD secretary, replacing Shaun Donovan (who\u2019s expected to be the next OMB director). And the news set off plenty of 2016 speculation about Castro. The argument: Even though HUD secretary is hardly a top-tier cabinet post, the move would elevate Castro to being a VP possibility in 2016, more so than being just San Antonio mayor. But, folks, a little caution here: When is the last time someone went straight from being HUD secretary to possibly being one step away from the presidency? The closest example would be 1996 GOP VP nominee Jack Kemp (who was HUD secretary from 1989-1993), but Kemp had served in Congress for 18 years BEFORE THAT -- and had run for president himself in \u201888. Castro becoming HUD secretary would certainly elevate him to run for statewide office in Texas down the road. But potentially being Hillary\u2019s VP in 2016? That appears to be a little premature, in our opinion, and, well, go see our rant above. And speaking of getting ahead of ourselves, realize the vetting of Castro is not done. So nothing is a done deal and there\u2019s UNLIKELY to be any announcement THIS WEEK.\n\nBurwell's HHS nomination producing yawns rather than fireworks\n\nWhen it comes to another cabinet position, want to know one of the stories that hasn\u2019t quite materialized like we thought it would? The answer: Sylvia Mathews Burwell\u2019s confirmation hearing to succeed Kathleen Sebelius as HHS secretary. After Sebelius announced her resignation, many of us predicted that the Matthews hearings would allow Republicans to re-litigate the Health Care Wars. But so far, the nomination has produced yawns instead of partisan fireworks. Here\u2019s how the New York Times described Burwell\u2019s hearing last week: \u201cSylvia Mathews Burwell, President Obama\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, appeared Wednesday to be on a swift path to confirmation after she sailed through another cordial congressional hearing without promising significant changes in federal health policy or regulations\u2026 Sen. Tom Coburn, a conservative Republican from Oklahoma, set the tone for the hearing on Wednesday when he introduced Ms. Burwell and said he would vote for her with enthusiasm. \u2018She\u2019s competent,\u2019 Mr. Coburn said. \u2018So often we have people placed in Washington who aren\u2019t competent for the task at hand.\u2019\u201d Wow. You know the politics of health care has been defused -- at least for the time being -- when Republicans are supporting (rather than fighting) Burwell\u2019s nomination.\n\nNunn\u2019s not-so-good answer on health care\n\nTurning back to the midterms, Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn gave this answer to NBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt about if she would have voted for the Affordable Care Act if she served in the Senate back in 2009-2010: \u201cAt the time that the Affordable Health Care Act was passed, I was working for Points of Light,\u201d she answered. When Hunt followed up by asking her \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d Nunn added, \u201cI think it's impossible to look back retrospectively and say, what would you have done when you were there.\u201d Folks, that isn\u2019t a good answer -- and it doesn\u2019t come across as credible since, well, it\u2019s the biggest political debate this country had for the last four years. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone like Michelle Nunn didn\u2019t have an opinion one way or the other.\n\nThe strange (and ugly) story down in Mississippi\n\nFinally, this story more than got our attention over the weekend: \u201cAuthorities say a conservative Mississippi blogger went into a nursing home, photographed the bedridden wife of Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran without permission and posted an image online as part of a video,\u201d the AP said. \u201cRose Cochran, 72, has lived at St. Catherine's Village since 2000 and has dementia. Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28, of Pearl, was arrested Friday and charged with a felony, exploitation of a vulnerable adult, Madison police said. Kelly remained in the Madison County Detention Center on Saturday on $100,000 bond.\u201d Here is where things get a murky (and potentially ugly): Kelly happens to be a supporter of Cochran primary opponent Chris McDaniel, and the McDaniel campaign says it has no connection with Kelly. But the McDaniel campaign has provided somewhat contradictory explanations about when it knew about the break-in. And the central question in this story has become: Was the campaign -- in any way -- tied to this? And of course, what\u2019s the motivation to do this? Well, some McDaniel supporters (or Cochran detractors, however you want to refer to them) have been trying to start a whisper campaign about Cochran\u2019s fidelity. That\u2019s the potential motivation here, but the story is VERY complicated -- a spouse in a nursing home for over a decade. This isn\u2019t as cut and dried as your typical attempt at digging into someone\u2019s personal life. It\u2019s ugly.\n\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.
