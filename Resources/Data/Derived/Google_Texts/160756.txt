Another major ObamaCare lawsuit is heading to the nation's high court.

Priests for Life follows Catholic doctrine against contraception and abortion, and opposes being forced to provide free coverage in Obamacare.

American Freedom Law Center attorney Rob Muise carried the pro-life case to the D.C. Court of Appeals, which denied the petition to rehear the case with a full court, known as en banc.

"Essentially we were asking the full court to rehear a panel decision in which it upheld the H.H.S. mandate against our challenge on behalf of Priests for Life," Muise explains to OneNewsNow.

The court denied the petition for a rehearing â€“ but that didn't end the Law Center's case on behalf of Priests for Life. Three of the judges dissented.

Muise tells what happened next: "And one judge in particular, Circuit Judge [Janice Rogers] Brown, wrote a very forceful dissent, which clearly demonstrates that the panel got the original decision wrong and that we should ultimately prevail in the U.S. Supreme Court."

A sampling of those opinions can be read here via the Law Center's website.

So an appeal is in the works, with the Law Center hoping the strong dissenting opinions will convince the high court to review the case. Tweet to @AFLC_Updates

The case will be a companion to the Hobby Lobby lawsuit in which the court ruled that closely held corporations, owned by people of faith, can't be forced to violate their faith.

Hobby Lobby was the for-profit case while Priests for Life is a non-profit operation asking for a similar ruling.
