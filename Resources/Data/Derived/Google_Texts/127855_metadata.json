John McCain (R-Ariz.), who told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Wednesday that he would back the bill even though it would end the Medicaid expansion in his home state of Arizona.\n\n\u201cObviously the governor and legislature in my state decided that they wanted that program and so it is going to trouble me in the vote. When you\u2019re looking at the overall components of it, I would probably vote for it,\u201d McCain said. \u201cBut it does provide me with discomfort. I am very reluctant to take positions that counter the decisions made by the governor. As a federalist, I believe it puts me in a difficult position.\u201d\n\nWith McCain\u2019s support, the Republican-authored bill inches closer to the 51 votes it will need to pass the Senate through parliamentary rules known as reconciliation. Among other provisions, the legislation would scrap the medical device tax and the s0-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health care plans. It would also eliminate subsidies for individuals who purchased health care insurance on exchanges.\n\nBut the most contentious provision may be the repeal of the Medicaid expansion, which is a huge component of Obamacare. The Senate bill would eliminate the expansion over a two-year period, ostensibly to allow the next president to pass a replacement health care bill. But the likelihood of such a bill ever passing is slim at best, and the resulting loss of coverage for millions of people could have dramatic socioeconomic and political consequences.\n\nMcCain isn\u2019t the only Republican senator willing to roll those dice. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Pat Toomey (Pa.) who, like McCain, are up for re-election in 2016, have said they will back the bill as well, though Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) -- perhaps the most vulnerable Senate Republican this cycle -- is leaning towards opposing the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It is going to trouble me.\"", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-12-03 10:05:25 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "\"It is going to trouble me.\"", "title": "John McCain Reluctantly Supports Obamacare Repeal Bill That Guts Medicaid In His State", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-obamacare-repeal_us_565f04a0e4b079b2818ca5cf", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/565f05b41b0000d80029ef49.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It is going to trouble me.\"", "creator": "@samsteinHP", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/565f05b41b0000d80029ef49.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "John McCain Reluctantly Supports Obamacare Repeal Bill That Guts Medicaid In His State", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-02 10:05:25 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_565f04a0e4b079b2818ca5cf", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "John McCain, mccain repeal bill, Obamacare Repeal,mccain obamacare,senate republicans obamacare", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "John McCain, mccain repeal bill, Obamacare Repeal,mccain obamacare,senate republicans obamacare", "published_time": "2015-12-02 10:05:25 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-12-02 10:21:33 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- A Republican bill to repeal Obamacare is putting several senators who are up for re-election in a difficult bind.\nThe Senate bill would eliminate the expansion over a two-year period, ostensibly to allow the next president to pass a replacement health care bill.\nAmong other provisions, the legislation would scrap the medical device tax and the s0-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health care plans.\nIt would also eliminate subsidies for individuals who purchased health care insurance on exchanges.\nBut the most contentious provision may be the repeal of the Medicaid expansion, which is a huge component of Obamacare."}
