Several Republicans said they\u2019re discussing the possibility of adopting a budget this year that would let the next president\u2019s agenda \u2014 including top goals like repealing Obamacare \u2014 bypass a Democratic filibuster at the very start of the year. Republicans used a similar move early this year to send a bill repealing much of Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood to President Barack Obama, who vetoed it. The strategy would allow Republicans who control the House and Senate to put just such a bill on the desk of a new president if their party wins the White House, without having to grind through months of budget process. To succeed, Republicans need the Senate parliamentarian to let them use rules set by a budget resolution into the next Congress.\n\nJust to be clear, this would mean immediately tossing tens of millions of people off their health coverage, bringing back denials for pre-existing conditions, and generally throwing the entire American health care system into chaos, while they then start to consider how they might go about \u201creplacing\u201d what they\u2019ve repealed with some super-terrific new plan. The word \u201cbacklash\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what would ensue.\n\n* And that\u2019s not all the fun stuff that\u2019s going on with congressional Republicans:\n\nCongressional leaders thought last year\u2019s two-year spending deal would pave the way for a simple budget season ahead of the election in November. They were wrong. The same group of conservatives that drove former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to resign amid a government spending fight last year are now threatening to rebel against the upcoming House Republican budget over $30 billion in spending that Boehner helped secure. They want current Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wisc.) to back out of the last year\u2019s bipartisan agreement and reset spending targets at a lower level despite Ryan\u2019s recent pleas for a more united party.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said many times, for these people the substantive conservative goals they espouse aren\u2019t really the point. The point is fighting. When you\u2019re fighting you have purpose, you have direction, you have meaning. But waiting to fight another day? No fun at all.\n\n* Via Natalie Jackson, there are no fewer than seven new polls out today of the Republican race in New Hampshire.
