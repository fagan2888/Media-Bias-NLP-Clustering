Hundreds of voters got up bright and early to see Gov. Jeb Bush in Fountain Inn less than 12 hours before the presidential candidate hit the debate stage.

"My debate prep is hanging out with my four grandchildren," Bush said at the relaxed town hall, which was filled with a standing room only crowd in the 420-person capacity Younts Center theater.

Bush spoke to the crowd about his record promoting school choice and voucher programs in Florida, his plans for the military and the Department of Veteran's Affairs and rebuking Republican frontrunners Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz before turning to the crowd for questions.

Bush seemed relaxed and confident fielding questions on boilerplate campaign topics, including abortion, health care and Supreme Court appointments.

One woman was trying to decide between Bush and Gov. John Kasich and asked Bush to give her reasons she should support him. The former Florida governor dinged Kasich for expanding Medicaid in Ohio under the Affordable Care Act while praising South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for refusing Medicaid expansion.

Up the road at Mutt's BBQ in Mauldin, Kasich got the endorsement of beloved former Clemson quarterback Tajh Boyd at a midday rally. Boyd said Kasich's campaigning in New Hampshire won him over.

"Gov. Kasich is for the people," Boyd said, before leading the crowd in a Clemson cadence count.
