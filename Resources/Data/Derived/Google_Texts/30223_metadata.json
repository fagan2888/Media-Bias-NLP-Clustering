It serves a valuable purpose only if, through its grandeur, it transports worshipers to a spiritual state of mind.\n\n\u201cThe point of the building is to leave people feeling awestruck,\u201d said the Rev. Michael Busch, rector of St. Michael\u2019s Cathedral in Toronto.\n\nBut is it the building itself that gives the space a sacred quality, or is holiness derived from the devotions of worshipers, present and past, who have occupied the space?\n\nI don't pretend to know the answer to that question. But I do know this: Even an ardent atheist can look at a house of worship and see the signs of an invisible human longing that is common to us all, believer and unbeliever alike.\n\nMark Schacter is a photographer based in Ottawa, Canada. Mark's newest book of photography, Houses of Worship, has just been published. It's available now in Canada and will be released internationally soon.
