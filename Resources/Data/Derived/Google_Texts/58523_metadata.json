As the end of the year draws closer, however, the importance of making a payment to secure coverage by January 1 has increased. As recently as November 18, a Healthcare.gov chat representative told THE WEEKLY STANDARD that the site \"may give you [the online payment] option when you complete your enrollment,\" but that \"We are still experiencing some technical difficulties with the website, which is why it would be best to possibly go through the insurance company to make your first premium payment.\"\n\nInstructions at Healthcare.gov on making premium payments are ambiguous at best. The following appears under the question, \"How Do I Apply for Marketplace Coverage?\" [emphasis added]:\n\nEnroll. After you choose a plan, you can enroll online and decide how you pay your premiums to your insurance company. You must pay your premium by the date the insurer provides before your coverage can begin. Coverage can begin as soon as January 1, 2014 .\n\nDespite saying \"decide how you pay your premiums,\" no options are actually listed.\n\nHowever, a blog post at HHS.gov on Wednesday removed any doubt. Payments may not be made through the Healthcare.gov Marketplace. Now HHS says \"you must pay your premium to the insurance company directly \u2013 not to the Health Insurance Marketplace.\"\n\nThis recent blog post suggests that the \"technical difficulties\" with online payments could not be overcome, and so the option will not be available. The government has repeatedly refused to respond to questions about the status of work related to an emergency, no-bid contract for \"financial management services\" awarded in August that would presumably handle online payments, part of the \"back end\" that HHS has indicated is far from complete.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barack Obama,Glitches,Health Care,Obamacare,Website,Jeryl Bier", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "With all the other problems experienced by consumers at Healthcare.gov, actually making payments for plans selected has gotten relatively little attention until recently. &nbsp;As the end of the year draws closer, however, the importance of making a payment to secure coverage by&nbsp;January 1&nbsp;has increased. &nbsp;As&nbsp;recently as November 18, a Healthcare.gov chat representative told THE WEEKLY STANDARD that the site may give you [the online payment] option when you complete your enrollment, but that We are still experiencing some technical difficulties with the website, which is why it would be best to possibly go through the insurance company to make your first premium payment. &nbsp;", "title": "Obamacare Website Still Not Accepting Online Payments", "url": "http://www.weeklystandard.com/obamacare-website-still-not-accepting-online-payments/article/769582", "image": "http://cdn.weeklystandard.biz/cache/r960-5e2f1ae50c5b842e127528e88d796f47.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With all the other problems experienced by consumers at Healthcare.gov, actually making payments for plans selected has gotten relatively little attention until recently. &nbsp;As the end of the year draws closer, however, the importance of making a payment to secure coverage by&nbsp;January 1&nbsp;has increased. &nbsp;As&nbsp;recently as November 18, a Healthcare.gov chat representative told THE WEEKLY STANDARD that the site may give you [the online payment] option when you complete your enrollment, but that We are still experiencing some technical difficulties with the website, which is why it would be best to possibly go through the insurance company to make your first premium payment. &nbsp;", "title": "Obamacare Website Still Not Accepting Online Payments", "image": "http://cdn.weeklystandard.biz/cache/r960-5e2f1ae50c5b842e127528e88d796f47.jpg", "site": "@weeklystandard", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407}, "google-site-verification": "QxcYUvYDy42iu46zPMF2vwdQlMXsJP74MqOgujGnpaQ", "keywords": "Barack Obama,Glitches,Health Care,Obamacare,Website,Jeryl Bier", "article": {"author": "Jeryl Bier", "published_time": "2013-12-05 12:07", "title": "Obamacare Website Still Not Accepting Online Payments"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9ff\"", "article_summary": "This recent blog post suggests that the \"technical difficulties\" with online payments could not be overcome, and so the option will not be available.\nInstructions at Healthcare.gov on making premium payments are ambiguous at best.\nWith all the other problems experienced by consumers at Healthcare.gov, actually making payments for plans selected has gotten relatively little attention until recently.\nAfter you choose a plan, you can enroll online and decide how you pay your premiums to your insurance company.\nNow HHS says \"you must pay your premium to the insurance company directly \u2013 not to the Health Insurance Marketplace.\""}
