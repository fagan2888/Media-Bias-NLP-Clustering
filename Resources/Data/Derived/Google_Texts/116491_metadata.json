Among the lower-cost plans available via ACA exchanges, 70 percent are now narrow-network plans. McKinsey defined narrow-network plans as those that include less than 70 percent of the doctors and hospitals in a market.\n\nThe McKinsey study found that:\n\nPremiums for broad-network plans are 13 to 17 percent higher than premiums for narrow-network plans.\n\nFaced with a choice between fewer choices and higher premiums, a majority of consumers knowingly opt for the cheaper plans even when more expensive ones with more choices are available.\n\nAbout 10 percent of consumers don't have a choice. Narrow-network plans are their only option.\n\nAbout a quarter of people who bought narrow-network plans via the ACA did not understand they would have fewer choices of doctors and hospitals.\n\nSeparately, a survey conducted by The Commonwealth Fund also found that most of the newly insured were happy with their network choices, but that 40 percent didn't know what doctors and hospitals were covered by their plan.\n\nWriting in the Times' Upshot blog, Margot Sanger-Katz reports that the narrow-network plans are here to stay.\n\n\"...Insurers have every motivation to keep these plans on the market.\"\n\nRead the McKinsey report:\n\n&lt;a href=\"http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1237257/mckinsey-report.pdf\"&gt;McKinsey Report (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1237257/mckinsey-report.txt\"&gt;McKinsey Report (Text)&lt;/a&gt;", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "Insurance companies cutting choices significantly in bid to counter Obamacare costs, study finds", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Most consumers knowingly buy plans with fewer choices, but some unaware other options available", "title": "Insurance companies cutting choices significantly in bid to counter Obamacare costs, study finds", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/insurance_companies_cutting_ch.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/15503726-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most consumers knowingly buy plans with fewer choices, but some unaware other options available", "creator": "@Stan_Diel", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/15503726-standard.jpg", "title": "Insurance companies cutting choices significantly in bid to counter Obamacare costs, study finds", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, July 29, 2014, 11:10 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, July 29, 2014, 11:08 AM", "article_author": "Stan Diel", "Description": "Most consumers knowingly buy plans with fewer choices, but some unaware other options available"}, "article_summary": "The McKinsey study found that:Premiums for broad-network plans are 13 to 17 percent higher than premiums for narrow-network plans.\nAmong the lower-cost plans available via ACA exchanges, 70 percent are now narrow-network plans.\nMcKinsey defined narrow-network plans as those that include less than 70 percent of the doctors and hospitals in a market.\nNarrow-network plans are their only option.\nAbout a quarter of people who bought narrow-network plans via the ACA did not understand they would have fewer choices of doctors and hospitals."}
