They had found a stray dog wandering in an empty parking lot, and the animal appeared to have been badly hurt.\n\nDespite its serious injuries, the dog offered an extremely friendly greeting to the deputy who responded to the call. He took the injured dog to Aspen Meadow Veterinary Specialists for lifesaving treatment.\n\nThe sheriff's office is hoping to speak with the driver of the red truck and anyone who has information about this dog's injuries.\n\nIt was discovered the dog had been shot at close range. The bullet, lodged in his jaw, has fractured the jaw bone in multiple locations. Deputies have named the resilient dog Beefcakes. They report that Beefcakes will require surgery to remove the bullet and reconstruct his shattered jaw.\n\nPeople can go to the Longmont Humane Society's Facebook page for information on how to help Beefcakes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28467970/help-sought-dog-shot-and-wounded-boulder-county", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0711/20150711_100601_doggie_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Charlie Brennan, Staff Writer", "description": "The Boulder County Sheriff's Office on its Facebook page is trying to find out more information behind the shooting and serious wounding of a dog that occurred on Tuesday night.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28467970:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-11T10:02:22-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28467970/help-sought-dog-shot-and-wounded-boulder-county", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0711/20150711_100601_doggie.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Boulder County Sheriff's Office on its Facebook page is trying to find out more information behind the shooting and serious wounding of a dog that occurred on Tuesday night.", "title": "Help sought for 'Beefcakes,' dog shot, wounded in Boulder County"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The Boulder County Sheriff's Office on its Facebook page is trying to find out more information behind the shooting and serious wounding of a dog that occurred on Tuesday night.", "title": "Help sought for 'Beefcakes,' dog shot, wounded in Boulder County", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28467970/help-sought-dog-shot-and-wounded-boulder-county", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0711/20150711_100601_doggie.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-11T10:02:22-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Help sought for 'Beefcakes,' dog shot, wounded in Boulder County", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0711/20150711_100601_doggie.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2015-07-11T14:08:00-0600", "endDate": "2025-07-11T10:02:22-0600", "byline": "By Charlie Brennan,", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-07-11T10:16:06-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Deputies have named the resilient dog Beefcakes.\nPeople can go to the Longmont Humane Society's Facebook page for information on how to help Beefcakes.\nThe Boulder County Sheriff's Office on its Facebook page is trying to find out more information behind the shooting and serious wounding of a dog that occurred on Tuesday night.\nThe sheriff's office is hoping to speak with the driver of the red truck and anyone who has information about this dog's injuries.\nThey report that Beefcakes will require surgery to remove the bullet and reconstruct his shattered jaw."}
