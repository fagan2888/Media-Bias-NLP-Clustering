But he also got into their heads.\n\n\u201cRoosters have only two goals in life,\u201d Mr. Moreno said. \u201cThey want to kill every other rooster\u201d and mate with every hen.\n\nA rooster with issues is the latest physically demanding stage role for Mr. Moreno, a lanky 30-year-old with a playful grin and mischievous brown eyes that reflect his Panamanian and Irish lineage. An Army brat who grew up in New York and Texas, Mr. Moreno has gained acclaim for an array of boldly oddball roles. He played a troubled military veteran in Ethan Lipton\u2019s \u201cLuther\u201d and a teenage miscreant in Robert Askins\u2019s \u201cHand to God.\u201d He got naked and took a bath in Jen Silverman\u2019s \u201cPhoebe in Winter.\u201d He was part of a terrifying coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre in Jonas Hassen Khemiri\u2019s \u201cInvasion!\u201d that nearly caused violent reactions from theatergoers who were unaware that he was part of the show.\n\nStarting Jan. 9, Mr. Moreno brings his rooster back to Ensemble Studio Theater, which is remounting its production of \u201cYear of the Rooster\u201d after a well-received run last fall. In his review for The New York Times, Neil Genzlinger called the play \u201castonishingly entertaining,\u201d and Mr. Moreno \u201cutterly convincing.\u201d The actor recently spoke with Erik Piepenburg about cockfighting and cultural identity. Following are excerpts from their conversation.\n\nPhoto\n\nQ. Have you ever been to a cockfight?\n\nA. [Laughs.] No. But I know people like that. I\u2019ve got family members that are pretty country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat kind of research did you do to play a rooster?\n\nI watched a lot of bird documentaries. David Attenborough has this series called \u201cThe Life of Birds.\u201d Birds\u2019 eyes focus in a very funny way. My performance is based on their movements that are jittery. But I don\u2019t want it to be too much. I\u2019m probably onstage for 25 minutes. The trick is what quick stories can I tell. There\u2019s a kiss in the show that\u2019s now a bird kiss because of something I saw in a documentary.\n\nWhat\u2019s a bird kiss?\n\nWe lean in like we\u2019re about to kiss, me and another bird, and at the last moment we kind of peck at each other.\n\nYou seem to be attracted to physically harrowing roles. Odysseus Rex is an aggressive chicken.\n\nAnother part of my research was watching all the great angry performances: Ben Kingsley in \u201cSexy Beast,\u201d \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d Ed Norton in \u201cAmerican History X.\u201d A lot of what I learned is about the power that comes from stillness. Once you make a move, that\u2019s it. People know what you\u2019re going to do. Until that moment, while that tension is building, that\u2019s when you really get people leaning on their seats. Birds have that too. They\u2019ll just stare off at something.\n\nDoes your look affect your roles?\n\nMy college professor was like, you know, you\u2019re going to get cast in a lot of Latino roles. I was like, you\u2019re crazy. But as soon as I got up here, I did. It\u2019s opened up a whole new community for me, which is great. But there\u2019s an issue with that in the New York theater, of how they deal with people that don\u2019t look a certain way. With me, it\u2019s my name more than anything else. They see the head shot and the name, and it automatically puts me in a box. I thought about changing my name when I first moved up, to Bobby Monroe, which is an anagram of Moreno. But then I was like, nah, this is my name.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140101113852, "twitter": {"description": "For his role as a bird in \u201cYear of the Rooster,\u201d Bobby Moreno did some unusual research.", "title": "Bobby Moreno in \u2018Year of the Rooster\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/theater/bobby-moreno-in-year-of-the-rooster.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002626506"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "erikpiepenburg", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/05/arts/05SNAPSHOT/05SNAPSHOT-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/theater/bobby-moreno-in-year-of-the-rooster.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002626506", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/theater/bobby-moreno-in-year-of-the-rooster.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "theater", "hdl_p": "To Play a Rooster, Do the Research", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/theater/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 1, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Year of the Rooster (Play)", "keywords": "Theater,Moreno  Bobby,Ensemble Studio Theater,Year of the Rooster (Play)", "news_keywords": "Theater", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Erik Piepenburg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/05/arts/05SNAPSHOT/05SNAPSHOT-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Moreno, Bobby", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ERIK PIEPENBURG", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "For his role as a bird in \u201cYear of the Rooster,\u201d Bobby Moreno did some unusual research.", "tom": "Interview", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/05/arts/05SNAPSHOT/05SNAPSHOT-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "For his role as a bird in \u201cYear of the Rooster,\u201d Bobby Moreno did some unusual research.", "CG": "theater", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Interview", "org": "Ensemble Studio Theater", "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "05snapshot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140116135026, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/theater/bobby-moreno-in-year-of-the-rooster.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/05/arts/05SNAPSHOT/05SNAPSHOT-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For his role as a bird in \u201cYear of the Rooster,\u201d Bobby Moreno did some unusual research.", "title": "Bobby Moreno in \u2018Year of the Rooster\u2019"}, "pdate": 20140101, "des": "Theater", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/erik_piepenburg/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/theater/index.html", "section": "Theater", "modified": "2014-01-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/theater/index.jsonp", "tag": "Year of the Rooster (Play)", "published": "2014-01-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "21D5B838-29CC-46D3-9006-879CAABC8F08"}, "articleid": 100000002626506, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Bobby Moreno in \u2018Year of the Rooster\u2019", "col": "Snapshot", "PST": "Interview"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf88a\"", "article_summary": "Starting Jan. 9, Mr. Moreno brings his rooster back to Ensemble Studio Theater, which is remounting its production of \u201cYear of the Rooster\u201d after a well-received run last fall.\nDavid Attenborough has this series called \u201cThe Life of Birds.\u201d Birds\u2019 eyes focus in a very funny way.\nA rooster with issues is the latest physically demanding stage role for Mr. Moreno, a lanky 30-year-old with a playful grin and mischievous brown eyes that reflect his Panamanian and Irish lineage.\n\u201cRoosters have only two goals in life,\u201d Mr. Moreno said.\nI thought about changing my name when I first moved up, to Bobby Monroe, which is an anagram of Moreno."}
