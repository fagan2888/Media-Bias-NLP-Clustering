So often, it feels like real loss \u2014 after spending a handful of seasons getting to know this person, they\u2019re gone, leaving you to experience the subsequent seasons alone, their absence hanging over it all. This year saw a lot of surprising and depressing character deaths. Some shows introduced themselves with a tragedy early on, helping to define what sort of world they wanted to tell a story about. Others made decisions as they approached the end of their stories \u2014 killing characters because it was time to clean house, or because it was time to make good on conflicts set up a long time ago. The year had its share of casualties, some sad and poignant, others jaw-dropping and bloodstained. Below are 10 of the most memorable ones.\n\n10. \u201cFamily Guy\u201d \u2013 Brian Griffin\n\nEven though Seth MacFarlane\u2019s career has remained on our radar through directorial debuts, a derided new sitcom and an Oscar-hosting gig, you don\u2019t really hear a ton about his breakout show these days even as it remains steadily popular. \u201cFamily Guy\u201d can be annoying, and is criticized for being offensive, but it also has its share of hilarious moments, many of which were due to Brian, Stewie and the interactions between the two. So when \u201cFamily Guy\u201d killed Brian by hitting him with a car in an episode that aired on November 24th, it was disappointing and confusing on multiple levels. If you were to take it at face value, the show\u2019s best character was just offed for no good reason aside from a publicity stunt (MacFarlane voiced Brian and still voices Peter, Stewie and a bunch of supporting characters, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going anywhere). Fox had teased the character death in the weeks leading up to it, and executive producer Steve Callaghan later described it as \u201ca fun way to shake things up.\u201d\n\nKilling a character on \u201cFamily Guy\u201d doesn\u2019t really serve any purpose narratively, and fans reacted negatively. A petition appeared on Change.org, garnering more than 100,000 signatures. As it turns out, things didn\u2019t stick \u2014 Brian returned for a Christmas episode. So, file this one under heartbreaking because it was sad and jarring to see Brian go, sure, but it might be more heartbreaking to see the show spinning its wheels and resorting to shock tactics and slapping fans in the face in order to make some headlines.\n\n9. \u201cTrue Blood\u201d \u2013 Terry Bellefleur\n\nIt can be hard to muster sympathy for any \u201cTrue Blood\u201d character these days. The show has wandered ridiculously far from its roots, losing sense of the community of Bon Temps both physically \u2014 as later seasons have been set less in the town \u2014 and conceptually, as the show\u2019s storyline has fragmented into a bunch of little stories to the point where you forget certain characters even know each other, let alone technically work together. Terry Bellefleur started out as a recurring supporting character, and even though he couldn\u2019t quite hold the weight of getting his own storylines in recent seasons, he was a steady source of charm. It was also worth actually having some likable human characters kept around, considering the ever-increasingly crowded supernatural docket of \u201cTrue Blood.\u201d\n\nFor all those reasons, it was sad to see Terry finally overcome by his PTSD and the knowledge of what he had done to the point where he asked an old Marine contact to assassinate him. After Arlene had a vampire friend glamor his past away, we got a fleeting glimpse at what a truly happy Terry would\u2019ve looked like, before he was sniped outside of Merlotte\u2019s. Terry will be missed \u2014 Todd Lowe\u2019s performance made the character work beyond the comic relief he initially provided, and was often a bittersweet reminder of what the show was like before it strayed too far from its promising premise. While in some ways Terry\u2019s death seemed abrupt and unnecessary, it may have served a larger purpose. Hopefully, if new showrunner Brian Buckner\u2019s comments at Comic-Con are to be believed, Terry\u2019s death is one step in the show\u2019s course correction for its final season: refocusing our attention on Bon Temps as a town and a community, and tightening the show\u2019s story back around these people and their relationships with one another.\n\n8. \u201cThe Bridge\u201d \u2013 Gus Ruiz\n\nFX unveiled two of the most promising new shows on TV this year: \u201cThe Americans\u201d and \u201cThe Bridge.\u201d The latter was populated by an array of strange and mysterious characters, from Stephen Linder, Thomas M. Wright\u2019s marble-mouthed coyote, to Demian Bichir\u2019s world-weary Mexican detective Marco Ruiz, to Diane Kruger\u2019s maybe-autistic detective Sonya Cross. These characters are dynamic both visually and thematically, distinct enough to carry an expansive and nuanced universe if \u201cThe Bridge\u201d moves beyond centering around a murder mystery in subsequent seasons. Gus, Marco\u2019s son, is not one of those characters. A loose sketch existing primarily to define Marco\u2019s familial issues and shortcomings as a father, Gus won\u2019t necessarily be missed, particularly when the show was already overcrowded with much more interesting and shadowy figures. What\u2019s striking and memorable about his death, then, is that it represents a moment late in the game \u2014 the third-to-last episode of the season \u2014 where \u201cThe Bridge\u201d announces just what kind of show it\u2019s going to be.\n\nNot that it had been gentle before, but the succession of the show\u2019s grisliest moments usually occurred to characters introduced almost for the sole purpose of later being dispatched an episode or two later in David Tate\u2019s ongoing killing spree. Agent Gedman\u2019s head shows up in a duffel bag, teenaged Gina bleeds out in a parking garage after a gunshot to the stomach, Childress\u2019 sniper bullet blows open Deputy Sheriff Stokes\u2019 face, and wealthy Mexican playboy Santi Jr.\u2019s throat gushes out onto the bathroom floor as his party continues outside. All helped establish the brutality of \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d but Gus\u2019s death was of the sort we\u2019ve been trained not to expect as viewers. Tate hides him in a tank that slowly fills with water, and we\u2019re treated to constant anxiety-building cuts between the water creeping up around Gus and the detectives\u2019 race to find him and deal with Tate simultaneously. You don\u2019t ever expect that Sonya won\u2019t get there at that last moment and find him, though \u2014 that\u2019s the sort of nail-biting finish the episode seems to build toward. Instead, she\u2019s too late, and we\u2019re reminded of Gus\u2019s slow, isolated death with a shot of his bloated, waterlogged body. From that moment on, it\u2019s clear that \u201cThe Bridge\u201d is a show that can have real consequences and real danger for its central characters. Gus\u2019s death was shocking because it was the first casualty of that prominence, and immediately let us know that life in \u201cThe Bridge\u201d was even more precarious than it had initially suggested.\n\n7. \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d \u2013 Clay Morrow and Tara Knowles Teller\n\n\u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d definitely didn\u2019t pull any punches in its penultimate season, featuring two brutal deaths for two characters who have been around since the show\u2019s start. Oddly, both deaths managed to feel inevitable and shocking at the same time. Jax killing Clay had been a long time coming. From the show\u2019s earliest episodes, the conflict between Jax and Clay was brewing, becoming more overt once Jax realized Clay tried to have Opie killed, a botched hit that inadvertently resulted in Donna\u2019s murder. They were openly threatening each other way back in Season 2, but while it was only a matter of time before we got to this point, it was still jarring to finally see it happen, with Jax viciously shooting Clay in the throat and then a few more times in the chest. And, because this is \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d and this is what \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d does, you get a good, long look at Clay\u2019s body lying there in a growing pool of blood, a gruesome goodbye to one of the show\u2019s defining presences.\n\nAs major a moment as Clay\u2019s death was, however, it\u2019s not one that engenders sympathy. Pretty much everyone wanted him gone at this point, and he deserved it for a whole host of reasons. After this episode, fans turned their concerns toward Tara, and it turned out those concerns were well founded. \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d went ahead and killed off two of its primary characters within the span of three episodes. Tara\u2019s death was naturally far more tragic than Clay\u2019s, as she merely associated with sinners rather than sinning herself. Jax gives Clay a somewhat pathetic facsimile of the outlaw\u2019s death he was always destined for; Gemma shoves Tara\u2019s face into a sink and plunges a carving fork into the back of her head. In the wake of Clay and Tara\u2019s deaths, lots of recappers are focusing on the Shakespearean influences of \u201cSons of Anarchy.\u201d Killing both Clay and Tara before the show\u2019s final season suggests that there\u2019s only more, not less, of that classic brand of tragedy to come.\n\n6. \u201cThe Americans\u201d \u2013 Gregory Thomas\n\nThe first season of \u201cThe Americans\u201d took a world you\u2019d readily assume to be played out \u2014 Cold War dramas \u2014 and imbued it with unexpected wrinkles and twists again and again. One of the most engaging of these was the introduction of Gregory, an African American spy recruited by Elizabeth during the Civil Rights Movement. Gregory\u2019s crew aids Directorate S operatives with different jobs, but he\u2019s also Elizabeth\u2019s lover, someone she truly cares for amidst the murky existence that is her partnership/arranged marriage with Philip and their regular need to conduct affairs for the purpose of their job. After Philip accidentally kills Chris Amador, the FBI \u2014 and, specifically, Stan Beeman \u2014 are out for blood, immediately assuming it was the KGB\u2019s doing. Through a series of events, Stan discovers the nature of Gregory and his crew, and Phillip and Elizabeth\u2019s superiors start the process of setting Gregory up with an escape route and a new life in Moscow. Gregory, however, decides he doesn\u2019t want to live in Moscow, and realizes that the FBI won\u2019t rest until they have someone to hold accountable for Amador\u2019s death, someone to enact their vengeance upon.\n\nIn one of the most crushing scenes of the season, Gregory serenely tells Elizabeth he\u2019s not going to Moscow, that he\u2019s lived for something, that\u2019s enough, and this is the end of the road. Though this is customary for \u201cThe Americans\u201d so far, it\u2019s a remarkably complex scene, with a multitude of things swirling together \u2014 the impressionistic gestures towards the professional and personal past between Elizabeth and Gregory, the rift growing between Elizabeth and Philip as they navigate their identities and their marriage, and the conflict between serving the abstraction of their homeland vs. their loyalty to those who have fought on the ground with them. Gregory gets his way, calmly walking outside, waiting for some cops to find him. Roberta Flack\u2019s \u201cTo Love Somebody\u201d plays over a montage of Elizabeth serving her children dinner, Philip eating a pizza alone in his motel room, Stan staring at a photo of Gregory bloody on the ground, and slow-motion visions of Gregory\u2019s last stand in a firefight with policemen. \u201cThe Americans\u201d may hint at the lineage of spy thrillers, but it isn\u2019t afraid to be meditative, and it gives Gregory\u2019s last moments a fittingly elegiac tone.\n\n5. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2013 Peter Russo\n\nSo many of the characters in \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d are ruthless \u2014 manipulative people playing against other manipulative people. As intoxicating as it is to spend time wading into everyone\u2019s machinations with Kevin Spacey\u2019s seductively evil coo of a Southern drawl as your guide, this quality could make \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a little cold at times. That\u2019s where Peter Russo came in. Peter had his own host of problems \u2014 the prostitutes, the alcohol and drug abuse, his sniveling once Spacey\u2019s Frank Underwood had him under his thumb. Corey Stoll played Russo perfectly, elevating a failed redemption arc to one of the most human of storylines in a show that often revels in calculations (even when it\u2019s trying to contrast such intellectual games against the more amorphous qualities of human nature with characters like Claire). It was easy to root for Peter for much of the way, envisioning a several-season arc where he ultimately amasses enough experience to challenge his former master.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remembering the characters we lost this year, from \"Breaking Bad\" to \"Family Guy\"", "title": "The 10 most heartbreaking TV deaths of 2013", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Remembering the characters we lost this year, from \"Breaking Bad\" to \"Family Guy\"", "title": "The 10 most heartbreaking TV deaths of 2013", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/27/the_10_most_heartbreaking_tv_deaths_of_2013/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/tv_deaths.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Remembering the characters we lost this year, from \"Breaking Bad\" to \"Family Guy\"", "title": "The 10 most heartbreaking TV deaths of 2013", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/tv_deaths.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ryan Leas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Best of 2013, Breaking Bad, heartbreaking deaths, TV, tv deaths", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1516\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Best of 2013, Breaking Bad, heartbreaking deaths, TV, tv deaths, Entertainment NewsKilling characters off of a TV show, when done right, can do so much more than simply write someone out of the script and out of the opening credits.\nThis year saw a lot of surprising and depressing character deaths.\nIn one of the most crushing scenes of the season, Gregory serenely tells Elizabeth he\u2019s not going to Moscow, that he\u2019s lived for something, that\u2019s enough, and this is the end of the road.\nOddly, both deaths managed to feel inevitable and shocking at the same time.\n\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2013 Peter RussoSo many of the characters in \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d are ruthless \u2014 manipulative people playing against other manipulative people."}
