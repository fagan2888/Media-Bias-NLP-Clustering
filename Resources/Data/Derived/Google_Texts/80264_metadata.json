Contact her at ckchumley@aol.com or on Twitter, @ckchumley .\n\nThe sad, very sad, sudden death of the Supreme Court\u2019s leading defender of the Constitution, Justice Antonin Scalia, has left a gaping hole that President Barack Obama\u2019s quickly vowed to fill \u2013 and that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has just as quickly vowed to protect.\n\nBut note to conservatives: Hold the cheer. McConnell\u2019s political promises mean little more than one thing \u2013 we\u2019re doomed.\n\nObama said, within hours of learning of Scalia\u2019s death: \u201cI plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time. There will be plenty of time for me to do so and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote.\u201d\n\nMcConnell responded: \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d\n\nBut the smart, savvy political conservative ought to conclude: Obama\u2019s going to nominate a far-lefty, McConnell\u2019s going to put on a heck of a show of a fight \u2013 key word, show \u2013 and in the end, the White House will prevail. How do we know these truths to be self-evident?\n\nLook at McConnell\u2019s past.\n\nIn August 2013, then-Senate Minority Leader McConnell backed off a challenge to implement Obamacare, despite the fact a defunding effort from the likes of Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee was gathering steam on Capitol Hill. The Senate Conservative Fund released a statement that read, in part: \u201cMitch McConnell is telling people he opposes Obamacare while he refuses to oppose its funding.\u201d\n\nIn September 2013, Breitbart News, citing a source, reported McConnell and fellow Sen. John Cornyn were \u201cwhipping senators to shut down debate\u201d on a House measure to defund Obamacare, \u201cunbelievably \u2026 leading the fight to fully fund\u201d the health reform.\n\nIn February 2015, McConnell announced support for a so-called \u201cclean\u201d Department of Homeland Security bill that capitulated to Democratic demands while stripping Republicans of their means of fighting Obama\u2019s amnesty plans, leading one unhappy Republican senator to wryly comment: What \u201ca total victory for the Obama position.\u201d\n\nIn July 2015, McConnell sparked Senate and American outrage by allowing a vote on a highway bill that fully funded the highly contested Export-Import Bank, while blocking amendments to defund Planned Parenthood, at a time when the health clinic was under fire for videos that appeared to tie it to a gruesome baby body parts-selling scheme.\n\nAnother amendment he blocked at the same time? One called \u201cKate\u2019s Law,\u201d in memory of Kate Steinle, the woman who was fatally shot by an illegal immigrant with a prior felony record while she walked in broad daylight in San Francisco. The law would have imposed a five-year prison sentence on any illegal who was convicted of a violent crime after already being deported and was widely seen as a common sense measure. Not to McConnell, apparently, who used a technique called \u201cfilling the tree\u201d perfected by former Majority Leader Harry Reid to block the amendments from reaching the floor for vote.\n\n\u201cThis strategy involves filling time allotted to amendments with insignificant procedural measures,\u201d RestoreAmericanGlory.com reported. \u201cIt may not be particularly democratic, but it works.\u201d\n\nAnd who can forget McConnell\u2019s absolute and ongoing contempt for the tea party?\n\nIn March 2014, he was quoted as bragging how Republicans were \u201cgoing to crush them everywhere\u201d in upcoming elections. In December 2015, he cautioned voters against voting for primary candidates who couldn\u2019t win in the general election, naming several tea party politicos who failed in their own recent bids.\n\nRoom doesn\u2019t permit to run down all the budget deals and pacts McConnell\u2019s made through the years that bended to Democratic will but tossed Republicans beneath the bus.\n\nEstablishment at all costs \u2013 concession by any means. That\u2019s McConnell\u2019s driving political mantra. And he\u2019s the one in charge of the Senate, which will soon be tasked to provide, in line with Article Two, Section Two of the Constitution, \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to Obama on Scalia\u2019s replacement?\n\nGod help us. Without, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, or someone else talked about as Scalia\u2019s replacement of similarly leftist slant, will be confirmed to the court within the month.\n\nCheryl Chumley, a writer for WND.com and former news writer for The Washington Times, is also the author of the 2016 release, \u201cThe Devil in D.C.: Winning Back the Country From the Beast in Washington, available now on Amazon, and of \u201cPolice State USA: How Orwell\u2019s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality.\u201d She may be reached at ckchumley@aol.com or through her blog, cherylchumley.blogspot.com, or at Twitter @ckchumley.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
