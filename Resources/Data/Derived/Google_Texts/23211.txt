WASHINGTON– GOP front-runner Donald Trump says Sen. Ted Cruz is responsible for Obamacare.

Trump shot back at Cruz’s recent claims that Trump supports the Affordable Care Act, and proposes a single payer system. Trump has dismissed the claims, calling to repeal and replace the legislation. Although he favored a single payer system in the past, he has since changed his position.

He went further at a campaign event Wednesday in Little Rock, Arkansas, claiming Cruz is to blame for the Supreme Court upholding the law’s key provisions because he put Justice John Roberts on the bench. The conservative justice sided with the president in the 6-3 decision in June.

“If it weren’t for Ted Cruz – he’s the one that got Justice Roberts onto the United States Supreme Court. He pushed him. He approved him,” Trump said. “It would have been dead if we had a different justice on the United States Supreme Court – put there by him.”

Although Cruz was a vocal supporter of Roberts at the time, Cruz had no hand in the Senate’s approval of Roberts to the court. Roberts was appointed in 2005, seven years before Cruz would be elected to the Senate. Cruz has since denounced Roberts and called his support for the justice a mistake.

“Trump’s claim is ridiculous, especially considering that he has advocated and supported a single-payer health care system along with many other social liberal policies,” Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told the AP.
