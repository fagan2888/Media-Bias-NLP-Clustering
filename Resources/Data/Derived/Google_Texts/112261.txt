Eating meat is like supporting the Nazis, former Smiths frontman Morrissey said on Thursday, arguing that the killing of animals in slaughterhouses is similar to the killing of Jews in gas chambers.

“If you believe in the abattoir then you would support Auschwitz … There is no difference,” the England-born punk rocker and self-described “animal protectionist” said in a web interview, the Times of Israel reported.

He even said he has no interest in getting to know anyone who eats meat.

“I see no difference between eating animals and pedophilia. They are both rape, violence, murder,” he said. “If I’m introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away. Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you: ‘Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life.’ Well, I doubt if you’d want to exchange phone numbers.”

Morrissey led the highly successful punk rock band The Smiths until they broke up in 1987. The band released “Meat is Murder” in 1985, which became its sole No. 1 album in the UK charts during the band’s lifetime. Morrissey has made the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart on 10 occasions as a solo artist since The Smiths split.
