Hillary commented \u201cat length\u201d to President Clinton, revealing she \u201cthinks managed competition\u201d is \u201ca crock; single-payer necessary; maybe add to Medicare,\u201d in the clipped wording of Blair\u2019s memo.\n\nAs Goodman noted, that\u2019s \u201cat odds with public statements by the former first lady that she never supported the single-payer option.\u201d In a New York Times interview during her 2008 presidential campaign, the ex-Obama administration secretary of state claimed: \u201cI never seriously considered a single payer system.\u201d\n\nThis might be Hillary\u2019s version of \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d\n\nLike Hillary, Obama prefers single payer. Speaking to an AFL-CIO conference a decade ago, Obama declared: \u201cI happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program \u2026 that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see, but as all of you know we may not get there immediately.\u201d\n\nWhen he ran nationally, knowing Americans opposed socialized medicine, Obama moved away from that. But as president he unsuccessfully pushed a \u201cpublic option\u201d \u2014 direct government coverage competing with private plans \u2014 which in Obama\u2019s first year in office was called \u201cthe best way to reach single payer\u201d by former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, because it \u201cdemonstrate(s) the strength of its power.\u201d\n\nOn the day the ObamaCare exchanges began, \u201cSicko\u201d filmmaker and admirer of Cuba\u2019s collectivist health system Michael Moore declared in The New York Times that \u201cObamaCare is awful,\u201d but was signed into law by a president \u201cwho knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go.\u201d\n\nWith ObamaCare in force, repeal can be ridiculed as going \u201cback to the old days when insurance companies could just jerk you around,\u201d as Obama said during the 2012 campaign. This leaves a false choice between the new ObamaCare status quo or the end of private health insurance and competition.\n\nMany ObamaCare supporters may indeed have known it would be the catastrophe it is, planning to \u201cfix\u201d what they wrecked by going totally socialist with a Canada/Britain/France-style single-payer system, where you wait forever for major treatment Americans are used to receiving promptly.\n\nThe evidence suggests Hillary was among them. A vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 may well be a vote for single payer to replace ObamaCare\u2019s failures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Big Government: A 20-year-old memo says Hillary Clinton backed a single-payer socialist health system, believing ObamaCare-like mega-regulation to be \"a crock.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Big Government: A 20-year-old memo says Hillary Clinton backed a single-payer socialist health system, believing ObamaCare-like mega-regulation to be \u201ca crock.\u201d As president, she\u2019\u2026", "title": "Memo Says Hillary Supports Single Payer Health System", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/obamacare/hillary-clinton-could-enact-single-payer-as-president/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-02-10 16:08:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-10T16:08:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2e6\"", "article_summary": "A vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 may well be a vote for single payer to replace ObamaCare\u2019s failures.\nBig Government: A 20-year-old memo says Hillary Clinton backed a single-payer socialist health system, believing ObamaCare-like mega-regulation to be \u201ca crock.\u201d As president, she\u2019d double down on government control.\nHillary commented \u201cat length\u201d to President Clinton, revealing she \u201cthinks managed competition\u201d is \u201ca crock; single-payer necessary; maybe add to Medicare,\u201d in the clipped wording of Blair\u2019s memo.\nThis leaves a false choice between the new ObamaCare status quo or the end of private health insurance and competition.\nThe first lady had just launched her secretive health care task force pushing a \u201cmanaged competition\u201d approach to reform."}
