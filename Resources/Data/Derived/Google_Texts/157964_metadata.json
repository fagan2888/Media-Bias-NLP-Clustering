Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) that would extend benefits for three months the day the Senate reconvenes, Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cBy temporarily extending emergency unemployment insurance for three months, this bipartisan bill will provide benefits for over 2 million Americans when they need it most, and we urge every member of Congress to support this vitally important bill,\u201d Sperling said.\n\nSperling argued extending jobless benefits would create jobs and generate economic growth, and he refuted the idea that the people who are losing their benefits are at fault for their unemployment.\n\n\u201cWe as Americans can choose to have each other\u2019s backs when we face serious spells of long-term unemployment,\u201d Sperling said. \u201cIn more than 50 years, we have never cut off emergency unemployment insurance when the rate of long-term unemployment was even above 50 percent of its current level, even though none of those recessions were nearly as deep as the one we are now recovering from.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 28, jobless benefits for 1.3 million Americans expired. Despite calls for a fix from many on the left before Congress left town, a fix was not included in a bipartisan budget deal reached in December, despite unemployment often being included in comprehensive bills in the past.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The director of the National Economic Council supports a vote to restore unemployment benefits.", "title": "Sperling's Hill resolution: Reid plan", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/unemployment-benefits-white-house-101668.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/07/20131007_gene_sperling_lamkey_politico_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Gene Sperling (41),Unemployment Benefits (17)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The director of the National Economic Council supports a vote to restore unemployment benefits.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Politico | Rod Lamkey Jr. for POLITICO Sperling's Hill resolution: Reid planThe White House on Wednesday urged Congress to pass a fix for Americans whose unemployment benefits ran out this week, supporting a plan to vote on a short-term bill the day Congress returns.\n\u201cWe as Americans can choose to have each other\u2019s backs when we face serious spells of long-term unemployment,\u201d Sperling said.\n'There would be no better New Year\u2019s resolution,' Gene Sperling says.\nHe said the president \u201cstrongly supports\u201d a commitment from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to bring for a vote a bill from Sens.\nDean Heller (R-Nev.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) that would extend benefits for three months the day the Senate reconvenes, Jan. 6."}
