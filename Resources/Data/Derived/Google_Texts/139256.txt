Scary moments for dozens of people at the Cedar Grove area Flea Market Sunday.

Strong winds and rain tore down a power line on East 15th Street around 1:30 Sunday afternoon.

Bay County Sheriff's Deputies shut down the busy intersection for about an hour as Gulf Power crews worked to clear the area.

People working and shopping at the 15th Street Flea Market say everything happened so quickly, they're just glad no one was hurt.

"I heard a snap and a pop and a customer coming in said there was a twister right above us," said Gary Davis, flea market Seller.

Kathy Vanderhoven another seller said, "I almost thought it was a tornado, I just wasn't sure. I've never seen anything like it."

The storm damaged a power line, a sign and broke a rail road crossing arm.
