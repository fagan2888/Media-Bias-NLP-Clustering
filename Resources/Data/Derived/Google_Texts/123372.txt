MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry equated the term “Obamacare” with the N-word on Sunday, saying it was “conceived by a group of wealthy white men who needed to… render [a black man] inferior and unequal and diminish his accomplishments.”

Buoyed by righteous indignation, Harris-Perry advances the white superiority narrative that is standard fare on the left in a full-on effort to run interference for President Obama.

Or, in other words, the failures associated with Obama’s signature healthcare law cannot be because of incompetence because he is a black man, so it must be whitey’s fault!

Texas defies feds; we shut the border down ourselves, said Lt. gov.

“I want to talk today about a controversial word,” Harris-Perry began. “It’s a word that has been with us for years. And like it or not, it’s indelibly printed in the pages of American history.”

“A word that was originally intended as a derogatory term, meant to shame and divide and demean,” she continued. The word was conceived of by a group of wealthy white men who needed a way to put themselves above and apart from a black man, to render him inferior and unequal and diminish his accomplishments.”

The deep-seated hate for the white man is hard to miss here.

In the end, Harris-Perry said the “Affordable Care Act will loom large in the president’s legacy,” which is what all this is really about — ensuring the first black president in American history is remembered as one of the countries greatest feats.

Even if he does destroy healthcare.
