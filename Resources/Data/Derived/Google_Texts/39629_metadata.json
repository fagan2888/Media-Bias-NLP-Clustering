But in Alaska, the high cost of premiums on the individual market has some residents thinking about dropping their coverage.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nGunnar Ebbesson is used to paying a lot for health insurance. But the small business owner from Fairbanks got a shock recently when his quote came in for next year\u2019s coverage. The premium for his family of five came to more than $40,000 a year. That\u2019s for a bare bones plan with a $10,500 deductible.\n\n\u201cI mean who really can afford this? I can pay it, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u201d he says.\n\nEbbesson makes a good living. He doesn\u2019t qualify for a subsidy to help pay for insurance because his family income is over $142,000 per year. But he isn\u2019t rich. Paying for insurance that amounts to more than his home mortgage has forced him to make sacrifices.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to put money in retirement, savings for my kid for college \u2014 my 10-year-old \u2014 believe me I could find lots of stuff to do for my future with $40,000,\u201d he says.\n\nEbbesson supports the Affordable Care Act. He calls the Alaska rates a \u201cwrinkle\u201d in the law that need fixing.\n\nAlaska has the most expensive individual health insurance in the country, according to a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average 2016 premium for a 40-year-old in Anchorage is $719, more than double the national average. Most Alaskans who buy individual plans qualify for a generous subsidy that rises with premium increases. But about 5,000 Alaskans are paying full sticker price.\n\nEric Earling is a spokesperson for Premera Alaska, one of only two companies left who offer individual health insurance in the state.\n\n\u201cWe want people to have access to affordable coverage and that\u2019s not happening right now in the marketplace in Alaska,\u201d he says.\n\nEarling says even at the high premium rates, the company is losing millions of dollars on the individual market in Alaska. He says there aren\u2019t enough customers to absorb the high cost of medical care for some Premera members.\n\nEarling says in the first six months of this year, 37 customers filed over $11 million in claims.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is they deserve access to coverage and we\u2019re glad they have it. The trick is creating a sustainable environment where those costs can be absorbed in a way that doesn\u2019t adversely impact all consumers.\u201d\n\nPremera is drafting legislation to use an existing high risk pool to insulate the individual market from those outsized claims. The largest medical claims would be redirected into the pool and paid for with a tax on all health plans in the state. The company is working with Moda Health, the other insurer on the individual market in Alaska, to develop the legislation.\n\nThe state\u2019s Division of Insurance is helping with some of the details, but director Lori Wing-Heier says she won\u2019t take a position on the idea until she can review the bill.\n\n\u201cWe want to see the individual rates stabilized so that people can afford them, there\u2019s no doubt,\u201d she says.\n\nWing-Heier is more focused on another issue driving up premium rates, the high cost of health care. The price for some specialty care in Alaska is double or triple the cost for the same service in Seattle. Wing-Heier says she wants to work with doctors and hospitals to come to some type of agreement that would ensure more reasonable rates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for everybody to make a living in the medical field, but we have to get the rates to at some point (where) people can afford them,\u201d she says.\n\nVictoria Cronquist doesn\u2019t care what the solution is, as long as it helps her find more affordable insurance. This year, the Anchorage resident is paying $1,600 dollars a month for a high-deductible plan for herself, her husband and two kids. The rate is going up to $2,600 a month next year. Her employer, a dental office, gives her some money each month to defray the cost, but that amount isn\u2019t rising with the premium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just getting too expensive, I\u2019m up against the wall. I can\u2019t do it all,\u201d she says.\n\nCronquist is considering dropping health insurance. Her family has been uninsured in the past. And she paid the price for that decision when her daughter ended up in the ICU. Still, she says going without insurance may be the best option:\n\n\u201cTo be quite frank, to have a $2,600 monthly premium payment in all this is stressful to me. And that increases my odds of getting ill,\u201d she says with a laugh.\n\nThe high rates will push more Alaskans into a category that allows them to avoid paying a penalty for not having insurance. The law includes an \u201cunaffordability\u201d exemption from the individual mandate if the lowest cost insurance amounts to more than eight percent of your income.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership between APRN, NPR and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "The Affordable Care Act was supposed to make health insurance accessible to all Americans.
