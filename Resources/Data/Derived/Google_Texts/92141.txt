District of Columbia officials have figured out the formula to get young people signed up for health care. Pair Obamacare with Jordans.

Recruiters are showing up to places where young residents “party by night and shop by day,” which in D.C. means lining up at the Footlocker for the release of the Jordan “Taxi” sneakers and a popular hang out restaurant and touting Obamacare.

Officials on Saturday visited two Footlocker stores where Nike’s exclusive Air Jordan 12 “Taxi” sneakers were going on sale. And they are scheduled to visit two Denny’s restaurants from 2 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. “My motto is ‘Get them health care while you get them Jordans,” DC Health Links representative Vanessa Brooks told Fox News outside a Footlocker in the city’s downtown. “Get some health care to go along with them taxis, OK?” Brooks told those at the store. “You got to have it. And you need it.”

The Obama administration has been tenacious in building support around the Affordable Care Act and are working hard to ensure that young people get covered.

And if sneakers are the way to go…so be it. Hey, whatever it takes to get all Americans covered, right?
