Claims and statements cascade past at a rate of about 25 per hour, meaning it\u2019s always hog heaven for fact-checkers.\n\nBut first, we\u2019ve tossed together Friday\u2019s PolitiFact Oregon Roundup, which doesn\u2019t want for much, either. Let\u2019s get going.\n\n1. Michael Reagan loses one for the geyser\n\nReagan, older son of President Ronald Reagan, recently doled out some advice to the current president on how to one-up the Russians. The Gipper, Reagan said, \u201c\u2026did it without firing a shot\u2026but he had a super weapon \u2013 oil.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact National checked Reagan\u2019s follow-up claim that his father eroded the former Soviet Union\u2019s cash flow by persuading the Saudis to flood the market with cheap oil. \u201cThere might be an element of truth in the claim,\u201d the story found, \u201cbut the public record strongly points the other way. We rate the statement Mostly False.\u201d\n\n2. If you like your bureaucrat, well, you can\u2019t keep your bureaucrat\n\nGeorgia Congressman Paul Broun, a Republican, recently said his alternative to Obamacare is the only one that removes \u201cfederal bureaucrats\u201d from the medical decision-making arena.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia looked into the claim and said this: \u201cBroun\u2019s bill would make Obamacare disappear. But so would other GOP proposals. And Broun\u2019s paln does not make the bureaucracy go away.\u201d Broun limped off with a Mostly False.\n\n3. Climate change heats up in Rhode Island\n\nU.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, according to PolitiFact Rhode Island, has made more than 60 Senate speeches on climate change, warning of its potential effects.\n\nOur East Coast affiliate has been tracking Whitehouse\u2019s claims and spent time compiling most of its recent findings. Click the link above to check their great work.\n\n4. Swatting medical marijuana in the Sunshine State\n\n\n\nIn Florida, outspoken attorney John Morgan used a debate over the medicinal use of marijuana to say that a woman in the audience, Cathy Jordan, was arrested by a \u201cSWAT team of hooligans\u201d last year.\n\nJordan smokes the drug to combat the effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. PolitiFact Florida\u2019s check showed that Jordan was arrested at her home, but that the \u201cpolice reaction was not nearly as drastic as Morgan described. We rate the statement Mostly False.\u201d\n\n5. Why Alex Sink got sunk\n\nA hotly-contested race for Congress in Florida ended with Republican David Jolly besting his Democratic opponent, Alex Sink. Almost as soon as the results were in, Democrats sent out a funding raising letter, claiming Sink \u201cgot outspent in a Republican district.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact Florida found agreement among nonpartisan analysts that the district is more accurately labeled \u201ctoss-up\u201d than \u201cRepublican\u201d in its partisan leanings. \u201cOn balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it, five quick checks of claims from around the PolitiFact world. Now get ready to grab a second cup of coffee and park yourself for a little television viewing Sunday. A real cascade of checkable claims, after all, is about to get underway.\n\n-- Dana Tims\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "politifact oregon, politifact oregon roundup, politifact oregon truth-o-meter, news", "title": "Ronald Reagan buries Russia in oil, SWAT teams battle Florida's medical pot: PolitiFact Oregon Roundup", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "In today's PolitiFact Oregon Roundup, Michael Reagan talks about his father's oil policies and a Florida attorney says it took a SWAT team to arrest a medical marijuana advocate in her home.
