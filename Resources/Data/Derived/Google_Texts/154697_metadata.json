SMN protein levels were observed to be 120% and 160% above baseline in the two highest doses nine to 14 months after first dosing. Utilizing the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded point scale to measure changes in muscle function for patients with SMA, the treated children in the 3 mg, 6 mg, and 9 mg cohorts achieved mean increases in HFMSE scores of 1.5 points, 2.3 points, and 3.7 points, respectively, nine months following their first dose of ISIS-SMN Rx. Isis plans to give children rolling over into an extension study a 12 mg dose every six months.\n\nNow what: Isis is truly one of a handful of remarkable biotech companies in that it's set up with a number of development partners and also has a number of in-house drugs in its pipeline. ISIS-SMN Rx is a drug being co-developed with Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB), with Biogen holding the option to license the compound until completion of the first successful phase 2/3 study or the completion of two phase 2/3 studies. There are few therapies on the market to treat SMA, so ISIS-SMN Rx is providing genuine hope for improvement to current sufferers. Safety doesn't appear to be an issue at the moment, and its impressive half-life -- Isis mentions muscle function scores were improved up to 14 months after the first dose -- certainly gives the impression that it could make for a fantastic long-term maintenance therapy. Because of its extensive pipeline, I'd postulate that Isis could have additional upside even following today's large move higher.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "12:55", "date": "2014-02-21T17:55:00Z", "description": "Isis shares soar after the company releases encouraging clinical results for ISIS-SMN Rx to treat children with spinal muscular atrophy.
