Chris Schutt has been appointed managing principal of the Virginia office of Digital Benefit Advisors, a division of employee benefits-only agency Digital Insurance.

Shutt is responsible for leading a 45-member team that operates out of Richmond, Charlottesville and Roanoke. He will focus on delivering strategic products and services to clients in the mid-Atlantic region.

The division is growing with 24 offices currently across the nation.

“Chris’ wealth of knowledge, noteworthy industry experience and proven leadership make him an excellent addition to our expanding agency network,” said Mike Sullivan, Digital’s executive vice president and chief marketing officer. “He will be instrumental in helping us continue to enroll Virginia employers in Digital Benefits Marketplace, our private insurance exchange solution.”

Digital Benefits Marketplace launched in Virginia last October.

Digital Benefit Advisors has acquired Strategic Employee Benefits Services (SEBS) of Virginia, Richmond’s Dominion Benefits and Reston’s CCA since 2011.

Schutt’s 21-year career includes executive positions in employee benefits consulting and risk management. Prior to joining Digital, he was managing director of the Virginia office of Marsh & McLennan, and previously led business development for the Mid-Atlantic region of Marsh. He also managed the Norfolk operation of Johnson & Higgins, which was then Marsh & McLennan, and was responsible for the risk management and health care consulting operations.
