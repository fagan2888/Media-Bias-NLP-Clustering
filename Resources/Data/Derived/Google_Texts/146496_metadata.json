Other companies that received federal approval to sell plans include:\n\n\u2014Health Alliance, based in downstate Urbana.\n\n\u2014Celtic Insurance, which is part of St. Louis-based Centene Corp.\n\n\u2014Coventry Health, part of Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna.\n\n\u2014Harken Health, of which UnitedHealth Group is an investor.\n\n\u2014Humana, based in Louisville, Ky.\n\nAssurant Health, whose parent company is leaving the health insurance business, is not coming back after selling plans last year.\n\nEach company is approved to sell health plans to consumers, but only Health Alliance, Blue Cross and Land of Lincoln are selling to small businesses. Land of Lincoln, though, is drastically limiting enrollment this year to survive. Small businesses in particular will be impacted.\n\nIt's still unknown how many plans and what type federal officials approved to be sold to Illinois consumers and businesses. Eight companies offered more than 400 plans on the Obamacare exchange for the enrollment period that ended in February.\n\n\n\nBorn out of the Affordable Care Act, the exchanges launched nationwide in 2013 to stir competition in the health insurance industry and give consumers and small businesses a place to shop online for health plans.\n\nIllinois routes people through its exchange, Get Covered Illinois, to HealthCare.gov, where those who fall below certain income levels can use federal subsidies to buy health plans. Illinois is among 37 states that send people to the federal exchange to buy plans. Other states have created their own online marketplaces.\n\n\n\nUP 60 PERCENT\n\nNearly 350,000 Illinois consumers enrolled in an Obamacare plan for the enrollment period that ended in February, climbing about 60 percent from the first year of the exchange.\n\n\n\nGet Covered Illinois has undergone dramatic changes in recent months. Federal grant dollars that helped states grow and promote the exchanges is running out. Get Covered laid off the bulk of its staff and moved from the governor's office into the Illinois Department of Insurance in August. Karin Zosel, who led the exchange, left her role after just five months on the job.\n\n\n\nHeading into the new enrollment period, Get Covered aims to rely heavily on brokers, health care providers and nonprofits to help find new enrollees and maintain current ones.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160526_13:44:50", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "title": "Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare return to Illinois Obamacare exchange", "taxo_Industries": "Health Insurance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20151020/NEWS03/151029989/AR/0/Blue-Cross-Blue-Shield-of-Illinois-UnitedHealthcare-return-to-Illinois-Obamacare-exchange.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Familiar faces are returning to sell plans on the health insurance marketplace, including Aetna, which is back after taking last year off.", "title": "Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare return to Illinois Obamacare exchange", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20151020/NEWS03/151029989/blue-cross-unitedhealthcare-return-to-illinois-obamacare-exchange", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20151020/NEWS03/151029989/AR/0/Blue-Cross-Blue-Shield-of-Illinois-UnitedHealthcare-return-to-Illinois-Obamacare-exchange.jpg", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Familiar faces are returning to sell plans on the health insurance marketplace, including Aetna, which is back after taking last year off.", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/151029989", "published_at": "2015-10-20", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "UnitedHealthcare of Illinois Inc.", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20151020/NEWS03/151029989/AR/0/Blue-Cross-Blue-Shield-of-Illinois-UnitedHealthcare-return-to-Illinois-Obamacare-exchange.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare return to Illinois Obamacare exchange"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "article_summary": "Aetna is returning to sell plans on the Illinois health insurance exchange after taking a year off.\nIllinois routes people through its exchange, Get Covered Illinois, to HealthCare.gov, where those who fall below certain income levels can use federal subsidies to buy health plans.\nEach company is approved to sell health plans to consumers, but only Health Alliance, Blue Cross and Land of Lincoln are selling to small businesses.\nMostly familiar faces are returning to the exchange for enrollment that begins Nov. 1, according to the Illinois Department of Insurance.\nIllinois is among 37 states that send people to the federal exchange to buy plans."}
