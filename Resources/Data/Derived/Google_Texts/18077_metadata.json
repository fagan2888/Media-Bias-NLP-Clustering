Yet that is exactly what a large and authoritative study published last week has revealed.\n\nThe findings provide stark evidence that the need to reduce smoking is more important than ever. Some 42 million American adults, 15 percent of women and 21 percent of men, still smoke. On average, they die more than a decade before nonsmokers. Poor people and those with less formal education are most likely to smoke.\n\nFor the past 50 years, the evidence about tobacco\u2019s dangers has been mounting. The landmark surgeon general\u2019s report in 1964 first declared that smoking caused lung and laryngeal cancer and chronic bronchitis. A succession of later reports by the surgeon general kept adding to the list of smoking-related diseases.\n\nThe latest surgeon general\u2019s report in 2014 estimated that there are 480,000 deaths each year in the United States from 21 diseases caused by smoking, including 12 types of cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and atherosclerosis.\n\nNow comes evidence that the toll is actually much worse than that. A study by researchers at the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and four universities \u2014 published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday \u2014 adds several more diseases and 60,000 deaths a year to the total. The added diseases include kidney failure, infections, a rare intestinal disease caused by inadequate blood flow, and heart and lung ailments not previously attributed to tobacco. The study also found small increases in the risks of breast and prostate cancer among smokers, although more research will be required to establish their significance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne obvious imperative is for governments to ramp up their efforts to help smokers quit, including with programs like Medicaid. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that only seven states cover all approved cessation medications and in-person counseling, and that all states impose some barriers to getting these treatments. That is a disservice to smokers who want to quit or could be persuaded to quit.\n\nFor people who earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act requires most health insurance plans to cover preventive services, including tobacco cessation programs. That could help millions of Americans, but it is not clear how well these services are working so far.\n\nThe new study followed more than 900,000 men and women, 55 years of age or older, for 10 years.\n\nThe 60,000 additional deaths a year from smoking that the researchers found could bring the total number of deaths caused by smoking each year in the United States to 540,000. And the researchers suspect that may be an underestimate because they didn\u2019t count deaths from diseases like breast and prostate cancer where the evidence is compelling but not quite strong enough to be certain that smoking was the cause.\n\nEither way, this huge number of deaths provides ample reason to use every possible tool to help smokers quit.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150214143011, "twitter": {"description": "A new study provides stark evidence that the need to help people quit is more important than ever.", "title": "The Smoking Toll Gets Much Worse", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/opinion/sunday/the-smoking-toll-gets-much-worse.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003510716"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/opinion/sunday/the-smoking-toll-gets-much-worse.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003510716", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/opinion/sunday/the-smoking-toll-gets-much-worse.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "The Smoking Toll Gets Much Worse", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 14, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "National Cancer Institute", "keywords": "Smoking and Tobacco,New England Journal of Medicine,Editorials,Research,Medicine and Health,Cancer,American Cancer Society,National Cancer Institute", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Research,Cancer", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A new study provides stark evidence that the need to help people quit is more important than ever.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A new study provides stark evidence that the need to help people quit is more important than ever.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 14, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-02-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "National Cancer Institute", "published": "2015-02-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "15sun2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150227112747, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/opinion/sunday/the-smoking-toll-gets-much-worse.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A new study provides stark evidence that the need to help people quit is more important than ever.", "title": "The Smoking Toll Gets Much Worse"}, "pdate": 20150214, "des": "Cancer", "articleid": 100000003510716, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Smoking Toll Gets Much Worse", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ea3\"", "article_summary": "The 60,000 additional deaths a year from smoking that the researchers found could bring the total number of deaths caused by smoking each year in the United States to 540,000.\nThe landmark surgeon general\u2019s report in 1964 first declared that smoking caused lung and laryngeal cancer and chronic bronchitis.\nThe findings provide stark evidence that the need to reduce smoking is more important than ever.\nNow comes evidence that the toll is actually much worse than that.\nIt seems impossible to believe that smoking is even more harmful to health than we had thought."}
