In an interview with USA TODAY Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner affirmed that Obama’s championed but disastrous Affordable Care Act “has to go.”

Moreover, the Ohio Republican confirmed that the next Congress will “spend some time” in its effort to repeal the law, which has spawned broken websites, unkept promises, health care losses and multiple lawsuits.

October 1 marks the first anniversary of the opening and subsequent collapse of the Obamacare exchanges on HealthCare.gov.

In addition to Obamacare, Boehner also addressed the fast approaching 2016 presidential race, which he said will center on the issue of “competence.” Likely, he believes Americans will be looking to elect an individual who is prepared for the position.

This comment comes just over a month after Boehner alleged that President Obama wasn’t “prepared for the job” during a radio interview.

According to Boehner, Jeb Bush has “a real shot” among the potential Republicans candidates for president in 2016. The Speaker of the House stressed Bush’s “record of serious, big reforms” during his post as Florida governor as evidence of his preparedness for the Oval Office.

And, turning attention to his own job, Boehner rejected the idea that the next Congress would be his final one.

“I’m going to stay all in,” he declared.
