Roberts \u2026 basically said, you need to look at what Congress intended. Congress intended to help fix the insurance market, not destroy the insurance market.\u201d\n\nThe decision hinged on four words in the ACA statute: \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d The plaintiffs contended that these words meant subsidies should only be available to those on state-run exchanges, not federal. But in the decision, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, \u201cWe doubt that is what Congress meant to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is definitive,\u201d said Kathleen Sebelius, the former secretary of health and human services, at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Friday. Sebelius was referring to Thursday\u2019s 6-3 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in King v. Burwell. The justices ruled that the health-insurance subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act should be available to people whether the states they live in use the federal health-insurance exchange or run their own exchanges.\n\nBill Frist, the former Republican Senate majority leader, agreed, saying Roberts \u201ccaptured it better than the legislation and the law actually did initially.\u201d\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that the highly contentious, partisan battle over the law is over. It just means it\u2019s not a legal battle anymore. \u201cThe courts are no longer going to be the battlefield,\u201d Frist said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be in the political arena.\u201d\n\nThere was some debate over what the current Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, should do now, less-than-pleased with the decision as he is.\n\n\u201cI think Mitch is still going to be under a lot of pressure to schedule at least one more repeal vote,\u201d said Tom Daschle, a former Democratic Senate majority leader who is now a lobbyist. \u201cNot because they think it\u2019s good politically in November 2016, but it\u2019s good politically for their base. In the longer term I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n\nThe panel also discussed the possibility of McConnell trying to repeal parts of the law using reconciliation, a procedure for changing a law to reduce spending or otherwise make it conform to the budget.\n\n\u201cThe courts are no longer going to be the battlefield. It\u2019s going to be in the political arena.\u201d\n\nNancy-Ann DeParle, a partner at Consonance Capital Partners and the former deputy chief of staff for policy for President Obama, dismissed the tactic. \u201cTo use reconciliation you have to be able to show a budget impact that you reduce the deficit. This is not going to reduce the deficit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had the lowest health inflation in 50 years,\u201d Sebelius added. \u201cWe are starting to trend relatively near GDP with health inflation. It used to be double.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were Mitch McConnell, I would take a simple repeal vote and move on,\u201d DeParle said.\n\nStill, panelists of both parties expressed regret that the ACA hadn\u2019t been more of a bipartisan effort from the beginning, wondering if some of this trouble could\u2019ve been avoided if Obama had secured Republican buy-in.\n\n\u201cIt was miserably passed and messily written,\u201d Frist said. \u201cThe bill\u2019s got good substance in it. The problem is when you write this stuff, you have to fix it \u2026 The opportunity to fix anything or modify it was erased by the way it was passed. There was no Republican at the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a day has gone by since the law passed that I haven\u2019t wished we had Republican support,\u201d DeParle said. \u201cThat would have made all the difference. It would not have been nearly as ugly as it\u2019s been.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, the battle moves from the courts back to the political arena.", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "With the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, the battle moves from the courts back to the political arena.", "title": "King v.
