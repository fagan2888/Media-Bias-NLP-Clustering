Prices for Medicare Part B coverage wonâ€™t rise for 2015, according to an announcement today by Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services.

Next year will mark the third year in a row that Part B premiums will cost $104.90 a month for most beneficiaries, and the annual deductible will stay at $147. Part B covers doctors visits, outpatient hospital services, durable medical equipment and other items. The program charges certain higher-income beneficiaries, which represent less than 5% of the Medicare population, more than the standard Part B premium; these income-adjusted rates will also remain flat for 2015.

Most beneficiaries pay no premiums for Part A, which covers inpatient hospital care. The Part A deductible that beneficiaries with original Medicare incur when admitted to the hospital will rise $44, to $1,260, in 2015.

Over the past four years, per capita Medicare spending growth has averaged just 0.8% annually, versus a 3.1% annual increase in per capita gross domestic product over the same period, according to Health & Human Services. In a statement, Burwell attributed this slowed growth, and the stabilization of Part B premiums, to cost savings realized under the Affordable Care Act.

Experts have cited other factors behind the slowdown in Medicare spending rates, including an influx of younger, relatively healthy boomers into the system.

Medicare open enrollment runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. During this time, beneficiaries can choose a new Part D drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan, or switch from Medicare Advantage to original Medicare and vice versa.
