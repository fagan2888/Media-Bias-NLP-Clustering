Beloved Aunt Jen caught him, tumbled to the floor, broke her wrist, and is now suing the boy for $127,000.\n\nNot that she complained at the time. \u201cIt was his birthday party and I didn\u2019t want to upset him,\u201d she told the Connecticut Superior Court in Bridgeport, according to a supremely restrained article in The Connecticut Post.\n\nBut her broken wrist has caused her great difficulty. She recently attended another party, \"and it was difficult to hold my hors d'oeuvre plate.\"\n\nGracious. Talk about your life-altering events.\n\nAccording to Connell\u2019s suit:\n\nThe boy, Sean Tarala of Westport, acted unreasonable when he leaped into her arms, causing her to fall on the ground and break her wrist four years ago. This week Connell is asking a six-member Superior Court jury to find the boy liable for his actions. She is seeking $127,000 from the boy, who she described as always being \u201cvery loving, sensitive,\u201d toward her. The boy is the only defendant in the case. In court Friday, the boy, now 12 years old, appeared confused as he sat with his father, Michael Tarala, in the Main Street courtroom. The boy\u2019s mother, Lisa Tarala, died last year.\n\nSo mom went to her grave not knowing if her sister (or sister-in-law) was going to go through with the case against her son, who is the sole defendant. That might heighten some tensions in the courtroom. (And at Thanksgiving.)\n\nThe suit claims that Sean, now age 11, was careless and negligent. What's more he \"should have known that a forceful greeting such as the one delivered... could cause the harms and losses suffered by the plaintiff.\"\n\nI'd warrant a middle-aged woman should know that the lawsuit itself could cause even deeper harms. But our legal system allows for any and all lawsuits, even those best tossed out\u2014ever so gently.\n\n[Updated at 3:40 p.m.] The boy was eight at the time of the incident. He is now 11, according to reports.\n\n[Updated at 3:50 p.m.] Connell lost in court today: she was awarded zero dollars.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Aunt sues nephew for an inadvertent broken wrist.", "title": "Boy on Trial for Exuberant Hugging", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/13/boy-8-on-trial-for-exuberant-hugging", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14447631397983.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14447631397983.jpg", "description": "Aunt sues nephew for an inadvertent broken wrist.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Boy on Trial for Exuberant Hugging"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-10-13T19:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/lenore-skenazy"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd610b\"", "article_summary": "This week Connell is asking a six-member Superior Court jury to find the boy liable for his actions.\nAccording to Connell\u2019s suit:The boy, Sean Tarala of Westport, acted unreasonable when he leaped into her arms, causing her to fall on the ground and break her wrist four years ago.\nBeloved Aunt Jen caught him, tumbled to the floor, broke her wrist, and is now suing the boy for $127,000.\nIn court Friday, the boy, now 12 years old, appeared confused as he sat with his father, Michael Tarala, in the Main Street courtroom.\nShe is seeking $127,000 from the boy, who she described as always being \u201cvery loving, sensitive,\u201d toward her."}
