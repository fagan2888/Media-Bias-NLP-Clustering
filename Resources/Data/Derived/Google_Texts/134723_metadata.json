In most cases, they also apply to vending machine operators with 20 or more units.\n\nThe postponement from the previous Dec. 1 deadline was contained in final guidance from the Food and Drug Administration released on May 5.\n\nThe rule's start date has been so delayed that early critics, such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), have been displaying such information for years in compliance with rules set by California, New York City and other jurisdictions.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that the date will stick,\" said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a long-time proponent.\n\nLobbyists for Domino's Pizza Inc (DPZ.N), convenience stores and supermarkets helped push back the previous federal deadline, and the U.S. House of Representatives in February passed legislation aimed at the weakening rule.\n\nTackling the American obesity epidemic has been a signature issue for the White House and first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe White House publicly opposed the House bill saying it \"would undercut the objective of providing clear, consistent calorie information to consumers.\" But, it stopped short of issuing a formal veto threat.\n\nWootan and other experts said that the Senate version of the opposition bill is expected to stall.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Restaurants will have to disclose the calorie counts of their food next year.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-05-17 11:27:59 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Restaurants will have to disclose the calorie counts of their food next year.", "title": "This Major Change Is Coming To Restaurant Menus In 2017", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-major-change-is-coming-to-restaurant-menus-in-2017_us_5739dfb8e4b08f96c1839c99", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5739e3821600002a00f9362d.jpeg?cache=11rs9iosdr", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HPLifestyle", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5739e3821600002a00f9362d.jpeg?cache=11rs9iosdr", "height": 1000}, "description": "Restaurants will have to disclose the calorie counts of their food next year.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "This Major Change Is Coming To Restaurant Menus In 2017"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-16 11:27:59 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5739dfb8e4b08f96c1839c99", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "healthy-living", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "calorie counts,restaurant calorie counts,healthy living,Diet And Nutrition,Living Well", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "tag": "calorie counts,restaurant calorie counts,healthy living,Diet And Nutrition,Living Well", "published_time": "2016-05-16 11:27:59 -0400", "modified_time": "2016-05-16 11:27:59 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Tackling the American obesity epidemic has been a signature issue for the White House and first lady Michelle Obama.\nU.S. restaurant owners have five extra months to post the calorie counts of their food.\nU.S. restaurant owners will have an extra five months to post the calorie counts of the food they sell under a new federal deadline of May 5, 2017.\nThe White House publicly opposed the House bill saying it \"would undercut the objective of providing clear, consistent calorie information to consumers.\"\nThe regulation requires calories to be listed on menus and menu boards at restaurants and other food retail establishments with 20 or more locations."}
