Rep. Michael Burgess says it would have been crazy not to respond.

The Republican from Lewisville said Friday he couldn’t let Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., get away with calling Texas a “crazy state” at a meeting of the House Rules Committee.

Lone Star pride was on the line.

“I can’t sit there at the witness table and not respond if someone says something disparaging about the state of Texas,” Burgess said during a recording of Lone Star Politics on KXAS-TV (NBC5) that airs Sunday.

“We all live here for a very good reason, because we love the state and we love the economy. We like the climate. We like that the state is able to provide for us and our offspring.”

Hastings was blasting Texas Republicans over the state’s failure to participate in the Affordable Care Act, and Gov. Greg Abbott has said he won’t change course.

Burgess demanded an apology. Hastings refused to do so. And Texas’ GOP House delegation later issued a statement: “Don’t Mess with Texas.”

The squabble between the two giant and influential states drew wide attention, especially on the late-night talk show circuit.

“We’re run by children,” comedian Jon Stewart concluded on The Daily Show, which dubbed the prickly exchange the Southern Slam.

Burgess seemed to agree. “This is unfortunate,” he said. “And one of those things that makes us as an institution not look good.”
