Andrew Cuomo\u2019s running mate Kathy Hochul has a credibility problem and can only offer excuses for a pro-Republican, anti-Obama voting record in Congress, lieutenant governor candidate Tim Wu said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the record, she was one of only 16 Democrats to join a vote that eliminated preventative care from Obamacare, in particular cervical screenings and breast cancer screenings,\u201d Wu said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama had made it clear he was going to veto ... (and) there was 130-something other Democrats who somehow found a way to not vote for that bill,\u201d Wu said, calling her explanation of why she went along with the GOP in Congress to try to roll back Obamacare a \u201cweak excuse.\u201d\n\nWu also released a memo on Hochul\u2019s voting record that detailed her support for House GOP positions on drilling for oil offshore and in nature preserves, the Keystone XL pipeline, shale gas hydrofracking, limiting EPA power, curtailing renewable energy, and climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFresh off winning the endorsement of The New York Times editorial page, Wu predicted that he and running mate Zephyr Teachout would score \u201cthe upset of the century\u201d on Sept. 9, when they face off against Cuomo and Hochul in the primary. Though the two sides are running as teams, the two offices are separate, which raises the possibility that Cuomo could beat Teachout yet have Wu as his running mate in November.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people who are dissatisfied with the Cuomo administration,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI also think my Chinese-American and Asian-American brothers and sisters are really interested in the possibilities of having the first Asian-American statewide official. Every time I go to Flushing or any other Chinatowns in New York, the response has been incredibly enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nThe Times, which is influential in deciding Democratic primaries in New York, declined to endorse Cuomo this week, saying he has done little to address corruption in state government and shut down the Moreland investigation of his supporters. The paper did not endorse Teachout, saying she is too inexperienced. But the editorial board enthusiastically backed Wu Thursday, sending shock waves through Democratic circles.\n\nIn a sign of how the stakes have been raised in what had been a sleepy race, the Cuomo campaign released a Youtube video Thursday of Hochul trying to establish her bona fides as a Democrat. The video followed an earlier pro-Wu video with archival footage of Hochul detailing her votes and alliances with House Republicans.\n\n\u201cDespite the politics of my district, I never backed down from our core Democratic values,\u201d she says in the new video. \u201cPro-choice, pro-marriage equality and pro-worker values. I nearly lost by re-election bid because I wouldn\u2019t turn my back on the president and millions of Americans who deserve quality healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me, as someone who has a progressive record in the most Republican district in the state, I know these issues are not rewarded at the ballot box, but they are the morally right stands to take,\u201d Hochul said.\n\nHochul has refused to debate Wu, and Cuomo has ignored debate challenges from Teachout as well as Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, the Republican candidate in the fall.\n\nWu is given a good chance of beating Hochul on Sept. 9 because of Cuomo\u2019s strained relations with Democratic Party core activists and Wu\u2019s potential to become the first Asian-American elected to statewide office in New York\u2019s history.\n\nWu is a Columbia University law professor and a nationally recognized expert on \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and other Internet law issues. He said Thursday he was taking a short break from campaigning to return home to help his wife out with childcare responsibilities.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "New York, New York news, Kingston New York news, NY New York news, US New York news, world New York news.", "title": "New York Gov.
