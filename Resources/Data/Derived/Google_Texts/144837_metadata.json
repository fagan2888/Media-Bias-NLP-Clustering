ValleyCare's corporate members, including some still active who paid as little as $50 to help build Valley Memorial Hospital in 1961, will be terminated as Stanford assumes full operating and management control over ValleyCare.\n\nSome corporate members will be offered membership in the ValleyCare Charitable Foundation, which will continue its philanthropic and fundraising efforts for the Pleasanton organization.\n\nStanford also will take control of the ValleyCare board of directors, with the new board to have 11 directors, consisting of three Class A directors who will be chosen by ValleyCare's current board from among its current members, and eight Class B directors. As vacancies occur, the Class A directors will select replacement directors, whose appointment will be subject to approval by Stanford.\n\nClass B directors will be selected by Stanford from a slate of candidates submitted by a nominating committee appointed by Stanford.\n\nThe agreement also gives the Charitable Foundation an oversight responsibility to protect the community's interests by monitoring Stanford's satisfaction of certain commitments under the Affiliation Agreement for a period of five years. The amended governing documents of the Charitable Foundation will give members the opportunity to elect the Charitable Foundation's board of directors from among nominees approved by the new VCHS Board.\n\nFor its part, Stanford will provide fundraising expertise and a charitable contribution of $3 million to the foundation. VCHS will continue to provide meeting space necessary for the foundation to carry on its fundraising functions. The sole purpose of the foundation going forward will be to support VCHS and further the charitable purposes it serves.\n\nThe ValleyCare Medical Foundation is a separate nonprofit corporation of which VCHS is the sole member. The foundation contracts with ValleyCare Physician Associates to provide medical services in the foundation's clinics.\n\nThe new affiliation with Stanford will not initially affect this structure, with the medical staff remaining a part of ValleyCare. However, over time the ValleyCare Medical Foundation operations may be combined into Stanford's Bay Area physician network.\n\nStanford leadership also will assist and provide support to ValleyCare and its medical staff in clinical care currently offered at the ValleyCare hospital and medical facilities in Pleasanton and Livermore as well as support the development and operation of a broad geographic network of health care providers and facilities in collaboration with Stanford Health Care and the Stanford University and its School of Medicine.\n\nThis effort will further the charitable, scientific and educational purposes of the university as well as develop, sponsor and advance services and programs that address the physical and mental needs of the community at large.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.pleasantonweekly.com/news/2014/10/03/details-of-stanfordvalleycare-merger", "image": "http://www.pleasantonweekly.com/news/photos/2014/october/3/10675_main.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The proposed affiliation of Pleasanton-based ValleyCare Health System and Stanford Hospital and Clinics have become clearer with Stanford agreeing to maintain ValleyCare as an acute care hospital with an intensive care unit, obstetric services and an emergency department for at least five years.", "title": "Details of Stanford/ValleyCare merger"}, "description": "The proposed affiliation of Pleasanton-based ValleyCare Health System and Stanford Hospital and Clinics have become clearer with Stanford agreeing to maintain ValleyCare as an acute care hospital with an intensive care unit, obstetric services and an emergency department for at least five years.", "author": "Jeb Bing"}, "article_summary": "Some corporate members will be offered membership in the ValleyCare Charitable Foundation, which will continue its philanthropic and fundraising efforts for the Pleasanton organization.\nHowever, over time the ValleyCare Medical Foundation operations may be combined into Stanford's Bay Area physician network.\nThe ValleyCare Medical Foundation is a separate nonprofit corporation of which VCHS is the sole member.\nThe foundation contracts with ValleyCare Physician Associates to provide medical services in the foundation's clinics.\nThe amended governing documents of the Charitable Foundation will give members the opportunity to elect the Charitable Foundation's board of directors from among nominees approved by the new VCHS Board."}
