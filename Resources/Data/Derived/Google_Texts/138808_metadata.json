For example, this Facebook post details a mother in Buchanan County whose healthcare costs have risen nearly 300% after her old plan was cancelled. Or this Facebook post where Johnson County residents told Joni about how Obamacare\u2019s mandates are causing budget headaches for their community.\n\nWhile other candidates are trying to follow Joni\u2019s lead, the reality is that Joni Ernst is the only Republican in this race who has a proven record of fighting against Bruce Braley\u2019s failed policy. As a state senator, Joni fought and voted against Iowa state senate Democrats and their efforts to expand Medicaid here in Iowa.\n\nWith that in mind, Joni Ernst for US Senate is announcing the launch of a new website,BraleysObamacare.com, highlighting the ways Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare is impacting everyday Iowans.\n\n\u201cFor months we\u2019ve heard horror stories as Iowans have been faced with uncertainty about their health coverage due to Obamacare\u2019s flubbed rollout and implementation. Bruce Braley helped pass a bad law and Iowans are paying the price. While Bruce Braley is now ducking the issue, I\u2019m talking to Iowans about my record in the state senate fighting against these policies, holding him accountable next November and repealing and replacing Obamacare with common-sense solutions,\u201d said Joni Ernst.\n\nBraleysObamacare.com features Obamacare nightmares from Iowa voters, Obamacare press clips, and an opportunity for Iowans concerned about Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare to sign up to join Team Joni at their precinct caucus later this month.\n\nPhoto credit: Joni for Iowa", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/01/ernst-launches-tour-website-focused-bruce-braleys-obamacare/", "article_author_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/joni-earnst-manchester-iowa.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-01-15T23:37:31+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "bruce braley, iowa u.s. senate race, joni ernst, obamacare, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Red Oak, IA \u2013 Starting in early January, Mother, Soldier and Proven Conservative, Joni Ernst successfully launched an exciting new effort \u2013 visiting every one of our counties to discuss 99 Reasons \u201cWhy Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare is Bad for Iowa.\u201d At each stop so far we have heard tales of Obamacare\u2019s devastation on local businesses, \u2026", "title": "Ernst Launches Tour, Website Focused on Bruce Braley's Obamacare | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/joni-earnst-manchester-iowa.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-15T17:38:43-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/01/ernst-launches-tour-website-focused-bruce-braleys-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Red Oak, IA \u2013 Starting in early January, Mother, Soldier and Proven Conservative, Joni Ernst successfully launched an exciting new effort \u2013 visiting every one of our counties to discuss 99 Reasons \u201cWhy Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare is Bad for Iowa.\u201d At each stop so far we have heard tales of Obamacare\u2019s devastation on local businesses, [\u2026]", "creator": "@CaffThoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/joni-earnst-manchester-iowa.jpg", "title": "Ernst Launches Tour, Website Focused on Bruce Braley's Obamacare | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "section": "Iowa News & Politics", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-01-15T17:37:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T17:38:43-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With that in mind, Joni Ernst for US Senate is announcing the launch of a new website,BraleysObamacare.com, highlighting the ways Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare is impacting everyday Iowans.\nBraleysObamacare.com features Obamacare nightmares from Iowa voters, Obamacare press clips, and an opportunity for Iowans concerned about Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare to sign up to join Team Joni at their precinct caucus later this month.\nAs a state senator, Joni fought and voted against Iowa state senate Democrats and their efforts to expand Medicaid here in Iowa.\nWhile other candidates are trying to follow Joni\u2019s lead, the reality is that Joni Ernst is the only Republican in this race who has a proven record of fighting against Bruce Braley\u2019s failed policy.\nOr this Facebook post where Johnson County residents told Joni about how Obamacare\u2019s mandates are causing budget headaches for their community."}
