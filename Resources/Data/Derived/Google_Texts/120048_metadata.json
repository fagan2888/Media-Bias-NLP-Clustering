Most notably, he\u2019s been the CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente, the huge not-for-profit insurance plan that includes its own hospitals and clinics, for more than a decade. Throughout his tenure at Kaiser Permanente, which just ended in December, Halvorson talked bluntly about the deficiencies of the U.S. model, particularly with its costs, its \u201cperverse incentives\u201d for providers and whether those incentives lead to bad choices \u2014 and sometimes worse outcomes \u2014 for patients.\n\nHalvorson is known for trying to put into practice what Kaiser and its leadership preach: He put an emphasis on prevention (with a special focus on the epidemics of obesity and diabetes), coordinated care for some 9 million consumers, electronic medical records, and limiting patients to seeing doctors and specialists only within the Kaiser network HMO plan (which includes 37 hospitals and 17,000 doctors in more than half a dozen states). It\u2019s the largest plan in California with 40 percent of the employer market and it\u2019s earned revenues of $50 billion a year.\n\nIn many ways, Kaiser has been seen as a pioneer in the battle over health reform \u2014 and a model for some of those very reasons. But Kaiser has also been the subject of serious criticism with some who have been worried about their limits of choice (including for specialists) and, more recently, for the costs of its premiums. And it, too, has not been able to hold its overall costs down as low as executives had hoped.\n\nHalvorson\u2019s new book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Health Care Bankrupt America\u201d examines the health system and tries to offer solutions based on what\u2019s he\u2019s seen over the years. In this extra online conversation with Judy Woodruff, Halvorson discusses some of the big differences he sees between the U.S. and other countries around the world. Halvorson also wrote about this topic in his book with sections like \u201cWe Pay Primary Care Doctors Half as Much Money\u201d and \u201cWe Have the Highest Hospital Costs in the World.\u201d You can watch that conversation here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Halvorson, former CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente, spoke with Judy Woodruff about his new book, \"Don't Let Health Care Bankrupt America.\"", "pubdate": 20140117, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "George Halvorson, former CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente, spoke with Judy Woodruff about his new book, \"Don't Let Health Care Bankrupt America.\"", "title": "How is health care in U.S. differenct from that of other countries?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Halvorson.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/george-halvorson-ceo-and-chairman/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "George Halvorson, former CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente, spoke with Judy Woodruff about his new book, \"Don't Let Health Care Bankrupt America.\"", "title": "How is health care in U.S. differenct from that of other countries?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Halvorson.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "health care"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Health Care Act, health care"}, "article_summary": "Halvorson\u2019s new book \u201cDon\u2019t Let Health Care Bankrupt America\u201d examines the health system and tries to offer solutions based on what\u2019s he\u2019s seen over the years.\n60532 60529 60529 disabled d6CaCPmXBrgGeorge Halvorson, former CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente, spoke with Judy Woodruff about his new book, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Health Care Bankrupt America.\u201dGeorge Halvorson has seen a lot of what works \u2014 and what doesn\u2019t \u2014 throughout his career in the American health care system.\nMost notably, he\u2019s been the CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente, the huge not-for-profit insurance plan that includes its own hospitals and clinics, for more than a decade.\nIn many ways, Kaiser has been seen as a pioneer in the battle over health reform \u2014 and a model for some of those very reasons.\nIn this extra online conversation with Judy Woodruff, Halvorson discusses some of the big differences he sees between the U.S. and other countries around the world."}
