The former secretary of state told interviewer Charlie Rose the prospect of becoming a grandmother could deter her, and she has a \u201cvery personal choice\u201d to make about a White House bid. \u201cThe job has gotten even bigger and more difficult,\u201d she told Rose. \u201cI understand how the job is done, and I understand what has to be prioritized. I just have to decide whether or not that\u2019s what I want to do at this point in my life.\u201d USA Today has more, and here\u2019s a video of Clinton and Rose:\n\nFine with Hillary, pining for Warren: Politico reports from the annual confab of progressives called Netroots Nation and finds the liberal base feels Hillary Clinton would be an acceptable choice for president. But they\u2019re really pining for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has said repeatedly she isn\u2019t running. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d one attendee told Politico. \u201cI want to see [Clinton] run for president because I know she would win. Who would I really want to see run for president? Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nDecision time: The White House needs to make a decision soon about whether Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate will take effect in 2015. The Hill writes federal officials are late in delivering the final forms and technical guidance necessary for firms to comply, raising suspicions the mandate could once again be delayed. It has been pushed back twice before \u2013 both times in late summer. It is now set to take effect in January.\n\nBorder funding: doubtful. House Speaker John Boehner raised doubts that Congress will be able to fulfill President Barack Obama\u2019s funding request to deal with the influx of illegal migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border before lawmakers leave for their summer recess in two weeks. As the Washington Post writes, Boehner\u2019s comments came amid a sharpening debate between Democrats and Republicans about the cause of the increase in illegal border crossings. Asked about the prospects of approving Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion request before Aug. 1, Boehner said: \u201cI would certainly hope so, but I don\u2019t have as much optimism as I would like to have.\u201d\n\nChristie mobbed in Iowa: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie insists that he hasn\u2019t made up his mind about running for president. But he plans to be back in Iowa \u201ca lot\u201d after visiting Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported from the state, which holds the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. Campaigning with GOP Gov. Terry Branstad, Christie was mobbed as he waded into a restaurant in the city of Marion, where he kissed babies, posed for selfies, signed baseballs and shook hands with about 100 people. Christie is trying to rebound on the national stage after a bridge lane-closing scandal broke his stride, as the Journal puts it.\n\nWant to read the latest and most interesting stories and analysis to come out of D.C.?
