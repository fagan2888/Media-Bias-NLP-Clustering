The tower was built in the 1980s and served for years as BellSouth\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe proposal surprised other developers who were skeptical city real estate is crowded enough to make such an expensive project economical.\n\nDewberry said he does not have new tenants ready for the space. While the add-on would be expensive, Dewberry bought the building at a discount during the Great Recession. He has expanded his real estate holdings in the Midtown area as a bet on future growth.\n\nHe said part of the project\u2019s appeal is improving the building\u2019s aesthetics.\n\n\u201cI think she is short and fat, and I want to make her tall and slender,\u201d Dewberry said. \u201cWe pride ourselves as a Tiffany developer, and she is ugly.\u201d\n\nHis firm has already spent millions of dollars in building upgrades, including replacing its original triangle top, re-glazing windows and replacing windows, the elevator system and lighting.\n\nAdding more floors could require more elevator bays and reduce the building\u2019s usable space, said Benjamin Flowers, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech. The building\u2019s foundation would have to be strong enough to handle the additional load. He said keeping existing tenants happy during construction could also be a challenge.\n\nThere is also the challenge of \u201chow to avoid looking like a Frankenstein,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to look like it was recently operated on with a random kit of parts.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, http://www.ajc.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A developer in Atlanta said he plans to add six stories to the top of an existing 21-story high rise in Midtown, a rare move in the city's real estate market.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/25/atlanta-developer-plans-to-add-6-stories-to-high-r/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A developer in Atlanta said he plans to add six stories to the top of an existing 21-story high rise in Midtown, a rare move in the city\u2019s real estate market.", "title": "Atlanta developer plans to add 6 stories to high rise"}, "twitter": {"description": "A developer in Atlanta said he plans to add six stories to the top of an existing 21-story high rise in Midtown, a rare move in the city's real estate market.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Atlanta developer plans to add 6 stories to high rise"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ef4\"", "article_summary": "ATLANTA (AP) - A developer in Atlanta said he plans to add six stories to the top of an existing 21-story high rise in Midtown, a rare move in the city\u2019s real estate market.\nThe proposal surprised other developers who were skeptical city real estate is crowded enough to make such an expensive project economical.\nHe has expanded his real estate holdings in the Midtown area as a bet on future growth.\nJohn Dewberry of Dewberry Capital told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he hopes to start construction that will turn the 21-story Campanile building into a 27-story building.\n\u201cWe pride ourselves as a Tiffany developer, and she is ugly.\u201dHis firm has already spent millions of dollars in building upgrades, including replacing its original triangle top, re-glazing windows and replacing windows, the elevator system and lighting."}
