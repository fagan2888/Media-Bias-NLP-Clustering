A lot of investors love to come to Texas to invest, but they look for local partners to play a leadership role.\u201d\n\nCalifornia dwarfs other U.S. regions for venture investment, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, with $5.3 billion of venture capital invested last quarter. Massachusetts is second with $1 billion, followed by New York at $737 million and Texas at $308 million.\n\nLiveOak will invest across Texas, even though the state\u2019s metropolitan areas have different strengths. Austin is strong in enterprise and infrastructure software, Mr. Srinivasan said, while Dallas specializes in IT and health care, and Houston has both health care IT and energy IT.\n\nThe team, which also includes General Partner Ben Scott and General Partner Venu Shamapant, worked together for several years at Austin Ventures and has already co-invested with their old firm.\n\nMore than 90% of LiveOak\u2019s limited partners are institutional, which is unusual for a first fund\u2013they include public pension funds, university endowments and foundations and Texas-based family offices.\n\n\u201cThey recognize the gap,\u201d Mr. Srinivasan said.\n\nTerms of the fund, called LiveOak Venture Partners I LP, are undisclosed.\n\nWrite to Deborah Gage at deborah.gage@wsj.com.
