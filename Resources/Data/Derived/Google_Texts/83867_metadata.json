The agency, now a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, draws its authority from the Pure Food and Drug Act signed into law by Roosevelt in 1906.\n\nSalatin describes the Republican president as a \u201csocialist\u201d who did great damage to the free enterprise system.\n\nWho is Joel Salatin?\n\nHe introduced himself Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference as a \u201cChristian, libertarian, environmentalist, capitalist lunatic.\u201d\n\nSo he said in prepared remarks delivered during an afternoon panel entitled \u201cSaving America\u2019s Property Rights and Family Farmers.\u201d\n\nSalatin, a prolific author on the subject of property rights, owns Polyface Farm in rural Swoope, Va.\n\nWith an eye toward history, Salatin points the finger at Roosevelt and other progressive political figures who unleashed the power of government on entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cIf the government never told us how to farm and to eat, we would be a healthier society,\u201d he said.\n\nSalatin agreed that Americans have legitimate concerns about pollution and irresponsible industry actions.\n\n\u201cYes, we should stand up to radical environmentalists,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t just be the party of no. We need to focus on real solutions, and that means creating more opportunities for entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nThe \u201clibertarian environmentalist\u201d was joined by Martha Boneta, who increasingly needs no introduction to conservative audiences.\n\nBoneta\u2019s name is attached to two property rights bills passed by the Virginia General Assembly with broad bipartisan support.\n\nAs The Daily Signal has reported extensively since 2014, Boneta is embroiled in a legal dispute with the Piedmont Environmental Council over the terms of a conservation easement on her 64-acre Liberty Farm in Paris, Va., which is part of Fauquier County.\n\n\u201cNever give up on the American dream,\u201d Boneta told the audience. \u201cThe power of just one person and one idea can create a movement.\u201d\n\nThe Piedmont Environmental Council is a nonprofit land trust headquartered in Fauquier County that, along with the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, holds the easement on Boneta\u2019s property.\n\n>>> Green Group Under Scrutiny for Trespassing on Woman\u2019s Farm\n\nConservation easements are legal agreements that typically call upon property owners to set aside a portion of their land for conservation purposes in exchange for tax breaks.\n\nThe idea is to preserve historic and bucolic regions for posterity while providing landowners with the latitude to conduct commercial and light industrial activities.\n\nIn Boneta\u2019s case, however, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation identified \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the easement that it says are in need of \u201ccorrective amendments.\u201d In addition, two versions of the easement exist: one signed by Boneta and another unsigned but filed in county records.\n\nThe panel discussion at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, was preceded by a documentary on the Boneta case entitled \u201cFarming in Fear.\u201d\n\nBoneta filed a lawsuit in Fauquier County Circuit Court against the Piedmont Environmental Council and the husband-wife real estate team of Phillip and Patricia Thomas, both members of the land trust.\n\nPhillip Thomas owns Talbot Realty in Middleburg, Va., and previously owned Boneta\u2019s Liberty Farm.\n\nThe Thomases filed a motion to dismiss Boneta\u2019s lawsuit. But in January, Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Parker rejected the motion and ruled that Boneta had presented ample evidence for her case to proceed with a trial by jury, expected later this year.\n\nAt CPAC, Boneta credited average citizens for taking a principled stand against well connected, well funded environmental activists and their allies in government.\n\nBut she also cautioned that \u201cthe battle was not over\u201d and that government regulations continue to work against farmers and other entrepreneurs.\n\nIn response to a question from The Daily Signal about the impact of a recent decision by the Virginia Supreme Court that disputes over conservative easements must be settled in deference to property owners, Boneta and Salatin both said they took heart.\n\nWhere the language of a particular easement is not clear or ambiguous, Virginia\u2019s highest court ruled, the burden of proof must be on the land trust and not the property owner.\n\n\u201cThis is huge,\u201d Boneta said. \u201cThis means a lot for the free use of land.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We need to focus on real solutions, and that means creating more opportunities for entrepreneurs,\u201d he tells a CPAC audience, after ripping Teddy Roosevelt.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"We need to focus on real solutions, and that means creating more opportunities for entrepreneurs,\u201d he tells a CPAC audience, after ripping Teddy Roosevelt.", "title": "TR Still Hurts Farmers, Property Rights Advocate Says", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160303_FarminFear_Mooney.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-04T16:25:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TWt6N4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"We need to focus on real solutions, and that means creating more opportunities for entrepreneurs,\u201d he tells a CPAC audience, after ripping Teddy Roosevelt.", "title": "TR Still Hurts Farmers, Property Rights Advocate Says", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160303_FarminFear_Mooney.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "property rights", "published_time": "2016-03-03T19:25:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-04T16:25:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "martha boneta, Piedmont Environmental Council, Virginia Outdoors Foundation, property rights, Liberty Farm"}, "article_summary": "American farmers haven\u2019t had the benefit of operating under a free market system since the early 20th century, property rights advocate Joel Salatin says.\nBoneta\u2019s name is attached to two property rights bills passed by the Virginia General Assembly with broad bipartisan support.\nBut she also cautioned that \u201cthe battle was not over\u201d and that government regulations continue to work against farmers and other entrepreneurs.\n\u201cIf the government never told us how to farm and to eat, we would be a healthier society,\u201d he said.\nSalatin describes the Republican president as a \u201csocialist\u201d who did great damage to the free enterprise system."}
