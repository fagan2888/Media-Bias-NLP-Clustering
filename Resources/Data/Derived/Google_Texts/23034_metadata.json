If passed, a \"Medicare for All\" type of system called \"ColoradoCare\" will be implemented for all residents of Colorado. The Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, gives the state a right to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and establish their own system if it covers more people with better care.\n\nColoradoCare is the health care financing system that would be established by Amendment 69. Everyone would pay premiums through a payroll and income premium tax, and every Colorado resident would be covered. This premium tax will replace current health insurance premiums, deductibles, and co-pays for designated preventive and primary care services. It is a financing system not a delivery system. Medical Care providers could choose to be public, private, for profit, nonprofit, independent, or salaried.\n\nFree, confidential HIV, Hepatitis C and STI testing available Thursday\n\nChildren's Hospital Colorado in conjunction with Fremont County Department of Public Health & Environment will offer a free, confidential HIV, Hepatitis C and STI testing day in honor of National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe event will occur from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday at the Public Health building at 201 N.
