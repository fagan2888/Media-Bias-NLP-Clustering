Treadwell trashes foe in primary\n\nAlaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell laced into a likely Republican primary challenger Thursday, warning that his expected entry into the Senate race will benefit tea party favorite Joe Miller and questioning the depth of his roots in the state.\n\nNews that Dan Sullivan will resign as the state\u2019s natural resource commissioner came last week just moments before Treadwell took the stage in Anchorage to officially launch his bid.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIf it was their intent to stomp on our rollout, it backfired on them,\u201d Treadwell told POLITICO in an extended interview at a law office in Washington.\n\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)\n\nSullivan has assembled a campaign team and plans to formally announce his candidacy after giving up his day job on Sept. 24 to focus full time on politics. Miller beat Sen. Lisa Murkowski in the 2010 primary only to lose to her write-in campaign in the general.\n\nThe winner of the three-way GOP contest will face Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, who narrowly won in 2008.\n\n\u201cIt would put us in a situation where we both have to put lots more resources into a primary situation than we would before,\u201d said Treadwell, who presented himself as the most electable conservative. \u201cPolitically, this helps Joe Miller. And most importantly, it helps people who want to help Mark Begich by fomenting division in the Republican Party. They can certainly do that.\u201d\n\nTreadwell, 57, noted that he moved to Alaska as a teenager.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Joe Miller heading to Las Vegas)\n\nSullivan was born in Ohio and moved to Alaska in 1997 after completing active duty in the Marines. He went to Washington to work in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, serving as an assistant secretary of state under Condoleezza Rice from 2006 to 2009. He returned to Alaska to be appointed attorney general by Sarah Palin and moved to the Department of Natural Resources in 2011.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put my 40 years of working in Alaska \u2026 against anyone,\u201d Treadwell said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a jar of mayonnaise in my refrigerator that\u2019s been there longer than Dan Sullivan\u2019s been in Alaska.\u201d\n\nSullivan responded in an email late Thursday night: \u201cWhile serving as Alaska\u2019s Attorney General and current Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, I have maintained a strict policy of declining media requests regarding politics and non-state of Alaska matters, but I will say this: after moving to Alaska over 16 years ago, I learned something new today \u2014 not to eat any of Mead Treadwell\u2019s sandwiches.\u201d\n\nClearly annoyed about Sullivan getting in the race, he noted that Rep. Paul Ryan, Gov. Scott Walker and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus would not run against each other in Wisconsin because they all know their lanes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no need for any one of those three guys to run against each other, and I look at Sullivan as someone we were happy to recruit back to Alaska and there\u2019s no reason for him to run for this job,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have to go out there and contrast our record, I\u2019m very happy to put my record out there and let the voters decide.\u201d\n\nTreadwell said he will be \u201csurprised\u201d if Gov. Sean Parnell, who is up for reelection and passed on running for the Senate seat, gets involved in the primary. Treadwell also said he does not believe Sarah Palin will weigh into the contested primary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s keeping her options open,\u201d said Treadwell. \u201cI\u2019m honored that her father-in-law, Jim Palin, was a sponsor of one of my fundraisers. I like and respect the governor and her family and will continue to work very hard in my race and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he would risk shutting down the government to defund the Affordable Care Act, Treadwell walked a careful line.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still two weeks left in September,\u201d he said. \u201cI would push as hard as I could to get Obamacare on the table. I don\u2019t want to shut down the government.\u201d\n\nTreadwell said he wants more serious discussion about tackling the debt and health care.\n\n\u201cDo I like this kind of tactic? No, I believe that you need to have bipartisan conversation and sit down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is that until the Democrats want to come in and sit down about these two issues, you\u2019re going to continue to see these kinds of tactics.\u201d\n\nTreadwell is traveling around the country to raise money \u2014 he\u2019s recently been in Chicago, Columbus, Ohio and Oklahoma City \u2014 but lags far behind the incumbent. Begich had $2 million cash on hand at the end of June, after raising $993,000 in the second quarter. Treadwell raised $170,000 during the period.\n\n\u201cI have seen some polling data that has us ahead, and I feel very comfortable saying we are the conservative who can win the primary and beat Mark Begich, and I can doubt any other candidate can show you polling data that says the same thing,\u201d Treadwell said.\n\nHe said there are various pushes in Alaska to have statewide ballot initiatives alongside the GOP primary, including the legalization of marijuana, changing the minimum wage, altering water permitting rules and repealing changes to the way oil companies are taxed.\n\n\u201cThat has the potential to change the composition of voters in the primary, which is interesting,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Alaska lieutenant governor questions the depth of his opponent's roots in the state.", "title": "Treadwell trashes foe in primary", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/mead-treadwell-alaska-primary-97074.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/06/18/130618_mead_treadwell_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Alaska,Mead Treadwell,2014 Elections (364)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Alaska lieutenant governor questions the depth of his opponent's roots in the state.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca38a\"", "article_summary": "Treadwell trashes foe in primaryAlaska Lt.
