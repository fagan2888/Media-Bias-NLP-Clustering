You know, people are being forced to pay for things that they will not use. It is not for them to tell people -- I don't need to be told I need to have mental health coverage. If I wanted it, I would have gotten it. And I think people are getting a little fed up, even Democrats, with this stuff.\n\nIn fact, without the ACA's requirement that essential health benefits be covered by new insurance plans sold on the exchanges, Powers may not have been able to get mental health coverage or maternity care if she wanted it. Individuals who needed those services before the law's passage were routinely discriminated against while trying to obtain necessary health insurance, by being required to pay significantly more for coverage, left unable to get a plan offering specific coverage, or rejected from health insurance all together.\n\nAs CNNMoney explained, previously insurance companies were able to keep costs down for many by offering plans without some essential benefits, like maternity care and mental health services, and cherry picking \"among applicants to only pick the healthiest ones.\" The New York Times reported that in 2011, \"62 percent of women in the United States covered by private plans that were not obtained through an employer lacked maternity coverage,\" and a Washington Post columnist explained that according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), nearly 20 percent of people currently in the individual market have \"no coverage for mental-health cases, including outpatient therapy visits and inpatient crisis intervention and stabilization.\" (Approximately 57.7 million Americans experience a mental health condition per year, and half of all Americans will experience one in their lifetime.) Many individual market insurance plans did not offer these services.\n\nThe entire concept behind the Affordable Care Act was to change this, ensuring that all Americans, regardless of their personal finances or current health states, could have access to quality, comprehensive health insurance that covered their needs. The law thus mandates ten essential health benefits -- including maternity care and some mental health services -- that all new insurance plans must include at minimum for every American.\n\nPowers' argument also ignored that requiring insurance companies to cover these essential services in all health plans has significant economic benefits.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers attacked the new health care law for requiring all new insurance plans to cover essential services such as maternity care and mental health care, ignoring the fact that individuals with these conditions are often discriminated against in the insurance market and that requiring coverage for these services will he", "title": "What Fox's Kirsten Powers Gets Wrong About Maternity And Mental Health Coverage", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/11/13/what-foxs-kirsten-powers-gets-wrong-about-mater/196879", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2013/11/13/powers.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-13T13:39:49-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/11/13/what-foxs-kirsten-powers-gets-wrong-about-mater/196879", "title": "What Fox's Kirsten Powers Gets Wrong About Maternity And Mental Health Coverage", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "Fox News Channel", "published_time": "2013-11-13T13:39:49-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-13T13:18:08-05:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/hannah-groch-begley/188"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2522\"", "article_summary": "It is not for them to tell people -- I don't need to be told I need to have mental health coverage.\nThe law thus mandates ten essential health benefits -- including maternity care and some mental health services -- that all new insurance plans must include at minimum for every American.\n(Approximately 57.7 million Americans experience a mental health condition per year, and half of all Americans will experience one in their lifetime.)\nPowers' argument also ignored that requiring insurance companies to cover these essential services in all health plans has significant economic benefits.\nIn fact, without the ACA's requirement that essential health benefits be covered by new insurance plans sold on the exchanges, Powers may not have been able to get mental health coverage or maternity care if she wanted it."}
