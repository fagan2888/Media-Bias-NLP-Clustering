It directed a video that was uploaded Sunday of the first-person shooter game \u201cTitanfall,\u201d which pitted a gamer under the handle HealthcareGOV \u2014 voiced by Obama impersonator Jason Stephens \u2014 against an unsuspecting group of youngish-sounding players. During the game, \u201cObama\u201d fielded questions on his gaming strategy, current events, and pop culture.\n\nWhen he asked the group a few questions of his own about signing up for health insurance, we got the nutshell of Millennial disinterest in Obamacare.\n\n\u201cDo you guys have any questions about the Affordable Care Act, or about my presidency, or about me?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cHow turnt up do you get on the weekends?\u201d one user responded.\n\nAfter replying with a couple of quips about the Drug Enforcement Agency and Colorado, Stephens-as-Obama went on to talk about the Kennedy assassination and took a question about deporting Justin Bieber.\n\nThe YouTube group known for its \u201cmachinima\u201d \u2014 using computer graphics, often those from video games, to create a cinematic work \u2014 has posted videos with the same premise this year.
