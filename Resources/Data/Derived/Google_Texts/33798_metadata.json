As the party of old white cranks who think the only racism that exists in this country is against white men, it\u2019s pretty much the job of the GOP presidential hopefuls to try to outdo each other yelling about how much they are not on board. (Considering that there are anti-racist protests happening at Ithaca, Smith and the University of Kansas, among several others, they\u2019ll probably have more to say in coming days.) Here are some prize reactions from the Republican presidential contenders.\n\n1. Donald Trump\n\nSpeaking via phone on Fox Business Network, Donald Trump\u2014who by his own estimation, has \u201ca great relationship with the blacks\u201d\u2014 said he thinks the Missouri protests are \u201cdisgusting.\u201d The billionaire, apparently taking a breakfrom not reading the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, took a few minutes to scaremonger about the school\u2019s future and boast about how he would have essentially done nothing to deal with charges of racism confronting the campus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s disgusting. I think it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Trump said about the protests. \u201cI think the two people that resigned are weak, ineffective people. I think that when they resigned, they set something in motion that\u2019s going to be a disaster for the next long period of time.\u201d\n\nAnd then, per usual, the billionaire made it about himself. \u201cTrump should have been the chancellor of that university,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, there would have been no resignations.\u201d\n\nTrump also suggested that student demands are not to be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cTheir demands are like crazy. The things that they are asking for, many of those things are like crazy. So it\u2019s just disgraceful.\u201d\n\n2. Ben Carson\n\nOddly, Carson\u2014a Yale alum\u2014began his thoughts on the University of Missouri situation on a sort of reasonable-sounding note, though it does suggest a false equivalence between students and the administration. Then things went really sideways, as you might expect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the problem we have going on in our country right now,\u201d Carson said on The Kelly File. \u201cWe have people who get in their respective corners and demonize each other, but there\u2019s no conversation. And of course, if you ask people to put on the record what their gripes are and what their solutions are, then perhaps they can see that they\u2019re not so far apart and they can come up with some reasonable solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is just raw emotion. And people being manipulated, I think, in many cases by outside forces who wish to cause disturbances.\u201d\n\nThat last part sounds a lot like when, in footage from the Civil Rights Movement, you hear white Southerners talking about how everything was fine until \u201coutside agitators\u201d starting coming in and getting the Negroes all riled up. Carson went on to talk about how we should be all be frightened, because anarchy, and also the Constitution and also America.\n\n\u201cWell, we need to recognize that this is a very dangerous trend,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWhen we get to a point where a majority can say, \u2018I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s offensive, and therefore I have a right to be violent toward you or deprive you of rights, because I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 that really goes against the grain of our constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nNot sure if Ben Carson knows that the only violence, or threats of violence, during the Yale and Missouri protests have come from two white men who, via social media, said they planned to shoot black protesters. In any case, Carson continued on in the same vein.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being a little too tolerant, you might say. Accepting infantile behavior\u2026.To say that I have a right to violate your civil rights because you\u2019re offending me is un-American. It is unconstitutional. And the officials at these places must recognize that and have the moral courage to stand up to it. Because if they don\u2019t, it will grow, it will exacerbate the situation, and we will move much further toward anarchy than anybody can imagine and much more quickly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "To the surprise of no one, the party of old white men is apathetic to students protesting institutional racism VIDEO", "title": "The 4 most ridiculous opinions on the unrest at Yale and the University of Missouri from our GOP candidates", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "To the surprise of no one, the party of old white men is apathetic to students protesting institutional racism VIDEO", "title": "The 4 most ridiculous opinions on the unrest at Yale and the University of Missouri from our GOP candidates", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/14/4_republican_candidates_ridiculous_opinions_on_the_unrest_at_yale_and_mizzou_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/rand_paul9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To the surprise of no one, the party of old white men is apathetic to students protesting institutional racism VIDEO", "title": "The 4 most ridiculous opinions on the unrest at Yale and the University of Missouri from our GOP candidates", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/rand_paul9.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kali Holloway", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, Rand Paul, university of missouri, Yale", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, Rand Paul, university of missouri, Yale, Elections News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThe anti-racism protests at the University of Missouri and Yale have become a topic of national conversation, which means politicians are also weighing in.\nBen CarsonOddly, Carson\u2014a Yale alum\u2014began his thoughts on the University of Missouri situation on a sort of reasonable-sounding note, though it does suggest a false equivalence between students and the administration.\n(Considering that there are anti-racist protests happening at Ithaca, Smith and the University of Kansas, among several others, they\u2019ll probably have more to say in coming days.)\nAccepting infantile behavior\u2026.To say that I have a right to violate your civil rights because you\u2019re offending me is un-American.\nAnd the officials at these places must recognize that and have the moral courage to stand up to it."}
