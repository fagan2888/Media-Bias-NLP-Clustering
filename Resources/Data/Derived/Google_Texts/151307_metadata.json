Cruise and then Rand Paul because in some ways they're competing for a very similar part of the party kind of the libertarian tea party ish kind of winged ... I and Chris basically one entity for Sony to come and get a jump on things and now I'm winter's coming out will go ... head to head and is distributed re impose import in this race with you think he has a good chance of winning the nomination not because because of that ... libertarian Basin because his father's ... accumulated machinery around the country ... I guarantee you that a certain respectable showing a whole bunch of states one after another after another whether it ever really takes off or not ... I must notably his father did well in the early primary states You know he came in third in Iowa in two thousand twelve first caucus state ... he came in second in New Hampshire in the primary ... and that he does very well in the pot as well be on the so the stereo Korea before earliest states where Rand Paul how we have a respectable showing and that that feel this pain if you come in with twelve percent that's a pretty big so it's good ... Graham poll ... conceivably win New Hampshire and that the electorate that lines up pretty well with his brother ... I could be cut to the free and I wanna libertarians there and ... at twenty since I got twentysomething percent ... due to the fact over and over twenty percent that's that's a giant showing in this field ... on and they are you know they remain pretty well organized and interconnected ... one big question is ... when he isn't quite as surely libertarian and says dad he likes to call him so libertarian ish ... um and so the question is whether the issue of the runway ... before and whether you get the average up the idea is to non libertarians and centrists in the party ... and even some even use a tea party ... slice the of the party this reading on the venture will actually want the government will and do some things ... that we will find offensive in our hearts as our moral concern Trian demos answer those are the Ted Cruz ... yet there they sat in us I think that that's the space where Ted Cruz thinks he can move in on Rand Paul turf is ... using social issues to get ... the idea now and it too I think with all this kind of ... thinking about that he has been in Iowa and other places ... privately Kinder reaching out to pastors evangelicals to say hey ... I've got religion to ALM so ... I think he's aware of it that the limitations of his father's appeal in really has been working very hard to reach beyond ... sting is social issues just did ... one exploded this week in Indiana and and then later artists of religious freedom legislation which has been interpreted ... widely in case of Indiana has ... essentially anti gay rights legislation ... your theory goods from explain or question answer format for us in this week I think you started to address the question that I hear a lot which ... I'm hoping that you can talk about for second here which is ... if the federal government has religious freedom on the books are in essence the nineties in as multiple other states have done the same or similar things before ... why does blow up now and yet ... you know it's it's fascinating because ... it's really a situation which the context has overshadowed the legislation itself ... the religious freedom restoration says it is ... that it is from a nineteen ninety three law ... which aims to reverse a justice Kali of conservative opinion ... restoring a very liberal opinion from the sixties by ... Justice William Brennan ... on that gave him small exceptions to general asked if he had a significant religious reasons one comply not one to work on sadder for instance ... and ... and this wall was of recently used mainly by what you wait says no ... relatively smaller minority religions ... in Sikhs Muslims people whose ... of taxes aren't necessarily taken into account when General last May ... now it is almost flat this is a lot which has been seized upon bought ... up by Christians by evangelical Christians who ... see it as a bulwark against the social change to the layman terms of gay marriage ... earlier with with contraception ... of federal law ... only applies to federal legislation so if ... there is so this ... Indiana lawns Arkansas law ... it would provide exceptions to the piano and our console for religious practice under certain circumstances ... the funny thing is that ... neither India nor Arkansas prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians ... so right now there is no law ... that would stop with this this from firing ... a gay employee for refusing to serve the customers they can do they have that freedom if you will ... right now so with this law seems to be something that is almost ... an effort to to to ... build up the barricades ... for the expected ... nationalization of gay marriage later this year ... after the Supreme Court will suck ... it in your when you're suggesting is if there was a pushback against the tide of pro gay marriage sentiment in the country we wouldn't be having this conversation at all the steps theory behind the controversy ... that's right I saw one out one blogger posts today ... described it as a ... an effort to to find a respectable way to oppose keeping their ... doors to really ... come into is a matter of ... our religious practice know whether that works or not ... off for businesses that want to ... up ... to dawn service to to to the people ... it is really ... hard to say because as I write how they can enable get up and ... if there were to be some legislation in the states that added sexual orientation to the anti discrimination laws ... if the Supreme Court were to come down with a very strong ruling ... for pitting the sky discrimination and the state statutes would matter anyway so it's ... I think they really ... it is almost ... in terms of ... oh what military people it's a assertive ... preparing the battlefield if you will as opposed to being something that specifically creates ... of power to discriminate ... just this ... a challenge to his was to make it to the Supreme Court I mean it it seems like there would be a pretty comparable majority ... against this is not ... in the Kennedy went to ... he was right the sky law down fall with me ... well you know the law itself ... has as its proponents of ... observe ... says nothing about sex orientation says nothing about any kind of protected classes simply says that was that ... Burton ... a former religious exercise ... to that recession's happy provided less than outweighed by certain state interests ... so it really would be a matter of application Anthony Kennedy were focusing on him is the swing vote the Supreme Court ... he has been of course the ... leading exponent of the rice is written all three major gay rights decision so for ... me well when the next one later this year ... he was seized in the majority by former Tory there ... he also was in the fight for majority last year ... that found a religious exception to the contraceptive regulations of the Affordable Care Act ... that were invoked by hobby lobby stores and created ... a really previously been recognized right of corporations to claim ... a logistics ... so they're well um the discovery sedan racing great raging and there's been a lot of conversation for a front about her here and in their talks up down up down up down it I think all the of obscure something potentially important that when on overseas and that is the place which is the ... Islamic State's arty kind of got rolled back finally in a place that matters which to create in Iraq ... but this is a big deal were not a big deal or we not only ... on ... this appears to be a big deal I mean we have the most major pushback on we've seen so far about the Islamic State forces the ... the ... for the U S has stopped their ideas push back and some ...
