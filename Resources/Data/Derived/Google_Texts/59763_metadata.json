Patty Murray of Washington announced support for the Iran deal Tuesday, following on the heels of Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., to further President Barack Obama\u2019s growing support in the Senate.\n\nThe announcements mark a setback to Republican-led efforts to secure the 67 votes needed to override a presidential veto if a resolution of disapproval hits Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nTwo top Senate Democrats have vowed to oppose the agreement, but Republican senators need 11 of the 17 Democrats who have yet to announce a position.\n\nMeet five key Democratic senators who are still on the fence.\n\nBenjamin Cardin, Maryland\n\nSen. Benjamin Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, holds perhaps the most critical influence in the fate of the Iran deal. Cardin was thrust into central focus after Sen. Chuck Schumer, in line as the next Democratic leader, publicly announced opposition to the accord.\n\nCardin\u2019s position as a top Jewish lawmaker, along with his persistent support for Israel during his eight years in the Senate, has made him a primary target for lobbying offensives on both sides of the deal.\n\nHe has spoken with Obama and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist and an architect of the deal, numerous times to address concerns, but he has remained silent and likely will not announce his position until after Labor Day.\n\n\u201cThis is such an elevated decision that members have to make,\u201d Cardin told reporters. \u201cYou don\u2019t look to someone else as to how you\u2019re going to vote. This is something that you\u2019re going to decide as to what\u2019s in the best interests of our country.\u201d\n\nCardin has also spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the accord a \u201chistoric mistake,\u201d and has met with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the lead pro-Israel lobbying group that has launched a nonprofit organization to run ads against the deal in Baltimore and nationwide.\n\nHe even became the first lawmaker specifically targeted through a Snapchat ad after advocacy group Secure America Now purchased a geofilter promoted in Maryland with the text \u201cTell Senator Cardin: No to the bad Iran deal!\u201d\n\nCardin has split from the White House before, voting against Obama\u2019s fast-track trade bill and opposing the president\u2019s legal justification to continue the war against ISIS.\n\nBut his voting record reveals a disposition toward diplomacy. During his time in the House, he notably voted against the 2002 authorization for the use of military force to invade Iraq.\n\nChris Coons, Delaware\n\nSen. Chris Coons, also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, is another central figure among the undecided senators. Before he was elected to the Senate in 2010, Coons was an attorney for his family\u2019s company, W.L. Gore & Associates.\n\nHis experience in law conditioned him to closely scrutinize complex deals, establishing a habit he indicated has carried over as he carefully reviews the nuclear agreement.\n\n\u201cI will tell you, my gut response at several places has been grave concern,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\nCoons has spoken with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden about his apprehensions, telling Politico the administration must assure him the provisions regarding inspections and sanctions \u201cwon\u2019t enable Iran\u2019s long-term ability to build a bomb.\u201d\n\nHe said he would assess the agreement \u201cwith a position of suspicion and distrust of Iran,\u201d given its history of \u201csupporting terrorism globally.\u201d\n\nCoons said the input from his constituents is divided, but he has remained adamant he would put political and partisan inclinations aside to determine his position based on the details of the accord, calling it a \u201cvote of conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are these watershed votes that have a real impact on how we see ourselves as a country, how we are seen in the world, and how we are perceived as an ally,\u201d he told The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nRichard Blumenthal, Connecticut\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, another Jewish Democrat with a staunch record of Israel-support, told constituents in August that the nuclear accord has \u201cweaknesses,\u201d noting that \u201cthere may have been a better deal if we\u2019d had different people doing it.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal\u2019s ties to the Jewish community have made him a key focus for both the administration and opponents of the deal working to capture his vote. He was one of four Democratic senators targeted by the American Security Initiative in a $1.4-million ad campaign.\n\nHe has also met with the Obama administration and lobbyists from AIPAC to flesh out concerns.\n\nBut the junior senator remains tight-lipped on his position, telling Bloomberg he would spend the August recess listening to constituents and would base his vote on what is \u201cright\u201d for the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been digging into documents, speaking to the administration and to opponents,\u201d he told The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019ve raised issues with the administration. I\u2019m awaiting responses, and they could be determinative.\u201d\n\nRon Wyden, Oregon\n\nSen. Ron Wyden describes himself as a \u201cdiplomacy guy\u201d and, along with Cardin, was one of only 23 senators who voted against the Iraq War in 2002.\n\nBut the Jewish senator, whose parents fled from Nazi Germany, is also a top recipient of pro-Israel funding and expressed suspicion of the deal in a July 14 statement released the day the agreement was reached in Vienna.\n\n\u201cI said all along I was skeptical that Iran\u2019s leaders would agree to dismantle their nuclear weapons program and I have questions about whether this agreement accomplishes that, particularly in light of Iran\u2019s history on this issue,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told Oregon Public Broadcasting he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the billions of dollars estimated to pour into Tehran if the accord remains intact, calling it a \u201csignificant factor\u201d in his decision.\n\n\u201cIran is going to get a substantial amount of money here \u2026 a very real portion of that money will go to support Hamas and Hezbollah,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three-term senator faces re-election in 2016 and has already received pushback from Democrats in the state who are angry at him for supporting Obama\u2019s trade deal.\n\nJoe Manchin, West Virginia\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, the former governor of West Virginia whose red-state constituents tend to push against Obama\u2019s policies, said in July he was leaning toward supporting the accord, but he has yet to announce an official position.\n\n\u201cEverybody says there is a better deal,\u201d he told MSNBC. \u201cWhat options are on the table or even basically discussed I could consider voting for?\u201d\n\nBut he has also criticized the Obama administration for lifting the arms embargo on Iran under the final agreement.\n\n\u201cI want to find out why it came back in. It was not part of the original talks,\u201d Manchin told Politico. \u201cWhat did we get for that?\u201d\n\nManchin has also previously backed two rounds of additional sanctions legislation during negotiations, which the White House opposed. He later pulled his support.\n\n\u201cI did not sign it with the intention that it would ever be voted upon or used upon while we\u2019re negotiating,\u201d he told MSNBC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meet five key Democratic senators who are still on the fence about the Iran deal.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Meet five key Democratic senators who are still on the fence about the Iran deal.", "title": "Why Five Key Democrats Are Still on the Fence of Iran Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150818_Iran-deal-whip-count_Update0826.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-26T12:40:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1V8rhMg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Meet five key Democratic senators who are still on the fence about the Iran deal.", "title": "Why Five Key Democrats Are Still on the Fence of Iran Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150818_Iran-deal-whip-count_Update0826.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-08-26T03:01:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T12:40:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran deal, Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow, Benjamin Cardin, Chris Coons, Joe Manchin, Richard Blumenthal"}, "article_summary": "Benjamin Cardin, MarylandSen.
