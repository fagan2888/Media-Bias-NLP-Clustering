Actually, wait: I think it probably is news to lots of Republican voters that he thinks AGW is real. It shouldn\u2019t be, as Romney\u2019s copped to believing that both on the trail and in a book he wrote in 2010, but one of the fun things about Romney campaigns is that you never know which long-held conservative heresy is suddenly going to blow up on him. He flamed out in the primaries in 2008 but RomneyCare was never much of an issue. Four years later, after ObamaCare had made Massachusetts\u2019s reforms toxic to the right, he was forced to swallow hard and explain it away \u2014 but meanwhile, his pronouncements on climate change largely went unnoticed. Four years after that, is climate change poised to become the RomneyCare of the 2016 primaries?\n\nNah, of course not. The RomneyCare of the 2016 primaries will be, er, RomneyCare.\n\nWhile hitting familiar Republican points criticizing the size of the federal debt, Romney at times sounded like a Democrat, calling for President Barack Obama and other leaders in Washington to act on common liberal priorities such as climate change, poverty and education. \u201cI\u2019m one of those Republicans who thinks we are getting warmer and that we contribute to that,\u201d he said of climate change, charging that federal leaders have failed to enact global agreements needed to tackle the problem\u2026 \u201cLet\u2019s deal with poverty,\u201d he said Wednesday night. \u201cHave we done it? No. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\u2026 Romney had previously acknowledged that climate change is real, noting in his 2010 book that \u201chuman activity is a contributing factor.\u201d But he questioned the extent to which man was contributing to the warming of the planet and said throughout his 2012 campaign that America shouldn\u2019t spend significant resources combating the problem \u2014 particularly with major polluters like China doing little.\n\nIn 2011, he said, \u201cI believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And \u2026 I believe that humans contribute to that.\u201d The next year, he hedged by insisting that we don\u2019t really know what\u2019s causing climate change and that, whatever it may be, we\u2019re surely not about to spend trillions to try to stop it. Now, evidently, he\u2019s knocking Congress for not being more aggressive in forging international agreements to solve the problem. Remember, this is a guy who thinks his path to the nomination is running to Jeb Bush\u2019s right. Can you survive the Republican primaries these days preaching that it\u2019s time for America to ratify the Kyoto Protocol?\n\nPerhaps, my friends. Perhaps:\n\nThat\u2019s quite a reversal in the span of just a year. In fact, on the threshold question of whether climate change is a \u201cresult of human activity,\u201d the partisan group that\u2019s shown the sharpest increase since September 2013 is Republicans. Partly that\u2019s because the GOP\u2019s numbers had more room to grow. Democrats increased from 70 percent to 78 percent over the same span while independents rose from 44 percent to 54 percent. Republicans rose from 29 percent to 42 percent \u2014 still a minority position but a significant enough gain to shake loose 15 GOP votes in the Senate yesterday for the proposition that \u201chuman activity contributes to climate change.\u201d But maybe all of this is fleeting: Read down into YouGov\u2019s poll analysis and you\u2019ll find that, as recently as one month ago, just 27 percent of Republicans agreed that man was contributing to climate change. What goosed the numbers, apparently, was NASA\u2019s announcement that 2014 was the hottest year on record. They\u2019ve since walked that back, admitting there\u2019s less than a 40 percent chance that it\u2019s true, but the \u201cdamn, last year was hot\u201d news stories every January may be having a cumulative effect in moving opinion \u2026 if only for a month or two. Romney had better hope that the latest wave of concern on the right lasts longer than that.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Victory.", "title": "Romney: Climate change is real, man is contributing to it, and it\u2019s time to do something about it", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/01/22/romney-climate-change-is-real-man-is-contributing-to-it-and-its-time-to-do-something-about-it/", "image": {"width": 295, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/yg.jpeg", "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-23T01:41:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T12:43:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, climate change, global warming, primary, republican, romney,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c58\"", "article_summary": "Four years after that, is climate change poised to become the RomneyCare of the 2016 primaries?\nIn fact, on the threshold question of whether climate change is a \u201cresult of human activity,\u201d the partisan group that\u2019s shown the sharpest increase since September 2013 is Republicans.\nFour years later, after ObamaCare had made Massachusetts\u2019s reforms toxic to the right, he was forced to swallow hard and explain it away \u2014 but meanwhile, his pronouncements on climate change largely went unnoticed.\nActually, wait: I think it probably is news to lots of Republican voters that he thinks AGW is real.\nRomney: Climate change is real, man is contributing to it, and it\u2019s time to do something about itposted at 8:41 pm on January 22, 2015 by AllahpunditIt\u2019s not news that he believes it\u2019s real and at least partly man-made, but it is sort of newsy that he thinks it\u2019s time to take action."}
