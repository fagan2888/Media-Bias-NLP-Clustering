Under the legislation, companies would be required to provide coverage for children with autism who are six and under.\n\nFor many Senators the legislation was personal. That was the case with Republican Senator Renee Unterman, who spoke about her late son, Zak.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t talk until he was three years old, and we were so proud of him. He said momma, and he said daddy. Nobody knew what autism was. There was no Marcus Institute. There was nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nUnterman says she spent countless hours trying to get her son help.\n\n\u201cHe saw psychiatrists, he saw psychologists \u2026 It cost a lot of money.\u201d\n\nBut despite that help, Unterman says her son didn\u2019t graduate from high school because he couldn\u2019t concentrate. Unterman said Zak later took his own life.\n\n\u201cAnd it was tragic.\u201d\n\nUnterman says she has seen positive outcomes for children with autism who receive early diagnosis and treatment. And she urged Senators to help those who suffer from the disorders.\n\nI\u2019m here to ask you not to let other children, to give them a second chance. Lots of people don\u2019t have money. The majority of people don\u2019t have to be able to afford to be able to take care of this disease process.\u201d\n\nThe bill was also personal to Tommie Williams. Ava, the daughter of his niece, has responded well to autism treatment. Williams has been pushing for similar legislation for several years.\n\n\u201cThis bill is about people, not on Medicaid, not on government welfare. This is about people who save up their money to buy insurance to find out when their kid is diagnosed with autism they\u2019re not covered. They deserve better policies.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Nan Orrock also spoke in support of the bill, but she says she wishes the legislation went further.\n\n\u201cI would much prefer to see us to have a bill that covers children up to the age 18. That\u2019s what needed. That seems to not be what\u2019s politically possible at this point.\u201d\n\nThe legislation would not require autism treatment coverage for plans under a federal health insurance exchange that Georgians can participate in under the Affordable Care Act. Companies with 10 or fewer employees would also be exempt. It would allow insurance companies to limit coverage for applied behavior analysis to $35,000 dollars per year. The bill now heads to the House where it\u2019s expected to receive some resistance from a number of Republicans who are concerned about the state placing a mandate on private businesses.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local", "description": "The Georgia Senate approved a bill 51 to 0 that would require private insurance companies to provide coverage for autism treatment.
