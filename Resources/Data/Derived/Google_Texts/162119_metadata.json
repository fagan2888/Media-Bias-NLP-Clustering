He said a Gulf missile shield would also require construction of a warehouse with spare parts in the region, since it now takes one to two years to repair damaged missiles because they are all sent to the United States. Tronolone also called for more multilateral training. He said the focus was less on buying new weapons systems than taking steps to break down barriers and better coordinate among GCC countries. Last week's attack in Yemen that killed 50 soldiers from the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain would help cement ties among Gulf states that have not always seen eye to eye, he said.
