Are 3D movies a giant waste of money or does that one additional dimension make the viewing experience that much better? Whether you appreciate being immersed in a movie scene thanks to the wonders of technology or not, it appears adding another dimension to your viewing experience improves on our cognitive function.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at Vue Cinemas today experimenting on people\u2019s minds, looking to see whether the value of watching a film in 3D is greater than watching it in 2D,\u201d Professor Brendan Walker from Thrill Laboratory explained in the video. \u201cWe\u2019re using these brain monitoring headsets, which monitor 14 different parts of the brain. Each part of the brain tells us something different about the way we process what we\u2019re seeing on the screen.\u201d\n\nWalker and his colleagues discovered a 7.31 percent increase in engagement from 2D to 3D and that the improvement in reaction was five times higher. Cognitive processing also improved from 11 percent among participants who watched a 2D film to 23 percent among those who watched a 3D film. The research concluded that the human brain gets a boost when it\u2019s excited by a 3D movie, and the euphoria we experience while watching also stimulates us to think faster.\n\nWatch the video to learn more.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "watching, 3d, movies, can, improve, your, cognitive, ability, and, brain, function", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Watching a movie in 3D can improve cognitive engagement, reaction, and processing compared to 2D.", "title": "Watching 3D Movies Could Make You Smarter [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/watching-3d-movies-can-improve-your-cognitive-ability-and-brain-function-334512", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/21/watching-3d-movies-can-improve-your-cognitive-ability-and-brain-function.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Watching a movie in 3D can improve cognitive engagement, reaction, and processing compared to 2D.", "title": "Watching 3D Movies Could Make You Smarter [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/watching-3d-movies-can-improve-your-cognitive-ability-and-brain-function-334512", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/21/watching-3d-movies-can-improve-your-cognitive-ability-and-brain-function.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/21/watching-3d-movies-can-improve-your-cognitive-ability-and-brain-function.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-21T14:40:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-21T14:40:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Watching a movie in 3D can improve cognitive engagement, reaction, and processing compared to 2D."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd84\"", "article_summary": "Cognitive processing also improved from 11 percent among participants who watched a 2D film to 23 percent among those who watched a 3D film.\nAre 3D movies a giant waste of money or does that one additional dimension make the viewing experience that much better?\nFilm critics are torn when it comes to watching a movie in 2D or 3D.\nThe research concluded that the human brain gets a boost when it\u2019s excited by a 3D movie, and the euphoria we experience while watching also stimulates us to think faster.\nWhether you appreciate being immersed in a movie scene thanks to the wonders of technology or not, it appears adding another dimension to your viewing experience improves on our cognitive function."}
