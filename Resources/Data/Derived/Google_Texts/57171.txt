UnitedHealthcare, the second-largest insurer in Illinois, is expanding a key coordinated care initiative with Advocate Health Care to include more than 80,000 people.

The two entities last year launched a so-called accountable care organization covering about 5,500 patients with a Medicare Advantage plan through UnitedHealthcare.

On July 1, the ACO will expand to include more than 80,000 patients who have a UnitedHealthcare plan through their employers.

“From a national perspective, it is truly a high priority" for the insurer, said Colleen Van Ham, who oversees the Illinois and Indiana markets for UnitedHealthcare. “It helps us look at the triple aim, which is to improve quality while delivering it in a cost-effective manner and benefiting our customers at the end of the day.”

Health systems and insurers increasingly are teaming up to form ACOs, which have intensified under the federal health care overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare. In an ACO, physicians are given bonuses or can share in savings achieved for lowering costs while keeping patients healthy, such as reducing unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital stays.

Mike Englehart, president of Advocate Physician Partners, a care management collaboration with Advocate that has about 4,900 physicians, said the goal for the bigger ACO with UnitedHealthcare is to be at least as successful as the ACO Advocate launched with Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois about four years ago. That effort with the state's dominant insurer has achieved up to 2 percent savings each year, Englehart said.

“The one thing about UnitedHealthcare that we've come to greatly appreciate is they have outstanding data and analytics,” Englehart said.

UnitedHealthcare, which serves nearly 1.4 million Illinois residents, is a subsidiary of Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth Group. Downers Grove-based Advocate is the largest hospital network in the state, with 12 hospitals. Advocate could bulk up even more. The health system plans to merge with Evanston-based NorthShore University HealthSystem, a four-hospital network.
