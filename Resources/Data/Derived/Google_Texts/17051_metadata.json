Over the last few years, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations from satellite and aircraft platforms have been used to produce maps of subsidence with approximately centimeter-level accuracy.\n\nFor this study, JPL researchers analyzed satellite data from Japan\u2019s PALSAR (2006 to 2010); and Canada\u2019s Radarsat-2 (May 2014 to January 2015), and then produced subsidence maps for those periods. High-resolution InSAR data were also acquired along the California Aqueduct by NASA\u2019s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) (2013 to 2015) to identify and quantify new, highly localized areas of accelerated subsidence along the aqueduct that occurred in 2014.\n\nThe California Aqueduct is a system of canals, pipelines and tunnels that carries water collected from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and Northern and Central California valleys to Southern California.\n\nUsing multiple scenes acquired by these systems, the JPL researchers were able to produce time histories of subsidence at selected locations, as well as profiles showing how subsidence varies over space and time.\n\n\u201cThis study represents an unprecedented use of multiple satellites and aircraft to map subsidence in California and address a practical problem we\u2019re all facing,\u201d said JPL research scientist and report co-author Tom Farr. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to supply the California DWR with information they can use to better manage California\u2019s groundwater. It\u2019s like the old saying: \u2018you can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure\u2019.\u201d\n\nLand near Corcoran in the Tulare basin sank 13 inches (33 centimeters) in just eight months \u2014 about 1.6 inches (4 centimeters) per month. One area in the Sacramento Valley was sinking approximately half-an-inch (1.3 centimeters) per month, faster than previous measurements.\n\n\u201cSubsidence is directly impacting the California Aqueduct, and this NASA technology is ideal for identifying which areas are subsiding the most in order to focus monitoring and repair efforts,\u201d said JPL research scientist and study co-author Cathleen Jones. \u201cKnowledge is power, and in this case knowledge can save water and help the state better maintain this critical element of the state\u2019s water delivery system.\u201d UAVSAR flies on a C-20A research aircraft based at NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center facility in Palmdale, California.\n\nThe increased subsidence rates have the potential to damage local, state and federal infrastructure, including aqueducts, bridges, roads and flood control structures. Long-term subsidence has already destroyed thousands of public and private groundwater well casings in the San Joaquin Valley. Over time, subsidence can permanently reduce the underground aquifer\u2019s water storage capacity.\n\n\u201cGroundwater acts as a savings account to provide supplies during drought, but the NASA report shows the consequences of excessive withdrawals as we head into the fifth year of historic drought,\u201d Director Cowin said. \u201cWe will work together with counties, local water districts, and affected communities to identify ways to slow the rate of subsidence and protect vital infrastructure such as canals, pumping stations, bridges and wells.\u201d\n\nNASA will also continue its subsidence monitoring, using data from the European Space Agency\u2019s recently launched Sentinel-1 mission to cover a broader area and identify more vulnerable locations.\n\nDWR also completed a recent land survey along the Aqueduct \u2014 which found 70-plus miles (113-plus kilometers) in Fresno, Kings and Kern counties sank more than 1.25 feet (0.4 meters) in two years \u2014 and will now conduct a system-wide evaluation of subsidence along the California Aqueduct and the condition of State Water Project facilities.\n\nNASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation are jointly developing the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. Targeted to launch in 2020, NISAR will make global measurements of the causes and consequences of land surface changes.\n\nPotential areas of research include ecosystem disturbances, ice sheet collapse and natural hazards. The NISAR mission is optimized to measure subtle changes of Earth\u2019s surface associated with motions of the crust and ice surfaces. NISAR will improve our understanding of key impacts of climate change and advance our knowledge of natural hazards.\n\nThe report, Progress Report: Subsidence in the Central Valley, California, prepared for DWR by researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, is available at:\n\nhttp://water.ca.gov/groundwater/docs/NASA_REPORT.pdf (14 MB)\n\nThe full DWR news release is online at:\n\nhttp://www.water.ca.gov/news/newsreleases/2015/081915.pdf (173 kb)\n\nFor more information, visit:\n\nhttp://water.jpl.nasa.gov\n\nhttp://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/\n\nNASA uses the vantage point of space to increase our understanding of our home planet, improve lives and safeguard our future.
