It\u2019s the same kind of wedge that\u2019s been driven particularly in the black community in this country for hundreds of years.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack during the time of slavery, they\u2019d tell the people in the house, you\u2019re better than the ones in the yard,\u201d he told an audience of predominantly black students at South Carolina State University. \u201cIf they could keep them divided and at each other\u2019s throats, you would never have to worry about the strength of that community overcoming the masters. That very same thing is going on today.\u201d\n\nCarson said the goal of those criticizing him is to prevent \u201cblack people who are conservatives, liberals, working together to solve the problems.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s comments came a day after arguing during a televised CNN Town Hall that attempts to use big government programs to help the poor \u2013FDR\u2019s New Deal and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs -- have largely failed. He cites increased poverty, incarceration and stagnant wages among his evidence.\n\nThey also came after he foreshadowed a concerted effort to win over black voters here and in other southern states. Though African Americans make up a small portion of the Republican electorate, the state has an open primary \u2013 and Carson told reporters Wednesday he\u2019s hopeful to win votes form black Democrats. The strategy may also come into play should he remain in the race through March 1, when a slew of southern states with large black populations go to the polls.\n\nCarson didn\u2019t appear to find much refuge in the crowd. A questioner who pleaded with Carson to stop attacking President Barack Obama drew the loudest applause of the event \u2013 though Carson drew applause too when he answered that he doesn\u2019t attack Obama or his Republican rivals.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna get me engaged in a lot of back and forth fisticuffs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same questioner also criticized Carson for calling Obamacare \u201cworse than slavery.\u201d Carson quickly rejected the comment, noting that he had actually called Obamacare \u201cthe worst thing since slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cIt fundamentally changes the relationship between the people and the government, and most people didn\u2019t notice that had happened.\u201d\n\nCarson trails most national polls and surveys of South Carolina, though he\u2019s argued that a top-three finish in the six-man field could reset his chances.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says the goal of those criticizing him is to prevent \u201cblack people who are conservatives, liberals, working together to solve the problems.\u201d", "title": "Carson: Campaign attacks resemble efforts to divide black slaves", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/south-carolina-primary-2016-live-updates-and-results/2016/02/ben-carson-campaign-attacks-219438", "image": "http://static.politico.com/a5/97/c05bb68542b482a028784648829d/160218-ben-carson-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He says the goal of those criticizing him is to prevent \u201cblack people who are conservatives, liberals, working together to solve the problems.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Email Sign UpTweets from https://twitter.com/politico/lists/team-politicoBen Carson said the goal of those criticizing him is to prevent \u201cblack people who are conservatives, liberals, working together to solve the problems.\u201d | AP Photo Carson: Campaign attacks resemble efforts to divide black slavesORANGEBURG, S.C. -- Ben Carson stepped onto a historically black college campus here and argued that the attacks his campaign faces resemble an effort to divide slaves.\nThey also came after he foreshadowed a concerted effort to win over black voters here and in other southern states.\nThe strategy may also come into play should he remain in the race through March 1, when a slew of southern states with large black populations go to the polls.\nThough African Americans make up a small portion of the Republican electorate, the state has an open primary \u2013 and Carson told reporters Wednesday he\u2019s hopeful to win votes form black Democrats.\nThe same questioner also criticized Carson for calling Obamacare \u201cworse than slavery.\u201d Carson quickly rejected the comment, noting that he had actually called Obamacare \u201cthe worst thing since slavery.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference,\u201d he said."}
