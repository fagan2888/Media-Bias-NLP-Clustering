Al Franken, Minnesota Democrat, defended his record during a debate with Republican Mike McFadden on Wednesday morning and pushed back against accusations he\u2019s \u201cthe most partisan senator\u201d in Washington.\n\nThe two men also clashed on U.S. foreign policy, Obamacare, economic growth and a host of other issues during a debate in Duluth, the first in a series of three debates between now and the Nov. 4 election. Recent polling shows Mr. Franken, a first-term senator and former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer, with a lead of about 9 percentage points.\n\nBut Mr. McFadden, a businessman, came out swinging Wednesday in an attempt to begin closing that gap during the home stretch of the campaign. He charged Mr. Franken lacks the independent streak that the people of Minnesota want in their U.S. senator.\n\n\u201cHe is the most partisan senator in the Democratic party. \u2026 He is No. 1 in the Democratic party. He is in a universe of one. He is part of problem, not part of the solution,\u201d Mr. McFadden said, citing congressional voting statistics showing Mr. Franken has voted in line with President Obama\u2019s position 97 percent time, more than any other Democrat in the Senate.\n\nMr. Franken fired back that it\u2019s easy to criticize his votes on foreign policy, health care, education and other issues when you\u2019re watching from the sidelines. He also said some of his votes have been characterized out of context, such as the claim he voted in favor of raising taxes when he merely wanted to end taxpayer subsidies to oil-and-gas companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to score political points from the bleachers,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThis is a serious job. You\u2019ve got to make real choices in real time.\u201d\n\nNor surprisingly, the two men disagreed on whether Obamacare should be repealed. Mr. McFadden said the law, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, should be scrapped.\n\nMr. Franken, like other Democrats, said such a move would undo years of progress by once again allowing, for example, insurance companies to deny coverage because of preexisting conditions.\n\nBut the candidates had perhaps their sharpest exchange on foreign policy matters, with Mr. McFadden linking Mr. Franken to the White House and its \u201ccomplete lack of foreign policy vision.\u201d\n\nMr. McFadden said he supports Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to bomb Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria and arm moderate Syrian rebels but believes those decisions should have been made long ago.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how frustrated I am by the complete lack of a foreign policy vision from this president and Al Franken,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is a more dangerous place today because we have not led.\u201d\n\nIn response, Mr. Franken struck a hawkish note, echoing the president\u2019s position that the Islamic State must be destroyed.\n\n\u201cThey pose a threat not just to the region but to us. I voted to train and equip the moderate rebels in Syria. I support the bombing in Syria. [The Islamic State] doesn\u2019t observe the border between Iraq and Syria. We shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Al Franken, Mike Mcfadden", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/1/franken-mcfadden-clash-health-care-foreign-policy/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/30/minnesota-senatejpeg-0214b.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Sen.
