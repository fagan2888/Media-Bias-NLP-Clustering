EDITOR: Daily Tribune Media recently wrote in an editorial that voters should throw negative mailers in the trash. I agree. Maybe Rep. Scott Krug doesn't realize it, but someone called the Jobs First Coalition Inc. is sending mailers that have nothing to do with jobs. They say that Dana Duncan is evil for doing his job â€” defending his client as an attorney. It sounds in the mailer like he didn't even win the case, but doing his job is what Krug hasn't done.

The mailer also claims that property taxes went up 38 percent during Duncan's tenure on the Port Edwards School Board. Krug was also the representative for Port Edwards during this time. What did he do about it? Wisconsin Rapids property taxes also went up due to a re-evaluation of property. Gov. Scott Walker has limited how much property taxes can go up.

I really like the black and red color scheme on the mailers. Makes them look more evil. Send them to the trash!
