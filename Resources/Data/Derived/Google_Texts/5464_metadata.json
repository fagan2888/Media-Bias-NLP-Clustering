(AP) \u2014 This City by the Sea is riding a wave of excitement harkening to its heyday as an international sailing mecca as it hosts this year\u2019s only North American stopover on the Volvo Ocean Race.\n\nThe sailors from the six teams arrived this week in Newport. The teams departed Oct. 11 from Alicante, Spain, on the 45,000-mile race that will conclude in June in Gothenburg, Sweden. Newport\u2019s race village will stay open through May 17, when the sailors begin racing toward Lisbon, Portugal. A seventh team was forced to suspend racing after its boat smashed into an Indian Ocean reef in November.\n\nNewport used its rich sailing history to help beat out Baltimore, Maryland, a much bigger city that has hosted once before, for the chance to host \u2014 and to bring in millions from visitors. The area\u2019s last major sailing event \u2014 America\u2019s Cup World Series in 2012 \u2014 drew 65,000 people and generated about $50 million.\n\nVolvo Ocean Race CEO Knut Frostad said Newport was chosen because of its history, and also because its residents and visitors are passionate about sailing.\n\n\u201cThe sailors love it,\u201d Frostad said. \u201cThey love coming to places where people love what they\u2019re doing and are following the sport.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1639, Newport has always relied on the sea for commerce, transportation and defense. Recreational sailing came later, in 1844, when the New York Yacht Club first cruised to Newport and fell in love with the city\u2019s deep waters and dependable winds. The club soon created an outpost in Newport.\n\nBert Lippincott, reference librarian for the Newport Historical Society, said this was the \u201cbirth of American yachting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world,\u201d Lippincott said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d\n\nThe yacht club chose Newport in 1930 to host the America\u2019s Cup match race. The international event draws tourists from around the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newport history, beauty propel sailors in global ocean race", "author": "Amy Anthony", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Newport history, beauty propel sailors in global ocean race", "title": "Newport history, beauty propel sailors in global ocean race", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/newport_history_beauty_propel_sailors_in_global_ocean_race/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/sailing-newport.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newport history, beauty propel sailors in global ocean race", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/sailing-newport.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Newport history, beauty propel sailors in global ocean race", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Newport history, beauty propel sailors in global ocean race", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it.\u201dThe yacht club chose Newport in 1930 to host the America\u2019s Cup match race.\nVolvo Ocean Race CEO Knut Frostad said Newport was chosen because of its history, and also because its residents and visitors are passionate about sailing.\n\u201cThe sailors love it,\u201d Frostad said.\nNewport\u2019s race village will stay open through May 17, when the sailors begin racing toward Lisbon, Portugal.\nThe teams departed Oct. 11 from Alicante, Spain, on the 45,000-mile race that will conclude in June in Gothenburg, Sweden."}
