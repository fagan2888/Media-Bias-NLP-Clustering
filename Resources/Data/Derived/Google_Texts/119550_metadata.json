Mike Capko of Conshohocken, Penn. barehanded a foul ball during the fourth inning of the Phillies game \u2014 with a ticket in one hand, and his 7 1/2-month-old son strapped to his chest.\n\nAfter cheers had finally died down, a dazzled Capko told reporters that it was his son\u2019s first game. \u201cIt was a natural reaction,\u201d Capko said. \u201cIt was great, great.\u201d\n\nIn an even weirder twist of fate, the ball Capko caught was off the bat of the Mets\u2019 Daniel Murphy. That\u2019s the Mets second baseman who was blasted last year for taking paternity leave as his wife delivered their first child. Yes, in the year 2014 the public was still having a hard time fathoming the idea of a man staying home with his child.\n\n\u201cI can only speak to our experience and it felt, for us, like the right decision to make was for me to stay a little bit longer,\u201d Capko said in an interview with ESPN. \u201cI think I had paternity leave until Friday. She was the one who was rather insistent. She wanted me to come back. I wanted to, too, but the pull of her and your son makes you want to stay with them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a weird twist of fate, it was Daniel Murphy's ball, the baseman blasted last year for taking paternity leave VIDEO", "title": "The world\u2019s coolest dad just barehanded a foul ball with a baby strapped to his chest", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a weird twist of fate, it was Daniel Murphy's ball, the baseman blasted last year for taking paternity leave VIDEO", "title": "The world\u2019s coolest dad just barehanded a foul ball with a baby strapped to his chest", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/11/heres_a_dad_barehanding_a_foul_ball_with_a_newborn_strapped_to_his_chest/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-11-at-10.04.51-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a weird twist of fate, it was Daniel Murphy's ball, the baseman blasted last year for taking paternity leave VIDEO", "title": "The world\u2019s coolest dad just barehanded a foul ball with a baby strapped to his chest", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-11-at-10.04.51-AM.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Colin Gorenstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Baseball, Sports, Video, Weird news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "barehanded a foul ball during the fourth inning of the Phillies game \u2014 with a ticket in one hand, and his 7 1/2-month-old son strapped to his chest.\n\u201cIt was great, great.\u201dIn an even weirder twist of fate, the ball Capko caught was off the bat of the Mets\u2019 Daniel Murphy.\nThat\u2019s the Mets second baseman who was blasted last year for taking paternity leave as his wife delivered their first child.\n\u201cI think I had paternity leave until Friday.\nI wanted to, too, but the pull of her and your son makes you want to stay with them.\u201d"}
