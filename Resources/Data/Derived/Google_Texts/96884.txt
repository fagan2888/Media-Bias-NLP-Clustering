Hundreds gathered at Florida Sports Park in Naples on Saturday to celebrate the life of Cecil Riner.

Riner and his wife Jessica were on their way to a Christmas party last weekend when they were involved in a crash with a driver troopers said was drunk.

Cecil, 33, was killed.

On Saturday, he was remembered as someone who worked hard and cared a lot for those around him.

"I feel like I'm blessed that I'm here after seeing the car, sitting in it. I honestly don't know how either one of us survived. I'm just amazed," Jessica said.

"Sadly I feel like he took my whole heart with him when he left, and I feel so empty and so broken. But I know all these guys here and my boys will get me through it."

Cecil leaves behind four sons.

The hurt is fresh with his family and coworkers, still coming to terms with what happened.

"Angry. I'm angry that someone would make such a poor decision," said Steven DeRoso, who works at Lowe's in East Naples, where Cecil was a manager.

Friends said accidents like the one that took Cecil's life don't need to happen.

"Call somebody, ask a stranger where you're at. I would never wish this pain on anybody. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through and I don't wish it on anybody," said Jason Lacaz, Cecil's best friend.

But through the pain and tears were smiles as the man called "Big Thunder" was remembered, shoes too big to fill.

Jessica said she's thankful for the community support. A GoFundMe account set up hours after the crash has raised more than $55,000 for the family.

The man troopers said is responsible for the crash, Rene Miles, remains jailed in Collier County.
