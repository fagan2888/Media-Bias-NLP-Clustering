Alternative methods \u2013 from supplements to acupuncture \u2013 are used in preventive care as well as the treatment of chronic and acute conditions, but they often aren\u2019t covered by health insurance.\n\nThere isn\u2019t one reason why people choose alternative approaches over traditional medicine. One study published in Social Science & Medicine found that patients who choose a homeopath over a general practitioner are likely to do so because of \u201cdisenchantment with, and bad experiences of, traditional medical practitioners.\u201d Another in the Journal of the Medical Association suggested that people were motivated more by personal values, beliefs and philosophical attitudes about health.\n\nRegardless of these findings, one thing is clear: Americans aren\u2019t flocking to alternative medicine to save money.\n\nThe Cost of Alternative Medicine\n\nAmericans spent more than $33.9 billion out of pocket on alternative and complementary medicine in 2007, the latest year for which comprehensive federal data are available. That amount includes visits to providers such as chiropractors and massage therapists, as well as products like supplements. While alternative medicine accounts for only about 1.5 percent of total health care spending in the U.S., it comprises 11.2 percent of total out-of-pocket health care spending, according to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey.\n\nThere's a perception is that alternative medicine is growing in popularity, with numerous websites dedicated to \u201cnatural health\u201d and home remedies. But the research disputes this. According to an analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2002 to 2008, the use of alternative medicine and spending on these services plateaued \u2013 something blamed in part on the higher proportion of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAlternative Medicine and Insurance Coverage\n\nWhen considering reimbursement, the Affordable Care Act mandates that insurers not discriminate against licensed health care providers, including those who practice alternative medicine, such as naturopaths, massage therapists and acupuncturists. But that isn\u2019t the same as requiring coverage.\n\nHealth insurers can limit coverage they deem experimental or not medically necessary, and they often do. Aetna, for example, says it considers alternative interventions medically necessary only \u201cif they are supported by adequate evidence of safety and effectiveness in the peer-reviewed published medical literature.\u201d\n\nSo while such things as acupuncture, biofeedback, chiropractic care and electronic stimulation may be covered under their policies, music therapy, aromatherapy, therapeutic touch massage and a long list of other interventions are not.\n\nEven when services are covered by an insurance plan, the insurer may require a statement of medical necessity or prescription from a primary care doctor. The coverage may also provided limited visits or cover only some of the services the provider offers.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"HDL cholesterol, or \u201cgood cholesterol,\u201d can lower your risk of heart attack and stroke.
