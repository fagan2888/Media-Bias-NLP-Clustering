If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.\u201d \u2013 Ronald Reagan\n\nThe World Wide Web has been an American success story, creating a tremendous amount of commerce, convenience, egalitarian education and serving as a monument to free speech. The Obama administration stood by and watched this success for as long as it could, and now has found a way to control it.\n\nMost Americans do not know what \u201cnet neutrality\u201d is. Many think it is what Bruce Jenner has decided to go through. But it is not.\n\nNet Neutrality is a complex subject, best explained as follows: The Internet was going along swimmingly. It was an example of free enterprise and free speech working well together for the benefit of the consumer. Then Washington realized it could, via the Federal Communication Commission (loaded with Obama appointees), regulate it. It was a takeover of a private sector success, just like the usurpation of health care.\n\nEven Bill Clinton came out against a similar White House-backed effort to turn over U.S. control of the Internet to an \u201cInternational Coalition,\u201d marking one of the few times Bill Clinton ever rejected an exotic body.\n\nThe premise of net neutrality is that Internet service providers, who had spent billions laying fiber-optic cable, might charge some customers more than others for higher-speed Internet service \u2013 much the same way Obamacare charges more for a Gold healthcare plan than for a Bronze one. It is how the market prices everything. There is a different price for a Chevy Tahoe than a Chevy Aveo.\n\nThe way politicians get a cut of a business is to regulate it. The cable companies are among the largest donors to lobbyists, who give the money to elected officials. Comcast is right behind Northrop Grumman (a defense contractor also inextricably in bed with Washington) in spending the most on lobbying: $18 million.\n\nOther cable companies also spend lots of money on politicians who \u201cregulate\u201d them. Why do people in 96 percent of the country have two or fewer cable companies from which to choose? Why is your cable bill so high and service so bad? Answer: regulation \u2013 the opposite of free-market competition.\n\nCable companies intentionally avoid each other\u2019s territory, like the Mafia or drug dealers. Any cable turf wars would benefit consumers in the form of better service and lower prices, but cable companies want no part of that.\n\n\u201cNet neutrality\u201d was never really debated because it was a planned takeover. If Washington bureaucrats in the FCC, FTC or whatever (I get my incompetent federal agencies confused) wanted to spend more time thinking about this, the outcome would be no different; it would still be them doing the thinking. They just didn\u2019t want us thinking about it.\n\nSo it was slipped by us. FCC votes fell along party lines. Since more Americans can name three Kardashian sisters than three Supreme Court justices, America, predictably, fell asleep on this one. When told what to think, even Joe Biden said he had looked at the regulation and was for it -- this from a guy who looks like he still has dial-up Internet.\n\nI kid Joe Biden. He is tech-savvy; you can follow him on Twitter and the Federal Sex Offender Groper\u2019s Registry.\n\nThe government used an interpretation of the Communications Act of 1934 to take over this new and vibrant, 21st century business. Now the FCC has a \u201cgeneral conduct\u201d or \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision in the regulation that allows the FCC to assert its authority over anything on the Internet. In the bureaucratic equivalent of an executive action, the FCC voted to have the FCC control everything.\n\nObama has been accused of steamrolling the FCC to make this decision. As with Obamacare, we got to \u201csee what was in the bill, once they passed the bill.\u201d You knew it was going to be another Obama administration lie when the president went out and promoted net neutrality. In selling it, Obama said that, if you like your porn site, you can keep your porn site. Period.\n\nIn twisting the famous adage, Washington thinks, \u201cIf it is not broken, then we should fix it,\u201d and has gotten its tentacles around another thriving U.S. enterprise. They will not make it better.\n\nRon Hart, a libertarian syndicated op-ed humorist, award-winning author and TV/radio commentator can be reached at Ron@RonaldHart.com or visit www.RonaldHart.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: A free Internet too much for government to resist | cable, fcc, internet, obama, neutrality, companies, bill, free, service, washington", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "RON HART", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "\u201cGovernment\u2019s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it.
