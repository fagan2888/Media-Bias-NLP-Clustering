WOODLAND PARK — Alexandra “Ali” Ponte, 14, who had been missing since Sept. 4, was found by the Woodland Park Police Department at 9 p.m. Saturday.

‘She is alive and well,” the police said in a written statement. “We would like to thank the community for all their help and support.”

The last time her mother, Chrissy Duis, saw her, Ali was in her Woodland Park home around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 4.

They had argued over a Facebook post, and Ali had gone to her room to cool off. Duis did not realize she was gone until nearly two hours later.

Woodland Park police and the FBI had been searching for the teen. Further details about Ali’s condition and whereabouts were not available from the Woodland Park police.

On a Facebook page dedicated to finding Ali, one of the page administrators posted Sunday night, “Thank you for asking about Ali possibly being found. We are aware of the news releasing this information.

“We are waiting to allow Chrissy the joy of making the official post, when it is official. We Love you all. … and please, respect the family’s privacy at this time.”
