The Supreme Court could announce as early as Friday whether it will be taking up President Obama’s appeal to save his executive action on immigration, according to a Reuters report.

The news service reported early Friday that the nine Supreme Court justices were set to meet privately on whether to hear the White House appeal to a pair of lower court rulings that found invalid Obama’s move to shield 4 million immigrants from deportation.

Declining to hear the case would effectively kill the program, whereas taking it up would immediately make it one of the most-watched cases of the court’s current term.

Twenty-six GOP-led states sued to stop Obama’s 2014 executive action, which bypassed Congress to prevent the deportation of 4 million immigrations with no criminal records and children who are U.S. citizens.

A Texas court and the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Obama had exceeded his authority with the move.

The court’s decision could come as soon as Friday afternoon.
