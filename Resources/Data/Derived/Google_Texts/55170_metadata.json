On the third bunt, Cliff Pennington executed perfectly to score Jarrod Saltalamacchia from third. Meanwhile, charging first baseman Wilin Rosario fielded the bunt, and then whirled, jumped and inexplicably threw the ball to a vacant first base, allowing two more runs to score.\n\nAnd so, the Rockies lost, 7-3.\n\nThe current 10-game road trip, one that could determine the makeup of the team as the July 31 trading deadline creeps closer, is turning out to be a major bust. With one game remaining on the trip, Colorado is 2-7.\n\nRosario, the former catcher who is still learning the nuances of playing first base, said he would field a similar bunt differently the next time. After the game, he consulted with shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and second baseman DJ LeMahieu about the play.\n\n\u201cThey said it\u2019s a tough play, but they recommended to me: \u2018Don\u2019t jump and throw,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018If I don\u2019t have a play at home plate, make sure and look to first before I throw the ball.\u2019 That\u2019s what I will do next time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rare for a team to bunt three times in a row. And in the ninth inning of Friday night\u2019s game, Arizona\u2019s A.J. Pollock dropped a bunt single between the mound and third base. But Rockies manager Walt Weiss dismissed the idea that opponents are taking advantage of flaws in the Rockies\u2019 defensive set up or fielding skills.\n\n\u201cNobody is seeing anything,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t defend the bunt the last couple of nights. Our guys know how to defend bunts. We just didn\u2019t do it the last couple of nights, it\u2019s nothing more than that.\u201d\n\nFor the fourth consecutive game, the Rockies\u2019 offense produce few fireworks and their starting pitching was hardly star-spangled.\n\nThe Rockies loaded the bases with one out in the eighth and were searching for timely hit. Though Rosario drove in a run with a groundout, the mini-rally ended when Drew Stubbs chopped out to short.\n\n\u201cLosing in general is just bad, no matter if we get out-pitched, out-hit or out-executed. There is not much more we can say,\u201d third baseman Nolan Arenado said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got that big lately and obviously it\u2019s been hurting us.\u201d\n\nThe game turned in the fourth when Pollock hit a two-run double down the left-field line off Colorado starter David Hale, scoring Chris Ownings and Nick Ahmed.\n\nIn the first inning, the Diamondbacks put Hale in an early 2-0 hole, and he went on to pitch an uneven five innings: Four runs (three earned) on five hits. With their offense in a mid-summer hibernation, the Rockies needed an ace-like performance, but Hale couldn\u2019t deliver.\n\n\u201cIt was rough early with David, but he settled in and did just fine. He kept us in position,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nHale (2-4, 5.89 ERA) has not won since June 8 vs. St. Louis, a string of fiive consecutive starts.\n\n\u201cI was a little wild in the first inning, but I settled in after that,\u201d Hale said. \u201cIf that (double) by Pollock doesn\u2019t sink down the line it\u2019s a different game. The pitch was right where I wanted it, and I wanted him to hit it to the left side, but he found a hole.\u201d\n\nOne-time Arizona ace Patrick Corbin, coming back from Tommy John surgery and making his first big-league start since Sept. 27, 2013, was hardly dominant, but he was effective enough. The left-hander departed in the fifth with a 4-2 lead, having given up eight hits. He didn\u2019t issue a walk and struck out three.\n\nArizona staked that 2-0 lead in the first by loading the base on an error by Arenado and consecutive walks off of by Hale by David Peralta and Paul Goldschmidt. Ysmany Thomas drove in the first run with a groundout, and Jake Lamb followed with a bloop RBI single.\n\nColorado tied the game, 2-2, in the third on a run-scoring double by Charlie Blackmon, followed by an RBI single by LeMahieu.\n\nWith a first-inning double, Tulowitzki extended his hitting streak to 17 games and has reached base in 32 consecutive games. Both marks are career highs, and also are the longest active streaks in the majors.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Diamondbacks beat Rockies 7-3 due to poor 8th inning", "title": "Diamondbacks beat Rockies 7-3 due to poor 8th inning", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/04/diamondbacks-beat-rockies-7-3-due-to-poor-8th-inning/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704__tulowitzkip1.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704__tulowitzkip1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T23:52:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T16:22:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But Rockies manager Walt Weiss dismissed the idea that opponents are taking advantage of flaws in the Rockies\u2019 defensive set up or fielding skills.\nPHOENIX \u2014 The Rockies donned red-white-and-blue ballcaps Saturday night at Chase Field, but their Fourth of July was a big dud.\nWith a first-inning double, Tulowitzki extended his hitting streak to 17 games and has reached base in 32 consecutive games.\nWe just didn\u2019t do it the last couple of nights, it\u2019s nothing more than that.\u201dFor the fourth consecutive game, the Rockies\u2019 offense produce few fireworks and their starting pitching was hardly star-spangled.\nWith their offense in a mid-summer hibernation, the Rockies needed an ace-like performance, but Hale couldn\u2019t deliver."}
