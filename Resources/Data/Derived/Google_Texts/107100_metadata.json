R. Martin received three separate challenges for the ALS ice bucket challenge, so he stepped up in what he calls a triple play. Martin took two buckets of ice to the head, followed by a plunge into a swimming pool, interspersing the entire event with lines from the Game of Thrones books and TV series.\n\n\u201cWinter is coming\u201d is the family motto of House Stark, from which family come many of the main characters in Game of Thrones, and it\u2019s an apt way to open a challenge that involves being deluged with ice water. Martin prepares himself with these words as he takes the plunge:\n\nHe also closes with \u201cwhat is dead may never die,\u201d words that are said in Game of Thrones to honor the Drowned God worshiped by the citizens of the Iron Islands.\n\nThe Game of Thrones author takes some flak in the Youtube comments and on Twitter about the quality of the video, and more importantly, about the delay in getting the rest of the books out, but we don\u2019t hear the ALS Association complaining. Donations with grainy vertical videos fund as much research as hi-def ones.\n\nThe funding is going well, too, it seems: an ALS press release today announced that the foundation has received over $62 million in donations, compared to closer to $2 million in the same period last year. They also note that 1.2 million new donors have contributed. That\u2019s a lot of ice water.\n\nAs for the other complaints, Salon reported last month that George R. R. Martin is actually stepping back from his work on the HBO Game of Thrones television series for the upcoming season to focus on finishing the next book instead.\n\nFans hope fervently that this means the sixth book in the series (side note: the book series is A Song of Ice and Fire, with A Game of Thrones as the first book while the entire television series is titled A Game of Thrones) will be out sooner rather than later.\n\nAs for the show, there\u2019s not so much hurry, since the recently-ended fourth season was still drawing on material from the third book (Slate has an awesome infographic that details which books and chapters each season and even episode draws on), but those who are readers of the books are anxious for the next one.\n\nReader beware, though: As Inquisitr recently reported, the Game of Thrones creator has hinted at a much-increased body count in the upcoming books.\n\n[Photo: Twitter]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Game of Thrones author took three ice bucket challenges at once, offering tribute to Westeros as he went.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Game of Thrones author took three ice bucket challenges at once, offering tribute to Westeros as he went.", "title": "Winter Is Coming: Game Of Thrones Author Takes \u2018Triple Play\u2019 ALS Ice Bucket Challenge", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1429055/winter-is-coming-game-of-thrones-author-takes-triple-play-als-ice-bucket-challenge/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/game-of-thrones-author-ice-bucket-challenge.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-23T20:18:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-23T21:01:23+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/game-of-thrones-author-ice-bucket-challenge.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-08-23T20:18:04+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "als ice bucket,game of thrones,george r. r. martin,ice bucket challenge,celebrity news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/game-of-thrones-author-ice-bucket-challenge.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Game of Thrones author took three ice bucket challenges at once, offering tribute to Westeros as he went."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2352\"", "article_summary": "Game of Thrones author George R.
