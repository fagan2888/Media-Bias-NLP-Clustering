For many, it is the primary source of health care.\n\nBut it is only the beginning.\n\nThe health disparities between urban Indians and the general population are little-known outside the Native American community.\n\nThey are shocking.\n\nIn Washington state, American Indian and Alaska Native infants are nearly twice as likely to die as other infants. American Indians and Alaska Natives generally face higher and earlier mortality rates for chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nHealth disparities are greater because of multiple socio-economic indicators: Urban Indians in cities like Seattle have some of the highest poverty rates and lowest rates of employment and education.\n\nThere are also disparities in federal funding. The federal government funds the Indian Health Service, which in turn supports the Seattle Indian Health Board. Urban Indians receive just 1 percent of all federal dollars set aside for Indian health \u2014 even though 71 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives live in metropolitan areas.\n\nWith its roots in the Red Power Movement, the Native-led Seattle Indian Health Board is a nationally accredited community health center.\n\nFrom its beginning in 1970, the Health Board\u2019s model of care for our Native families has been based on the concept of the Native home. We provide or refer clients to medical, dental or social services. Urban Indian clinics across the U.S. have based their services on this model.\n\nThis model of a homebase for all health care is mirrored in how the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, aims to improve health services.\n\nIn many ways, the country is following in the footsteps that Native health-care organizations have already walked. Our history gives us insight that might be valuable with medical providers transitioning to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will also affect the urban Indian community in unanticipated ways. The act increases options for where urban Indians in Seattle can obtain health care. What is potentially lost in this opportunity is the Native cultural continuity that has been essential to the work of the Health Board for 43 years.\n\nWe have studied the reasons why urban Indians don\u2019t seek out medical care. Data shows that our community experiences more than economic barriers to medical care. It shows that urban Indians distrust providers, which we attribute to a lack of Native cultural competency.\n\nThis is why we sought the City Council\u2019s approval for the Health Board to assume payments and ownership of the Leschi Center. In the coming months, the Health Board will commence the extensive repair of longstanding water damage and the remodel to develop a 21st century Native health care center.\n\nAt the renovated Leschi Center, the Health Board will be better able to expand our services for a growing urban Indian community.\n\nIn the long run, the health disparities in Seattle\u2019s urban Indian community will not change without the concerted attention of a broad range of partners working with the Seattle Indian Health Board, including federal, state, local governments, tribal governments and urban Indian organizations.\n\nThe future health of our urban Indian people depends upon it.\n\nPolly Olsen, a member of the Yakama Nation, is president of the Seattle Indian Health Board and community relations director for the Indigenous Wellness Research Institute at the University of Washington.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IN December, the Seattle City Council voted to make a difference in the lives of our city&rsquo;s urban Indians.
