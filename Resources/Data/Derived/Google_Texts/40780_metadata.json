Additionally, she suggested bolstering mental health treatment facilities and personnel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to treat mental health the same as we treat all health problems,\u201d Clinton said at the rally.\n\nFor some members of the crowd, the rally did not appear representative of the Oakland community\u2019s diversity. Oakland resident Frank Rodriguez was particularly critical of the press.\n\n\u201cThe entire thing is a photo-op,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201c(Clinton) is so out of touch with my community.\u201d\n\nProgressive youth may favor Sanders over Clinton because Clinton seems more old-fashioned in comparison, according to Lawrence Rosenthal, chair and lead researcher of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies. Clinton does, however, know how to reach out to a wide range of people, including youths, in part thanks to her advisers, Rosenthal noted.\n\nAt the rally, Clinton also condemned Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s approach to immigration, plans to defund Planned Parenthood and impolitic approach to discussing nuclear deals with foreign leaders.\n\nSeveral political figures made appearances at the event in order to introduce Clinton \u2014 including California State Assemblymember Rob Bonta, D-Oakland; Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf; and U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California.\n\nCampus junior Melissa Marquette, who was also present at the rally, said she favored Clinton over other candidates because of Clinton\u2019s stance on reproductive rights and equal pay for all genders and the symbolism of having a woman heading the White House.\n\n\u201cHillary\u2019s fighting for all of us,\u201d said James Chang, elected commissioner on the Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board. \u201cI think she\u2019s trying to bring Americans together \u2026 (and to) make America affordable for everybody.\u201d\n\nBesides Clinton supporters, Sanders supporters were also present, some intermittently countering cheers for Clinton with chants for Sanders.\n\nAlthough Clinton disagreed with Sanders\u2019 demand for free universal college education, she proposed \u201cdebt-free tuition\u201d and contingency repayment programs, in which a set portion of graduates\u2019 paychecks would go to paying for their tuition.\n\nThough she prefers Sanders, Whitney Dwyer, Oakland resident and teacher at the adjacent MetWest High School, came to the event because she wanted to hear what Clinton had to say and to witness a historical moment in Oakland.\n\nContact Anna Dell\u2019Amico at [email protected] and follow her on Twitter at @adellamico_dc.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Californian", "description": "Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign made its way to an Oakland elementary school gymnasium Friday, where Clinton spoke at a rally about topics ranging from the gender pay gap to college tuition.Read More\u2026", "title": "Hillary Clinton speaks to crowd at campaign rally in Oakland | The Daily Californian", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2016/05/HllaryRally_SuhaunaHussain.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-08T23:36:24-07:00", "url": "http://www.dailycal.org/2016/05/08/hillary-clinton-speaks-crowd-campaign-rally-oakland/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailycal", "section": "City", "tag": "Whitney Dwyer", "published_time": "2016-05-08T21:25:46-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-08T23:36:24-07:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 877855486}, "twitter": {"description": "Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign made its way to an Oakland elementary school gymnasium Friday, where Clinton spoke at a rally about topics ranging from the gender pay gap to college tuition.Read More\u2026", "creator": "@Adellamico_dc", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2016/05/HllaryRally_SuhaunaHussain.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton speaks to crowd at campaign rally in Oakland | The Daily Californian", "site": "@dailycal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "At the rally, Clinton also condemned Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s approach to immigration, plans to defund Planned Parenthood and impolitic approach to discussing nuclear deals with foreign leaders.\nPresidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign made its way to an Oakland elementary school gymnasium Friday, where Clinton spoke at a rally about topics ranging from the gender pay gap to college tuition.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to treat mental health the same as we treat all health problems,\u201d Clinton said at the rally.\nFor some members of the crowd, the rally did not appear representative of the Oakland community\u2019s diversity.\nSeveral political figures made appearances at the event in order to introduce Clinton \u2014 including California State Assemblymember Rob Bonta, D-Oakland; Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf; and U.S. Sen.
