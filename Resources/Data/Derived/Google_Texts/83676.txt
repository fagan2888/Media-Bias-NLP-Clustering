A New Brunswick man was arrested Monday night for allegedly trying to deliver cocaine to a borough resident.

Tomas Aguilar-Torres, 28, was arrested and charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine, according to Hunterdon County Prosecutor Anthony P. Kearns III.

"The defendant was arrested by members of the Hunterdon County SWAT Team on Spring Street in Flemington Borough when he attempted to deliver the cocaine," Kearns said.

According to Kearns, Aguilar-Torres was dropped off by two men, who fled the area after abandoning their car in a driveway off William Street in Flemington.

SWAT members and investigating officers, along with a Readington Police K-9 unit, searched but were unable to locate the two men. The dog lost the scent east of Route 31 in Raritan Township. The men were tracked outside of Hunterdon County, Kearns said.

The Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office Gangs, Guns and Narcotics Task Force, Hunterdon County SWAT Team and police from Flemington Borough, Raritan Township and the Readington Township Police K-9 Unit were involved in the operation.

Kearns said the street value of the cocaine was $1,400.

Bail for Aguilar-Torres was set at $100,000 by Superior Court Judge Matthew Curry. Aguilar-Torres is being held at the Hunterdon County Jail.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with additional information is asked to contact the Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office at 908-788-1129.
