But being active on social media doesn\u2019t have to hurt your chances of getting that perfect job. In many cases, what you post on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter can actually help you, according to employers surveyed by CareerBuilder.\n\nWhile 51 percent of employers who research job candidates on social media say their searches have led them to not hire a candidate due to indecent content, 33 percent also say that they\u2019ve found content that made them more likely to hire a candidate, according to the survey.\n\nRelated: You\u2019ve Quit Your Job. Here\u2019s What to Do Next\n\nThe share of employers going so far as to say that content they found on social media actually directly led them to hire a candidate went up to 23 percent in this year\u2019s survey from 19 percent last year.\n\nHere are five reasons that prompted employers to hire a candidate based on their social media profiles:\n\n- The employer valued the large amount of followers or subscribers a job candidate had.\n\n- They liked that the candidate had interacted with the company\u2019s social media accounts.\n\n- They had a good feel for the candidate\u2019s personality and concluded he or she would be a good fit with the company\u2019s culture.\n\n- They thought that a candidate\u2019s social media page conveyed a professional image.\n\n- They found out the candidate showed a wide range of interests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for job seekers to remember that much of what they post to the Internet \u2014 and in some cases what others post about them \u2014 can be found by potential employers,\u201d said Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder, in a press release.\n\nStill, there are as many downsides and dangers for job hunters active on social media. Employers in the CareerBuilder survey said they\u2019ve discovered a litany of bad behavior while searching online about a job candidate, including:\n\n- A candidate bragged about drunk driving and not getting caught.\n\n- A candidate posted information about using drugs.\n\n- A candidate posted discriminatory comments related to race, gender, or religion.\n\n- A candidate\u2019s screen name was unprofessional.\n\n- A candidate posted inappropriate photos or comments.\n\nRelated: 5 Hot Job That Could Be Right for You\n\nThe survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among more than 2,100 hiring managers and human resource professionals between Feb. 10 and March 4.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Being active on social media doesn\u2019t always have to hurt your chances of getting that perfect job.
