On June 9, 2012, then-governor of Texas Rick Perry sent a letter full of good ol’ Texas fire and brimstone to then-HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and described expanding Medicaid under Obamacare as a “gun to the head,” a “power grab,” and “Orwellian.”

He informed Sebelius that, thanks to the Supreme Court’s decision to allow states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion, Texas would not be accepting the federal funds that would have delivered health care coverage to 2 million of the poorest people in the Lone Star State.

On Thursday, Rick Perry stood before a group of potential New Hampshire voters and proudly showed off his Medicare registration.

Medicare and Medicaid are separate programs, of course, but that doesn’t alleviate the gross hypocrisy of Perry bragging that he now uses government-run health care when he denied the same right to millions of the people he was serving as governor.

Texas is a big state with a lot of poor people, and Rick Perry left a whole lot of them without access to affordable medical care. The Medicaid expansion is a gift to states, with the federal government footing the entire bill for the first few years, then the vast majority of it afterwards. It’s free money to the states to keep their people healthy.

Rick Perry rejected that free health care for the poor people of Texas. But he didn’t reject free health care for himself.
