Free registration: http://t.co/FMJyyavPVq pic.twitter.com/Xp3KR9ZxlE \u2014 NationalActionNet (@NationalAction) February 17, 2015\n\nSoon enough, Twitter started going nuts. Some users aren\u2019t fans of Sharpton\u2019s politically-charged convention:\n\nR U helping to further legitimize a race-hustling, cop-bashing, GOP-hating tax fraud. by appearing before NAN, @BenCarson? Explain decision \u2014 Carole Gilman (@CaroleGilman) February 18, 2015\n\nSome are fantastic at wordplay:\n\n@seanhannity is it true Dr. Ben Carson speaking at Al Sharlaton NAN convention \u2014 Michael Moore (@13Dolphinmike) February 18, 2015\n\nThere are innumerable reasons why conservatives are distrustful of Al Sharpton. For one, many consider his railing against the rich pretty hypocritical. Then there\u2019s that whole \u2018race-baiting\u2018 issue.\n\nCarson, of course, has a penchant for the dramatic. He\u2019s the one who likened the Affordable Care Act to slavery.\n\nThere was also the now-famous National Prayer Breakfast event in 2013 where he spoke up, mere feet from the President. Politico describe that moment as \u201ca politically charged invocation\u201d that transformed Carson into \u201ca darling of the right-wing media.\u201d\n\nSome folks on Twitter are expecting the April event with Sharpton\u2019s friends as a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast Redux, of sorts:\n\nBen Carson and Al Sharpton together? Either the weather is so bad hell has frozen over or Dr. Carson is gonna go \"prayer breakfast\" on Al. \u2014 Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) February 18, 2015\n\nOthers say you can\u2019t impact opponents unless you engage with them:\n\nNo evidence that Carson is one to cave. You can't do outreach by only appearing on Fox! 'Is Carson with Sharpton?!' http://t.co/nUrxVvLFWQ \u2014 Uncle Odie (@OdieMoats) February 18, 2015\n\nRecently, Sharpton has been seen at public events hanging out with popular conservatives like Sarah Palin and Rand Paul:\n\nI am in Senate Dining Room having breakfast meeting with Sen. Rand Paul. We don't agree on much but he is an interesting guy. \u2014 Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) November 20, 2014\n\nSo, maybe his unlikely partnership with Carson is evidence that Reverend Sharpton\u2019s just trying to find common ground with the other side of the aisle. But that doesn\u2019t mean Ben Carson won\u2019t drop some truth bombs in April.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Keep your friends close...", "published_at": "2015-02-19T13:25:57+00:00", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "Keep your friends close...", "title": "Pigs Can Fly: Ben Carson to Speak at a Conference Organized by None Other Than...Al Sharpton?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4471, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/carson1.jpg", "height": 2439}, "updated_time": "2015-02-19T15:07:15-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/02/254233-ben-carson-invited-speak-al-sharpton-conference/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Keep your friends close...", "creator": "@charlesSAMUEL_", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/carson1.jpg", "title": "Pigs Can Fly: Ben Carson to Speak at a Conference Organized by None Other Than...Al Sharpton?", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Charles Samuel", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-19T13:25:57-04:00", "wp-categories": "27 1471", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/02/254233-ben-carson-invited-speak-al-sharpton-conference/", "wp-category-slugs": "elections, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Elections", "published_time": "2015-02-19T13:25:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T15:07:15-04:00", "author": "charlessamueldotcom"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/carson1.jpg", "post_id": 254233, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd167e\"", "article_summary": "But that doesn\u2019t mean Ben Carson won\u2019t drop some truth bombs in April.\nWell, Ben Carson apparently lives by this credo.\nCarson, who is one of the more popular candidates in a wide-open GOP race for 2016, just made more waves by agreeing to speak at Al Sharpton\u2019s upcoming conference.\nThere was also the now-famous National Prayer Breakfast event in 2013 where he spoke up, mere feet from the President.\nEither the weather is so bad hell has frozen over or Dr. Carson is gonna go \"prayer breakfast\" on Al."}
