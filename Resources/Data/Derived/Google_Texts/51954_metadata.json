Blake Farenthold (R-TX) won't say Obama was legitimately elected [MSNBC]\n\nRep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) was called out on Friday for an apparent double standard regarding the presidential eligibility of party colleague Sen. Ted Cruz compared to President Barack Obama in a combative interview with MSNBC host Chris Matthews, refusing to support Obama\u2019s election as legitimate while promoting Cruz as a viable future candidate..\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as eligible as Obama is,\u201d Farenthold said of Cruz.\n\n\u201cWell, what does that mean?\u201d a flustered Matthews asked to follow up.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s president, Ted Cruz can be president,\u201d Farenthold answered, which seemed to anger Matthews.\n\n\u201cThis is serious business, Congressman,\u201d Matthews protested. \u201cYou\u2019re chuckling about this. Is he eligible to be president or not? You\u2019ve been touting the guy, you said he could run for president \u2014 explain.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the interview, Farenthold brushed off the attacks against Cruz coming from within their own party, suggesting to Matthews that some of his critics are positioning themselves against Cruz for a run at their presidential nomination. Cruz has drawn the ire of House Republicans for allegedly laying the fight to defund the Affordable Care Act at their door after spending his summer campaigning against it.\n\nAfter Farenthold finally said he believed Cruz was eligible to run for president, Matthews pressed on, asking whether he thought the same of Obama \u201ceven if that crazy theory of Donald Trump is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Ted Cruz,\u201d Farenthold answered, seemingly deflecting the question.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you project an inch, mentally?\u201d Matthews asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you that President Obama is the president,\u201d Farenthold said. \u201cIf he\u2019s eligible to be president, Ted Cruz is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas he legitimately elected president?\u201d Matthews responded.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t in Congress to make that determination,\u201d Farenthold said. \u201cThat was determined before I got here.\u201d\n\nWhen Matthews asked him to repeat the statement, \u201che was legitimately elected president,\u201d Farenthold omitted \u201clegitimately\u201d from his response, prompting Matthews to accuse him of \u201cdodge balling.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody watching knows what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Matthews warned.\n\nWatch the interview, as aired on MSNBC on Friday, below.\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Rep.-Blake-Farenthold-R-TX-wont-say-Obama-was-legitimately-elected-MSNBC-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Texas Republican: Ted Cruz \u2018as eligible as Obama is\u2019 to be President"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ecd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf he\u2019s eligible to be president, Ted Cruz is.\u201d\u201cWas he legitimately elected president?\u201d Matthews responded.\n\u201cObama\u2019s president, Ted Cruz can be president,\u201d Farenthold answered, which seemed to anger Matthews.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you that President Obama is the president,\u201d Farenthold said.\nAfter Farenthold finally said he believed Cruz was eligible to run for president, Matthews pressed on, asking whether he thought the same of Obama \u201ceven if that crazy theory of Donald Trump is true.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Ted Cruz,\u201d Farenthold answered, seemingly deflecting the question.\nRep.
