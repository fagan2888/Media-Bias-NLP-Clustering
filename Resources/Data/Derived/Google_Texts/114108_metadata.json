Meanwhile, a similar Pew study found that whites are far less likely to see discrimination in the treatment blacks receive by the education system, the courts and hospitals. Such views are held by many Americans, who believe that \u201cblacks are mostly responsible for their own condition.\u201d Police killings of unarmed blacks are certainly the most visible manifestation of systemic racism, but data show that racism still manifests itself frequently in everyday life.\n\nIn America, race determines not just where someone lives and what school he or she attends, it affects the very air we breathe. Although many whites wish to believe we live in a \u201cpost-racial\u201d society, race appears not just in overt discrimination but in subtle structural factors. It\u2019s impossible to delineate every way race affects us every day, but a cursory examination of major structural racial problems can give us a feeling for how far we still have to go.\n\n1) Education\n\nEducation is an important key to fostering upward mobility and alleviating inequality. However, schools today are becoming more segregated, rather than less segregated. At the peak of integration, 44 percent of black Southern students attended majority white schools. Today, only 23 percent do. This is particularly worrying because recent research by Rucker C. Johnson finds that school desegregation benefited black students, because it \u201csignificantly increased both educational and occupational attainments, college quality and adult earnings, reduced the probability of incarceration, and improved adult health status.\u201d\n\nResearchers have increasingly referred to a rise of \u201capartheid schools,\u201d which are almost entirely non-white. In 2003, one-sixth of all black students were educated in such \u201capartheid schools.\u201d These districts are underfunded and understaffed, and frequently referred to as \u201cdropout factories.\u201d So students of color are far less likely than their white peers to attend schools with a full range of advanced courses.\n\nAs ProPublica documents, more and more schools are squeezing out of court oversight. The result, according to Sam Reardon and his colleagues, is increased racial segregation.\n\n(Source)\n\nAt the college level, the situation is little better. A recent report by Anthony Carnevale and Jeff Strohl finds that college education in America consists of \u201ca dual system of racially separate and unequal institutions despite the growing access of minorities to the postsecondary system.\u201d They find that students of color are less likely to end up in the most selective schools than white students with the same qualifications.\n\n2) Wealth\n\nThere is a large racial wealth gap between blacks and whites in America, partially driven by income but exacerbated by racially biased housing policies (which will be examined below). A recent research brief by the Institution on Assets and Social Policy finds that the wealth gap between white families and African-Americans has tripled between 1984 and 2009. The recession has only exacerbated the gap, with whites losing 11 percent of their wealth between 2007 and 2010, while blacks lost 31 percent and Hispanics 44 percent.\n\n(Source)\n\nThe housing crash disproportionately affected blacks and Hispanics, who were more likely to receive subprime loans even when compared to whites with similar credit scores. In one instance reported by the New York Times, a loan officer at Wells Fargo said the bank \u201csaw the black community as fertile ground for subprime mortgages, as working-class blacks were hungry to be a part of the nation\u2019s home-owning mania.\u201d However, even before the recession, disparities in employment, college education, homeownership and inheritance helped solidify racial wealth gaps. Instead of wealth, more and more Americans, particularly people of color, are burdened with debt.\n\n3) Job Markets\n\nUnemployment is particularly high among African-Americans, the result of both explicit discrimination and occupational segregation.\n\nOccupational segregation, or the delegation of blacks to jobs with low upward mobility and wages, is rife. People of color are primarily affected by practices like just-in-time scheduling, which gives workers little warning before a shift.\n\nPart of the problem is infrastructure and education. People of color are far more likely to rely on public infrastructure, and therefore suffer from cuts to public transportation. Decades of housing segregation have trapped African-Americans in jobless areas with badly understaffed schools. Social networks reinforce the patterns, since most Americans get their jobs through friends and family connections. Outright discrimination plays a role as well: Marianne Bertrand finds that applicants with white-sounding names are 50 percent more likely to receive a call-back than applicants with black-sounding names with the same credentials.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Privileged pundits love to insist that race is no longer a factor in American life.
