"For the hunter, fall is the island and the rest of the year is the swim." Charles Fergus, "A Rough-Shooting Dog," 1991.

For some bird hunters in Wisconsin, fall arrived Tuesday, the first day of September and the meteorlogical change of seasons.

The thermometer might have read "summer," but the calendar said "hunt."

Bow deer hunters and northern grouse hunters will see their opportunities start Saturday.

Rabbit, squirrel, bear, wild turkey and assorted other seasons are also on the near horizon.

From farm fields in Kenosha County to big woods near Superior, and from Mississippi River backwaters to open expanses of Lake Michigan, by the time September ends hunters will be writing the latest chapter in Wisconsin's outdoors history.

As contemporary hunters have become accustomed, the opportunities for most species this fall in Wisconsin are very good. A few have never been better in modern history.

And some are beset by changes in habitat or disease issues.

In the hunting realm, challenges are not unexpected.

The value of the hunt is in the effort, in the ethics, in the camaraderie, in the respect for the game.

No kill should be minimized or taken for granted. As our ancestors practiced, each animal should be fully utilized for food, feather and fur.

And remember that no hunt is a success if it isn't conducted safely and lawfully.

Follow the basic rules of hunter safety â€” treat every firearm as if it were loaded; always point the muzzle in a safe direction; be certain of your target and what is beyond it; and keep your finger outside of the trigger guard until ready to shoot.

And make sure your fellow hunters do the same or don't hunt with them.

If you hunt from a tree stand, make sure to wear and use a full-body harness.

If you're an experienced hunter, add a measure of success to your season and introduce a friend, co-worker or neighbor to hunting this year.

Hunting not only plays a valuable role in wildlife management and the economy. It's a natural part of the human experience that can engender a deeper appreciation for nature and awareness of the environment.

Good hunting to you.

What follows are excerpts of Department of Natural Resources forecasts for the Wisconsin 2015-'16 hunting seasons. A copy of the full forecast is posted at www.jsonline.com/sports/outdoors.

Deer

Archery/crossbow: Sept. 12-Jan. 3, 2016

Regular gun: Nov. 21-29

Muzzleloader: Nov. 30-Dec. 9

Late antlerless-only gun hunt: Dec. 10-13

Youth gun hunt: Oct. 10-11

Disabled gun hunt: Oct. 3-11

On the heels of a mild winter, the herd is generally larger, according to DNR wildlife biologists. That will be good news to hunters, who registered 191,550 deer in the 2014 gun deer season, a 15% decrease from 2013 and lowest since 1982.

The larger herd this year may help increase license sales. The DNR reported gun deer license sales of 608,711 in 2014, down 4% from 2013 and lowest since 1976.

The season will see statewide implementation of electronic deer registration. Physical registration is history. Hunters will record their harvest by calling (844) 426-3734 or by visiting gamereg.wi.gov. When they register the animal, hunters will receive a 10-digit confirmation number. The number must be written on the carcass tag and attached to the deer and will serve as proof the animal was legally registered.

Also new this year, there will be no "bonus buck" opportunities. Any bonus buck stickers from previous years are invalid.

In another change, the holiday hunt (held late December through early January in recent years) has been discontinued. The DNR says it could return if recommended by County Deer Advisory Councils.

Twelve deer management units, in whole or in part, are designated as "buck only" this year. The regulation is an effort to rebuild deer herds in the areas.

Most units in the state have bonus antlerless deer permits available, based on county and public or private land.

Chronic wasting disease has continued to spread in Wisconsin's deer herd. This year, baiting and feeding deer is prohibited in 38 counties.

Bear

Sept. 9-Oct. 13

Wisconsin has one of the largest black bear populations in the nation and has recorded the top six bear harvests in state history in the last six years. This season should continue the string of high harvests, as the DNR has issued a record 10,690 kill permits. The agency received a record 109,000 applications. Last year hunters registered 4,526 bears, third-highest in history.

Ruffed grouse

Zone A: Sept. 12-Jan. 31, 2016

Zone B: Oct. 17-Dec. 8

Wisconsin offers some of the finest ruffed grouse hunting in the U.S. Numbers should be similar to 2014 when hunters took about 254,826 birds. Highest harvests were reported in Price, Forest and Marinette counties. Best grouse hunting opportunities are often found in young, early successional forests.

Pheasant:

Oct. 17 to Dec. 31

Waterfowl

Youth waterfowl hunt: Sept. 19-20

Duck:

Northern zone: Sept. 26-Nov. 24

Southern zone: Oct. 3-11 and Oct. 17-Dec. 6

Mississippi River zone: Oct. 3-9 and Oct. 17-Dec. 8

Canada goose:

Early September statewide: Sept. 1-15

Northern zone: Sept. 16-Dec. 16

Southern zone: Sept. 16-Oct. 11 and Oct. 17-Dec. 21

Mississippi River zone: Oct. 3-9 and Oct. 17-Jan. 7

The 2015 breeding survey found 49.5 million ducks in North America, highest in the 60-year history of the survey. The estimate led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to offer another liberal 60-day season with a six-duck daily bag limit to Wisconsin and other states in the Mississippi Flyway.

The resident and migratory Canada goose populations are large enough for the state to again have a 92-day exterior zone goose hunt.

Rabbit:

Northern zone: Sept. 12 to Feb. 29, 2016

Southern zone: Oct. 17 (noon) to Feb. 29, 2016

The outlook for rabbit hunters is very good, with the 2015 survey indicating 0.29 rabbits per stop, up from 0.17 in 2013.

Rabbits are extremely prolific, with reproduction linked to weather conditions. Portions of the state with adequate rainfall and plenty of green, succulent vegetation have the highest rabbit production.

Squirrel:

Sept. 12 to Jan. 31, 2016

Squirrels are a very popular game species and can provide some great early season hunting opportunities especially for beginners. Squirrel production and resulting hunting opportunities are strongly tied to the previous year's mast production, so hunters are encouraged to look for areas with the presence of acorns or hickory nuts.

During the 2014-'15 hunting season, the results of a mail-in survey indicated hunters harvested 347,116 squirrels.

Wild Turkey:

Statewide Sept. 12 to Nov. 19, Zones 1-5 also open Nov. 30 to Dec. 31.

Although summer brood observations have yet to be finalized, DNR biologists expect fall turkey hunters to find good prospects in the woods and fields this fall. The DNR has offered 100,700 fall turkey permits this year, an increase of 4,000 from 2014.

Turkeys typically separate into bachelor flocks of toms and larger groups of hens and poults in fall. The birds feed in woods on mast such as acorns and in agricultural fields.
