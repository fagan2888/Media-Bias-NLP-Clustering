A recent Kaiser Family Foundation report found that Hispanics account for 32 percent of the nation\u2019s non-elderly uninsured population \u2014 just the group he needs to buy into Obamacare to make it a success.\n\nSo, why the sudden shift?\n\nFor starters, the Spanish language website, cuidadodesalud.gov, isn\u2019t finished. The pages where customers select a plan are still in English.\n\nAnd that can cause big trouble for non-English speakers.\n\n\u201cIf people are not selecting the right plan for themselves, depending on how they need or expect to use the insurance for the upcoming year, it might affect their financial bottom line,\u201d said Luis Chaves of the Pangea Financial Group, who closely follows health care-related issues.\n\n\u201cFor example, if I pick a plan that has a lower cost but I know that I have to have outpatient surgery, I might be better off selecting a plan that costs a little more per month but that has a co-payment for surgery of $300 instead of the plan that costs less but I have to pay the first $6,350,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cYou always have to add up the monthly premium plus the amount of money you would have to pay for services you plan to use during the year.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s a lack of general information, though the feds have held little back trying to promote the program.\n\n\u201cHispanic people ask questions, and we all are a little confused,\u201d said Chanel Valcarcel, a pharmacist at one of the many Narvarro Discount Pharmacy locations in Miami-Dade County. \u201cHere, we try to explain what it is and refer (people) to the federal website. We are also working with private companies such as Blue Cross (Blue Shield) and health-care reform advisers.\u201d\n\nBut even that\u2019s not working for some people.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebilus has been to South Florida three times in three months, trying to drum up support, to little avail.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it. I don\u2019t know about (the law),\u201d Miamian Matias Garica told Florida Watchdog.\n\nMiami resident Alina Lambert hasn\u2019t seen it, either.\n\n\u201c\u2026 But I heard from family and friends that it\u2019s pretty bad. They have a hard time trying to use it, and it\u2019s pretty expensive.\u201d\n\nBut the feds aren\u2019t giving up. The Obama administration has pledged a Hispanic-focused marketing blitz beginning in January and has pushed back until March the deadline for registering for an insurance plan.\n\nContact Marianela Toledo at Marianela.Toledo@FloridaWatchdog.org twitter @mtoledoreporter", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "They were among President Barack Obama\u2019s best supporters, but support for the president and his signature health insurance scheme is quickly dying among Hispanics.", "title": "Lost in translation: Once-supportive Hispanics turning backs on Obama, ACA - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/HispanicYoungAdults.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-17T04:06:06+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/120337/obamacare-hispanic-enrollment/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Florida", "tag": "ACA,Gallup,Kaiser Family Foundation,Obama,ObamaCare,U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius", "published_time": "2013-12-17T04:00:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-17T04:06:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "They were among President Barack Obama\u2019s best supporters, but support for the president and his signature health insurance scheme is quickly dying among Hispanics.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/HispanicYoungAdults.jpg"}, "title": "Lost in translation: Once-supportive Hispanics turning backs on Obama, ACA - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "They were among President Barack Obama\u2019s best supporters, but support for the president and his signature health insurance scheme is quickly dying among Hispanics."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08f9\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration has pledged a Hispanic-focused marketing blitz beginning in January and has pushed back until March the deadline for registering for an insurance plan.\n\u201cHispanics\u2019 approval ratings of Obama have shown the most variation of any group\u2019s ratings throughout his presidency,\u201d the pollsters said when they released their report Dec. 5.\nBy Marianela Toldeo | Florida WatchdogMIAMI \u2013 They were among President Obama\u2019s best supporters, but support for the president and his signature health insurance scheme is quickly dying among Hispanics.\nThey have a hard time trying to use it, and it\u2019s pretty expensive.\u201dBut the feds aren\u2019t giving up.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebilus has been to South Florida three times in three months, trying to drum up support, to little avail."}
