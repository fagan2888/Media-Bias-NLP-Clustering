The sooner it\u2019s over and done with, the better, right?While it is one\u2019s natural temptation to rush through the process as quickly as possible, Time\u2019s Money.com explains that it literally can pay for you to take your time.\u201cThere are more than 350 possible deductions on your federal return alone, says TurboTax CPA Lisa Greene-Lewis, and even professionals don\u2019t always take the right ones,\u201d Money reported. \u201cA 2014 Government Accountability Office study tested 19 randomly selected tax preparers and found that only two managed to calculate the correct refund.\u201dMeanwhile, you also have a little more extra time this year to file. The tax deadline is April 18 this year, because of a Washington, D.C., holiday. (In Massachusetts and Maine, because of Patriots\u2019 Day, the deadline is April 19.)Money\u2019s Ingrid Case also offers 12 trouble spots to avoid in an attempt to maximize your tax season savings.Highlighting her tips:\u201cLast year\u2019s volatile market left some investors underwater. If you sold at a loss during August\u2019s slide, you can deduct up to $3,000 from ordinary income after you\u2019ve offset capital gains. You can carry forward any additional losses to offset income in future tax years,\u201d she said.\u201cMedical costs are deductible on your federal return, but only to the extent they exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income, or AGI (7.5% if you or your spouse is at least 65). If you had big out-of-pocket expenses last year, add up your bills: You can deduct nearly any out-of-pocket medical or dental cost\u2014drugs and doctor bills but also mileage traveled to appointments, disability-related home or car modifications, addiction treatment, lead paint removal, a guide dog,\u201d she said.\u201cIf you need a babysitter in order to work, look for work, or attend school, take a tax credit that\u2019s worth 20% to 35% (depending on your income) of up to $3,000 in expenses for one child or up to $6,000 for two or more,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cost of day camp counts, though not sleepaway camp. If you\u2019ve set aside pretax dollars in an FSA for child care, you must use that money first, but you can still take a credit for additional expenses up to the limit once you\u2019ve exhausted the account.\u201d\u201cUnless you\u2019re self-employed, there are few legitimate job-related deductions,\u201d she said. Work clothing doesn\u2019t count, unless it\u2019s a uniform or other specialized gear. Commuting costs are not deductible \u2014 but miles you drive on the job are fair game, if you don\u2019t get reimbursed (and only to the extent they and other miscellaneous deductions top 2% of AGI). Same goes for miles you drive to look for a new job. Teachers can take a $250 deduction for classroom supplies \u2014 a write-off that Congress just made permanent.\"If you bought insurance on an Obamacare marketplace, you\u2019ll get a new form this year. You don\u2019t need to file the 1095-A, but don\u2019t overlook it: You\u2019ll use it to complete your Form 8962, which will help you make sure you\u2019re taking all the credits you\u2019re allowed \u2014 if, for example, your income dropped after you first signed up \u2014 and to see whether you owe any penalties for lack of coverage,\" she reported.Self-employed people can claim a long list of deductions, including business expenses, retirement plan contributions, 50% of self-employment tax, and workspace, she said.To get the most out of your tax deductions, stay organized and do your research. \u201cNo one likes getting audited \u2013 though if the IRS does red flag you, some costs of professional advice to defend yourself are, in fact, deductible,\u201d explains Kimberly J.
