Forecasters warned Sunday of exceptionally cold air, perhaps the coldest in years. Strong winds were expected to continue into Monday, reducing visibility, creating drifts and complicating an ongoing cleanup effort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s historic,\u201d Frank Libby said as he walked down a deserted street in Boston\u2019s Back Bay neighborhood. \u201cI think we\u2019re in uncharted territory. People just don\u2019t know how to deal with the logistics of it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nA DEEP FREEZE\n\nA bone-chilling blast of cold blew into New England as the last snowflakes fell Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe big story is subzero air temperatures with wind chills as low as 20 to 40 below zero,\u201d Matthew Belk of the National Weather Service said, adding that exposed skin could start to develop frostbite in \u201ca matter of minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big thing is to dress in layers and don\u2019t go outside if you don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Arctic cold front already had frozen the upper Midwest, with temperatures in Michigan plunging to minus-27 in the Upper Peninsula.\n\nAllan Tufankjian of Scituate, Massachusetts, said it\u2019s discouraging every time he looks at the forecast.\n\n\u201cIf I saw one day that was above freezing, I\u2019d be very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked seven days ahead and every single day, the highest temperature I could see is 26 degrees.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPLANNING AN ESCAPE\n\nThe Klose family \u2014 Clint, Sue and daughters Caitlin and Kiersten \u2014 attacked a mountain of snow in front of their Concord, New Hampshire, house Sunday morning. Just last week, Clint Klose booked a trip for the girls and him to Orlando, Florida.\n\n\u201cYou just need a break!\u201d he said. \u201cWe need some Vitamin D that we\u2019ve been deprived of.\u201d\n\nKlose said the family wouldn\u2019t forget this winter.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s been the harshest winter in the shortest amount of time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past five weeks, it\u2019s just been a slamming event and a slamming event and a slamming event one after the other.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSNOW TOTALS\n\nSome areas of New England reported nearly 2 feet of snow from the storm including Acushnet, Massachusetts, with 22 inches, and Salisbury with 20.5 inches. Boston recorded 13 inches of new snow. At the easternmost tip of Maine, Lubechad had 2 feet. With many intersections already clogged by soaring snow banks, forces mobilized before the storm to remove piles of snow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Biting cold air follows latest New England snowstorm", "author": "Alanna Durkin and Michael Melia", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Biting cold air follows latest New England snowstorm", "title": "Biting cold air follows latest New England snowstorm", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/16/biting_cold_air_follows_latest_new_england_snowstorm/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/new-england-snow.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Biting cold air follows latest New England snowstorm", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/new-england-snow.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Biting cold air follows latest New England snowstorm", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Biting cold air follows latest New England snowstorm", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03c6\"", "article_summary": "The Arctic cold front already had frozen the upper Midwest, with temperatures in Michigan plunging to minus-27 in the Upper Peninsula.\nForecasters warned Sunday of exceptionally cold air, perhaps the coldest in years.\nWith many intersections already clogged by soaring snow banks, forces mobilized before the storm to remove piles of snow.\nPeople just don\u2019t know how to deal with the logistics of it.\u201d___A DEEP FREEZEA bone-chilling blast of cold blew into New England as the last snowflakes fell Sunday.\nStrong winds were expected to continue into Monday, reducing visibility, creating drifts and complicating an ongoing cleanup effort."}
