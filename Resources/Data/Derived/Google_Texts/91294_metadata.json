More than 3 million people signed up for Medicaid in the 27 states that chose to expand the joint federal-state insurance program for the poor to include those making as much as 138 percent of the federal poverty limit, or $15,856 for a single adult.\n\n\u201cThere is a really profound effect going on in the states that expanded Medicaid,\u201d Fetter said Tuesday in an interview in New York. \u201cYou took people who were coming in and we were getting paid nothing, and now we are getting paid something, that is very helpful.\u201d\n\nAbout a quarter of Tenet\u2019s patient beds are in the states that expanded Medicaid as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The company operated 77 hospitals and 189 outpatient centers as of March 31, Tenet said in a regulatory filing.\n\nThe states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid are mostly controlled by Republican governors and legislators opposed to the law. Fetter said politics will prevent states, such as Republican-led Texas, from expanding the program in the next few years.\n\nWhile the federal government provides full financing for the Medicaid expansion until 2017, Republican governors that have declined the money say their states wouldn\u2019t be able to afford their share of the cost beyond that time.\n\nShannon Pettypiece,\n\nBloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Emergency room visits by the uninsured and charity cases have dropped in states that expanded Medicaid rolls.", "og": {"description": "Emergency room visits by the uninsured and charity cases have dropped in states that expanded Medicaid rolls.", "title": "Tenet gains from Obamacare in states that expanded Medicaid", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140520-tenet-gains-from-obamacare-in-states-that-expanded-medicaid.ece", "image": {"width": 405, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140520-trevor_fetter-2-.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/TREVOR_FETTER+%282%29.jpg", "height": 600}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-05-21T02:40:11Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-05-21T02:22:09Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Tenet gains from Obamacare in states that expanded Medicaid\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140520-tenet-gains-from-obamacare-in-states-that-expanded-medicaid.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140520-nb_12tenet.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_12TENET.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1683843\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-05-21T02:22:09Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140520-nb_12tenet.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NB_12TENET.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-05-21T02:22:09Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3ce\"", "article_summary": "Tenet Healthcare Corp. is getting a boost from Obamacare because its hospitals are spending less on charity care for uninsured patients in states that have expanded Medicaid.\n\u201cThere is a really profound effect going on in the states that expanded Medicaid,\u201d Fetter said Tuesday in an interview in New York.\nThe states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid are mostly controlled by Republican governors and legislators opposed to the law.\nIn states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, such as Texas and Florida, hospital admissions for the uninsured have increased 2 percent while ER visits have decreased 6 percent.\nFetter said politics will prevent states, such as Republican-led Texas, from expanding the program in the next few years."}
