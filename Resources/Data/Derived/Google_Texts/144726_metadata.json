Ted Cruz, News, Politics News\n\nSen. Ted Cruz pretends to be a tough guy, but mostly he spends his time trashing Democrats in front of adoring right-wing crowds and conservative journalists. On Wednesday he sat down with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo \u2013 you didn\u2019t expect him to go to MSNBC, did you? \u2013 and showed himself to be incredibly thin-skinned when pressed just a little on how he would replace the Affordable Care Act he wants to repeal. It was an interesting window on Cruz\u2019s temperament as well as his cynical, threadbare \u201cpolicy\u201d agenda.\n\nCuomo asked Cruz how he would replace the law he inveighs against, and as usual, Cruz dodged the question and kept on inveighing instead. Cuomo followed up. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that you have a responsibility as a U.S. senator to do better than that, in terms of offering a solution for what to do next?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd Cruz shot back: \u201cWell, I appreciate your trying to lecture me in the morning.\u201d\n\nCuomo didn\u2019t leave it there.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, not at all, Senator. I\u2019m worried, same as you, anybody who looks at the situation has worries.\u201d\n\nSo Cruz tried to turn the tables. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried, did you speak out for the 5 million people who have lost their health insurance?\u201d\n\nCuomo had an answer: \u201cAbsolutely \u2014 we\u2019ve been covering it doggedly. The problem is, I don\u2019t have the power to fix it. You do. That\u2019s what a U.S. senator does, is you sponsor law. You know this. It\u2019s not a lecture, it\u2019s a concern; I\u2019m asking, what are you going to do about it?\u201d\n\nApparently Cruz isn\u2019t used to being grilled. Cuomo got him to share what passes for an answer from conservatives these days: \u201cLet people purchase health insurance across state lines.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas senator gets huffy with CNN, then reveals his bogus, anti-states\u2019 rights plan to replace the ACA", "title": "Ted Cruz reveals he\u2019s a thin-skinned hypocrite", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Texas senator gets huffy with CNN, then reveals his bogus, anti-states\u2019 rights plan to replace the ACA", "title": "Ted Cruz reveals he\u2019s a thin-skinned hypocrite", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/20/ted_cruz_reveals_hes_a_thin_skinned_hypocrite/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/ted_cruz8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Texas senator gets huffy with CNN, then reveals his bogus, anti-states\u2019 rights plan to replace the ACA", "title": "Ted Cruz reveals he\u2019s a thin-skinned hypocrite", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/ted_cruz8.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Chris Cuomo, CNN, health insurance, Sen.
