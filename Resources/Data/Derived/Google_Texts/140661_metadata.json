Dan Malloy banned state-funded travel to Indiana. The reason wasn\u2019t because Indiana had imprisoned a political dissident or arrested feminist activists for planning an event to raise awareness about sexual harassment. It wasn\u2019t because Indiana lawmakers passed a law to censor the Internet. It was that Indiana had passed a law that would allow business owners who hold devout religious beliefs against homosexuality to choose not to participate in gay marriages.\n\nIn September 2012, Malloy went on a taxpayer-funded trip to China, where he promoted business relationships: \u201cConnecticut is finally raising its flag in China after a 25-year absence,\u201d he announced.\n\nMalloy was joined by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo both in banning state-funded travel to Indiana and lobbying for business deals with China. Cuomo even has a trade mission to Cuba coming up on April 20. Outside interests paid for some of those governors\u2019 trips, but the Connecticut Post reported that Malloy\u2019s trip, one of many global jaunts he has taken as governor, was covered by a taxpayer-funded state agency.\n\nMy Big Fat Wedding Hypocrisy Maybe the governors realized how silly their short-lived travel bans were after the media hype died down. Cuomo, Malloy, and Inslee have already lifted their states\u2019 bans now that Indiana has passed a \u201cfix.\u201d After all, it would be kind of hard to justify going on a taxpayer-funded trip to China, a country where gay people can\u2019t marry someone of the same sex (to say nothing of the many anti-democratic features of its government), when you have already drawn the line on letting photographers opt out of taking photos of a gay wedding the state allows.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if gays aren\u2019t being stoned to death in Iran, thrown off buildings in Syria, or threatened with long prison sentences in 78 countries. Yet the domestic press exploded with attacks on the Indiana law and its supporters. Companies like Angie\u2019s List and Salesforce said they would limit their business dealings with Indiana. Apple CEO Tim Cook compared Indiana pizzerias that won\u2019t cater gay marriages to restaurants with segregated lunch counters. Small-town Indiana\u2019s Memories Pizza was denounced and threatened after its owner answered a hypothetical question on the news, then people who donated their own hard-earned money to help the restaurant were denounced.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if gays aren\u2019t being stoned to death in Iran, thrown off buildings in Syria, or threatened with long prison sentences in 78 countries or territories around the world.\n\nHow China Treats Gay People China isn\u2019t one of the worst countries for gay rights. It repealed its law against gay sexual relations in 1997. Homosexuality is slowly becoming more accepted. But China is still far from Indiana or other American states in terms of open acceptance of gay people.\n\nUnlike Indiana, same-sex marriages are not recognized anywhere in China. Traditional social views in China pressure gay people to stay in the closet. Many have sham marriages to please their parents. Li An\u2019s 1993 film, \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d deals with sham marriages. Although the film is two decades old, the practice is still relatively common. Unlike Indiana, same-sex marriages are not recognized anywhere in China.\n\nAn international survey by Pew Research in 2013 found that 21 percent of Chinese think homosexuality should be accepted, compared to 60 percent of Americans. Don\u2019t even think about setting up a non-government organization and hosting large-scale protests in China about gay rights, or other issues. In the run up to women\u2019s day, five Chinese women were arrested just for planning to pass out information about sexual harassment. After more than a month, the women are still being held. If you surf the web from behind China\u2019s Great Firewall, you won\u2019t be able to view this Facebook page calling for their release.\n\nHomophobia Is Not an Exclusively Religious Phenomenon China has a much different history and culture than America that has shaped its social viewpoints. My point isn\u2019t so much to criticize Chinese positions (although change would certainly be welcomed) as it is to criticize those hypocrites who seem only to get outraged when Americans do anything they find to be intolerant. The vast majority of countries in the world don\u2019t measure up to Indiana or other American states on gay rights and acceptance of gays in society.\n\nThese are countries where the root cause of homophobia isn\u2019t religion but big government power. Their criticism also came down harshly on religion\u2014particularly Christianity, which is understandable considering that Christians make up a large majority of religious Americans. Still, Neil DeGrasse Tyson vastly overstated his case when he told The Daily Beast, \u201cHomophobia almost always entirely stems from religion.\u201d\n\nThere are many cases where homophobia is caused or justified on religious grounds. Most of the countries with death sentences for homosexuality have fanatical Islamic governments. Uganda, a Christian country, passed a law criminalizing homosexuality with a death sentence, with the support of some American pastors.\n\nBut in no way is religion that cause \u201calmost always entirely.\u201d The insertion of \u201calmost\u201d gives DeGrasse a little bit of wiggle room. Is it enough wiggle room to cover Communist and authoritarian countries like the People\u2019s Republic of China, Cuba, North Korea, Russia, and Zimbabwe? These are countries where the root cause of homophobia isn\u2019t religion but big government power.\n\nCommunists Restrict Gay People Severely In the cases of the PRC, Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, each are current or former Communist countries. Their governments under Communism exerted broad power over many aspects of people\u2019s lives. In fact, Communist countries are officially atheist, and they have used state power to resist religion. North Korea bans the Bible. Along with Communism, China also faced the influence of Confucianism, which prescribes fixed roles for men and women in society.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the People\u2019s Republic was founded and Mao took power that homosexuals (along with everyone else) faced the worst persecution. Yet it wasn\u2019t until the People\u2019s Republic was founded and Mao took power that homosexuals (along with everyone else) faced the worst persecution. According to the Shanghai Star, in an article from 2004 now published on ChinaDaily.com, \u201cDuring the cultural revolution (1966 \u2013 76), homosexuals faced their worst period of persecution in Chinese history. The government considered homosexuality to be a social disgrace or a form of mental illness.\u201d With the free-market oriented reforms China began under Deng Xiaoping, things got better, and homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in 2001.\n\nRussia\u2019s \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law is well-known. That was one instance where liberal activists did apply their same level of outrage to a foreign country. In Russia, only 33 percent of the population said religion was an important part of their daily life in a 2009 Gallup survey, while 65 percent of Americans did.\n\nCuba and Zimbabwe, along with being authoritarian dictatorships, are examples of another aspect of homophobia: xenophobia. When Fidel Castro took power, he attacked gays as \u201cagents of imperialism.\u201d Zimbabwe dictator Robert Mugabe, a proud Marxist, called homosexuality a \u201cWestern perversion.\u201d Zimbabwe is also a very religious country, with 87.5 percent of citizens telling Gallup religion is important in their lives, but from the language Mugabe uses, it is clear attacking gays serves nationalistic purposes to solidify his power base. In 2006, he banned same-sex kissing and even hand-holding.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 07 Apr 2015 06:44:19 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Apparently, a bunch of governors and CEOs think states that allow people to bow out of gay weddings are worse than countries that stone gay people to death.", "title": "Indiana-Shunners Work With Countries That Kill Gay People", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_161064980.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-09T07:33:40+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/07/indiana-shunners-do-business-with-countries-that-kill-gay-people/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Apparently, a bunch of governors and CEOs think states that allow people to bow out of gay weddings are worse than countries that stone gay people to death.", "title": "Indiana-Shunners Work With Countries That Kill Gay People", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_161064980.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "World Affairs", "tag": "China,Dan Malloy,Editors Picks,gay rights,homophobia,human rights,Indiana,RFRA,Russia", "published_time": "2015-04-07T06:44:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-09T07:33:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Apparently, a bunch of governors and CEOs think states that allow people to bow out of gay weddings are worse than countries that stone gay people to death."}, "article_summary": "How China Treats Gay People China isn\u2019t one of the worst countries for gay rights.\nApple CEO Tim Cook compared Indiana pizzerias that won\u2019t cater gay marriages to restaurants with segregated lunch counters.\nYet the domestic press exploded with attacks on the Indiana law and its supporters.\nDon\u2019t even think about setting up a non-government organization and hosting large-scale protests in China about gay rights, or other issues.\nApparently, a bunch of governors and CEOs think states that allow people to bow out of gay weddings for the sake of religious convictions are worse than countries that stone gay people to death."}
