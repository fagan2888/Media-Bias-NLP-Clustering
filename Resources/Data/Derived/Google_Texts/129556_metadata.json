Dr. Cliff Maesaka, CEO of Delta Dental of Kentucky, said the survey will establish a baseline for the state.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to move the needle on children\u2019s oral health, we need to know where we\u2019re starting from, because in that way we\u2019ll be able to measure success, and we\u2019ll be able to see if we\u2019re having an impact \u2014 if we know first where we are,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, sixth-graders at Bullitt Lick Middle School will become the first group of students to participate in the initiative. The Shepherdsville middle school is one of 60 schools that have been chosen to be part of the survey.\n\nThe project will screen 6,000 students in Kentucky. It will take 18 months to complete the survey. Kentucky Youth Advocates, the University of Louisville School of Dentistry, and several other local and statewide agencies are partnering.\n\nMaesaka said dental students at U of L will provide dental screenings for the children participating. He said the screenings would be given through spring 2016, and data from the survey would be available by next fall.\n\nOral health was the topic of a recent summit in Louisville focused on oral health policies and initiatives. Dr. Michael Glick, a dental medicine professor at the University of Buffalo and the summit\u2019s keynote speaker, said oral health affects the overall well-being of Kentuckians.\n\n\u201cOral health for some reason has always been siloed separately from systemic health, and obviously if you have an infection anywhere in the body, it will affect other places and other organs in the body as well,\u201d Glick said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not surprising that infections in the mouth may have some correlation with other infections in the body as a whole.\u201d\n\nImproving the overall dental health of Kentucky children was also one of the goals of outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s health initiative.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, children are supposed to receive two dental exams a year at no cost.\n\n\u201cFor us to identify enhancements or better oral health, we need to focus on the population that will have access to oral health care,\u201d Maesaka said.\n\nMaesaka hopes the survey will allow the organization to work with children and parents to develop achievable goals in improving the health of Kentuckians.\n\n\u201cThe end goal of all of it is to make our children \u2014 and ultimately our entire population \u2014 healthier,\u201d Maesaka said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Making Smiles Happen Surveillance Initiative will assess the oral health of Kentucky third- and sixth-grade students.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "The Making Smiles Happen Surveillance Initiative will assess the oral health of Kentucky third- and sixth-grade students.", "title": "Kentucky's First Oral Health Survey Since 2001 Begins This Week", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1930, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teeth_2-e1448035542456.jpg", "height": 661}, "updated_time": "2015-12-03T07:40:18-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/delta-dental/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Making Smiles Happen Surveillance Initiative will assess the oral health of Kentucky third- and sixth-grade students.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teeth_2-e1448035542456.jpg", "title": "Kentucky's First Oral Health Survey Since 2001 Begins This Week", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-12-01T08:55:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-03T07:40:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Oral health was the topic of a recent summit in Louisville focused on oral health policies and initiatives.\n\u201cFor us to identify enhancements or better oral health, we need to focus on the population that will have access to oral health care,\u201d Maesaka said.\nFor the first time since 2001, an oral health survey will be undertaken in Kentucky.\nThe initiative, by insurer Delta Dental of Kentucky, seeks to assess the oral health of Kentucky\u2019s children and determine the need for additional dental programs.\nThe Making Smiles Happen Surveillance Initiative will assess the oral health of Kentucky third- and sixth-grade students."}
