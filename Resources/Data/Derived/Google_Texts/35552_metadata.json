But the Lac-Megantic derailment, and subsequent rail accidents in Alabama, North Dakota and New Brunswick, suggest further measures are required, he said.\n\nThe AAR is already moving toward a more-stringent standard for railcars used to carry dangerous goods, and Mr. Ross said his agency believes the Canadian government needs to do likewise.\n\n\u201cWhat we are recommending is much more akin to what the industry is proposing,\u201d Mr. Ross told Canada Real Time Thursday, after the TSB issued three separate recommendations \u2014 dealing with railcars, route analysis and compulsory emergency-response plans \u2014 aimed at boosting rail safety given the rapid increase in the amount of crude oil carried on North America\u2019s tracks.\n\nThe TSB is also calling on Canada to \u201cimmediately\u201d phase out older rail cars, like the ones used by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd. to carry crude oil from North Dakota\u2019s Bakken region to a refinery in New Brunswick.\n\n\u201cThe emphasis needs to be on ensuring the tankers transporting dangerous goods provide enough protection,\u201d Mr. Ross said.\n\nCanadian Transport Minister Lisa Raitt has instructed her officials \u201cto review the recommendations on an urgent basis,\u201d her spokeswoman said Thursday.\n\nMr. Ross\u2019s investigation into the Lac-Megantic derailment continues, and he spoke to Canada Real Time about developments to date. The following is an edited transcript of the conversation:\n\nWSJ: Would better-equipped cars, as the TSB is recommending, have reduced the damage done at Lac-Megantic?\n\nMr. Ross: Certainly, cars with additional safety features \u2014 full head shields, head jackets, thermally protected \u2014 would have helped.\n\nWSJ: What have tests shown about the characteristics of the Bakken crude involved in the Lac-Megantic derailment?\n\nMr. Ross: We\u2019ve analyzed some of the data \u2026 and issued a safety advisory in September saying shippers need to make sure these dangerous goods are properly described when they are in transit. The crude in Lac-Megantic was labelled as level 3 when it should have been the [more-flammable] level 2. We haven\u2019t finished all the analysis with that oil. We have had people coming forward asking if we\u2019ve checked for this element and that one. So there\u2019s a whole spectrum of things we are looking at and that work is not complete.\n\nWSJ: But so far, is there anything that has raised eyebrows about that Bakken crude? And what do you think accounts for the explosive nature?\n\nMr. Ross: Not at this point. It\u2019s described as a light sweet crude and our testing so far is consistent so far with that type of terminology. As far as sulphur levels and so on, we are looking at that. I have heard the suggestion about gassy crude. But there is no accepted industry method for testing for gassy crude. That\u2019s the challenge. We were surprised by the enormity of the fire in Lac-Megantic. And we are trying to answer those questions, to determine whether there was something different.\n\nWSJ: Should the goods have been shipped in a pressurized tank car?\n\nMr. Ross: If there is something new on the market \u2014 and I am not saying there is \u2014 then you have to make sure you have good testing and a good understanding of what that product is, and what are the associated risks. When you have those answers, then you can say what type of packaging is required to make sure it is transported safely.\n\n\u2013Russell Gold contributed to this article\n\nPaul Vieira", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Canadian investigators believe the Canadian government's plan to beef up standards for new railcars used to ship dangerous goods doesn't go far enough.", "title": "Canada Needs to Get Even Tougher on Railcars: Lac-Megantic Investigator", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/canadarealtime/2014/01/23/canada-needs-to-get-even-tougher-on-railcars-lac-megantic-investigator/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJcanada", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Canada Needs to Get Even Tougher on Railcars: Lac-Megantic Investigator", "description": "Canadian investigators believe the Canadian government's plan to beef up standards for new railcars used to ship dangerous goods doesn't go far enough.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Paul Vieira", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Canada Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Canada Real Time", "article.summary": "Canadian investigators believe the Canadian government's plan to beef up standards for new railcars used to ship dangerous goods doesn't go far enough.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-23T19:38:20-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/canadarealtime/2014/01/23/canada-needs-to-get-even-tougher-on-railcars-lac-megantic-investigator/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-CDRTB-3823", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Canadian investigators believe the Canadian government's plan to beef up standards for new railcars used to ship dangerous goods doesn't go far enough.", "title": "Canada Needs to Get Even Tougher on Railcars: Lac-Megantic Investigator", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/canadarealtime/2014/01/23/canada-needs-to-get-even-tougher-on-railcars-lac-megantic-investigator/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Canada Real Time", "article.id": "BL-CDRTB-3823", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-23T19:41:06-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc029\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe emphasis needs to be on ensuring the tankers transporting dangerous goods provide enough protection,\u201d Mr. Ross said.\nThe AAR is already moving toward a more-stringent standard for railcars used to carry dangerous goods, and Mr. Ross said his agency believes the Canadian government needs to do likewise.\nMr. Ross\u2019s investigation into the Lac-Megantic derailment continues, and he spoke to Canada Real Time about developments to date.\nThe crude in Lac-Megantic was labelled as level 3 when it should have been the [more-flammable] level 2.\nAssociated PressThe lead investigator into last summer\u2019s Quebec rail disaster said he believes the Canadian government\u2019s plan to beef up standards for new railcars used to ship dangerous goods doesn\u2019t go far enough."}
