Facing a Democratic majority in the House and a slim GOP edge in the Senate - and lacking George W. Bush's star power - the new Republican governor set policy goals on core issues, such as education, met with lawmakers and spent much of his time traveling the state.  The death toll included bills to ban the execution of murderers with mental retardation, overhaul Medicaid, ease undocumented immigrants' efforts to get driver's licenses and ensure that doctors were paid more promptly by managed-care companies.  The vetoes carried darker themes, too, raising questions about special-interest influence that have dogged him and foreshadowing the indictment that casts a shadow on his final months in office, on charges that he abused his authority with a 2013 veto of funding for the Austin district attorney's public integrity office.  By virtue of his longevity, Perry has filled every spot on every appointed Texas board and commission with like-minded officials who have picked high-profile battles over issues like higher education, making the state resemble a cabinet form of government and further elevating his national profile.  Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, as secretary of state; San Antonio attorney Wallace Jefferson, a descendant of slaves whom Perry named as the first African-American member and later chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court; and Houston attorney Eva Guzman, the first Latina to serve on the court.  Perry's agenda largely has delighted conservatives, although some have joined in questioning such items as economic development grants that critics liken to slush funds.  Under Perry, critics point to the appointment of donors to key posts; the state's award of Texas Enterprise Fund grants to companies tied to contributions to him or the Republican Governors Association, which he previously headed; and state cancer research grants that went to those who contributed to Perry and the cancer agency he championed.  The Enterprise Fund was roasted over lax oversight in a state audit last year, and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute was overhauled after questions arose about grant oversight, including the indictment of an agency administrator over a grant that was not properly reviewed.  Politically, Perry has a lot to prove after his error-plagued presidential race in 2012, in which he entered the annals of presidential debate history by remembering only two of three federal agencies he wanted to shut down, finally giving up with an \"oops.\"  At great cost to his support among the GOP base in his run for president, Perry has stood by a 2001 law he signed allowing undocumented immigrants brought here as children to qualify for in-state college tuition.  Despite opposition from a number of conservative groups and many Republican lawmakers, he signed a hate crimes law named after James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged to death behind a pickup in Jasper in 1998.  McBee called the hate-crimes measure \"my proudest moment, probably, to be around\" Perry, who had been credited with keeping the Senate from melting down over the hate-crimes issue as lieutenant governor in the 1999 session, then criticized by some for sending mixed signals on the bill when he became governor before finally signing it.  Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat who championed the hate-crimes bill, said he believed Perry had tried to kill the high-profile measure in 2001, after at least giving an appearance of trying to mediate a compromise as lieutenant governor two years earlier.  Perry, whose career tracks the GOP's rise, has legendary political instincts that he has acted on with bravado, boosted by luck and by his reputation as a tireless, no-holds-barred campaigner.  Elected to the Texas House as a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party to take on favored incumbent Democratic Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower in an uphill 1990 race that yielded him a surprise win.  Besides hard work and tough campaign ads, Perry at times has had an assist from good instincts and good fortune.  Republican Party of Texas Chairman Steve Munisteri called Perry arguably the fourth-most important Republican in the state's history - after John Tower, who was elected U.S. senator in 1961 as the first Republican to win a statewide race since Reconstruction; Ronald Reagan, whose popularity dramatically boosted the party by attracting conservative Democrats; and Bill Clements, the first Republican elected governor since Reconstruction.  Angelo said Perry \"made a huge contribution to the growth of the party in Texas,\" including his support of Republicans running against Democrats in the Texas House, which helped turn the chamber red in the 2002 election and paved the way for 2003 congressional redistricting so onerous to Democratic lawmakers that they fled the state in an effort to stop it.  Perry's combination of political skill, hard work and luck carried him right up until his first White House bid, which he launched with little preparation after back surgery left him in pain and proved to interfere with his ability to sleep.  The combination proved lethal to his prospects, leaving him grasping for words and sometimes acting oddly, including his giggling and groping of a bottle of maple syrup in a widely viewed video.  Since his 2010 re-election, taxpayers have been billed more than $3.3 million for his security detail's travel expenses on out-of-state trips, including $1.8 million during his run for the 2012 presidential nod.", "vf": {"section": "local", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-6007179"}, "author.name": "By Peggy Fikac and Mike Ward", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "AUSTIN - When his predecessor ascended to the White House 14 years ago, Rick Perry glided into the governorship and was dismissed by some as an accidental governor who lucked into Texas' top job with his automatic promotion from lieutenant governor.
