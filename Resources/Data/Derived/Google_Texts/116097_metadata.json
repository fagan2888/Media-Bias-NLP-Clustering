I never want to offend anyone.\n\nBut I walked through a stinking gray cloud of smoke on 16th Street in Denver last week, looked at the winners who were sucking on the smoldering tobacco, and began to wonder: Who the heck still smokes cigarettes?\n\nRemember, we\u2019re talking 50 years after the Surgeon General said in no uncertain terms that smoking will likely kill you.\n\nI smoked. For some 30 years. Quit nine years ago. And I don\u2019t want to be one of those obnoxious, holier-than-thou former smokers who insult and belittle current smokers.\n\nBut it turns out \u2014 and this isn\u2019t me talking here but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta \u2014 that people who continue to smoke cigarettes are stupid. Or ignorant. Or uneducated. Or all three.\n\nFrom a 2010 CDC study: \u201cThe overall prevalence of smoking declines with increasing years of education. In 2009, the prevalence of cigarette smoking ranged from 9 percent among college graduates to 28.9 percent among those with less than a high school diploma.\u201d\n\nSo if we get rid of big words like \u201cprevalence\u201d so you smokers might understand it, what the report is saying is that if you smoke cigarettes today, you:\n\n\u2022 Probably stared at the orange juice carton this morning because it said \u201cconcentrate.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sold your car for gas money.\n\n\u2022 Once got locked inside a mattress store overnight and slept on the floor.\n\nLike smokers, the habit is slowly dying. The American Cancer Society says 42 percent of American adults smoked in 1965. Today it\u2019s just 18 percent.\n\nThat puts you smokers in what statisticians call a \u201csmaller group\u201d because there are \u201cfewer of you.\u201d And let\u2019s not even bring up the \u201cyellow teeth.\u201d\n\nCigarettes cause 480,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Ten times more Americans have died from cigarettes than have died in all the wars fought by the U.S. in its history. Smoking causes more deaths each year than HIV, illegal drug use, alcohol use, car crashes and gunfire. Combined.\n\nHere, many of you smokers are wheezing, coughing up a ball of greenish stuff, trying to get out of your beanbag chair and are saying, \u201cSo, what\u2019s with all that stuff about us being stuppid and unedumacated?\u201d\n\nGlad you asked. And remember, these are not my studies. As the old saying goes, don\u2019t blow a noseful of disgusting, low-life, arsenic-filled cigarette smoke at the messenger.\n\nFrom the CDC: \u201cBehavioral problems have also been linked to smoking. Studies have shown that students who smoke are also more likely to use other drugs, get in fights, carry weapons, try to kill themselves and take part in risky sex.\u201d\n\nSmoking, as we were told in 1964, causes lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and emphysema, to name the biggies. It also causes other people to point at you and laugh.\n\nCigarettes contain more than 7,000 chemicals, including formaldehyde, which is used to embalm the dead. It also contains cadmium (used to make batteries), arsenic, carbon monoxide (car exhaust), hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, butane and toluene (also found in paint thinner.)\n\nWhich makes it even more dangerous than the smoke you inhaled as a kid \u2014 when they had to burn down your school to get you out of the third grade.\n\nContact Rich Tosches at richtosches@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tosches: Really?
