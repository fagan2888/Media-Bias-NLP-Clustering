I tell him we buy what we need, and not more. I tell him I have enough money for food, but nothing else. I tell him I don\u2019t buy treats for myself.\n\n\u201cYou buy art supplies,\u201d my son says. And I\u2019m stumped.\n\nBecause of course he\u2019s right.\n\nI often make less in a month than some people spend on cable.\n\nI live in Appalachia, in the poorest county in my state. I often make less in a month than some people spend on cable, though my son and I don\u2019t have cable. We don\u2019t always have trash collection. I drive a 15-year-old car with dents in the back and a scrape on the side that will never get fixed, and I\u2019m behind on medical bills.\n\nBut I do buy art supplies.\n\nOne of my first memories is of drawing. I\u2019m sitting below the table while my parents have dinner; I\u2019m drawing their portraits. Outside, rural Indiana is flat and abandoned. Our road is gravel. Our neighbors have trailers. But in the warmth of the kitchen, I draw and dream.\n\nI don\u2019t remember being specifically encouraged in art as a child, but I was encouraged to be creative. I was encouraged to occupy myself. I was told, when I complained to my mother that I was bored, \u201cIs your imagination broken?\u201d\n\nWhen I became a mother \u2014 and then, a solo mother \u2014 I found myself saying the same words to my son. I filled an old suitcase with art supplies, and put the suitcase in the living room. Mostly, I did it to distract him, to gain a few minutes so I could fold laundry, or start dinner.\n\nBut something happened: my child came to love art.\n\nA few years ago, I took him to a \u201cFirst Friday\u201d event, a street fair when the stores \u2014 those that are still in business \u2014 stay open late, and there are hot dogs and a high school band. Kids were playing in a fountain, but my kid starting sobbing because he wanted to see paintings. He had heard me mention an art gallery \u2014 and he had to see the paintings there.\n\nMy son became enamored with paintings after seeing the art I make at night after he\u2019s asleep. Most nights I fall asleep working as a freelance reporter, drifting off over my laptop, but some mornings, it\u2019s paper and paint pens that litter the quilt when he wanders into my room. He holds the images up. He has questions. He has favorites, and constructive criticism.\n\nNot long ago, in the midst of making what I thought was a couch fort, he made his own art gallery. He turned the biggest cushion on its side and taped up his creations to the fabric. He\u2019s also done an \u201cinstallation\u201d in which he taped greeting cards, string, an odd piece of paper from a grocery bag he cut out himself, and small toys to the wall. He did this after seeing me arrange my own postcards on the wall of our rented place, to cover a water stain.\n\nWhy is it important to have art even in poverty? Why is it important to make it? Why spend time trying to make things look nice?\n\nOne of my jobs as a poor mother is to make things, to stretch the laundry detergent with water, to fit the screws back in the car door with wire.\n\nMy child is observant \u2014 he knows we struggle \u2014 and is prone to worry. It\u2019s just clothes, I tell him when he has a play date that will end in mud and wet grass. It\u2019s okay if they get dirty. That means you\u2019re having fun.\n\nFun is okay, I tell myself. It\u2019s okay to be happy. It\u2019s okay not to spend every second working. It\u2019s okay not to spend every second worrying. It\u2019s okay to forget sometimes \u2014 briefly \u2014 the creditors on the answering machine, the possibility that we might have to move again, my cough that I can\u2019t afford to get checked out.\n\nWhy do I bother making things?\n\nOne of my jobs as a poor mother is to make things, to stretch the laundry detergent with water, to fit the screws back in the car door with wire. What is living in poverty if not constantly being creative? Continually making it work? Making the unbearable, bearable. Making the money last. Making the unlivable not just livable, but survivable.\n\nSo I cover up scuffs in shoes with marker. I use baking soda to wash my face. Every leftover portion from dinner, I carefully wrap and freeze.\n\nSelf-sufficiency is a hallmark of Appalachian life, as is DIY ingenuity. Everything is jerry-rigged, slapped or duct-taped together. One Christmas, my friend helped me chop a tiny evergreen, but when I got it home, I realized I had nothing to put it in. So I filled a pot with water, propped the tree in it, and secured it to the pot handles with rubber bands. Appalachian tree stand.\n\nThat\u2019s the descriptor for what we do \u2014 and it\u2019s a brand of honor. Appalachian tanning bed: a blanket in the sun. Appalachian recycling bin: throw your empties out the window.\n\nThere is more to this life than struggle; there is also great love. I learned that when my son was a newborn, and the knocks on the door began: strangers with mason jars of soup and trays of rice and beans. I learned it when my son was a toddler, and a friend\u2019s father gave him a bicycle and spent hours helping me teach him to ride.\n\nLiving in Appalachia, being surrounded by people who are the kindest, most generous I have ever met, even though they have the least, has allowed me to find a way when it seemed there was no way. It has made me feel strong and capable at the hardest points of my life. It has also allowed me to give. When I feel like I have nothing, I can give my son the gift of creativity, the gift of imagination, the gift of spending a happy hour painting cardboard on the porch.\n\nYes, the porch is splintered, and it doesn\u2019t belong to us and we don\u2019t own the land \u2014 we don\u2019t own any land, not yet \u2014 but the paint is bright, the colors are true and my son smiles.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "pubdate": 20160423, "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "In the toy aisle, which is inconveniently next to the bread aisle, I tell my 5-year-old son we are not getting a truck today.
