Mr. Kerr got his answer. The Assembly Committee members that opposed the bill effectively said that a high quality Obamacare plan was inadequate.

"AB 1865 provides a simple exemption from healthcare double payments", commented Assemblyman Jim Patterson. "Savings generated from this fix could be used for a variety of things such as increased wages for current employees, upgrading equipment or tools, or best of all, creating a job for a new employee."

"I was disappointed by the vote in the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee," added Tami Chapman a California rebar contractor and President of ABC of California. "On one hand President Obama introduced the Affordable Care Act to ensure that all Americans have access to quality health insurance at an affordable price; yet today a Legislative Committee said an Obamacare compliant plan wasn't good enough and employers have to pay into a healthcare plan that their core employees will not use. Seems like a waste of resources to me."
