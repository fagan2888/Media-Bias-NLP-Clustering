Messina is also famous as the White House staffer who told Democrats to \u201cpunch back twice as hard\u201d in town hall meetings on Obamacare in 2009, and as the campaign manager for President Obama\u2019s negatively-themed re-election in 2012.\n\nCurrently, Messina works for companies like Uber and Airbandb, selling his connections in the Obama administration for a hefty price. Venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar told Bloomberg News: \u201cWe call him \u2018The Wolf,\u2019 \u201d after the Pulp Fiction character who helps the mob dispose of dead bodies and manage other crisis. Bloomberg\u2019s Brad Stone calls Messina \u201ca consigliere for startups that need help winning over legislators\u201d\u2013and notes he works for Clinton\u2019s super PAC all the while.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m pretty committed to getting Mrs. Clinton elected,\u201d Messina told Stone, though he admits that his millions in consulting fees help to \u201cpay the rent.\u201d He maintains that his paid work is for companies and causes that \u201cI really believe in.\u201d\n\nHis clients seem happy: one CEO gushed that Messina was able to use his connections to set up an immediate meeting with California transportation officials that would have taken any other company six months to arrange.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Messina boasted that President Obama \u201cput in place the most sweeping ethics reforms in history to close the revolving door between government and lobbyists.\u201d He criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Citizens United case for \u201caccelerat[ing] a dangerous trend toward a political system increasingly dominated by big-money interests with disproportionate power to spend freely to influence our elections and our government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama-Turned-Clinton Aide Makes 'Tens of Millions' as Silicon Valley's D.C.
