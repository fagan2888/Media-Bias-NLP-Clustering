The goal is to establish a \u201cfederal family leave policy that is on par with leading private-sector companies and other industrialized nations,\u201d the document stated.\n\nHouse Democrats last week reintroduced legislation that would give new federal parents six weeks of paid leave. Earlier this month, Obama signed an executive order allowing feds to use up to six weeks of paid sick leave up front to care for a new child or an ill family member. Now, federal workers can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave through the 1993 Family Leave Act, or tap their accrued sick and annual leave to avoid three months without a paycheck.\n\nThe $4 trillion budget released Monday also plugged phased retirement, despite the fact that no agency has implemented it yet, and some have said they might never offer the benefit. Phased retirement allows eligible feds to work 20 hours per week, receiving half their pay as well as half their retirement annuity, while mentoring their successors.\n\n\u201cThese efforts are essential for developing a nimble, efficient 21st century workforce that can help ensure agencies achieve their important missions under a tightening fiscal climate,\u201d the budget document said of phased retirement. The Office of Personnel Management issued final rules on partial retirement in August, more than two years after Congress passed the law, and the agency said eligible federal employees could submit applications starting on Nov. 6, 2014. But the reality is that most feds will have a longer wait because individual agencies have to devise their own plans for implementing phased retirement that meet the needs of their missions as well as collective bargaining agreements.\n\nObama\u2019s proposed budget acknowledged the sacrifices the federal workforce has made over the last few years \u2013 pay freezes and increased contributions to retirement benefits, for example \u2013 coupled with furloughs resulting from sequestration and the 2013 government shutdown.\n\n\u201cDuring five years of delayed budgets, sequestration, pay freezes and award caps, federal employees have come in every day to serve their country,\u201d the White House document said. \u201cIn 2014 alone, federal employees addressed a wide range of national priorities \u2013 from responding to the Ebola outbreak to working to end veterans\u2019 homelessness to implementing the Affordable Care Act\u2026. Thanks in part to the efforts of federal employees, the economy is recovering.\u201d\n\nSome federal employee advocates were not thrilled with the president\u2019s 1.3 percent pay raise proposal, which is slightly more than the 1 percent raise in 2014 and 2015. Before that, federal civilian employees were under a three-year pay freeze. \u201cLet\u2019s be real \u2013 a 1.3 percent pay raise will be eaten up by higher costs for groceries, health care and other essentials,\u201d said American Federation of Government Employees National President J. David Cox Sr., in a statement. \u201cLike other middle-class workers, federal employees need a meaningful pay raise to make up for years of stagnant wages, and unfortunately the president\u2019s proposal falls short.\u201d The National Treasury Employees Union called the recommended 1.3 percent pay boost \u201cinadequate,\u201d but applauded the White House for seeking an end to sequestration, which returns to full strength in fiscal 2016.\n\nThe National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association said that it was \u201ctime to start closing the growing gap between public- and private-sector wages\u201d and the recommended 1.3 percent pay bump doesn\u2019t go far enough in doing that. Still, NARFE praised the administration for not including in its fiscal 2016 budget proposals a switch to the chained CPI for retirees\u2019 annual cost-of-living adjustments, or increases in how much current feds contribute to their pensions. Those ideas have been part of past Obama budgets.\n\nThe fiscal 2016 budget proposal includes a lot of data on the size and compensation of the federal workforce over the decades, as well as comparisons between public- and private-sector pay for certain occupations. The push for increased flexibility for federal workers to improve recruitment and retention, including \u201cbreaking down barriers\u201d to telework, indicate that the administration is emphasizing better benefits rather than seeking major boosts in pay. The latter has been the subject of much debate for years \u2013 namely, whether federal employees are over- or underpaid compared to their private sector counterparts.\n\n\u201cCompensation for highly educated federal workers (or those in more complex jobs) is lower than for comparable workers in the private sector, whereas the Congressional Budget Office found the opposite for less educated workers,\u201d said the fiscal 2016 budget analysis. \u201cThese findings suggest that across-the-board compensation increases or cuts may not be the most efficient use of federal resources.\u201d\n\nOn the military personnel side, Obama also is seeking a 1.3 percent pay raise for troops next year. The White House also continues to call for reforming the military compensation system to rein in ballooning costs while providing \u201crobust\u201d pay and benefits to honor service members and their families. Some proposals echo recommendations from the recently-released Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission report, including auto-enrolling service members into the Thrift Savings Plan. Other proposals, such as creating an enrollment fee for new TRICARE for Life beneficiaries and tying TRICARE fees to retired recipients\u2019 income, have been part of previous Obama budgets.\n\nThe fiscal 2016 budget document also calls for replacing TRICARE by Jan. 1, 2017, with a \u201cconsolidated health plan that incorporates cost-sharing for certain members.\u201d The commission has recommended moving family members and some retirees out of TRICARE and onto health insurance plans in the private sector, similar to the menu of choices civilian federal employees have under the coverage.\n\nThe budget proposes a 1.5 percent increase in the basic housing allowance for service members, and a 3.4 percent increase in the basic subsistence allowance.\n\n(Image via Photographee.eu / Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kellie Lunney", "description": "The president\\'s fiscal 2016 recommendations focus on more flexibility for the federal workforce.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "The president\\'s fiscal 2016 recommendations focus on more flexibility for the federal workforce.", "title": "Obama Budget Pushes Paid Parental Leave, Phased Retirement", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2015/02/obama-budget-pushes-paid-parental-leave-phased-retirement/104307/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/02/02/020215flexibility.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president's fiscal 2016 recommendations focus on more flexibility for the federal workforce.", "title": "Obama Budget Pushes Paid Parental Leave, Phased Retirement", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/02/02/020215flexibility/open-graph.jpg", "creator": "@klunney", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-02T20:15:41Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/02/02/020215flexibility.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Obama Budget Pushes Paid Parental Leave, Phased Retirement", "sailthru.tags": "military-pay-raise,pay-raise,2016-budget,channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-long,site-govexec", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/02/02/020215flexibility/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "keywords": "military pay raise, tricare, pay raise, 2016 budget, paid leave, phased retirement", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "The president's fiscal 2016 recommendations focus on more flexibility for the federal workforce."}, "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s fiscal 2016 budget supports increasing flexibility for civilian federal workers through benefits like paid parental leave and phased retirement, in addition to a 1.3 percent pay raise for next year.\nThe budget document reiterated the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to offer federal workers paid leave to care for the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child.\nNow, federal workers can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave through the 1993 Family Leave Act, or tap their accrued sick and annual leave to avoid three months without a paycheck.\nThe latter has been the subject of much debate for years \u2013 namely, whether federal employees are over- or underpaid compared to their private sector counterparts.\nHouse Democrats last week reintroduced legislation that would give new federal parents six weeks of paid leave."}
