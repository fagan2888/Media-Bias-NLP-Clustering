And he later eared criticism nationally when footage of his comments about U.S. voters went viral. The dust-up resonated particularly loudly in Vermont, where the Shumlin administration had hired Gruber to perform economic modeling on its ill-fated single-payer health care system.\n\nAudio from this story will be posted at approximately 11 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 23.\n\nThe single-payer financing proposal has since been shelved, thanks in part to the results of Gruber\u2019s modeling. But for State Auditor Doug Hoffer, serious questions remain about the state\u2019s contract with the noted MIT economist.\n\n\u201cContracts are a serious business,\u201d Hoffer says. \u201cAnd if you agree to the terms of a contract then you have an obligation to meet those requirements, and he has not met those requirements. And the people who paid him, i.e. the taxpayers of the state of Vermont \u2026 We have every reason to expect him to abide by the terms of the contract. And there are some outstanding questions that we have a right to know the answer to.\u201d\n\nHoffer is a Progressive/Democrat. And unlike some of Gruber\u2019s previous adversaries, he doesn\u2019t stand to gain politically by scrutinizing the state\u2019s contract with him.\n\n\"Contracts are a serious business. And if you agree to the terms of a contract then you have an obligation to meet those requirements, and he [Jonathan Gruber] has not met those requirements.\" - State Auditor Doug Hoffer\n\nHoffer says he decided to conduct the inquiry after being contacted, independently, by three different lawmakers \u2013 Rep. Oliver Olsen, an Independent from Jamaica; Sen. Joe Benning, a Republican from Caledonia County; and. Sen. Chris Bray, a Democrat from Addison County.\n\nThe Shumlin administration has paid Gruber $160,000 so far, as payment on two invoices submitted by Gruber last year. But Hoffer says those invoices lacked even basic information about the work Gruber or his workers performed. Each invoice billed $100,000 \u2013 $50,000 for 100 hours of work by Gruber, a $500 per hour; and $50,000 for 500 hours of work by his \u201cresearch assistants,\u201d at $100 per hour.\n\nThe state \u201cheld back\u201d 20 percent of the total bill pending final resolution of the contract, as is customary. The contract originally had a maximum value of more than $400,000. After the national controversy surrounding Gruber ignited, the state amended the maximum value, to $260,000, and said it would pay only for work performed by Gruber\u2019s assistants, not work done by Gruber himself.\n\n\u201cThe contract called for a description of the work performed. He simply says we worked these many hours. On the face of it, it does not appear to meet the terms of the contract,\u201d Hoffer says.\n\nHoffer says he\u2019s asked Gruber for more detailed documentation of his work. Hoffer says Gruber's responses to those inquiries have been \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\nHoffer made the requests to Gruber through Robin Lunge, director of health reform for the Shumlin administration. Specifically, Hoffer says he wants more substantial documentation of the number of \u201chours worked, the employment status of research assistant or assistants, [and] the actual dollar paid to them.\u201d\n\nLunge says that the invoices do meet the minimum invoicing requirements stipulated in the contract. She says the invoices show both the number of hours worked, as well as a description, however brief. The description in the invoice reads, quote \u201cconsulting and modeling on the Green Mountain Care proposal.\u201d\n\n\"I feel confident that we've gotten our money's worth in terms of both the amount of work as well as the quality of the work that we received.\" - Robin Lunge, director of health reform for the Shumlin administration\n\nAnd Lunge says she worked hand-in-glove with Gruber and his team for the duration of the contract. The Gruber controversy spurred numerous records requests for communications between him and the administration. And Lunge says those emails, first chronicled in a story by the Vermont Press Bureau, provided her with a comprehensive understanding of the work Gruber was doing.\n\n\u201cI think as is illustrated by the thousands of documents and emails we released between Dr. Gruber and the staff, including myself, I feel confident that we\u2019ve gotten our money\u2019s worth in terms of both the amount of work as well as the quality of the work that we received,\u201d Lunge says.\n\nHoffer says that may be so. But he says it doesn\u2019t mean Gruber or the administration can bypass the statutory requirements governing state contracts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Gruber per se, it\u2019s about the administration and its ability and willingness to hold personal service contractors to the terms of these contracts,\u201d Hoffer says. \u201cIt\u2019s just contract stuff, and the administration needs to do a better job, because they approved payments that I think most people say on first glance, 'this isn\u2019t sufficient.'\"\n\nHoffer, who has subpoena power for state contracts, says he\u2019s in the process of submitting more requests for information to Gruber. Gruber declined comment for this story, as did the three legislators who asked Hoffer to conduct an audit.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Health economist Jonathan Gruber won notoriety last year for his unflattering remarks about the \u201cstupidity of the American voter.\u201d But here in Vermont,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "VPR News", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/states-contract-economist-jonathan-gruber-under-scrutiny", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/styles/medium/public/201501/gruber-ap-riley-20141209_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Health economist Jonathan Gruber won notoriety last year for his unflattering remarks about the \u201cstupidity of the American voter.\u201d But here in Vermont,", "title": "State's Contract With Economist Jonathan Gruber Under Scrutiny"}, "story_id": 379180993, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@vprnet"}, "author": "Peter Hirschfeld", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "State&#039;s Contract With Economist Jonathan Gruber Under Scrutiny"}, "nid": 32656, "datePublished": "2015-01-22", "keywords": "Government & Politics, Health Care, Doug Hoffer, VPR News", "wordCount": 866, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But for State Auditor Doug Hoffer, serious questions remain about the state\u2019s contract with the noted MIT economist.\nOn the face of it, it does not appear to meet the terms of the contract,\u201d Hoffer says.\nBut Hoffer says those invoices lacked even basic information about the work Gruber or his workers performed.\nThe Shumlin administration has paid Gruber $160,000 so far, as payment on two invoices submitted by Gruber last year.\nAnd if you agree to the terms of a contract then you have an obligation to meet those requirements, and he [Jonathan Gruber] has not met those requirements.\""}
