But then again you can say that about nearly anything Obama does.\n\nDeputy National Security Adviser and MFA in creative writing Ben Rhodes likened an Iranian nuclear deal to Obamacare in a talk to progressive activists last January, according to audio obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nRhodes by the way is considered Suspect #1 in the Chickens__tgate scandal.\n\n\u201cBottom line is, this is the best opportunity we\u2019ve had to resolve the Iranian issue diplomatically, certainly since President Obama came to office, and probably since the beginning of the Iraq war,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cSo no small opportunity, it\u2019s a big deal.

He's invaded countries without Congress. What's a little thing like unilaterally letting one of the country's worst enemies get a nuclear bomb.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "So it won't work, will cost a lot of money and kill a bunch of people.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "So it won't work, will cost a lot of money and kill a bunch of people.", "title": "Obama Security Adviser: Iran Deal is Our ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/244316/obama-security-adviser-iran-deal-our-obamacare-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:18-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/244316/obama-security-adviser-iran-deal-our-obamacare-daniel-greenfield", "description": "So it won't work, will cost a lot of money and kill a bunch of people.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Security Adviser: Iran Deal is Our ObamaCare"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-01T19:30:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb312\"", "article_summary": "This is probably the biggest thing President Obama will do in his second term on foreign policy.\nThis is healthcare for us, just to put it in context.\u201dBy \"resolve\", Rhodes means let Iran get the bomb.\nDeputy National Security Adviser and MFA in creative writing Ben Rhodes likened an Iranian nuclear deal to Obamacare in a talk to progressive activists last January, according to audio obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\nYou can see why Rhodes would want to spend his time smearing Netanyahu since the Israeli leader is the big obstacle to Obama's Iranian bomb campaign.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already kind of thinking through, how do we structure a deal so we don\u2019t necessarily require legislative action right away,\u201d Rhodes said."}
