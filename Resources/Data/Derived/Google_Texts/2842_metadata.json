So we decided to step up the brunches a notch and not just focus on ourselves, but give the congregation another way to be part of our outreach to various organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who doesn\u2019t love food?\u201d Wade continued. \u201cWe realized if all the Deacons chip in, help cook and serve, we could do something really exciting. We could help the community while also building community within the church. The brunches are a fun way for church members and visitors to enjoy good food, quality time with each other and the chance to get to know new people. And we also raise extra funds for important ministries. The first one went great.\u201d\n\nWade was referring to St. Mark\u2019s recent \u201cBrunch for a Cause,\u201d which benefitted both Creative Identity and The Lynn House.\n\n\u201cWhen we put an organization\u2019s name and a face to it, people see where the funds are going and get excited about it,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are St. Mark, we are the voice of St. Mark, and we represent the church to our communities. We have a passion for social justice and the people in our communities. We get involved and volunteer in our different outreach involvements as much as we can, and this is one of many ways we can make a difference.\u201d\n\nCreative Identity is a 501 (c) (3), nonprofit music and art-based day care program in Anaheim that serves adults, 18 years and older, who have intellectual and developmental disabilities. The program is based on the\n\nfundamental belief that music and the expressive arts can promote positive change on all levels of human health, well-being, and foster development.\n\nThe Lynn House in Costa Mesa is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit home that provides a healing environment for women struggling with drugs and alcohol and who are trying to restore themselves physically, emotionally, spiritually, socially and professionally. Over 5,000 nights of shelter and 15,000 meals are provided to impoverished women each year.\n\n\u201cWe had a great turnout for the brunch,\u201d explained Deborah Mayhew, an Elder at St. Mark. \u201cThe Deacons all worked hard to make the event a success for these very worthy organizations. A special treat was the jazz music provided by Elena Gilliam and the George Gilliam Trio who had people up dancing!\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge Gilliam is a music therapist and jazz musician who founded Creative Identity,\u201d Mayhew continued. \u201cA group of Creative Identity singers also provided some of our worship music that morning. It was very moving.\u201d\n\nThe next \u201cBrunch for a Cause\u201d will be Sunday August 17 at 10:30 a.m. and will be a fiesta theme featuring breakfast tacos. The cost is $10 for adults and $3 for children.\n\nThe brunch will benefit Penny Lane, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit that provides care for over 3500 abused and neglected children, youth and families every month. It provides therapeutic residential services, foster family home placements, adoption services, transitional and affordable housing, family preservation, and mental health services for children youth and families through Los Angeles and Orange County.\n\nFor more information, go to stmarkpresbyterian.org.\n\nCindy can be reached at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "faith, religion, st. mark presbyterian, newport beach, newport coast, corona del mar, education, entertainment, arts, books, music, headlines, health, lifestyle, politics, sports, science, technology", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Newport Local News", "description": "\u201cSt. Mark has been doing\u00a0summer brunches\u00a0for a while, but earlier this year the Deacons wondered if we could use them for a cause, to help and supplement organizations we already represent within our traditional budget,\u201d said Robin Wade, Deacon at St. Mark Presbyterian. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about our new leadership at the church; we\u2019re growing and seeing different ways to make an impact.
