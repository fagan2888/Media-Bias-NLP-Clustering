(DAILY CALLER) Democratic Florida Rep. Joe Garcia — fresh off being caught eating his own earwax on camera — was caught red-handed (or is it yellow-fingered?) in another gaffe this week, claiming that low crime rates in border cities with lots of federal immigration workers is proof that “Communism works.”

WND: Democrat caught on live TV in ‘revolting action’

Garcia made the comment during a Google hangout he convened last week to talk about comprehensive immigration reform with supporters. The Democrat attempted to point out how, for all their talk about limited government, many Republicans are fine spending loads of government money on border security.

“Let me give you an example, the kind of money we’ve poured in,” he said. “So the most dangerous — sorry, the safest city in America is El Paso, Texas. It happens to be across the border from the most dangerous city in the Americas, which is Juarez. Right?”

Sound off on congressman who says, 'Communism works' He's right

It's just innocent hyperbole

He was just poking fun at GOP right-wingers, listen in context

It 'works,' if the people have agreed to be slaves of the state

Finally, a Democrat who's honest about what he believes

He's a Democrat. Of course he thinks that. They all do

Well, it appears Sen. Joseph McCarthy was onto something after all

What do you expect from a guy who munches on his own earwax on live TV?

How does he figure? Communism is responsible for the cold-blooded murder of hundreds of millions and the utter decimation of the human spirit

There are still some countries to move to if he feels that way
