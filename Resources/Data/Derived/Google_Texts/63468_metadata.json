It gives customers the option to pay a flat fee of $80 per adult per month to visit as many times as they need.\n\nInside, there are doctors, but there are also health coaches, a yoga studio, and a kitchen that features cooking classes. All part of the monthly charge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an innovative primary care ecosystem,\u201d says Dr. Zubin Damania, the founder and CEO.\n\nYou can also step into the future, as well as the past, by going to a website that proudly proclaims \u201cThe House Call Is Back.\u201d\n\nHeal offers an iPhone app that lets you request a doctor to come to your home.\n\nWithin an hour, a physician and a medical assistant will arrive to examine you or your sick child, perform blood work or other tests if needed, and authorize a prescription if it\u2019s warranted. All for $99.\n\nThe service now operates in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with plans to expand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing medicine to people\u2019s homes,\u201d says Dr. Renee Dua, the company\u2019s founder and chief medical officer.\n\nTurntable and Heal are just two examples of the rapidly changing healthcare industry in the United States. In the next five years, where and how Americans get care will look a lot different than it does today.\n\nDoctors\u2019 offices will still be around, but they are going to change dramatically. Kurt Mosley, Merritt Hawkins consulting firm\n\nDriven by high healthcare costs, new technology, and an impending doctor shortage, the country\u2019s medical industry may see its biggest changes since Medicare and Medicaid were approved in 1965.\n\n\u201cDoctors\u2019 offices will still be around, but they are going to change dramatically,\u201d said Kurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances for the Merritt Hawkins physician search and consulting firm.\n\nRon Vance, a managing director in the healthcare division of the Navigant consulting firm, also sees change coming, though he thinks it will arrive a little more slowly than predicted.\n\nHe said the Affordable Care Act is pushing some of these changes, but they also started before Obamacare was signed into law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see an increasingly different landscape in the healthcare field,\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt\u2019s the continuation of a trend.\u201d\n\nRead More: Do Doctors Really Hate Obamacare? \u00bb\n\nWhere You\u2019ll Go for Treatment\n\nIn 2020, chances are you won\u2019t go to a traditional doctor\u2019s office if you have the flu.\n\nYour visit to your family physician may be at an urgent care center when your doctor has time between other duties.\n\nOr it might be at a hospital-owned medical facility where a group of doctors work.\n\nOr at the local Walgreens or CVS pharmacy.\n\nMosley predicts that in five years the number one location where people will get medical attention will be at pharmacies and other retail centers.\n\nHe notes that in 2007 there were 1.4 million patient visits to retail centers in the United States that offered healthcare services. In 2010, there were 4.1 million patient visits. And the number keeps growing.\n\nAt these centers, a nurse practitioner deals with issues for which people now go to their doctor or perhaps even the emergency room. The ailments range from a hacking cough to strep throat to a swollen wrist or an ear infection.\n\nMosley adds that these places are also dealing more and more with people who have chronic conditions, such as asthma or diabetes.\n\nMosley points out that 50 percent of the $3 trillion the United States spends each year on healthcare is spent on 5 percent of the population. Much of that $1.5 trillion is spent on chronic care patients.\n\nMosley believes the retail centers will significantly reduce that cost because they will provide the care for less money out of pocket, so patients will visit before their ailments become expensive crises.\n\n\u201cWe have to do something to keep from coming back to the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nVance agrees. He says clinics at retail centers and other places will force the industry to become more efficient and cost-effective.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to do more with less,\u201d he said.\n\nThose who don\u2019t go to Walgreens may see their doctor in an urgent care center or the wing of a large hospital or medical group facility.\n\nThe Physicians Foundation released a survey it did of its members in fall 2014. More than 20,000 doctors across the United States responded. This wasn\u2019t a scientific study, but the organization said it did reveal some trends.\n\nAbout 35 percent of the respondents said they own their own independent practice. That was down from 49 percent in the foundation\u2019s 2012 survey and 62 percent in its 2008 survey.\n\nAbout 53 percent of the doctors described themselves as hospital or medical group employees. That was up from 44 percent in 2012 and 38 percent in 2008.\n\nThings are going to change a lot. We\u2019re going to have fewer and fewer small practices. Dr. Ripley Hollister, Physicians Foundation\n\n\u201cThings are going to change a lot,\u201d said Dr. Ripley Hollister, a Physicians Foundation board member and a family medicine doctor in Colorado. \u201cWe\u2019ll have fewer and fewer small practices.\u201d\n\nHollister said that trend is already apparent in more urban areas. He expects it to spread to less populated areas in the next few years.\n\nHollister says there are a number of factors pushing this change, including the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandates for insurance coverage and the recent changes in Medicare payments.\n\nDr. Alice Chen, the executive director of Doctors for America, sees three other factors driving physicians from solo practices.\n\nOne is that medicine is a more complex business than it used to be. Second is medical schools don\u2019t train students to own a business. And third, the technological challenges, such as electronic record keeping, which can be overwhelming for a single practitioner.\n\n\u201cMedicine is like a lot of other industries where larger institutions are gobbling up smaller ones,\u201d said Chen, who is a practicing internal medicine hospitalist at the UCLA Medical Center.\n\nFrom Reactive to Preventative Care\n\nOnce a patient arrives at their destination, the type of care they get will be different from what they might receive today. Experts say the healthcare industry is swiftly moving toward providing better preventative care.\n\nPart of the movement is driven by the Affordable Care Act, which stresses prevention. The other is that preventative medicine is less expensive and saves time in the long run.\n\nFacilities like Turntable Health in Las Vegas have already adopted this model.\n\nDamania says treatment at his facility is a team-based approach, with a health coach at the helm. Doctors and other medical professionals will not only treat a patient\u2019s problem, they\u2019ll assess how best to keep it from happening again.\n\nDoes the patient need a different diet? Do they need more exercise? What stress can they avoid?\n\nThe idea is to keep you healthy and that takes a team. Dr. Zubin Damania, Turntable Health clinic\n\n\u201cWe have aligned the financial incentives. We get paid a flat fee to keep you healthy,\u201d said Damania. \u201cThe idea is to keep you healthy and that takes a team.\u201d\n\nThe idea is also part of Heal\u2019s medical app. Dua said their house calls put medical professionals in a person\u2019s home where they can see their entire environment.\n\nIs the air circulation adequate in the house? Are there fast food bags on the dining table? Is there a lot of dust on the floor?\n\nDua said her doctors like this model because it gives them more time with their patients. Basically, quality of care over quantity.\n\n\u201cThe big thing for them is not having to rush,\u201d said Dua. \u201cAnd they are able to see what their patient\u2019s home life looks like.\u201d\n\nRead More: Is da Vinci Robotic Surgery a Rip-off? \u00bb\n\nTechnology Pushes the Envelope\n\nTechnology like the Heal app is also pushing a lot of changes in the industry.\n\nMosley points to some of the new gadgets that are already making a difference. One is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine that was used in Dallas on an Ebola patient who eventually died.\n\nMosley said these types of machines can diagnose pathogens from a DNA swab, eliminating the need to draw blood, as well as saving time.\n\n\u201cTreatment will be decided before you leave the exam room,\u201d he said.\n\nTelemedicine is also altering the playing field. More and more, patients will be able to video chat with doctors or take photos of their rash or bruise on their mobile devices and send those to the clinic. Kaiser Permanente already has a humorous television commercial promoting this service.\n\n[Patients] won\u2019t be coming in at all unless there is something that needs to be checked. Ron Vance, Navigant consulting services\n\nThere are also hand-held devices that can detect viruses. Automakers are developing cars that take your blood pressure and heart rate by placing your hands on the steering wheel. And of course, there\u2019s the Apple Watch.\n\n\u201cA lot of people won\u2019t even be going into the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d said Mosley.\n\nVance said the telemedicine trend is already under way. He said the biggest change will probably be tasks such as blood work that patients will be able to do from home and then send to their doctor via their mobile device before they arrive at the office.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to do health checks themselves,\u201d said Vance. \u201cThey won\u2019t be coming in at all unless there is something that needs to be checked.\u201d\n\n\u2018Now Is a Perfect Storm\u2019\n\nThere are still a number of serious obstacles doctors will have to hurdle as the industry transitions. One of the biggest is the projected shortage of providers.\n\nThe Physicians Foundation survey predicts there will be a shortfall of 65,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2025. An equal number of specialists may also be needed.\n\nThe system will also have to deal with the ever-rising number of Medicare and Medicaid patients. Every day, 11,000 baby boomers turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare.\n\nIn addition, more than 5 million people have signed up for Medicaid since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. That number may be reduced if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down government subsidies for Obamacare in a ruling expected in June.\n\nAlready, many doctors are restricting how many of these patients they treat.\n\nIn the Physicians Foundation survey, 25 percent of the doctors said they don\u2019t see or limit their number of Medicare patients. That figure was 8 percent in 2012. Another 38 percent limit or don\u2019t see Medicaid patients. That\u2019s up from 26 percent in 2012.\n\nVance said there is also a \u201cgenerational crossroads,\u201d in which doctors who\u2019ve been in the business for awhile are reluctant to change while younger ones new to the field are more willing to do things differently.\n\nNow is a perfect storm. Now is the perfect time for something like this. Dr. Zubin Damania, Turntable Health clinic\n\n\u201cThe question will be how are we going to break this culture and cross that bridge?\u201d he said.\n\nThose on the cutting edge of healthcare changes say the industry needs to change with them.\n\n\u201cThis is an uphill battle, but it\u2019s a battle we have to fight,\u201d said Damania of Turntable Health.\n\nHe said there\u2019s a move toward an entirely new standard, where quality of care is highlighted, visits to the doctor are more flexible, and payment systems are more reasonable.\n\n\u201cNow is a perfect storm,\u201d said Damania. \u201cNow is the perfect time for something like this.\u201d\n\nRelated News: The Future of Vaccinations \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "doctors, doctors office, 2020, five years, preventative care, concierge, flat fee, technology, Turntable, Get Heal", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Healthcare costs, new technology, and a physician shortage are driving changes that will alter where you go to see the doctor, how you\u2019re cared for, and how much it costs.", "title": "This Is What Your Doctor\u2019s Office Will Look Like in Five Years", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/this-is-what-your-doctors-office-will-look-like-in-five-years-042715", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/042715_futuredoctors_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/042715_futuredoctors_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Healthcare costs, new technology, and a physician shortage are driving changes that will alter where you go to see the doctor, how you\u2019re cared for, and how much it costs.", "card": "summary", "title": "This Is What Your Doctor\u2019s Office Will Look Like in Five Years"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-27", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Healthcare costs, new technology, and a physician shortage are driving changes that will alter where you go to see the doctor, how you\u2019re cared for, and how much it costs."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce93a\"", "article_summary": "The Physicians Foundation survey predicts there will be a shortfall of 65,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2025.\n\u00bbWhere You\u2019ll Go for TreatmentIn 2020, chances are you won\u2019t go to a traditional doctor\u2019s office if you have the flu.\n\u201cA lot of people won\u2019t even be going into the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d said Mosley.\nIn the next five years, where and how Americans get care will look a lot different than it does today.\nDoctors\u2019 offices will still be around, but they are going to change dramatically."}
