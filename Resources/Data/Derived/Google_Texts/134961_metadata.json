And yet, despite the incalculable horrors Hitler\u2019s invasion brought to the Soviet Union (tens of millions dead, entire cities starved to death), Pasternak spoke for many Russians who looked backed upon WWII fondly, as the Good Years during Josef Stalin\u2019s terrible reign.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn no way am I about to compare the American left and the DC Media to Stalin\u2019s thirty-year terror. But Pasternak\u2019s overall observation, that few things are as oppressive and intolerable as living under the yoke of a lie, is universal.\n\nPolitical Correctness is a lie, a lie in which Democrats, their cultural enablers in Hollywood, and their Palace Guards in the DC Media, use the fascist weapons of social pressure, emotional blackmail, and character assassination (racist, bigot, Islamophobe) to coerce us to speak and behave in a certain way that is dishonest.\n\nOver the past two decades, like the proverbial boiling frog, our society has caved to this lie. For fear of being branded a racist or of being ostracized by The Beautiful People, too many of us have enabled these lies by tiptoeing around or outright ignoring truths that have not been approved by Our Betters.\n\nIllegal immigrants who steal jobs from the working class and import a horrific amount of crime, are now undocumented workers who are a vitally important part of the fabric of our society.\n\nIslam isn\u2019t a religion infected with a virulent disease that could literally bring about the end of Western Civilization and the Apocalypse, it is a religion of peace with a few bad apples.\n\nToo many American Muslims (hundreds of thousands) are comfortable with the idea of violence and religious oppression (51%). But we are told they are just like the rest of us.\n\nAn act of domestic terrorism doesn\u2019t mean our government has failed to protect us or that we need to speak out loud about how political correctness enabled the San Bernardino Islamists. No, it means we must disarm law-abiding Americans more concerned with their personal security than ever before.\n\nObama wasn\u2019t warped by the influences of Reverend Wright, Bill Ayers, and his time overseas. No, he is a patriotic Christian just like the rest of us.\n\nAfter an attack on Planned Parenthood, we must condemn all pro-lifers and restrict their speech.\n\nAfter an Islamist atrocity we must embrace the Muslim community as victims of America and Americans.\n\nIslam isn\u2019t a problem because it is Climate Change that creates terrorists.\n\nThe government is the answer to all of our problems, so call the federal government if your child is bullied.\n\nIgnore the fact that with an increase of an armed citizenry gun violence has been halved.\n\nThat isn\u2019t a man wearing a dress, that\u2019s a woman.\n\nGun-free zones aren\u2019t invitations to mad men looking for sitting ducks.\n\nA woman can do any job as well or better than a man.\n\nGiving your 14 year-old daughter hormone therapy drugs isn\u2019t child abuse.\n\nHomosexuality isn\u2019t a sin.\n\nConcerns over domestic security are racism.\n\nYou can\u2019t use that word anymore, it offends people. Stop celebrating your tradition, it\u2019s insensitive. Prayer is bigotry. Jokes are hate speech. Flags motivate mass-murder. Waterboarding means we\u2019re no better than the terrorists. Those aren\u2019t dead baby parts, that\u2019s fetal tissue. Israel is the problem. Guns are the problem. Budget cuts are the problem. America is the problem\u2026\n\nEvery time you turn on the news, every time our government opens its mouth, every time you just want relax in front of a movie, a television show, or a sporting event; every time a Thought Leader or politician speaks\u2026 Again and again and over and over these lies not only pile up, they are wielded with a brutal relentlessness meant, not to convince us, but to wear us down until we give up just to make it stop.\n\nBut when we give in, and inch-by-inch in this war of inches we always do, we put a yoke of oppression around our own necks by agreeing to live under behavior and speech regulations founded on what we know is a lie.\n\nMy dad isn\u2019t a political person. All his life he\u2019s lived by the rules, worked with his hands, voted for the person not the party, and personifies a live and let live approach to life.\n\nHe\u2019s warming up to Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like or agree with everything Donald Trump says,\u201d he told me the other day. \u201cBut I like that he says it.\u201d\n\nThis is why our elite media and political establishment are so utterly useless. They have become so insulted and bubbled \u2014 the frog boilers or the boiled frogs \u2014 that all perspective has been lost.\n\nLike my dad, I don\u2019t agree with everything Trump says, I don\u2019t like everything Trump says and I\u2019m probably not going to vote for him in the primary. But every time he speaks, no matter how coarse, every time he offends (even me), it feels more than liberating, it feels like a revolutionary act in the cause of human freedom.\n\nSo many Americans frustrated and angry over this oppression, those not yet fully boiled but who for decades were convinced by a deluge of propaganda that they were alone, forgive much in an imperfect Donald Trump willing to take the flaming arrows that come with volunteering to be a battering ram against the Temple of Political Correctness \u2026 against the Left\u2019s \u201cinhuman reign of the lie.\u201d\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the most insightful things I have ever read about human nature comes in the epilogue of Boris Pasternak's \"Doctor Zhivago\": And when the war broke out, its real horrors, its real dangers, its menace of real death were a blessing compared with the inhuman reign of the lie, a relief because it broke the spell of the dead letter.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "One of the most insightful things I have ever read about human nature comes in the epilogue of Boris Pasternak's \"Doctor Zhivago\": And when the war broke out, its real horrors, its real dangers, its menace of real death were a blessing compared with the inhuman reign of the lie, a relief because it broke the spell of the dead letter.", "title": "'The Inhuman Reign of the Lie': Why Donald Trump's Words Haven't Hurt Him - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Trump-1123-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-12-05T12:13:07-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/05/the-inhuman-reign-of-the-lie-why-trumps-words-dont-hurt-him/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the most insightful things I have ever read about human nature comes in the epilogue of Boris Pasternak's \"Doctor Zhivago\": And when the war broke out, its real horrors, its real dangers, its menace of real death were a blessing compared with the inhuman reign of the lie, a relief because it broke the spell of the dead letter.", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Trump-1123-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "'The Inhuman Reign of the Lie': Why Donald Trump's Words Haven't Hurt Him - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump 2016, John Nolte, political correctness, terrorism,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism,donald trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-05T05:59:38-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-12-05T12:13:07-07:00", "tag": "terrorism", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut I like that he says it.\u201dThis is why our elite media and political establishment are so utterly useless.\nBut Pasternak\u2019s overall observation, that few things are as oppressive and intolerable as living under the yoke of a lie, is universal.\nOver the past two decades, like the proverbial boiling frog, our society has caved to this lie.\nThey have become so insulted and bubbled \u2014 the frog boilers or the boiled frogs \u2014 that all perspective has been lost.\nToo many American Muslims (hundreds of thousands) are comfortable with the idea of violence and religious oppression (51%)."}
