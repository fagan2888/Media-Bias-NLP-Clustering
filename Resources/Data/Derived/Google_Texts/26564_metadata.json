The program will launch immediately with household-name driven tweets and other social-media campaigns aimed at encouraging signups for health coverage using the hashtag #GetCovered.\n\n\u201cThrough the \u2018Tell a Friend, Get Covered\u2019 campaign, we are using entertainment as a way to break the ice on what is often considered a challenging and sensitive issue,\u201d Peter V. Lee, executive director of Covered California, told TheWrap. \u201cFrom musical performances, comedy routines, to \u2018slice of life\u2019 videos \u2013 we want to get people to react and more importantly, take action.\u201d\n\nSee video: Stephen Colbert Releases Obamacare Christmas Carol Parodies\n\nIn a separate statement, Lee said the hope was to tap into California\u2019s \u201crichest national resources\u2013the creative entertainment sector and social media \u2014 to support health care coverage.\u201d He said his and groups from other states are turning to celebrities to get friends to educate friends about the availability of new health coverage choices. The groups would like to reach 100 million contacts.\n\nIn addition to Pitbull and Drescher, other celebrity participants include Tatyana Ali and Iman \u201cAlphaCat\u201d Crosson, but organizers said more could join in. Videos and the January event connected to the effort are being produced by Maker Studios.\n\nVideos will appear both on YouTube and the campaign site www.tellafriendgetcovered.com weekly.\n\nJanuary\u2019s live stream will include comedic and educational segments. While some will be about healthy eating and the financial risks of being uninsured, others will be entertainment oriented. The entertainment segments are still being planned, a spokesman said.\n\nSee video: Rick Santorum Compares Obamacare to Apartheid, on Night of Mandela\u2019s Death\n\nThe White House has been pushing hard to get healthier youth to sign up for Obamacare to balance out the number of older adults with preexisting health conditions that are expected to sign up. At a meeting earlier this year, the White House urged celebrities to participate in its efforts.\n\nAnne Filipic, president of Enroll America, said she was hopeful the campaign would help kick start conversations that eventually lead to enrollment. The groups included a comment from Drescher in announcing the campaign.\n\n\u201cLike we say at Cancer Schmancer, \u2018Take control of your body.\u2019 That\u2019s why I support Obamacare,\u201d Drescher said. \u201cSign up and tell all your friends to sign up, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pitbull-cropped-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Ira Teinowitz", "description": "All celebrity-driven social media efforts will use the hashtag #GetCovered", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "All celebrity-driven social media efforts will use the hashtag #GetCovered", "title": "Pitbull, Fran Drescher Among Stars Enlisted to Promote Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pitbull-cropped.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T19:47:31+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/stars-enlisted-promote-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "All celebrity-driven social media efforts will use the hashtag #GetCovered", "title": "Pitbull, Fran Drescher Among Stars Enlisted to Promote Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/stars-enlisted-promote-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pitbull-cropped-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pitbull-cropped-340x300.jpg"}, "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-12T23:42:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Pitbull, Fran Drescher Among Stars Enlisted to Promote Obamacare", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "fran drescher", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Hollywood, D.C.", "tag": "Fran Drescher", "published_time": "2013-12-12T15:42:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T19:47:31+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Pitbull, Fran Drescher Among Stars Enlisted to Promote Obamacare\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/stars-enlisted-promote-obamacare\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/12\\/pitbull-cropped-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"191677\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-12T23:42:00Z\",\"section\":\"Hollywood, D.C.\",\"author\":\"Ira Teinowitz\",\"tags\":[\"fran drescher\"]}", "sailthru.category": "hollywood, d.c.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pitbull-cropped.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecfa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLike we say at Cancer Schmancer, \u2018Take control of your body.\u2019 That\u2019s why I support Obamacare,\u201d Drescher said.\nIn addition to Pitbull and Drescher, other celebrity participants include Tatyana Ali and Iman \u201cAlphaCat\u201d Crosson, but organizers said more could join in.\nBoth groups said that the star-powered events are part of a major effort dubbed the \u201cTell a Friend, Get Covered\u201d initiative.\n\u201cSign up and tell all your friends to sign up, too.\u201d\nThe program will launch immediately with household-name driven tweets and other social-media campaigns aimed at encouraging signups for health coverage using the hashtag #GetCovered."}
