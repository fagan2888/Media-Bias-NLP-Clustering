COTTONWOOD, Ariz. (AP) â€” A police officer shot during a deadly late-night brawl outside a Wal-Mart store in north-central Arizona was released from the hospital this week.

Cottonwood police Sgt. Jeremy Daniels began recuperating at home Thursday, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

Daniels was shot in the leg March 21 in an incident that began when a Wal-Mart employee was shoved inside the store, Department of Public Safety officials said. Police then found the suspects outside, and that's when the fight began.

Department of Public Safety officials said it appears there was a struggle for Daniels' gun during the melee. Three gunshots were fired in all. One suspect, 21-year-old Enoch Gaver, was shot and killed. A second suspect, 28-year-old David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen. He was released from the hospital Tuesday and booked on charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest.

Eight officers suffered minor injuries, including cuts and bruising. Another Wal-Mart employee who tried to help suffered a broken arm.

Seven suspects, including two juveniles, were arrested on aggravated assault charges. Authorities say the suspects appear to all be related and were living out of a Chevrolet Suburban SUV with Idaho plates. The other adults arrested have been identified as 55-year-old Peter Gaver, 52-year-old Ruth Gaver, 27-year-old Nathan Gaver, and 29-year-old Jeramiah Gaver.

All four face counts of aggravated assault and resisting arrest in a way that caused injury. The male and female juvenile suspects were not identified.

It is not known if any of them have retained an attorney.

The Department of Public Safety said the investigation is ongoing.
