(The headline on Toobin\u2019s column in the New Yorker is even nastier: \u201cClarence Thomas\u2019 Disgraceful Silence.\u201d)\n\nToobin notes that it has been eight years since Thomas grilled a lawyer. But he doesn\u2019t make much of a case for outrage over this admittedly odd behavior.\n\nHere\u2019s his best shot: \u201cThe court\u2019s arguments are not televised (though they should be), but they are public. They are, in fact, the public\u2019s only windows onto the justices\u2019 thought processes, and they offer the litigants and their lawyers their only chance to look these arbiters in the eye and make their case. There\u2019s a reason the phrase \u2018your day in court\u2019 resonates. It is an indispensable part of the legal system.\u201d\n\nUntil the justices decide to admit cameras to their courtroom (don\u2019t hold your breath), the public that is being denied the right to look into (or listen outside) the window of Thomas\u2019 thoughts is tiny. And justices\u2019 questions aren\u2019t always windows into how they will eventually rule. Sure, sometimes they tip their hand, as Justice Antonin Scalia did when he asked the U.S. solicitor general if Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate wasn\u2019t like requiring people to buy broccoli. But a lot of questions fall into the devil\u2019s advocate category.\n\nYou could amend Toobin\u2019s arguments to say that the public has the right to hear those questions too, in order to evaluate a justice\u2019s ability to role-play. But that\u2019s a stretch. Anyway, the best way to access a window on a justice\u2019s thought process is to read his or her published opinions. And Thomas\u2019 are endlessly informative about his jurisprudence (sometimes scarily so).\n\nToobin\u2019s article appeared a few days after an article in the New York Times quoted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on why she opposed TV cameras in the courtroom. \u201cIt would leave a false impression of the appellate process to think that the oral argument is what is decisive in the cases,\u201d Ginsburg said.\n\nToobin also argued that \u201cif all nine justices behaved as Thomas does on the bench, [the] public would rightly, and immediately, lose all faith in the Supreme Court.\u201d This is a variation on the slippery slope argument popular with lawyers. (If the court approves a healthcare mandate, next week it will approve a broccoli mandate.)\n\nBut the traditional response to the slippery slope (or \u201cparade of horribles\u201d) argument is \u201cnot while this court sits,\u201d and that is literally the answer to Toobin\u2019s hypothetical about nine mute justices. The Constitution will be amended to require the consumption of broccoli before Thomas\u2019 colleagues follow his lead and clam up. Heck, even if seven of the other eight justices adopted a vow of silence, Scalia could fill the vacuum by himself.\n\nAs Toobin acknowledges, Thomas is a distinctive and occasionally influential thinker on the court, the \u201cintellectual godfather\u201d of important decisions even when he doesn\u2019t write the majority opinion. So he seems to be doing the most important part of his job.\n\n(Toobin also focuses on Thomas\u2019 body language in the courtroom, writing that he looks up at the ceiling and strokes his chin \u2014 proof that he\u2019s \u201cnot paying attention.\u201d But other justices occasionally look distracted. Sometimes they even nod off.)\n\nMy theory is that Thomas has remained silent all these years to confound his critics. It certainly isn\u2019t because he is tongue-tied or inarticulate. If you\u2019re desperate to hear the sound of his voice, YouTube and C-SPAN preserve some of his comments in public settings outside the court.\n\nWhatever the explanation, Thomas\u2019 silence is strange. But disgraceful? A dereliction of duty? To quote Chief Justice John Marshall: \u201cThis is too extravagant to be maintained.\u201d\n\nALSO:\n\nWhy 9/11 can happen again\n\nThe Iran I saw \u2014 in 781 days in Evin Prison\n\nMorrison: Prince William's smashingly bad idea\n\nFollow Michael McGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Justice Clarence Thomas' silence is 'disgraceful'?
