Continued rockfall mitigation will close Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon on Tuesday, officials said.

The road will be closed from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday from the Glenwood Springs 116 exit to the Dotsero 133 exit, according to the Colorado Department of transportation.

A helicopter will be used to secure fencing while CDOT focuses on continued road repairs. The work is in an effort to start using both lanes of traffic instead of solely the eastbound lanes following a rock slide that closed the interstate through the canyon in February.

Delays of 30 minutes to one hour are still possible through the canyon, CDOT said.

Rest areas in Hanging Lakes, Grizzly Creek and Shoshone remain closed.
