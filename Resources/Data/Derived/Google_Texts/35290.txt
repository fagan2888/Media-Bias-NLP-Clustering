Changes to medical care at the Maury County Jail have helped reduce the number of inmates who must be transported to outside visits to doctor’s offices over the past year, Sheriff Bucky Rowland said.

“We have a nurse practitioner that came in the spring, and that’s cut down on transports,” Rowland said. “Medical grievances have gone down considerably.”

The jail has always had two full-time nurses and a part-time nurse, but this is the first time a nurse practitioner has been on staff, Capt. Nathan Johns said.

“A nurse practitioner can just do more than an LPN or RN can do,” he said.

The nurse practitioner was added to the staff of two full-time nurses and one part-time nurse, Rowland said.

The nurse practitioner was hired at the jail in April 2014, said Rita Williams, Director of Marketing at Maury Regional Medical Center. She said MRMC partners with the jail to provide healthcare services.

Over the summer, MRMC supplied the jail with the equipment needed to do laboratory work, Johns said.

According to jail data, inmates paid 108 visits to outside medical clinics in January 2014, compared with 28 in December 2014, he said.

“The big thing is, we’re not transporting,” Johns said. “It’s safer for everyone involved, and there’s less liability for the department.”

The sheriff’s department has wanted to increase the medical services inmates receive on site for a long time, he said.

Johns also said the population of the jail is fluid, with inmates being booked in and released each day. That makes it difficult for the story to be told using raw data alone.

“We can have 300 inmates here at the beginning of the month, and have 300 at the end of the month,” he said. “But they may not be the same 300.”

The medical staff at the jail sees an average of 400 inmates per month, Rowland said.

The nurse practitioner is on-site Monday through Friday.

“One of the RNs will come in on the weekends as well,” Rowland said. “It’s been a huge plus.”
