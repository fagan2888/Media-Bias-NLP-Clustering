It then crossed the road, went into a ditch and overturned.\n\nWichita's Chris Ketzner was driving two cars behind the woman on Ridge Road. Having just returned late Friday night from the Bahamas, Ketzner was on the way to Sedgwick to pick up her daughter's dog from the pet sitter.\n\n\"There was a truck in front of me and a red car in front of him and the red car just started swerving into the opposite lane, went into the ditch, and went spinning. It went on its roof and then flipped onto its tires,\" Ketzner said.\n\nKetzner says the car started on fire. She called 911 as another witness grabbed a fire extinguisher and tried to put out the flames.\n\nAbout a minute later, the fire officers put out the fire and they were getting of the jaws of life and the ambulance arrived,\" Ketzner said.\n\nTroopers said Tina McDaneld had to be extracted from the vehicle and was taken to the hospital with critical injuries. Reports state she was wearing a seatbelt.\n\nInvestigators are trying to determine whether prescription drugs played a role in the crash.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Investigators are trying to determine whether prescription drugs played a role in the crash.", "language": "english", "author": "Jason Tarr", "og": {"description": "Investigators are trying to determine whether prescription drugs played a role in the crash.", "title": "UPDATE: Woman driving erratically before rollover crash near Maize", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/One-critically-hurt-in-rollover-crash-near-Maize-238710901.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/EEA/46C/EEA46C8CC8014490B7B8ECD460D57615", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/613/CA0/613CA0E9A4B540B88D162F0E27706E6C.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Investigators are trying to determine whether prescription drugs played a role in the crash.", "title": "UPDATE: Woman driving erratically before rollover crash near Maize", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/One-critically-hurt-in-rollover-crash-near-Maize-238710901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/maize+rollover.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Woman driving erratically before rollover crash near Maize", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Woman driving erratically before"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd017c\"", "article_summary": "The crash was reported around 9:15 a.m. at 61st Street North and Ridge Road, which is just northeast of Maize.\nHope officer told troopers he saw a maroon passenger car driving erratically at speeds up to 100 mph on K-96.\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol says a 40-year-old Wichita woman who suffered critical injuries in a rollover accident Saturday morning was driving erratically and at high speeds before the crash.\nWichita's Chris Ketzner was driving two cars behind the woman on Ridge Road.\nIt then crossed the road, went into a ditch and overturned."}
