Rather, it would add a stipulation requiring that a hearing be held within 30 days of the borrower being notified of the lender\u2019s intent to file a declaratory judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the commercial banking area, this would be a big change on the way lenders make judgment on loans,\u201d said Steven Shandor, chair of Akron law firm Day Ketterer\u2019s banking law practice group.\n\n\n\nThe change almost certainly would drive up legal fees for lenders in addition to drawing out the timeline for a bank to recoup losses, Shandor said. In a scenario involving commercial real estate, for example, it would draw out the timeline of a foreclosure.\n\n\n\nWhile lenders rarely act on cognovits, which generally are considered a last-ditch effort to recover losses, banks argue this proposed change puts them at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\nBut Rep. Ron Young (R-Leroy Twp.), who is the bill\u2019s primary sponsor along with Rep. Jonathan Dever (R-Cincinnati), argues the change helps protect borrowers by ensuring cognovits are only filed \u201cfor legitimate reasons.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the proposed reforms would require a lender to notify a borrower 30 days in advance that they plan to confess judgment, and allow the debtor the opportunity to request a hearing to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nLenders voice opposition\n\nIt also would ban the use of a cognovit note when a lender alleges non-monetary default, such as a failure to file a report on time\u2014something that\u2019s been upheld by several Ohio Appellate Courts.Those changes combined create a fairer system that would encourage economic growth and jobs, according to a testimony by Young.Young said he was motivated to sponsor the bill after being approached by business people in Lake County who \u201cwanted this done.\u201d Dever, an attorney, has tried cases where businesspeople lost homes and businesses as a result of cognovits even in situations where they allegedly made payments on time, every time.\u201cThe agreement itself is simply un-American,\u201d Young said. \u201cIn a sense, we\u2019re taking away people\u2019s constitutional rights and due process, specifically. It\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be practiced in Ohio.\u201d\n\nOhio\u2019s bank associations are generally against the proposal.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe think from all angles, it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d said James Thurston, a spokesman for the Ohio Bankers League trade organization.\n\n\n\nCognovits, as they stand now, shift risk away from lenders, which in turn benefits borrowers in their loan agreements. And while Ohio is among a minority of states that permit them, opponents maintain it\u2019s an important and beneficial tool.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is accurate to say we are in a minority of states that do this,\u201d Thurston said. \u201cBut that means we get an advantage. The borrowers can potentially get better terms in Ohio than they would in other states.\u201d\n\n\n\nCredit unions are paying attention, though they seem to take a more neutral stance.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are in the business of protecting credit unions, and our member credit unions who are involved in business lending had concerns over the proposed notification process,\u201d said Patrick Harris, vice president of government affairs at the Ohio Credit Union League, in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe continue to have discussions with the bill sponsors, with the hope of getting to a place that protects credit unions while allowing them to continue to offer affordable small business lending.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting risk\n\nMiddlefield Banc Corp. president and CEO Thomas Caldwell, an Ohio delegate for The Independent Community Bankers of America and a member of the legislative committee for the Community Bankers Association of Ohio, said it is, in fact, rare for a bank to use cognovits.\u201cBut part of the concern is you\u2019re giving the customer 30 days prior to the judgment being placed, and all of a sudden, the assets we have a secured interest in disappear,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has happened before.\u201dCaldwell said his bank has witnessed borrowers literally hide money or equipment the bank has a claim on ahead of the assets being seized.\u201cIn the past, where we attempt to collect on a debt, equipment has disappeared and we have to track it down if the borrower is not being cooperative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe find it\u2019s gone. Sometimes it\u2019s already been sold. In some cases it\u2019s being hid.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cmost borrowers\u201d are honest, Caldwell said, that extended period gives the borrower increased opportunity to act surreptitiously. That results in more risk for the bank, which in turn could result in higher interest rates and fees for commercial customers.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll find, if they removed this clause, it could make it more difficult for some borrowers to obtain credit, and more than likely it will make it more costly for borrowers to obtain credit,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\n\n\nHowever, Young isn\u2019t sold by the claims that the proposed changes to cognovits would interfere with a bank\u2019s ability to loan money, or that it would drive up legal costs, He said that hasn\u2019t been the case in other states where similar changes to cognovits have occurred.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat argument is based more in fears and concerns banks might have than any reliable data that can be confirmed statistically,\u201d Young said.\n\n\n\nOne tweak to the bill, Young said, would permit lenders to declare judgments immediately, as they do now, with the significant caveat that a hearing must still happen within 30 days, and if a borrower can prove they made all their payments on time, the bank would be held responsible. If the bank, indeed, made an error and seized a borrower\u2019s assets \u2014 which could include an individual\u2019s business, banks accounts and even their home and car \u2014 the bank would be responsible for court costs, attorney fees and \u201cextensive\u201d damages.\n\n\n\nThe bill was introduced last July and is currently in committee. Young said he expects to see it moved out of committee in mid-April or sooner.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill in the Ohio Legislature that, according to its sponsors, is intended to create fairness in commercial lending contracts also could affect a bank's abilities to lend and to recoup losses after a deal sours.
