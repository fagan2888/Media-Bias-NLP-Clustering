It went to Nevada instead.\n\nNow it\u2019s Scott\u2019s turn. But what would await a California company in Florida, beside sinkholes, huge insects, humidity, strip malls, backyard alligators, mold, and modern cannibalism (the \u201cMiami Zombie\u201d was in 2012; the Donner Party was nearly 170 years ago)?\n\nMatters like this:\n\nAs California leads the nation in grappling with climate change, Scott has whacked at the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection, and reportedly told state officials in Florida \u2013 with 1,350 miles of ocean coastline \u2013 not to use phrases like \u201cglobal warming\u201d or \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nScott \u2013 who headed a hospital firm that was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud \u2013 loathes Obamacare, and Florida doesn\u2019t have its own health insurance exchange, as California does. Nonetheless, this year more people signed up for federal Obamacare in Florida than in any other state.\n\nFlorida\u2019s 2015 state budget, which Scott wanted to be big on tax cuts, has opened up a billion-dollar-plus healthcare sinkhole.\n\nSo welcome, Gov. Scott, but watch out: California is an enticing, exciting, enchanting place. Why, just last summer, Rick Perry let slip that he actually loves California.\n\nAccording to some analyses over the last few years\u2014the latest from WalletHub -- Florida is a \"taker \"state when it comes to federal tax money. WalletHub finds it gets about $2.02 in federal help for every tax dollar it sends to Washington. Californians may be footing Florida\u2019s bill; we get back only 68 cents in benefits for every federal tax dollar we pay.\n\nThe dean of the business school at Florida State University is leaving that job \u2013 to become dean of the business school at Santa Clara University.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown\u2019s spokesman, with merry malice, welcomed Scott as \"one of the 60 million tourists expected to visit California this year.\"\n\nBut when I asked the Miami Herald's Dave Berry, the funniest newspaperman in the business, he warned me and other Californians: \u201cDo not underestimate Rick Scott. He\u2019s a very intense, very determined guy. He reminds me a little of those relentless individuals on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d who are always banging against doors and walls, trying to get inside and consume the main characters. Sometimes that tactic works, and it\u2019s entirely possible that Gov. Scott will be successful in persuading some California businesses to relocate to Florida. I just hope to God it\u2019s not the Kardashians.\u201d\n\nI think Brown's office should send Scott a copy of this Fresno Bee editorial, which nailed the \u201cbusiness-hostile California\u201d trope this way:\n\n\u201cBut California, despite high taxes, tough regulations and expensive housing, is not a terrible place. It leads the nation in venture capital investments, technology growth and tourism. Its public university systems, while pressed for cash, outshine all others. Its gorgeous coastline, mountains and valleys, which are beautiful thanks in part to environmental regulators, are a huge draw. And its famous social tolerance makes California a place where smart, ambitious and creative people come to find their fortunes, and employ untold thousands while doing so.\u201d\n\nSo welcome, Gov. Scott, but watch out: California is an enticing, exciting, enchanting place. Why, just last summer, Rick Perry let slip that he actually loves California, that he visits and vacations here often, and might even give up Lone Star residency for the Golden State.\n\nFollow Patt Morrison on Twitter @pattmlatimes", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The siren call of ...
