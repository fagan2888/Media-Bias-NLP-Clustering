Barack Obama, the Senator, justwasn\u2019t ready for the presidency. How much more evidence do people need?\n\nHe harbored delusions of grandeur that were difficult to conceal and truly believed he could reshape American politics. He spoke of a post-partisan era, denigrated lobbyists, and said he would change the way things worked in Washington. And he did. Although it might be more accurate to say he changed how things don\u2019t work in Washington.\n\nSure, Washington might have changed, but not in the way that Senator Obama spoke so eloquently about on the campaign trail in 2008. He envisioned himself as the second-coming of LBJ.\n\nHe wanted a new \u201cGreat Society\u201d to tackle poverty and inequality. He was going to rebuild infrastructure and reform education. Okay, but isn\u2019t it time for a reality check? If he really cared so much about addressing inequality and improving peoples\u2019 lives why did he demonstrate so little interest in the implementation of his key domestic initiative, the Affordable Care Act?\n\nFurthermore, the Obama administration is actually run by lobbyists; in 2013, one scholar found that there were 119 ex-lobbyists in his administration. This is unsurprising because Mr. Obama\u2019s rhetoric won\u2019t ever come close to matching reality.\n\nRegarding foreign policy, Mr. Obama\u2019s performance has been even more dismal. He\u2019s still so obsessed with being the anti-Bush that he\u2019s forgotten what it means to be the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nAt one time, he spoke of a nuclear-free world, but what was his point? In Cairo in 2009 he championed a different American foreign policy in the Middle East. If by \u2018different\u2019 he meant \u2018disastrous\u2019 then things seem to be going as planned. The Arab Spring came and went before Mr. Obama fully comprehended the import of events in the region.\n\nSyria continues to burn as Washington looks more like a bystander than a world power intent on changing events on the ground. No need to elaborate when it comes to Iran; naivet\u00e9 is fueling discussions with Tehran.\n\nSo let\u2019s just look at this realistically.\n\nFive years into his presidency, President Obama remains reluctant to acknowledge that he wields tremendous power when it comes to foreign affairs. As his time in office becomes increasingly ineffective, even astute operatives might be more interested in the jockeying for his presidential library.\n\nPost-presidency, attempting to contain Mr. Obama\u2019s failure to several government buildings in Chicago or New York seems unreasonable, but stranger things have happened.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Obama is making Vladimir Putin look absolutely brilliant. Mr. Obama \u2013 the Deliberator-in-Chief \u2013 yearns for a Kantian world of perpetual peace. He longs for a place where the acceptance of international institutions, multilateral cooperation and democratic norms are what matter most.\n\nUnfortunately, some other world leaders seem to be more interested in the lessons gleaned from Machiavelli and Hobbes. That\u2019s probably because we\u2019re still stuck in a place where power matters. A place where red lines can\u2019t be discarded. And a place where the international community still looks to Washington for global leadership.\n\nThe US has footed the bill for international security since the end of World War II. Mr. Obama seems to think that it\u2019s time for someone else to do that. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t seem to be working out very well either.\n\nAnd yet there\u2019s so much more. He\u2019s upset allies, notably Israel and several Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia. Senior policymakers in Tokyo and Seoul are wondering if Washington is truly committed to its strategic rebalancing to the Pacific.\n\nIn fact, based upon Mr. Obama\u2019s policy of \u201cgradual escalation\u201d to deal with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, it\u2019s highly questionable \u2013 perhaps even crazy \u2013 to think that Mr. Obama will ever be capable of matching Vladimir Putin\u2019s resolve.\n\nSure, Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy is a big problem, but it\u2019s a problem that emanates from his hopelessly na\u00efve view of world affairs. The bigger problem is the fact the Mr. Obama may actually believe that he\u2019s doing an okay job.\n\nTo be fair, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney didn\u2019t have much foreign policy experience either. But even then, would he have been any worse than Mr. Obama?\n\nIs it actually possible to be worse than Mr. Obama?\n\nTaylor Dibbert is an international consultant based in Washington, DC and the author of the book Fiesta of Sunset: The Peace Corps, Guatemala and a Search for Truth", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thecommentator.com/article/4857/obama_s_kantian_fantasy", "image": "http://www.thecommentator.com/system/articles/inner_pictures/000/004/857/original/barack_obama.JPG?1396699189", "type": "website", "description": "Considering both domestic and foreign policy, is it actually possible to be worse than Barack Obama?
