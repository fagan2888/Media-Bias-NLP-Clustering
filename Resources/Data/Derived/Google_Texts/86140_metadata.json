Thoughts race: What if I mess up my presentation at work tomorrow? Did I forget to pay my student loan? Did I turn off the oven? Worries scamper through your brain, and before you know it, your alarm is going off and you haven\u2019t gotten an ounce of sleep. Insomnia and disrupted sleeping patterns can come from many sources, such as a tough day at work, but more serious conditions, like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and sensory processing disorder (SPD), can also be triggers.\n\nOf course, there are medications out there designed to help with insomnia and anxiety. Some people prefer not to take them, perhaps because of the side effects or because they don\u2019t help the way they should. There are some medications and therapies available for ASD and SPD as well, and like those for insomnia, these options don\u2019t always pan out. One therapy, however, comes relatively cheap and with virtually no side effects. It\u2019s also capable of helping people with these conditions, and maybe even more.\n\nSensing The Pressure\n\nOn the surface, something as simple as a weighted blanket shouldn\u2019t be able to hold its own against extensively researched and designed drugs. Even therapies designed to relieve anxiety or alleviate certain ASD symptoms take many years of study and practice. How, then, could a heavy blanket help these patients out?\n\nThe idea of weighted-blanket therapy, also called deep-touch therapy, goes back to a basic human behavior known to calm us \u2014 being held. Clinical studies suggest that when certain pressure points on the body are stimulated by touch, the brain releases serotonin. This neurotransmitter is responsible for regulating various brain functions, including sleep and mood.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Native Americans and other indigenous tribes from around the world automatically wrapped their babies snuggly in a swaddle or cradle board to ease fussiness,\u201d Tori Boucher, an autism spectrum counselor and author told Medical Daily via email. \u201cInnovative hospitals and birthing centers today continue this practice. Weighted blankets are a clever extension of that idea for individuals who continue to need snug pressure beyond infancy.\u201d\n\nThe key to this stimulation is the heaviness of the blanket, which is able to create a deep pressure. Aside from swaddles, this kind of pressure is present in hugs and when we stroke animals.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, light touch pressure is a more superficial stimulation of the skin, such as tickling, very light touch, or moving hairs on the skin,\u201d wrote Dr. Temple Grandin in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology. \u201cIn animals, the tickle of a fly landing on the skin may cause a cow to kick, but the firm touch of the farmer\u2019s hands quiets her. Occupational therapists have observed that a very light touch alerts the nervous system, but deep pressure is relaxing and calming.\u201d\n\nA Multi-Use Therapy\n\nAt first, deep touch pressure stimulation was used to help children with ASD or SPD. These kids often experience sensory overload, meaning they have difficulty filtering out background sensory information. This can cause restlessness, anxiety, and trouble participating in seated activities and ongoing tasks. Of course, sleeping can be difficult in this state as well.\n\nStudies have shown weighted blankets can help children with ASD fall asleep. The kids benefit not only from the release of serotonin the blankets bring, but also from the decrease in heart rate and blood pressure that result from the calming effect. This allows for more control, and in turn, a better chance of rest.\n\nWeighted blankets and deep-touch pressure benefits those without a specific sensory disorder as well. One 2004 study involved participants complaining of sleep dysfunction, stress, and pain, and showed a reduction in nighttime cortisol levels while patients were \u201cgrounded\u201d during sleep with weighted blankets. A reduction in cortisol, the primary stress hormone, lead to overall better sleep quality.\n\nAnother paper found that 63 percent of the study participants reported lower anxiety after using a weighted blanket, a benefit that has been verified by subsequent papers. Since the therapy is safe, patients with a multitude of conditions have given weighted blankets a shot \u2014 and they\u2019ve benefited those with post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and all types of anxiety.\n\nLike any medication or therapy, deep pressure stimulation doesn\u2019t help everyone. But as a therapy with virtually no side effects or dangers \u2014 except perhaps for those with prior respiratory or circulatory problems \u2014 weighted blankets can provide a feeling of calm and comfort that has escaped some for a long time.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "how, weighted, blanket, therapy, can, help, those, anxiety, autism, and, more", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "How can a simple blanket reduce anxiety, stress, and ASD symptoms?", "title": "The Science Behind Weighted Blankets", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/weighted-blanket-insomnia-anxiety-380924", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/06/blanket.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How can a simple blanket reduce anxiety, stress, and ASD symptoms?", "title": "The Science Behind Weighted Blankets", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/weighted-blanket-insomnia-anxiety-380924", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/06/blanket.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/06/blanket.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2016-04-07T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-07T15:50:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "How can a simple blanket reduce anxiety, stress, and ASD symptoms?"}, "article_summary": "Like any medication or therapy, deep pressure stimulation doesn\u2019t help everyone.\nStudies have shown weighted blankets can help children with ASD fall asleep.\nSince the therapy is safe, patients with a multitude of conditions have given weighted blankets a shot \u2014 and they\u2019ve benefited those with post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and all types of anxiety.\nInsomnia and disrupted sleeping patterns can come from many sources, such as a tough day at work, but more serious conditions, like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and sensory processing disorder (SPD), can also be triggers.\nWeighted blankets and deep-touch pressure benefits those without a specific sensory disorder as well."}
