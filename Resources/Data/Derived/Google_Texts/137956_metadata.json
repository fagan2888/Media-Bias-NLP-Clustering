Christie\u2019s theme is not just his, though; it seems to dominate the Republican candidates\u2019 critique of any Democratic leader whose approach to the larger world refrains from their over-the-top bluster. The real question, though, is what makes the Republicans think theirs is the party of strength? What lies behind their in-your-face, Clint Eastwood-style American bravado?\n\nFor one, the macho pose ironically owes some of its inspiration to the famed breeder and hockey mom Sarah Palin, who adopted as her motto \u201cgoing rogue,\u201d which was actually a euphemism for departing from the facts. Now another untamed candidate, Donald Trump, sees nothing wrong in maligning a sizable percentage of Mexican immigrants as roving rapists; instead of recognizing his irresponsible comments for what they are, a certain slice of the Republican electorate has insisted that he was merely saying what others are thinking but haven\u2019t the guts to voice publicly.\n\nGuts? Another word for the wing-nut rhetorical method is \u201cgall,\u201d which in linguistic terms takes us even closer to the internal bitterness that oozes from angry mouths in the form of hypocritical taunts. Hispanic immigrant Ted Cruz is so viscerally troubled by the Hispanic immigrant problem that he must sound the alarm louder than his colleagues, who have less to prove on that score. Piyush \u201cBobby\u201d Jindal, exudes a gargantuan impatience with all foreigners who refuse to shed their foreign skin. One narcissist\u2019s blanched bigotry meets another narcissist\u2019s self-denial. The common denominator is how loudly each feels impelled to proclaim his or her visceral rejection of the imaginary force of human pollution that Democrats define, less fearfully, as a respect for difference. When it comes to foreigners, the Dems\u2019 watchwords of \u201csensitivity\u201d and \u201cmoderation\u201d are characterized as \u201cweakness\u201d in the GOP lexicon.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 thoughtful restraint may in fact be accompanied by unspoken, behind-the-scenes intelligence collection and terror elimination activities, but the Republicans have constructed a narrative that paints Democrats as physically, constitutionally weak. Though it hasn\u2019t succeeded of late, and isn\u2019t even true, Republicans attach to themselves a well-practiced, \u201creality-based\u201d focus on reactive power. They yell at the camera that the American ideal is something marked by uncompromising strength, and only one party will \u201cstand up\u201d for that America.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem with their Eastwood logic. The notion that the louder the verbal attack, the more real it is, is as idiotic at yelling at an empty chair. Indeed, to rely on rudeness to convey one\u2019s mind is, sadly, childlike. Trump and Christie resemble high school punks more than prospective statesmen. It is fitting, in that sense, that Christie staged his campaign kickoff at his alma mater, Livingston High School. Perhaps he really believes that it was here that the New Jersey governor attained manhood. He reminds us that he was a star catcher on the varsity baseball team, a point of pride he used to belittle Port Authority executive David Wildstein during the Bridgegate scandal: poor, nerdy David was not his friend, not in his crowd, but strictly a member of the chess team. It was in this \u201cBack to the Future\u201d episode that the line between the nerds and jocks was permanently drawn: a mindset, a small worldview, in which the scripts for future success are found in yearbooks. Trump, too, recalls out loud his educational background as a young student of business, whose promise was readily apparent at a tender age \u2014 all to pose questions about phony, unAmerican Barack Obama: \u201cNobody remembers him\u201d until \u201cBarry\u201d suddenly appeared as a pot-smoking college student. Are we to assume that democracy is like high school \u2014 a place where uncensored arrogance triumphs? Is that where these Republicans are trapped?\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit deeper. In politics, rudeness seems to be, at least at this moment, a white male privilege. What would it look like if the careful, ruminative President Obama suddenly became as forward and obnoxious as Chris Christie? He would be an out-of-control black man. Or if Hillary Clinton snarled like Trump? The ravenous press would have a field day, remaking her into the heartless mogul Leona Helmsley, or the poisonous Lucrezia Borgia, or the evil queen in \u201cSnow White.\u201d\n\nHere is the obverse image transformation to ponder: Louisiana\u2019s Jindal is as close-shaven and clean-cut as they come, but he has gone overboard to befriend the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d clan; they represent his main constituency these days. Sure, NRA-supported candidates will don camouflage and go out for some photo-op weekend hunting; but imagine how Republicans would react to Jindal if he sported a bandana and grew a long, scraggily beard. Despite his constant call for everyone who loves America to be a \u201creal\u201d and not a hyphenated American, the Robertson clan\u2019s hillbilly chic only works on white men\u2019s bodies.\n\nWhat do the faux-macho Republican candidates think it takes to belong to the proud American past they have manufactured and seek to \u201crecover\u201d? In the Trump-Christie tell-it-like-it-is Eastern boastfulness or the Cruz-Jindal self-reinventing backcountry Gothic, we have the perverse appropriation of a make-believe Western narrative, one that functions as a mirror image of the nineteenth century\u2019s romance with \u201cManifest Destiny.\u201d Like then, nativist dismissal of inferior others still accompanies an exaggerated rhetoric of America\u2019s bigness and irresistibility.\n\nOur current GOP candidates\u2019 love for a folksy \u201cdemocracy of manners\u201d dates back to the 1840s, the first time that educated men saw that they could get elected to state or national office by dressing down and appealing to voters as \u201clog cabin\u201d types. That same fascination with commonness was revived in the 1940s, when a host of down-home candidates strummed their way into office: Ohio-reared Wilbert Lee \u201cPappy\u201d O\u2019Daniel became a governor, then senator from Texas after he wrote little ditties and performed on the radio (and was the only politician who ever defeated Lyndon Johnson at the polls). The \u201csinging cowboy\u201d Glen Taylor was elected to the Senate from Idaho; Louisiana Governor Jimmy Davis was yet another actor and country crooner, who composed the memorable \u201cYou are My Sunshine.\u201d So, Canadian-born Cruz\u2019s Texas twang and Rhodes scholar Jindal\u2019s constant reference to his stupid cowboy boots are nothing new. Remember Mitt Romney in mom jeans? Politicians have been pretending to humble themselves before the almighty voter, and largely getting away with it, for ages.\n\nOn another level, the macho bragging that Trump and Christie excel at (or at least can\u2019t resist) allows them to go against type, to distance themselves from the \u201cNorthern liberal\u201d stigma. Dr. Ben Carson is another perfect example of this phenomenon. The neurosurgeon Carson rejects his educational background, when it comes to social issues, by finding his inner Ann Coulter and lashing out with the refinement of your average high school bigot. Ivy League darlings like Cruz and Jindal have to go out of their way to make up for pampered educations. Any chance they get, they scream: Hey, look at me, all them liberal manners ain\u2019t infectin\u2019 my \u201creal American\u201d social fiber!", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right's in-your-face obnoxiousness and need to portray Democrats as weak is classic phony bravado.
