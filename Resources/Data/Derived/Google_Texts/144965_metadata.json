They should have patients and Medicare sort it out,\u201d Mr Boland said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling dentists to be cautious if they have duplicated accounts to note they have given patients advice not to double dip,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Department of Health says dentists are not prohibited from issuing a second invoice.\n\n\u201cIf a dentist chooses to participate in the CDBS for services provided earlier in the calendar year, issuing an amended invoice with appropriate CDBS item numbers is not prohibited under the Dental Benefits Act 2008 or subordinate legislation, so long as the dentist complies with the program\u2019s requirements,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nGovernment guidelines simply require the dental provider \u201ckeep a record of both invoices\u201d and \u201cadvise the patient that they are not entitled to claim both CDBS and Private Health Insurance benefits for the same service item under the Rules\u201d.\n\nMedicare data shows nearly 500 children had root canal treatment paid for in January and another 7,600 had fillings reimbursed.\n\nIn the first month the scheme has cost the government $5.6 million.\n\nDentists don\u2019t have to take part in the scheme and they do not have to bulk bill.\n\nThe Australian Dental Association has warned Medicare rebates are up to 20 per cent lower than the fees dentists charge and parents could be left with some out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nThe Greens are hoping to persuade the government to gradually expand the scheme to cover the adult population.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "description": "MORE  than 18,000 children had their teeth checked during the first month of a new Medicare dental scheme that dentists warn could be open to rorting.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "MORE  than 18,000 children had their teeth checked during the first month of a new Medicare dental scheme that dentists warn could be open to rorting.", "title": "Medicare dental scheme \u2018open to fraud\u2019", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/national/medicare-dental-scheme-open-to-fraud/story-fncynjr2-1226862613397", "image": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/03/23/1226862/613371-bf57d2d2-b247-11e3-995d-6099a80e173b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/03/23/1226862/613371-bf57d2d2-b247-11e3-995d-6099a80e173b.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226862613397, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Mar 23 21:24:34 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun Mar 23 21:24:34 EST 2014", "author": "By Sue Dunlevy"}, "keywords": "fees dentists, dental care, health fund members, health fund rebate, dental provider, identification numbers, health funds, patients advice, amended invoice, duplicated accounts, Government guidelines, Health Department, health fund, dental scheme, dental services, item numbers, canal treatment, Medicare data shows, Plymouth Argyle Football Club, Robert Boyd Boland", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3bd\"", "article_summary": "MORE than 18,000 children had their teeth checked during the first month of a new Medicare dental scheme that dentists warn could be open to rorting.\nHealth fund members may be able to claim both a Medicare rebate and a health fund rebate for the same dental service.\nHowever, a decision to introduce a separate set of Medicare identification numbers for dental services rather than use existing health fund identifiers could open the way for fraud.\nAustralian Dental Association chief Robert Boyd Boland says Medicare adds an 88 prefix to many of the item numbers that identify dental services for health fund claiming purposes.\nWhen they take their original bill to Medicare it cannot be refunded because the item numbers the dentists charged are for health funds not Medicare."}
