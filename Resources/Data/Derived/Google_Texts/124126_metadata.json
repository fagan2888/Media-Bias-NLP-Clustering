Although the charter does not mention al Qaeda or its two official Syrian branches, the Al Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham, the Islamic Front embraces jihad and calls the foreign fighters \u201cour brothers.\u201d Taken as a whole, the charter indicates that the Islamic Front is willing to cooperate with both Al Nusrah and the ISIS; most of the Islamist groups that make up the Islamic Front have fought alongside the al Qaeda groups already.

A few days earlier, on Nov. 24, an FSA spokesman had claimed that the Islamic Front answered to the Supreme Military Council; he also estimated that the Islamic Front controlled up to 60 percent of the rebel fighters in Syria, TIME reported.\n\nA report in the BBC today states that al Qaeda-linked fighting units are becoming increasingly organized in the recruitment and transfer of foreign fighters through safe houses near the Turkish border into Syria and often out again back to their home countries.\n\nA French jihadist who joined a brigade that consists of 8,000 fighters told the BBC that \u201cthere are thousands of us, literally from every corner of the world\u201d and \u201cwe are all al-Qaeda.\u201d He also claimed that his brigade had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham.\n\nIn a further indication of the growing strength of the Islamist forces and corresponding weakness of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, a former rebel commander told the BBC that FSA fighters are now being targeted by jihadist forces and that he fled to Turkey after jihadists captured his unit and killed most of his men.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Islamic Front took control of Free Syrian Army warehouses that are stocked with Western supplies and that were raided by the Islamic State of Iraq and the", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Long War Journal", "description": "The Islamic Front, a recently formed Islamist alliance of several large groups that cooperate with al Qaeda in Syria, has driven Free Syrian Army forces out of bases and a warehouse at the Bab al-Hawa border crossing into Turkey.
