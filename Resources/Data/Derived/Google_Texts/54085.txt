Joel Dreessen has enjoyed too good an NFL career to have it end from the sidelines.

One of only 12 players to start a football game at the high school (Fort Morgan), college (Colorado State) and NFL (Broncos) level in the state of Colorado, Dreessen will have surgery on his troublesome left knee next week in hopes he can play out the final year of his contract with the Broncos.

The extent of the surgery will likely be determined as the Broncos’ medical staff gathers at the NFL scouting combine this week in Indianapolis.

“We’re going through the stages of getting various opinions on what the best course of action is for me to contribute in 2014,” Dreessen said.

After catching a career-high six touchdowns with the Houston Texans in 2011, Dreessen became a free agent and signed a three-year, $8.5 million deal with the team he grew up rooting for in Fort Morgan.

He then caught a personal-best 41 passes with five touchdowns in 2012 for the Broncos. But the knee started acting up on the first day of Organized Team Activity in May and Dreessen, 31, wound up having two surgeries before the start of the regular season.

The injury, and emergence of Julius Thomas, limited Dreessen to just seven catches this past season and he was inactive from the Broncos’ three postseason games.

That’s no way to bow out. Dreessen wants a ninth NFL season.

“That’s exactly it,” he said. “Obviously, being inactive for the postseason was exceptionally disappointing. I want to find a way to have a more permanent role on this team and get one more year in.”
