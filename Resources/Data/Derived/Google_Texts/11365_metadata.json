Finding a family doctor takes forever\n\nAnd then you end up on a wait list for two years.\n\n2. Specialists and hospitals don't talk\n\nWhich means your specialist might send you to a hospital with a long wait time instead of one with a short one.\n\n3. Hospital parking is SO EXPENSIVE\n\nAnd nobody makes change inside.\n\n4. Doctors are too busy\n\nAnd it always feels like they're rushing you out the door.\n\n5. Friends with doctors in the family get better service\n\nThey magically get appointments in two weeks instead of eight months.\n\n6. We have to pay for drugs/dentists/vision care\n\nBut we always forget and end up forgoing care or emptying the wallet.\n\n7. And don't get us started on mental health coverage\n\nWhich often isn't covered either.\n\n8. Family doctors insist you can't use walk-in clinics\n\nBecause they lose money every time you do. Why is the pay structure like this again?\n\n9. Preventative care takes a backseat\n\nEven though it could help us save money.\n\n10. Moving provinces is a nightmare\n\nWe're supposed to have universal health care, but good luck figuring out the paperwork to get reimbursed for out-of-province care.\n\n11. It costs money to get a sick note\n\nWhy do we pay for you to scribble gibberish on a notepad? Feels like a hidden fee.\n\n12. And to renew prescriptions over the phone\n\nNow I'm going to the office for no good reason. But the doctor will get paid, so the system will lose money on the transaction. Genius!\n\n13. Doctors STILL HAVEN'T GONE DIGITAL\n\nEven after the eHealth scandal in Ontario.\n\nSeriously, do they just hate computers?\n\nBut even though things aren't perfect\n\nAt least we'll always be better than them", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Danielle Martin, vice president at the Women's College Hospital in Toronto, totally schooled Sen.
