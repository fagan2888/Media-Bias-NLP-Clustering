The dream of one Chip Baskets (to be played by Zach Galifianakis) is to be a professional clown. After bombing out of clown school in Paris, he’s pursuing his goal in Bakersfield, CA. As a rodeo clown. That’s the premise of “Baskets,” a single camera comedy starring Galifianakis and co-created by Louis C.K. and Jonathan Krisel, today ordered as a series by FX.

FX has ordered 10 episodes of “Baskets,” with production due to begin next year and the series scheduled to launch in 2016. “Baskets” is the first production under FX Productions’ overall deal with Louis C.K. and his production company, Pig Newton.

The pilot was co-written by executive producers Galifianakis, Emmy Award-winner Louis C.K., and Emmy Award-nominated writer and director Jonathan Krisel (“Portlandia,” “Saturday Night Live” “Man Seeking Woman”), who is the showrunner on Baskets and also directed the pilot.
