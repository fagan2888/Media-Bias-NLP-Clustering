(Reuters) Connecticut said on Wednesday that it will provide special driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants starting next week to help stop them from driving the state’s roads unregistered and uninsured.

The move comes days after President Barack Obama issued an executive order protecting millions of undocumented immigrants across the country from deportation, which state officials said could boost participation in their drivers’ license program.

“There are many undocumented immigrants driving without a driver’s license who aren’t insured or registered, and we believe making that possible is very important,” said Mike Lawlor, Connecticut’s undersecretary for criminal justice policy and planning.
