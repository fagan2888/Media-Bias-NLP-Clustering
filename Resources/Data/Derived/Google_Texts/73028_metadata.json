They just allow powerful interests to cash in.\n\nThe costs of such deals in \u201cthe world we\u2019re living in\u201d are likely to be even higher now. Powerful interests are more powerful than ever thanks to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision opening the floodgates to big money.\n\nWhich takes us to the second view about how presidents accomplish big things that powerful interests don\u2019t want: by mobilizing the public to demand them and penalize politicians who don\u2019t heed those demands.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt got a progressive income tax, limits on corporate campaign contributions, regulation of foods and drugs, and the dissolution of giant trusts \u2014 not because he was a great dealmaker but because he added fuel to growing public demands for such changes.\n\nIt was at a point in American history similar to our own. Giant corporations and a handful of wealthy people dominated American democracy. The lackeys of the \u201crobber barons\u201d literally placed sacks of cash on the desks of pliant legislators.\n\nThe American public was angry and frustrated. Roosevelt channeled that anger and frustration into support of initiatives that altered the structure of power in America. He used the office of the president \u2014 his \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d as he called it \u2014 to galvanize political action.\n\nCould Hillary Clinton do the same? Could Bernie Sanders?\n\nClinton fashions her prospective presidency as a continuation of Obama\u2019s. Surely Obama understood the importance of mobilizing the public against the moneyed interests. After all, he had once been a community organizer.\n\nAfter the 2008 election he even turned his election campaign into a new organization called \u201cOrganizing for America\u201d (now dubbed \u201cOrganizing for Action\u201d), explicitly designed to harness his grassroots support.\n\nSo why did Obama end up relying more on deal-making than public mobilization? Because he thought he needed big money for his 2012 campaign.\n\nDespite OFA\u2019s public claims (in mailings, it promised to secure the \u201cfuture of the progressive movement\u201d), it morphed into a top-down campaign organization to raise big money.\n\nIn the interim, Citizens United had freed \u201cindependent\u201d groups like OFA to raise almost unlimited funds, but retained limits on the size of contributions to formal political parties.\n\nThat\u2019s the heart of problem. No candidate or president can mobilize the public against the dominance of the moneyed interests while being dependent on their money. And no candidate or president can hope to break the connection between wealth and power without mobilizing the public.\n\n(A personal note: A few years ago OFA wanted to screen around America the movie Jake Kornbluth and I did about widening inequality, called \u201cInequality for All\u201d \u2013 but only on condition we delete two minutes identifying big Democratic donors. We refused. They wouldn\u2019t show it.)\n\nIn short, \u201cthe real world we\u2019re living in\u201d right now won\u2019t allow fundamental change of the sort we need. It takes a movement.\n\nSuch a movement is at the heart of the Sanders campaign. The passion that\u2019s fueling it isn\u2019t really about Bernie Sanders. Had Elizabeth Warren run, the same passion would be there for her.\n\nIt\u2019s about standing up to the moneyed interests and restoring our democracy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>In 2008, when then-Senator Barack Obama promised progressive change if elected president, his primary opponent, then-Senator Hillary Clinton,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/opinion-real-change-takes-a-movement/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Opinion: Real change takes a movement"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/opinion-real-change-takes-a-movement/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Opinion: Real change takes a movement"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201dThat ain\u2019t the real world we\u2019re living in.\u201cSo what\u2019s possible in \u201cthe real world we\u2019re living in?\u201dThere are two dominant views about how presidents accomplish fundamental change.\nOpinion: Real change takes a movementIn 2008, when then-Senator Barack Obama promised progressive change if elected president, his primary opponent, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, derided him.\nIn short, \u201cthe real world we\u2019re living in\u201d right now won\u2019t allow fundamental change of the sort we need.\nPowerful interests are more powerful than ever thanks to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision opening the floodgates to big money.\nThey just allow powerful interests to cash in."}
