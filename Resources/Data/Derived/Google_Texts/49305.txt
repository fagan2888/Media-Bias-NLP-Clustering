Second-term president, first-time caller?

President Obama called into Boston public radio station WGBH Thursday to surprise outgoing Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, who was on the air for one last “ask the governor” segment.

“Governor, this is Barack Obama, formerly of Somerville. I’ve got a few complaints about service in and around the neighborhood. But I’ve moved down south since that time,” the president said.

“You’re kidding, Mr. President. Who is this impersonator? You’re very good. Who is this, really?” Patrick responded.

Obama said he called to find out how Patrick was able to make Massachusetts “so strong” and move it “in the right direction.”

Patrick responded with a joking jab. “Mr. President, you know I love you, but you still have trouble saying ‘Massachusetts.’ You know that, don’t you?”

Obama lived in a Somerville, Massachusetts apartment while attending Harvard Law School. After holiday well-wishes were thoroughly exchanged, the segment wrapped up with a nod to about $117 in unpaid fees and fines Obama reportedly owed the city of Somerville as of 2007, as The Boston Globe reported. The president assured the hosts that he had resolved the outstanding tab.
