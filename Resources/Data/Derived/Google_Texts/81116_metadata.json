They carry the movie.\u201d\n\nAfter more than 30 years, Ford is reprising his role as smart-aleck smuggler Han Solo in director J.J. Abrams\u2019 \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d out Dec. 18.\n\nThe iconic character, who hasn\u2019t been seen on screen since celebrating the fall of the Galactic Empire in 1983\u2019s \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d serves as an unlikely mentor to scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley), defector Finn (John Boyega) and pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) as they team up to take on masked adversary Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and his minions.\n\nWhile the film has been cloaked in an unparalleled level of secrecy, Ford guaranteed that fans can expect the same Solo they fell in love with from the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy. (Disney declined to screen \u201cForce Awakens\u201d for this story ahead of the Dec. 14 premiere).\n\n\u201cThe shorthand is that he\u2019s older and wiser, but his bones are the same,\u201d Ford said. \u201cHe\u2019s not selling real estate now. He\u2019s the same guy \u2014 only with the passage of 30 years. While we do not sit down and describe what he\u2019s been doing for those years, we do discover in the context of the story what the complications have been in his life.\u201d\n\nFord, who infamously wanted George Lucas to kill off Solo in \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d had a \u201cwhy not?\u201d attitude about suiting back up as Solo. He wasn\u2019t surprised by Disney\u2019s Death Star-sized plan to revive the franchise after acquiring Lucasfilm in 2012 for more than $4 billion. The studio is planning to release a stand-alone film about a young Solo in 2018.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harrison Ford promises older, wiser Solo in \u2018Force Awakens\u2019", "title": "Harrison Ford promises older, wiser Solo in \u2018Force Awakens\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Harrison Ford promises older, wiser Solo in \u2018Force Awakens\u2019", "title": "Harrison Ford promises older, wiser Solo in \u2018Force Awakens\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/08/harrison_ford_promises_older_wiser_solo_in_force_awakens/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/star-wars-ford.jpeg-1280x836.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Harrison Ford promises older, wiser Solo in \u2018Force Awakens\u2019", "title": "Harrison Ford promises older, wiser Solo in \u2018Force Awakens\u2019", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/star-wars-ford.jpeg-1280x836.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Derrik J.
