Within minutes, much of this stretch of chic South Beach was flooded ankle-deep in a fetid mix of rain and sea.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the new Venice,\u201d McKenzie joked as salt water surged from the sewers.\n\nThere are few places in the nation more vulnerable to rising sea levels than low-lying South Florida, a tourist and retirement mecca built on drained swampland.\n\nYet as other coastal states and the Obama administration take aggressive measures to battle the effects of global warming, Florida\u2019s top Republican politicians are challenging the science and balking at government fixes.\n\nAmong the chief skeptics are U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, both possible presidential candidates in 2016. Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for re-election, has worked with the Republican-controlled Legislature to dismantle Florida\u2019s fledgling climate change initiatives. They were put into place by his predecessor and current opponent, Democrat Charlie Crist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d Scott said, after a federal report pinpointed Florida \u2013 and Miami in particular \u2013 as among the country\u2019s most at-risk areas.\n\nHe and other Republicans warn against what they see as alarmist policies that could derail the country\u2019s tenuous economic recovery.\n\nTheir positions could affect their political fortunes.\n\nDemocrats plan to place climate change, and the GOP\u2019s skepticism, front and center in a state where the issue is no longer an abstraction.\n\nTheir hope is to win over independents and siphon some Republicans, who are deeply divided over global warming. Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has pledged to spend $100 million this year to influence seven critical contests nationwide, including the Florida governor\u2019s race.\n\nThe battle in the country\u2019s largest swing state offers a preview of what could be a pivotal fight in the next presidential election.\n\nCrist is running for his old job as a Democrat, criticizing Scott and Florida Republicans for reversing his efforts to curb global warming.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t believe in science. That\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Crist said at a recent campaign rally in Miami. \u201cThis is ground zero for climate change in America.\u201d\n\nNationally, the issue could prove tricky for Democrats.\n\nPolls show a bipartisan majority of Americans favor measures to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as the new federal rule to limit carbon emissions from power plants. But they routinely rank climate change far behind the economy, the centerpiece of Scott\u2019s campaign, when prioritizing issues.\n\nIn Miami Beach, which floods even on sunny days, the concern is palpable. On a recent afternoon, McKenzie pulled out his iPad and flipped through photos from a 2009 storm. In one, two women kayak through knee-high water in the center of town.\n\n\u201cThis is not a future problem. It\u2019s a current problem,\u201d said Leonard Berry, director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University and a contributing author of the National Climate Assessment, which found that sea levels have risen about 8 inches in the past century.\n\nMiami Beach is expected to spend $400 million on an elaborate pumping system to cope with routine flooding. To the north, Fort Lauderdale has shelled out millions to restore beaches and a section of coastal highway after Hurricane Sandy and other storms breached the city\u2019s concrete sea wall. Hallandale Beach, which lies on the Atlantic Coast between the two cities, has abandoned six of its eight drinking water wells because of encroaching seawater.\n\nBy one regional assessment, the waters off South Florida could rise another 2 feet by 2060, a scenario that would overwhelm the region\u2019s aging drainage system and taint its sources of drinking water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where some properties being bought today will probably not be able to be sold at the end of a 30-year mortgage,\u201d said Harold Wanless, chairman of the geological sciences department at University of Miami. \u201cYou would think responsible leaders and responsible governments would take that as a wake-up call.\u201d\n\nFlorida lacks a statewide approach to the effects of climate change, although just a few years ago, it was at the forefront on the issue.\n\nIn 2007, Crist, then a Republican, declared global warming \u201cone of the most important issues that we will face this century,\u201d signed executive orders to tighten tailpipe-emission standards for cars and opposed coal-fired power plants.\n\nBush, his predecessor, had pushed the state during his administration to diversify its energy mix and prioritize conservation.\n\nEven Rubio, who was then Florida House speaker and a vocal critic of Crist\u2019s climate plans, supported incentives for renewable energy. With little opposition, the GOP-led Legislature passed a bill that laid the groundwork for a California-style cap-and-trade system to cut carbon emissions and created a special commission to study climate change.\n\nBut the efforts sputtered as the economy collapsed and Crist and Rubio faced off in a divisive 2010 Republican primary for U.S. Senate.\n\nAlthough Rubio had voted for Crist\u2019s landmark environmental measure, he soon hammered the governor for what he called a \u201ccap-and-trade scheme.\u201d Seeking support from the growing tea party movement, he distanced himself from the vote.\n\nRubio also began to voice doubts about whether climate change is man-made, a doubt he shares with Bush. Both have stuck to that position.\n\nAmid meetings with conservative activists and Republican leaders in New Hampshire last month, Rubio said: \u201cI do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.\u201d Proposals to cut carbon emissions, he said, would do little to change current conditions but \u201cdestroy our economy.\u201d Rubio later said he supports mitigation measures to protect coastal property from natural disasters.\n\nScott and Florida Republicans share his current views.\n\nDenouncing \u201cjob-killing legislation,\u201d they repealed Crist\u2019s climate law, disbanded the state\u2019s climate commission and eliminated a mandate requiring the state to use ethanol-blended gasoline. Asked about climate change recently, Scott demurred, saying the state has spent about $130 million on coastal flooding in his first term, as well as millions on environmental restoration.\n\nMeanwhile, Miami Beach is bracing for another season of punishing tides.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suffering while everyone is arguing man-made or natural,\u201d said Christine Florez, president of the West Avenue Corridor Neighborhood Association. \u201cWe should be working together to find solutions so people don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve been left on a log drifting out to sea.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida, and Philip Elliott in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Michael J.
