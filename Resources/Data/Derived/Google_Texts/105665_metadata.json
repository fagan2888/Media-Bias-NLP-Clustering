Bernie Sanders is trailing in the polls and may not be able to pull out a victory next Tuesday in the New York primary against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But he has the wind at his back and could score another important moral victory \u2013 even if he doesn\u2019t put a dent in Clinton\u2019s committed delegate count.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s safe to say: The self-described democratic socialist has startled the political world with an improbable campaign that has frequently rocked Clinton on her heels and led to victories in seven of the last eight primary and caucus contest. Wednesday night, he drew roughly 27,000 people to a rally in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park, a larger crowd than the one gathered for nominee Barack Obama in 2007.\n\nRelated: Bernie and Hillary Take the Gloves Off in a Fiery Debate\n\nSanders rallied with striking Verizon communications workers earlier in the day, whose union endorsed Sanders last December. Clinton signaled her solidarity with the strikers as well, but she can\u2019t count on many of them backing her at the polls next Tuesday. And despite her strong support among blacks and Hispanics more generally, Clinton got a tepid response from those attending the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network convention after former President Bill Clinton clashed with some Black Lives Matter protesters last week.\n\nAnd \u2013 talk about perfect timing \u2013 federal regulators announced yesterday that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and three other of the largest banks in the country are still \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and do not have credible plans for how they would unwind in the event of another banking crisis. This played directly into the hands of Sanders, who for months has been calling for the breakup of these banks while Clinton has advocated a more cautious approach called for under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law\n\nSanders for a long time was criticized as a Johnny One Note who obsessed in his speeches on income inequality and the evils of Wall Street\u2019s largest banks, which he largely blames for the financial meltdown that triggered one of the worst recessions in U.S. history. He was also criticized by the Clinton camp and others for seemingly stumbling over his explanation of precisely how he would go about breaking up the big banks during a lengthy interview with the New York Daily News editorial board a week ago.\n\nAs The New York Times noted on Wednesday, Sanders\u2019s position has drawn some positive nods from \u201dthe other side of the political spectrum\u201d in the banking world, including Neel Kashkari, a former Treasury Department official during the 2007-2008 financial crisis and now the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nRelated: New Polls -- Kasich Is the Only Republican Who Could Beat Clinton\n\nDuring his speech last night in the heart of Greenwich Village, Sanders lashed out once again against the political \u201cstatus quo\u201d and \u201ccorporate greed and the rigged economy\u201d \u2013 taking careful aim at the big banks and at Clinton, the former New York senator who over the years has accepted $675,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.\n\n\u201cIt is about creating a government that works for all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributions,\u201d Sanders said to the cheering masses near the campus of New York University. \u201cThis campaign is sending a message to corporate America: You cannot have it all.\u201d\n\nSanders, the former mayor of Burlington, Vt., and a member of the House of Representatives, early on vowed to conduct a civil campaign that would be steeped in issues and devoid of personalities and cheap shots.\n\nBut as Clinton has pulled well ahead of Sanders in both committed delegates and \u201csuper delegates\u201d to the point where it is almost impossible for him to overtake her and win a majority before the Democratic national convention in July, Sanders and his advisers have been far more critical and hard hitting against Clinton, to the point of disputing that she has the qualities and judgment to be the next president. Sanders insists, for example, that Clinton\u2019s Senate vote in 2002 in support of the U.S. invasion of Iraq -- leading to vast U.S. casualties and expenditures of government funds \u2013 is reason enough to disqualify her for president.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Tax Plan Soaks Everybody, With the Wealthiest Paying Millions More\n\nThe Sanders campaign also has portrayed Clinton as an establishment Democrat who has had to be dragged further left on key issues and always seems to come up with an argument for why Sanders proposals for free tuition, national health care for all and other liberal ideas are not feasible.\n\nAs if the Democratic contest wasn\u2019t heated enough, Paul Song, the executive chairman of the progressive Courage Campaign, who also spoke at the Sanders rally, said the government would never adopt a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program like the one Sanders has proposed as long as \u201ccorporate Democratic whores\u201d are elected.\n\nSanders and Song both later apologized for the comment, but the damage had been done. And now we all await tonight\u2019s final Democratic presidential debate on CNN, beginning at 9 pm (ET) in advance of Tuesday\u2019s New York primary, to see whether the vitriol continues to flow.\n\nSanders is at a crucial juncture in his drive for the nomination: After treating his campaign largely as a progressive messaging effort for months, he now firmly believes he is best equipped to be the Democratic nominee \u2013 and best equipped to beat Republican frontrunner Donald Trump in the general election campaign this fall. But the more the political analysts and experts insist he can\u2019t overcome the delegate math squarely in favor of Clinton, the angrier and more frustrated he appears to become.\n\nRelated: Not So Fast, Hillary: Bernie\u2019s Right About Breaking Up the Banks\n\nMore than half way through the primary season, Clinton leads Sanders in total delegates, 1,776 to 1,118, with 2,382 needed for the nomination. That means Clinton needs to pick up an additional 606 delegates in the remaining contests to win the nomination, with many of the upcoming races in the highly friendly terrain of the Northeast. Clinton leads Sanders 55 percent to 41 percent in New York, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Regardless of the result Tuesday night, she is certain to pick up more than half of the 291 Democratic delegates at stake. Sanders will probably end up losing ground.\n\nBecause the Democratic delegates will be distributed proportionate to the popular vote going forward, Sanders will have to score improbably large victories \u2013 of 60 percent or more \u2013 if he hopes to catch up to Clinton. Or he will have to persuade many of the \u201csuper delegates\u201d \u2013 the party and elected officials who automatically are chosen to take part in the convention \u2013 to switch their allegiance from Clinton to the Vermont senator.\n\nAt the same time, Sanders may have turned up the heat so much in his now-frequent denouncements of Clinton that the two sides will have a tough time putting the pieces together and uniting against the Republicans this fall. After all, Sanders\u2019 comments disputing Clinton\u2019s qualifications to be president will make interesting fodder for GOP political campaign ads this fall if Clinton emerges as the Democratic nominee.\n\nIf Clinton wins next week by ten or more percentage points, as the recent polls suggests, she will be well on her way to securing the nomination, even without much reliance on the super delegates. If Sanders wins in New York -- where he was born and Clinton served two terms as a U.S. senator -- then the race will be turned upside down and Sanders\u2019s scenario for ultimately winning the nomination will seem more credible.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.", "title": "Sanders Has the Wind at His Back in His Improbable Bid for the Nomination", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/14/Sanders-Has-Wind-His-Back-His-Improbable-Bid-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX29UZY.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/14/Sanders-Has-Wind-His-Back-His-Improbable-Bid-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX29UZY.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Regardless of the result Tuesday night, she is certain to pick up more than half of the 291 Democratic delegates at stake.\nClinton leads Sanders 55 percent to 41 percent in New York, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.\nAfter all, Sanders\u2019 comments disputing Clinton\u2019s qualifications to be president will make interesting fodder for GOP political campaign ads this fall if Clinton emerges as the Democratic nominee.\nSen.
