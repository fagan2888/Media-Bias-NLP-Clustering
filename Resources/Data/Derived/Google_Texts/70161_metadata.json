Bush\u2019s life may recently have been saved because of a diagnostic test that would likely have been prevented by the sort of limits Obamacare \u201cquality measures\u201d will impose.\n\nAccording to an October 11th National Journal piece, \u201cGeorge Bush\u2019s Close Call,\u201d Tom DeFrank writes,\n\n\u201cSources familiar with the former president\u2019s medical situation told National Journal that a major blockage in a coronary artery discovered during Bush\u2019s annual physical exam in August had almost completely shut off blood flow to one of his heart chambers. \u2018He was more than 95% occluded,\u2019 an authoritative source said. \u2018With a blockage like that in a main artery you\u2019re supposed to die. He was pretty lucky they caught it.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet before the 95% figure became public, the doctors who had ordered the test whose results sent Bush into urgent surgery were denounced for having done so.\n\nFor example, in an August 9th opinion written for the Washington Post titled, \u201cPresident Bush\u2019s unnecessary heart surgery,\u201d Vinay Prasad and Adam Cifu lamented that George Bush received the heart health test. They wrote:\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Bush had visited a general internist practicing sound, evidence-based care, he would not have had cardiac testing. Instead, the doctor would have had conducted age-appropriate cancer screening. For the former president, this would include only colon cancer screening. It no longer would include even prostate-specific antigen testing for cancer. The doctor would have screened for cholesterol, checked for hypertension and made sure the patient was up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations, including those for pneumococcal pneumonia and shingles. Presumably Mr. Bush got these things, and he got the cardiac test as well. What value does a stress test add for an otherwise healthy 67-year-old? No study has shown that this examination improves outcomes.\u201d\n\nNote the emphasis on \u201cage-appropriate\u201d testing. Does it bespeak an unstated assumption that when you\u2019re old spend we shouldn\u2019t waste too much money on checking for life-threatening illnesses?\n\nReducing the number of \u201cunnecessary and expensive tests\u201d has long been a goal of those seeking to cut health care costs. While we would all prefer to spend less on healthcare, these tests, although sometimes expensive, do save lives. It is a fact that an otherwise seemingly healthy former president\u2019s extra testing probably saved his life.\n\nBy contrast, in another Post opinion piece, \u201cThe unnecessary test that saved my mother\u2019s life,\u201d Dr. Jason Wasfy described how one inconclusive test after another finally led to a very early diagnosis of his mother\u2019s lung cancer that made the condition treatable.\n\n\u201cTypically, patients do not know they have lung cancer until they notice symptoms such as a cough or weight loss. At that point, lung cancer is usually incurable. My mother was lucky. An unwarranted liver test led to a discovery in the lung, which spotlighted cancer caught early enough to be cured.\u201d\n\nHowever, reducing the use of a number of tests like the ones Dr. Wasfy\u2019s mother and former President Bush received may become the new normal under the Obama health care law.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nDoctors, hospitals, and other health care providers can essentially be told by Washington just what diagnostic tests and medical care are authorized under \u201cquality and efficiency\u201d standards imposed by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nEven if the patient is willing and able to pay for it, treatment that a doctor and patient deem needed or advisable to save the patient\u2019s life or preserve or improve the patient\u2019s health will have to be denied if it exceeds the imposed standards.\n\nDocumentation of this element of Obamacare can be found at: www.nrlc.org/uploads/medethics/LifeatRisk112012.pdf\n\nThe Obama Health Law\u2019s blind insistence on limiting health care spending threatens access to life-saving medical treatment \u2013 now, and in the future.\n\nLifeNews Note: Jennifer Popik is a medical ethics attorney with National Right to Life.
