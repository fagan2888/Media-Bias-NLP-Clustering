Marco Rubio (Paul Sancya/Associated Press)\n\nLooking back on the 2016 presidential field, there was no candidate who seemed to hold as much potential or engender as much excitement as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) did. His family\u2019s story was inspirational. He had a winning smile and could produce stirring rhetoric.\n\nThe Fix's Chris Cillizza breaks down why Marco Rubio was never going to be president. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nAnd yet there had been warning signs that the exterior charm and eloquence were not matched by internal fortitude and mature judgment. After a heroic effort on immigration reform, he not only went mute when the bill left the Senate, but he also plunged head-long into the inane shutdown effort. He did not lead the charge, but he mimicked the ridiculous arguments (e.g. the president would be the one shutting down the government, the public\u2019s anger over Obamacare would carry the day). It seemed a blatant effort to patch things up with the far right, which had become infuriated with his immigration effort.\n\nThen there was the Syria \u201cred line.\u201d If ever there was an issue that demanded Rubio\u2019s support, this was it. He, more than most, understood the enormity of the ongoing bloodbath, the risk that jihadists would take hold and the essential task of projecting U.S. power. Yet once again he blinked, siding with the far right, refusing to take the intellectually consistent and courageous position in support of a military strike.\n\nNext came Rubio\u2019s opposition to an aid bill for Ukraine, opposed by the far right because it contained a reform of the dreaded International Monetary Fund.\n\nAnd while his campaign began with much promise and high expectations, he again faltered at key moments. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ate his lunch at the debate before the New Hampshire primary. When given a chance to break with the pack, show real leadership and declare that he would not support the know-nothing, bigoted, misogynistic, deceitful Donald Trump, he again blinked. Despite all the criticisms, he said he would support the nominee.\n\nNow, after his race is over, Rubio again refuses to stand up and stand tall against the cranks in his party. He proclaims that Trump\u2019s \u201cperformance has improved significantly.\u201d Really? I am curious to know whether Rubio thinks the Trump foreign policy address, littered with contradictions and absurdities, was a significant improvement. What about Trump\u2019s embrace of Mike Tyson and denial that he is a convicted rapist? His assertions that we should give the bomb to South Korea and Japan and pull back from NATO? Judging by his silence on these issues, Rubio seems no different from rank opportunists such as Newt Gingrich. Even worse, Rubio went so far as to support Trump\u2019s argument that he does not really need a majority. \u201cI do think it\u2019s valid to argue to delegates: \u2018Look, let\u2019s not divide the party. You have someone here who has all these votes, very close to get 1,237, let\u2019s not ignore the will of the people or they\u2019re going to be angry.\u2019 \u201d Yes, we wouldn\u2019t want to anger the mob that Trump has stirred up.\n\nWhat does all of this say about Rubio? Frankly, it tends to confirm Jeb Bush\u2019s view of the man. Bush argued that Rubio was untested, short on internal strength and too eager to be liked. It was not a matter of experience \u2014 although that was sorely lacking \u2014 but of character. This was not Jeb Bush\u2019s year. But he had Rubio\u2019s number. What a waste. What a shame.\n\nUPDATE: The Rubio camp argues that in context Rubio was referring to an improvement in Trump\u2019s primary election results, not his \u201cperformance,\u201d although he could have easily said \u201cresults.\u201d Rubio\u2019s defenders also argue he also made the case for the majority delegate rule. Maybe Rubio\u2019s problem is that he is trying to have it every which way, preserving his own political viability. (\u201cMarco wants Donald to lose. If he thought his endorsement would help in California or in Indiana, which it won\u2019t, then he would probably do it. But what Marco isn\u2019t going to do is just endorse Ted, watch Trump win anyway and then, in four years, watch Cruz use Marco\u2019s endorsement against him if they both run for president again.\u201d Got all that?)
