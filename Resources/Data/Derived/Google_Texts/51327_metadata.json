Congress reasoned that physician-owned hospitals drive up overall health care spending because they give doctors a financial incentive to refer more patients for the high-dollar surgeries.\n\n\n\nNow, OrthoIndy is trying to turn that reasoning on its head.\n\n\n\nData released in May by the federal Medicare program show that the Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital performed its surgeries at significantly lower cost than other hospitals around Indianapolis.\n\n\n\nIn fact, if all 3,000 Indianapolis-area Medicare patients that received a major joint replacement without complications in 2011 had gone to the Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital, the Medicare program would have enjoyed a 10.3 percent discount. That punches out to total annual savings in Indianapolis of $4 million, or about $1,340 per patient.\n\n\n\n(That example excludes the downtown hospitals run by Indiana University Health and Wishard Health Services, because those hospitals receive especially large Medicare payments to offset their larger-than-normal expenses for teaching new doctors and handling complex patients.)\n\n\n\nDr. John Dietz, an OrthoIndy physician that spearheaded the creation of the Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital in 2005, said the federal government\u2014and private insurers too\u2014are too strapped by the growing costs of health care to ignore those savings.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe evidence in overwhelming. It\u2019s irrefutable,\u201d Dietz said.\n\n\n\nThose data compared the charges at all hospitals on the 100 most common procedures, as well as the average amount the Medicare program for seniors actually pays each facility for those procedures.\n\n\n\nThe data compared hospitals according to its system of DRGs, or diagnosis-related groups, which accounts for the severity and complexity of a procedure. For example, Medicare\u2019s DRG system makes note of whether a patient had complications or not and even whether those complications were minor or major.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the Medicare data makes it possible to do apples-to-apples cost comparisons across multiple hospitals.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s significant for doctor-owned hospitals because they have been accused of cherry-picking the healthiest and wealthiest patients from community hospitals, which allows them to post great outcomes and pocket big profits.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s some good evidence for that argument. A 2005 report by the Medicare program noted that physician-owned orthopedic and surgical hospitals provided almost no charity care and had a small amount of bad debt.\n\n\n\nNot only that, community hospitals say the lucrative payments they receive for orthopedic surgeries help them pay for other money-losing services, which physician-owned hospitals typically don\u2019t provide, such as mental health care or emergency rooms.\n\n\n\nThat may be true. But the report by Medicare also showed that the taxes paid by physician-owned hospitals\u2014because they are for-profit businesses\u2014far outweighed the value of charity care and bad debt provided by not-for-profit hospitals.\n\n\n\nWhether members of Congress pay attention to this \u201calways low prices\u201d message is another question. But Dietz said he has been presenting the data in Washington, D.C., while arguing that Obamacare\u2019s restrictions on the growth of doc-owned hospitals should be lifted. He says he\u2019s been getting some positive reception.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Dietz said in predicting that Congress will relax the restrictions on the growth of physician-owned hospitals.\n\n\n\nOrthoIndy might have a more receptive audience among private health insurers and employers. I adjusted the charge data released by Medicare to reflect the 35 percent to 40 percent discounts that local hospitals give to uninsured patients.\n\n\n\nThe local hospitals argue that these discounted prices are then roughly equivalent to what private insurance plans pay.\n\n\n\nAssuming that is the case for orthopedic surgery, then private insurers would have saved nearly 33 percent if all their customers had gone to the Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital for joint replacement surgery. That\u2019s a savings of about $9,000 per patient.\n\n\n\nWill those savings prove too good for payers to pass up?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The local orthopedic surgeons are presenting themselves as low-cost providers in an attempt to reverse growth restrictions imposed by Obamacare.", "csrf-token": "Tc7yfga/DpbVJzHCoWpdUuWHDoCu6esmLWlfxUBiV6o=", "twitter": {"description": "The local orthopedic surgeons are presenting themselves as low-cost providers in an attempt to reverse growth restrictions imposed by Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "OrthoIndy channeling Walmart in comeback bid"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "The local orthopedic surgeons are presenting themselves as low-cost providers in an attempt to reverse growth restrictions imposed by Obamacare.", "title": "OrthoIndy channeling Walmart in comeback bid"}, "keywords": "hospitals,Congress,growth,patients,Medicare,savings,hospital,health,orthopedic,orthoindy,care,physician-owned,Obamacare,joint replacement,dietz,orthopaedic", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd77f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Dietz said in predicting that Congress will relax the restrictions on the growth of physician-owned hospitals.\nAssuming that is the case for orthopedic surgery, then private insurers would have saved nearly 33 percent if all their customers had gone to the Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital for joint replacement surgery.\nIn other words, the Medicare data makes it possible to do apples-to-apples cost comparisons across multiple hospitals.\nData released in May by the federal Medicare program show that the Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital performed its surgeries at significantly lower cost than other hospitals around Indianapolis.\nCongress reasoned that physician-owned hospitals drive up overall health care spending because they give doctors a financial incentive to refer more patients for the high-dollar surgeries."}
