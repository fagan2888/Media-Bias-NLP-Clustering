This is before factoring in paying for it all. Understanding what steps to take may be a daunting barrier for those who want help.\n\nDane County residents navigating the available services who have the least amount of resources often face the most racial and economic disparities.\n\nSome 40 percent of the population receiving behavioral treatment services from Access Community Health Center in 2013 did not have health insurance, a percentage higher than the center\u2019s amount of uninsured primary care patients according to Quall.\n\n\u201cThe behavioral health team is serving the neediest part of our patient population,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Access Clinic, a federally funded community center, uses an integrated primary care behavioral health model. This approach allows patients access mental health services while they seek primary medical care, meaning they can often see obtain both sets of services on the same day.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we wanted to start having behavioral [health treatment] was because we had a very hard time finding mental health services for our patients who have Medicaid and Medicare,\u201d Quall said.\n\nThe Access Clinic accepts Medicaid, Medicare and BadgerCare. What makes it different from most area clinics is its federal sliding discount program for those without insurance. Under the federally sponsored program, Access Clinic cannot legally deny primary care services due to an inability to pay.\n\nAccess has a unique health service model. Dane County residents with government health care plans often have trouble finding treatment for a number of reasons.\n\nA limited number of treatment centers accept Medicare and Medicaid because of low insurance reimbursement rates. The rates often do not cover costs needed to operate a clinic, according to director of the Family Center Betty Rygiewicz.\n\n\u201cEven with the Affordable Care Act, a lot of mental health services are not affordable,\u201d she said. \u201cI say that not because [government] agencies are gouging anyone to make as much money as they can, but with rent, utilities and every other cost that goes along with it, there is a lot of cost to run a clinic.\u201d\n\nThe Family Center is primarily funded and staffed by the Marriage and Family Therapy program at Edgewood College. The College funds costs for office space and utilities that enable therapists to collect reduced fees based upon income. Sometimes the payment is whatever little cost the client can afford after the session.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to come in here and have it be another hardship, but we do want people to pay something towards their sessions,\u201d Rygiewicz said.\n\nThe Family Center offers financial flexibility in order to provide individuals, families and couples short-term or long-term treatment weekly.\n\nAlthough the center treats clients with stable and non-severe illnesses, urgent care appointments on the day of an emergency are available to those struggling to make financial ends meet.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t turn anyone away for an inability to pay,\u201d she said.\n\nResources like the Family Center and the Access Clinic are few and far between, according to Rhonda Reinholtz, a licensed psychologist and professor in the University of Wisconsin-Madison psychology department.\n\nReinholtz sees clients with Medicare at her private practice. At times, she offers sliding fees for clients without insurance or who cannot afford the full fee.\n\nThree years ago, she experienced difficulty when referring clients to Journey Mental Health Center, the mental illness treatment facility primarily funded by Dane County.\n\nSue Moran, director of outpatient services at JMHC, said Journey struggles to keep with demand for services. About 40 percent of its clients have no medical assistance, according to the JMHC 2013 Annual Report. Eighty-two percent of clients were assessed as unable to pay based upon its sliding fee scale that offers a zero pay fee.\n\n\u201cWe know that the population\u2019s needs are far greater than the resources we have,\u201d she said.\n\nEven though JMHC schedules 40 intake appointments for new clients every week, Moran said the clinic still has to prioritize children, family, pregnant mothers using substances and crisis situations when scheduling appointments.\n\n\u201cWe try to get people in as quickly as possible,\u201d Moran said.\n\nJMHC provides the largest range of mental health services to the largest population of consumers. The center\u2019s availability increases demand that is further overtaxed by expectations and quotas of health management organizations and health care providers.\n\n\u201cHealth care insurance providers have expectations of how their members are going to be served [at JMHC],\u201d she said. \u201cWe try to be responsive to individual need while we are managing many different [health care provider] contracts.\u201d\n\nAlternatives to publicly funded, chronic mental health illness treatment like JMHC are non-existent, according to Reinholtz. She says she does not know of any psychiatric private practices that use a sliding fee scale.\n\nAs one of the few treatment facilities for the severely mentally ill that accepts any or no form of health insurance, JMHC has a waiting list for appointments sometimes scheduled months from the date of inquiry, according to Rygiewicz.\n\nMoran said that JMHC accepts same-day appointments and usually sees clients one month out from when they first called.\n\nReinholtz had a different experience when calling to make an appointment at JMHC.\n\n\u201cThe last time I checked in with anyone that was trying to get seen [at JMHC] they were so booked up that they weren\u2019t putting people on waiting list anymore,\u201d Reinholtz said.\n\nMoran and her team at JMHC are redesigning the center\u2019s treatment model to better meet the county\u2019s treatment demands. The new, centralized intake process will increase flexibility across JMHC\u2019s treatment programs, getting more clients to the end goal of recovery.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of different programs but we didn\u2019t have a lot of fluidity, she said. \u201cWe wanted to be able to easily move people and be more recovery focused.\u201d\n\nAva Martinez, program coordinator of NAMI in Dane County, found seeking public treatment at JMHC - formally known as the Mental Health Center of Dane County - easily accessible twenty years ago.\n\nMartinez has been a mental health consumer in Dane County since she moved to Madison twenty years ago. She now is an advocate for mental health.\n\nComprehensive promotion of services like Access Clinic, The Family Center and JMHC, along with others like the University\u2019s WISPIC graduate training program, is where Quall would like to see reform in the county\u2019s mental health system begin.\n\n\u201cFrom a consumer standpoint, having something much more easily navigated would be a big improvement to the point of \u2018I have a problem, where do I start?,\u201d she said.\n\nServing the largely diverse population of those in need of mental health treatment may advantage the few of those with education and resources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard at any level if you have mental health issues to navigate the system, but boy if you have resources it makes it easier,\u201d Quall said.\n\nUntil health care becomes more accessible to all of Dane County\u2019s citizens, Martinez\u2019s advice for someone seeking treatment is to persevere.\n\n\u201cI would encourage them to not give up, and know that they are not alone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf0b\"", "article_summary": "Finding the appropriate and affordable treatment may be the larger obstacle for one to face in Dane County\u2019s complex mental health care system.\nThe county\u2019s mental health services must work to balance the demands of treatment needs with the limitations federal, state and private health care insurance providers present.\nServing the largely diverse population of those in need of mental health treatment may advantage the few of those with education and resources.\nBetween the United Way and the National Association for Mental Illness, Dane County has many publicly listed adult mental health services, all of which have very different health insurance policies and treatment models.\nThree years ago, she experienced difficulty when referring clients to Journey Mental Health Center, the mental illness treatment facility primarily funded by Dane County."}
