Cuomo must ensure that no patient is left behind \u2014 and then make full public accounting of how it was that his Department of Financial Services, which regulates insurers, failed to see this disaster coming even as others did.\n\nHealth Republic stood on shaky financial footing from the start, amassing reported losses of $130 million in 18 months.\n\nRegardless, the fledgling nonprofit co-op kept signing up patients attracted by its bargain premiums, while losing money on each and every one.\n\nState regulators insisted they were clueless that insolvency loomed until late September, when they told Health Republic to wind down operations as insurance policies expired.\n\nOn Oct. 30 \u2014 after concluding Health Republic had understated its financial woes \u2014 officials deemed the numbers dire enough to order near-immediate closure.\n\nExchange administrators moved posthaste to instruct stranded patients to sign up for new plans, barraging them with letters, emails and phone calls.\n\nIs there a Plan B if not everyone lands a new insurer? Officials won\u2019t say. What about those cancer patients, who get only a 60-day reprieve before losing coverage? Officials can\u2019t say.\n\nA product of Obamacare, Health Republic has failed as the President\u2019s signature health insurance program enters terra incognita nationwide.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gave birth to 23 nonprofit health insurers, including Health Republic, with $2.4 billion in start-up loans. The starry-eyed premise of Washington Democrats was that the nonprofits would serve as low-cost competition for profit-making health insurance giants.\n\nNew York\u2019s failed co-op alone got a $265 million loan and a later $90 million cash infusion, likely to never be repaid.\n\nSo far, 11 co-ops have gone belly up after being denied additional funding by congressional Republicans set on proving Obamacare a failure.\n\nWall Street analysts had warned months ago that most co-ops were dominoes waiting to fall, lacking the cash and firepower to compete against insurance industry powerhouses.\n\nWhere was Cuomo\u2019s Department of Financial Services? The governor must provide a full independent autopsy after all former Health Republic customers are safely reinsured.\n\nPresent diagnosis: This was one hell of a costly experiment, in terms both financial and human.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "With sickening suddenness, the second-largest insurer on New York\u2019s health care exchange is kaput at the end of the month.", "title": "Editorial: Wanted: Cuomocare for failed Health Republic", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-wanted-cuomocare-failed-health-republic-article-1.2426394", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2426393.1446850626!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health6e-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "andrew cuomo, cuomocare, new york healthcare, healthcare republic,", "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "andrew cuomo, cuomocare, new york healthcare, healthcare republic,", "nydn_tags": "andrew cuomo, obamacare, keyston pipeline, benghazi controversy, same-sex marriage", "news_keywords": "andrew cuomo, cuomocare, new york healthcare, healthcare republic,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-wanted-cuomocare-failed-health-republic-article-1.2426394", "parsely-title": "Editorial: Wanted: Cuomocare for failed Health Republic", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-06T17:58:28-0500", "sailthru.title": "Editorial: Wanted: Cuomocare for failed Health Republic", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-06T22:58:28", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2426393.1446850626!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health6e-1-web.jpg", "description": "With sickening suddenness, the second-largest insurer on New York\u2019s health care exchange is kaput at the end of the month.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "With sickening suddenness, the second-largest insurer on New York\u2019s health care exchange is kaput at the end of the month.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "With sickening suddenness, the second-largest insurer on New York\u2019s health care exchange is kaput at the end of the month.", "title": "Editorial: Wanted: Cuomocare for failed Health Republic", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-wanted-cuomocare-failed-health-republic-article-1.2426394", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2426393.1446850626!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health6e-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "andrew cuomo, obamacare, keyston pipeline, benghazi controversy, same-sex marriage", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2426393.1446850626!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health6e-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "A product of Obamacare, Health Republic has failed as the President\u2019s signature health insurance program enters terra incognita nationwide.\nThe Affordable Care Act gave birth to 23 nonprofit health insurers, including Health Republic, with $2.4 billion in start-up loans.\nThe governor must provide a full independent autopsy after all former Health Republic customers are safely reinsured.\nThe starry-eyed premise of Washington Democrats was that the nonprofits would serve as low-cost competition for profit-making health insurance giants.\nHealth Republic stood on shaky financial footing from the start, amassing reported losses of $130 million in 18 months."}
