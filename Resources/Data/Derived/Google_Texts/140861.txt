WOONSOCKET, R.I., Nov. 6, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) today announced the kickoff and major expansion of Project Health, its annual free health screening campaign, at select CVS/pharmacy locations. Over the next four months, the Project Health wellness program will deliver more than $14 million worth of free health services to multicultural communities with a significant number of uninsured or underinsured individuals across the United States. More than 1,000 Project Health events will be held at select CVS/pharmacy stores in 27 markets.

Project Health offers an array of free comprehensive health risk assessments, including blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), glucose and total cholesterol screenings. Additionally, Project Health will feature CVS Health's smoking cessation program, which was designed with the help of national smoking cessation experts. The program includes four important elements: an assessment of the smoker's readiness to quit; information and tools needed to quit; medication support to help curb the desire to use tobacco; and ongoing coaching to help smokers who are trying to quit stay motivated and prevent relapses.

"Smoking is the leading cause of premature disease and death in the United States with more than 480,000 deaths annually," said Helena Foulkes, Executive Vice President of CVS Health and President of CVS/pharmacy. "By offering a comprehensive and uniquely personalized smoking cessation program at our Project Health events, we are making it easier for our customers to take the first step to a healthier life."

Project Health events will also offer participants information about the health insurance marketplace and their coverage options under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Health insurance experts will be available to provide guidance and support to those who need it throughout the open enrollment period, which runs from November 15, 2014 to February 15, 2015.

Project Health is part of CVS/pharmacy's commitment to improve access to health care and ensure that cost is not a barrier to important preventive services. Project Health events, while held in cities with large multicultural populations, are open to everyone and do not require an appointment.

Originally held in ten major markets, Project Health events will be held in 17 additional cities. The Project Health locations include:

- Atlanta







- Miami - Austin







- Milwaukee - Cincinnati







- Nashville - Chicago







- New Orleans - Cleveland







- New York City - Columbus







- Orlando - Dallas-Fort Worth







- Philadelphia - Dayton







- Phoenix - Detroit







- Pittsburgh - Houston







- Richmond - Indianapolis







- San Antonio - Los Angeles







- Tampa - Louisville







- Washington, D.C. - Memphis











Project Health events are also being held at select CVS/pharmacy stores in Puerto Rico through November as well.

"The free, comprehensive health screenings offered at our Project Health events can help identify health concerns or risk factors for participants," added Foulkes. "By addressing health care challenges, such as ethnic disparities and lack of access to preventive care, we can make a difference in the health and well-being of our customers. It's just one more way we are helping people on their path to better health."

Once screened, CVS/pharmacy will help patients through on-site consultations with bilingual (Spanish/English) nurse practitioners or physician assistants who will analyze results and refer patients who require additional medical attention to no-cost or low-cost medical facilities nearby or to their primary care physician if additional follow-up care is necessary. CVS pharmacists will be available to conduct one-on-one medication reviews and answer any questions patients may have.

Since 2006, Project Health has delivered more than $72 million worth of free health care services to nearly 730,000 customers, demonstrating the continuing need for these critical services. As a result, many areas of concern among participants were discovered:

50 percent were found to be overweight or obese

41 percent had abnormal blood pressure readings

29 percent had abnormal glucose readings

40 percent were found to have abnormal cholesterol levels

Project Health events will be held from 2 p.m. â€“ 6 p.m. on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and/or Sundays at select CVS/pharmacy locations, with no appointment needed.
