(Photo by David Crane/Los Angeles Daily News)\n\nClosing out a short visit through Los Angeles, President Barack Obama spoke to employees of DreamWorks Animation on Tuesday, and praised the entertainment industry as an economic \u201cbright spot.\u201d\n\nThe president toured the company\u2019s Glendale campus before the speech, met with comedian Steve Martin and actor Jim Parsons, two stars of its upcoming movie \u201cHome,\u201d and learned a thing or two about motion-capture technology.\n\nObama then met privately with DreamWorks Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, a longtime supporter, and other studio honchos before taking the stage in front of nearly 2,000 employees.\n\nThe president hailed the entertainment industry for its role in global diplomacy and economic stability, noting Hollywood\u2019s dominance in the international creative marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe thing we do better than anybody else is creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something that can\u2019t be copied. It\u2019s one of the reasons why even with new markets and new technologies, there\u2019s still no better place to make movies and television and music than right here in the United States. The gap between what we can do and what other countries can do is enormous.\u201d\n\nObama addressed some familiar themes during the speech, such as his commitment to the Affordable Care Act and the resistance of congressional Republicans to his economic agenda.\n\n\u201cSome people have heard me say that on my list of top-five movies, \u2018Godfather I\u201d and \u201cII\u201d have to be on it, but it turns out Marlon Brando had it easy, because when it comes to Congress there is no such thing as an offer they can\u2019t refuse,\u201d he said, drawing laughter.\n\nHe touched on immigration reform in the approximately 30-minute speech, saying it would allow the country to \u201cattract the best and brightest from around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey bring extraordinary talents to the United States,\u201d he said of California\u2019s large immigrant population, \u201cand that\u2019s part of what makes America special. That\u2019s part of what, by the way, makes California special. Because it\u2019s always been this magnet of dreamers and strivers, people coming from every direction, saying to themselves, \u2018If I work hard there, I can have my piece of the American dream.\u201d\n\nThe appearance was Obama\u2019s last stop in Los Angeles. He arrived at LAX from San Francisco Monday, where he attended two fundraisers in support of congressional Democrats. In L.A., he was honored with a reception at the Beverly Hills home of NBA Hall of Famer Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson and wife Cookie, before heading to a dinner at the home of billionaire Haim Saban and his philanthropist wife, Cheryl. Earlier Tuesday, he attended a fundraiser at the Hancock Park home of \u201cFriends\u201d co-creator Marta Kauffman, then departed via Marine One helicopter for the trek to Glendale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe started the West Coast trip Sunday in Seattle, where he attended several fundraisers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Closing out a short visit through Los Angeles, President Barack Obama spoke to employees of DreamWorks Animation on Tuesday, and praised the entertainment industry as an economic \u201cbright spot.\u201dThe president toured the company", "title": "Obama calls entertainment industry an economic \u2018bright spot\u2019 in Glendale speech", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20131126/obama-calls-film-biz-an-economic-bright-spot-in-glendale-speech", "image": {"width": "807px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20131126/NEWS/131129547/AR/0/AR-131129547.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Obama calls entertainment industry an economic \u2018bright spot\u2019 in Glendale speech"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Closing out a short visit through Los Angeles, President Barack Obama spoke to employees of DreamWorks Animation on Tuesday, and praised the entertainment industry as an economic \u201cbright spot.\u201dThe president toured the company", "title": "Obama calls entertainment industry an economic \u2018bright spot\u2019 in Glendale speech", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20131126/obama-calls-film-biz-an-economic-bright-spot-in-glendale-speech", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20131126/NEWS/131129547/AR/0/AR-131129547.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Obama, Executive branch", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama, Executive branch"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0142\"", "article_summary": "In the speech, Obama talked about jobs and the Patient Care and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\nPresident Barack Obama speaks to employees at DreamWorks studios in Glendale Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2013.\nThe president hailed the entertainment industry for its role in global diplomacy and economic stability, noting Hollywood\u2019s dominance in the international creative marketplace.\nObama then met privately with DreamWorks Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, a longtime supporter, and other studio honchos before taking the stage in front of nearly 2,000 employees.\nEarlier Tuesday, he attended a fundraiser at the Hancock Park home of \u201cFriends\u201d co-creator Marta Kauffman, then departed via Marine One helicopter for the trek to Glendale."}
