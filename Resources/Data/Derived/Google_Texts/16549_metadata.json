Ashley McIntyre and Danny Robinson were complete strangers a year ago, but a simple twist of fate, along with McIntyre\u2019s compassion for someone she had never met, led to a one-of-a-kind, feel-good story. The couple from Kentucky began planning their wedding this past Christmas, less than a year after McIntyre donated her kidney to help change Robinson\u2019s life.\n\n\"I know being a living organ donor is not possible for a lot of people,\" McIntyre told The Courier-Journal. \"But it's something to just think about. And even if it's not an option, people can put on their license that they will donate. It's just kind of a human thing, something [to] do for another person that could change their life.\"\n\nMcIntyre heard about her future fianc\u00e9\u2019s situation through a local radio station while driving from Nashville to Louisville in January 2014. Robinson had been spending three days a week at dialysis for four hours a day. The 25-year-old electrician did not match with any family member and had already spent two years on the transplant waiting list. McIntyre would soon find out that the pair were a perfect match in more ways than one.\n\nRobinson was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, commonly known as Berger\u2019s disease, at the age of 16. This disease of the kidneys occurs when the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA) becomes lodged in the patient\u2019s kidneys. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, there are currently 123,219 people on the waiting list for a new organ. McIntyre and Robinson hope that their heartwarming story will inspire other people to become living donors.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kidney, heart, kentucky, woman, gives, kidney, stranger, gets, engaged, him, year, later", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ashley McIntyre donated her kidney to Danny Robinson in April 2014.
