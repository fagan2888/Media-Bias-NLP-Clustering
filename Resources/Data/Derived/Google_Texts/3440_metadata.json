The hospital isn't encouraging anyone to endanger their own life, Byran said, but if a neighbor wants to help out, he or she should have training.\n\n\"The studies find that it is the very simple things that make largest amount of differences, stopping the bleeding with direct pressure, elevation, we teach pressure points that are key to stopping extremity bleeding, and then eventually this will move forward\u2014hopefully--where there are trauma kits in the field,\" Bryan said.\n\nThose kits would include protective gloves for bystanders who decide to help out.\n\nThe program does not have any formal funding, Bryan says, but Temple's outreach team hopes to contact local merchants to place first aid kits in strategic, high-crime locations.\n\nFor more information on \"Fighting Chance,\" residents can call 215-707-8398", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Volunteers at Temple University Hospital are teaching first aid skills to residents who want to be ready when violence happens in the neighborhood The community around Temple basically asked What do", "title": "Program aims to help bystanders become first reponders for Philly gunshot victims", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "Volunteers at Temple University Hospital are teaching first aid skills to residents who want to be ready when violence happens in the neighborhood."}, "twitter": {"description": "Volunteers at Temple University Hospital are teaching first aid skills to residents who want to be ready when violence happens in the neighborhood.", "creator": "@taunyaenglish", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_", "title": "Program aims to help bystanders become first reponders for Philly gunshot victims", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-15", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/healthscience/91059-program-aims-to-help-bystanders-become-first-reponders-for-philly-gunshot-victims", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "author": "Taunya English", "keywords": "first, bryan, temple, there, jacobs, should, local, pressure, bleeding, stopping, playground, fighting, chance, wants, program, going, training, scene, everyone, would", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "said Tim Bryan, assistant director of emergency medical services.\nTim Bryan designed the curriculum based his experience as a combat medic.\nThe program does not have any formal funding, Bryan says, but Temple's outreach team hopes to contact local merchants to place first aid kits in strategic, high-crime locations.\nVolunteers at Temple University Hospital are teaching first aid skills to residents who want to be ready when violence happens in the neighborhood.\nThe hospital isn't encouraging anyone to endanger their own life, Byran said, but if a neighbor wants to help out, he or she should have training."}
