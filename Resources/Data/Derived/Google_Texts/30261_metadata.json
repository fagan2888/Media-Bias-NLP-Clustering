Fewer and fewer can remember a time when DC\u2019s Superman was inarguably the character most associated with the term \u201csuperhero\u201d or when Michael Keaton\u2019s \u201cBatman\u201d was that rare, successful superhero film. With that ascendance, the thirst for information and trivia regarding every single facet of the Marvel Universe has grown voracious among fans old and new. Just look at the clamor that erupted earlier this week when writer/director Edgar Wright backed away from helming the upcoming Ant-Man movie; the incident was widely reported despite the fact that Ant-Man is a third-tier Marvel character barely recognizable by anyone without ink-stained fingertips. Fortunately for Marvel, its catalog of heroic exploits in the face of extreme villainy dates back well over 50 years, so there is no end of minutiae to be excavated \u2014 so much so that, 10 years ago, a 22-year-old die-hard fan named Jamie Hari took it upon himself to start pulling together threads in an attempt to make relative sense of the vast Marvel Universe.\n\nFrom Hari\u2019s colossal efforts (\u201ccolossal\u201d as in X-Man\u2019s Peter Rasputin) was born the sprawling Marvel Database under the Wikia banner. (As the host, Wikia makes some profit from placing ads in the wiki. Hari does not.) Very soon after, came the Marvel Universe Wiki, a product of Marvel itself and so official that even Hollywood screenwriter Zack Stentz used it as a research tool while working on \u201cThor\u201d and \u201cX-Men: First Class.\u201d But, while the former is essentially a fan site and the latter is bought and paid for by the company it promotes, the two ever-expanding databases are similar in that they are both ultimately collaborative. Like \u201cMagneto\u201d or \u201cadmantium,\u201d \u201cwiki\u201d is a noun that snuck into the public consciousness without the population at large being so acutely aware of its origins. For the record, Wikipedia defines a wiki as \u201ca web application which allows people to add, modify, or delete content in collaboration with others.\u201d\n\nThe upshot of all this is that, yes, one will find branded editorial on the Marvel Universe Wiki \u2014 with Ant-Man and Daredevil projects in the offing, the site has been featuring splashy posts inviting readers to \u201cFollow the History\u201d of both. But, when it comes down to its core function \u2014 feeding the trivia hounds \u2014 Marvel\u2019s site is not wildly different from Hari\u2019s. Yet, surprisingly, a David and Goliath story did not evolve out of the competition, with Marvel using its considerable resources to crush or absorb Jamie Hari\u2019s DIY labor of love. In fact, the Marvel Database not only exists alongside its corporate-sanctioned cousin, it flourishes. In a side-by-side comparison of entries for Ant-Man, the Marvel Database entry is noticeably longer and far more detailed, reflecting a certain fanboy ferocity in its reporting. But as you will read, the Marvel Universe Wiki\u2019s succinctness is also somewhat by design. Salon talked to Hari about how the two wikis came to coexist.\n\nWhen did you start the Marvel Database, and why?\n\nThe Marvel Database has roots in a series of encyclopedia-style comic books first published in 1981, called the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe. I loved these books as a kid and tried to emulate their style using modern technology. My first attempt at making a comic book database was around 1997. It was not on the Internet and was only for my own use, but I never really make any significant progress. When I was trying to get back into comics in the early 2000s after a brief hiatus, I realized there wasn\u2019t anything on the Internet beyond a few small, disorganized fan pages, nothing with the ambition of Wikipedia. And so in March of 2005, after a few months of work, the Marvel Database was launched. (The DC Database followed in October of that same year.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jamie Hari has created his own empire of comic trivia", "author": "Neil Drumming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jamie Hari has created his own empire of comic trivia", "title": "Battle of the Wikis: One comic fan\u2019s Marvel Database takes on the massive Marvel Universe", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/02/battle_of_the_wikis_one_comic_fans_marvel_database_takes_on_the_massive_marvel_universe_site/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/spiderman2_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jamie Hari has created his own empire of comic trivia", "creator": "@Neil_Salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/spiderman2_3.jpg", "title": "Battle of the Wikis: One comic fan\u2019s Marvel Database takes on the massive Marvel Universe", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Battle of the Wikis: One comic fan\u2019s Marvel Database takes on the massive Marvel Universe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ant-man, databases, Film, Marvel Comics, technology, TV, wiki", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfaf9\"", "article_summary": "The Marvel Database has roots in a series of encyclopedia-style comic books first published in 1981, called the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe.\nWith that ascendance, the thirst for information and trivia regarding every single facet of the Marvel Universe has grown voracious among fans old and new.\nAnd so in March of 2005, after a few months of work, the Marvel Database was launched.\nBut as you will read, the Marvel Universe Wiki\u2019s succinctness is also somewhat by design.\nFrom Hari\u2019s colossal efforts (\u201ccolossal\u201d as in X-Man\u2019s Peter Rasputin) was born the sprawling Marvel Database under the Wikia banner."}
