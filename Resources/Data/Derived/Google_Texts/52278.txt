NEW YORK (AP) - The Neon Trees will have a slightly bigger presence on stage this summer - their drummer, Elaine Bradley, is pregnant.

She and husband Sebastian Bradley are expecting their third child, a daughter, in September. They have a 2-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter.

The baby will be born shortly after the Trees, best known for songs like “Animal,” go on tour this summer: The band, which released the single “Songs I Can’t Listen To” on Tuesday, is embarking on a two-month tour. A rep for the quintet says Bradley will be behind the drums for the cross-country tour, which begins in Seattle in June and ends in Boston in July.
