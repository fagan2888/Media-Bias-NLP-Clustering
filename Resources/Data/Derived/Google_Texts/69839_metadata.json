Now he's hoping to groom the next great kicker from the Midwest.\n\nCantele has coached local players looking to excel on special teams in multiple camps across the area and held one of his Cantele Kicking camps Saturday at Kapaun Mt. Carmel, his alma mater.\n\n\"We've got a lot of kids from the Wichita area - Maize, Goddard, Andale, and the list goes on. But these camps are intended to be small because if a kid needs assistance, you can really give them that attention that they need,\" Cantele said.\n\nCantele's camps focus on field goals, kickoffs, punting and long snapping, placing players in game situations to prepare them for their respective upcoming seasons.\n\n\"I want them to be able to get their money's worth because a lot of times they got to these camps where there are 300 kids and 5 coaches and you get 3 kicks and the coach never sees one, so that's kind of the goal of these camps, along with the college recruiting.\" he said.\n\nCantele's next camp will be August 16th at Kapaun Mt. Carmel.\n\nMore information: www.cantelekicking.com", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "WICHITA, Kan. -- Former Kansas State kicker Anthony Cantele has always had his roots in Wichita.
