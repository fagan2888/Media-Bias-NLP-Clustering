Jeb Bush delivered a big foreign policy speech a few weeks ago, and unfortunately for the Republican presidential hopeful, it featured a few noticeable stumbles . Bush misidentified countries; he mispronounced names; he flubbed the size of ISIS\u2019 fighting force; and he got the U.S. military budget wrong, among other things.\n\nBut the same day, Ari Fleischer nevertheless told the New York Times, \u201cJeb is very much a policy wonk and comes across that way.\u201d\n\nNo, actually he doesn\u2019t. In fact, at times, Bush gives largely the opposite impression.\n\nBut it seems the former governor is managing to develop a wonk-ish reputation among reporters anyway. After a campaign event on Friday night, Politico ran this headline : \u201cJeb Bush wonks out in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nIt was Jeb Bush the conservative, optimistic wonk who showed up in New Hampshire on Friday after a 15-year absence from the first-in-the-nation primary state. In remarks shot through with policy details and optimism about the potential for growth and innovation to solve the country\u2019s problems, Bush emphasized the conservative sides of his positions on education and immigration and called for severe limits on the federal government\u2019s role in fighting climate change at a half-house party, half-media circus at the home of former state Republican Party chairman Fergus Cullen late Friday.\n\nI think part of the problem is grading on a curve. Is Jeb Bush a wonk compared to his brother? Sure. Does Jeb Bush seem more familiar with policy details than Rick Perry and Ben Carson? Most of the time, yes.\n\nBut let\u2019s not be too eager to define \u201cwonk\u201d down.\n\nAs the former governor\u2019s foreign policy speech helped prove, his comfort level with substantive details is, at best, suspect. The troubles continued on Friday.\n\nIn his remarks to the roughly 30 business leaders, Bush criticized Obama for failing to maintain a U.S. military presence in Iraq after 2010, repeating his assertion that the U.S. withdrawal allowed for the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS). \u201cNow we need to reengage with some small force level to continue to train the Iraqi army,\u201d and to ensure that Sunni and Shia militias are united against the militant group. Asked by reporters whether Obama\u2019s deployment of thousands of U.S. troops to do just than was sufficient or whether he would call for even more American forces to be sent to Iraq, Bush said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI totally haven\u2019t been briefed enough for that,\u201d he added.\n\nI\u2019d put that in the \u201cnot good\u201d category. Bush knew enough to repeat the prepared talking point about a key international issue, but asked a simple follow-up question, the candidate made it seem as if no one had yet told him what to say next.\n\nThe week before, Bush was confronted with a Dream Act kid, and when asked a pretty basic question for those familiar with the immigration debate, the Florida Republican seemed completely lost\n\nDREAMER: Will it be your priority to end DACA and DAPA? BUSH: End what? DREAMER: End DACA and DAPA. BUSH: DACA? What is\u2026\n\nLook, it\u2019s early in the process, and I suspect Bush will become more familiar with the issues as the campaign continues. He\u2019ll do more interviews, talk to more voters, and host more Q&A sessions, which will no doubt help him brush up on specifics.\n\nBut in the meantime, the former governor, who hasn\u2019t even campaigned for public office since 2002, seems a little rusty on policy details and the substance of many key debates. He\u2019s making plenty of generic comments, without demonstrating an expertise on much of anything.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Is it too late to reconsider Jeb Bush's reputation as a \"wonk\"?
