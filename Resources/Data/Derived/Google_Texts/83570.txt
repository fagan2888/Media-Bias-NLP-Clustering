Insurer EmblemHealth will issue almost $400,000 in reimbursements to patients and pay the state of New York a $25,000 fine for charging colonoscopy patients for anesthesia services. In addition, Emblem says it will now cover anesthesiology services provided in connection with an Affordable Care Act-mandated in-network preventive colonoscopy, without any cost-sharing by the member.

Following patient complaints, the state attorney general's office investigated the New York City-based insurer's colonoscopy billing practices, and found that it had required patients to shoulder a share of anesthesia costs when their in-network procedures used out-of-network anesthesia providers.

According to the federal Affordable Care Act, insurers must fully cover preventative colorectal cancer screenings, waiving co-pay, co-insurance and deductible amounts.

In its settlement with New York state, Emblem Health acknowledged that a total of 255 claims were incorrectly processed, and announced plans to train its staff to prevent future oversights.

"My office will continue to verify that health insurance companies are following the law," said Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman in a statement, "so that we can avoid the needless patient suffering and high-cost care involved with advanced illnesses."
