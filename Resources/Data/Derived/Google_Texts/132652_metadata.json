Obama has asked Congress to rescind it but has been blocked by the Republican leadership. Instead, Obama has used executive authority to loosen trade and travel restrictions.\n\nCuba also complains about the continued occupation of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, which Obama has said is not up for discussion, and U.S. support for dissidents and anti-communist radio and TV programs beamed into Cuba.\n\n\"There are many years of mistrust and we are not going to change our system, our values,\" said Ileana Valdes, 55, a nurse. \"Although one must highlight that there are no longer invasions.\"\n\nThe Americans in turn criticize one-party rule and repression of political opponents. Cuban police briefly detained more than 200 activists in the days before the visit, dissidents said.\n\nObama\u2019s critics at home accuse him of making too many concessions for too little in return from the Cuban government and of using his trip to take a premature \"victory lap.\"\n\nLittle progress on the main issues is expected when Obama and Castro meet on Monday or over state dinner that night.\n\nInstead, the highlights are likely to be Obama's speech on live Cuban television on Tuesday, when he will also meet dissidents and attend a baseball game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\n\"Times change and it's great that we have relations with the United States, even though they still impose the embargo,\" said Barbaro Echevarria, 28, a medical student. \"But we can't blame all our problems on the U.S. embargo.\"\n\nObama is not scheduled to meet retired president Fidel Castro, 89, but officials reminded Cubans of their \"historic leader\" by publishing photos in the Juventud Rebelde newspaper of Castro seated in a wheelchair and meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nMaduro had just visited Cuba to receive its highest state honor in a show of defiance by socialist allies that have stood together against the United States since Maduro's predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, came to power in 1999.\n\nThe photos of Fidel and the medal for Maduro underlined the conflicting sentiments within the Communist Party about receiving a U.S. president. At the same time official media published a glowing biography of Obama and the government signed a hotel management deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide.\n\nStarwood becomes the first U.S. hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution, announcing a multimillion-dollar investment to manage and market two properties in Havana and signing a letter of intent to operate a third.\n\n(Reporting by Nelson Acosta; Editing by Daniel Trotta and Bernard Orr)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/20/Cuba-casts-aside-rancor-welcome-Obama-historic-visit", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama arrives in Cuba on Sunday for a 48-hour visi", "title": "Cuba to welcome Obama on historic trip despite hatred of embargo"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/20/Cuba-casts-aside-rancor-welcome-Obama-historic-visit", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama arrives in Cuba on Sunday for a 48-hour visi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Welcome signs with images of Obama alongside Castro popped up in colonial Old Havana, where Obama will tour on Sunday afternoon shortly after landing.\nLittle progress on the main issues is expected when Obama and Castro meet on Monday or over state dinner that night.\nCuban police briefly detained more than 200 activists in the days before the visit, dissidents said.\n\"Obama has been brave for agreeing to relations with Cuba,\" said school teacher Elena Gonzalez, 43.\nAt the same time official media published a glowing biography of Obama and the government signed a hotel management deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide."}
