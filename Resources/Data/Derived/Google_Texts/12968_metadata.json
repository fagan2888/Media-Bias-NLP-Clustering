Metropolitan Opera Technical Department\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera\u2019s singers, dancers and stage managers would lose between 22% and 39% of their compensation if the company\u2019s proposed work-rule changes are implemented, according to a preliminary analysis by their union.\n\nIn a bid to reduce labor costs, the Met has proposed several work-rule changes and a high-deductible health insurance plan for its chorus, dancers and production staff. The Met hasn\u2019t specify the net effect of those proposed changes on employees\u2019 incomes.\n\nIn a letter to members Thursday, union head Alan Gordon called the Met\u2019s proposals \u201can attack on its performing artists,\u201d and advised members to prepare for a potential lockout.\n\nMet spokesman Peter Clark said: \u201cMr. Gordon\u2019s letter is inaccurate in every respect, and most significantly in his characterization of the Met\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nThe Met is also seeking concessions from its orchestra members and stagehands.
