The Dietzel people also touted their grassroots army and their theory that it would make the difference on Election Day \u2013 specifically that Dietzel\u2019s get-out-the-vote operation would insure that he\u2019s actually underpolling at present compared to what his actual vote will be.\n\nWe predicted in that report \u2013 and this should be no surprise \u2013 that there would be disagreement with the Dietzel camp\u2019s theory of the race. And that disagreement didn\u2019t take long to materialize in a substantive fashion. Today, the Graves campaign presented a completely different view of where things stand 26 days until Election Day.\n\nSpecifically, Graves has a poll out by Magellan Strategies, the nationally-known Republican firm doing their polling, which doesn\u2019t show the skin-tight race Dietzel\u2019s polling firm shows\u2026\n\nGraves\u2019 poll has a sample of 1,423 respondents and a margin of error of 2.5 percent.\n\nA poll with Graves at 21 percent and a nine-point spread between the three main Republican candidates is a far bolder statement than the 12-10-10 split Dietzel\u2019s pollster John Couvillon was showing.\n\nThe Dietzel and Claitor camps will surely scoff at the poll and pick it apart. But Graves\u2019 camp can defend the poll by noting that in the last few weeks they\u2019ve unloaded onto the airwaves \u2013 we\u2019re told by independent sources that Graves\u2019 cable TV buys alone in the district total over $300,000 so far \u2013 and their ads are very effective. And the fact is, they are. This ad in particular has gotten strong reviews\u2026\n\nWe know that effective TV ads, run with massive exposure, can move a race. We don\u2019t know, absent credible independent polling, whether that is in fact happening here, or if it\u2019s happening to the extent that Graves is now running away from the GOP field as Magellan\u2019s poll suggests.\n\nBut even Dietzel\u2019s polls showed upward movement for Graves, if sluggish, over the last three months.\n\nGraves\u2019 campaign manager Kevin Roig says that next week the campaign will show that it has raised over $1 million since the campaign began, and Graves\u2019 campaign has had a much lower burn rate than the others \u2013 meaning they can continue their TV blitz, which their polling says is working, without running out of money.\n\nThe Graves campaign also took issue with Dietzel\u2019s presentation of the race with respect to polling. They noted that the momentum among known polling where Dietzel\u2019s campaign is concerned is negative, not positive. To wit\u2026\n\nGiven all that, Graves\u2019 camp says Dietzel probably shouldn\u2019t be crowing about a poll which has him at 12.\n\nOf course, this is all little more than informed speculation at this point. Everyone has their own polling showing their candidate as making the runoff; we hope shortly to bring the Claitor camp\u2019s theory of the race to you.\n\nThat said, Graves\u2019 view is as believable as Dietzel\u2019s. He\u2019s running a bunch of TV ads, and they\u2019re pretty good ones, his campaign is holding well-attended events (there is one tonight with Mary Matalin at the Renaissance Hotel in Baton Rouge), he\u2019s got a lot more money than any of the other campaigns and he\u2019s spending it. Like Dietzel he\u2019s a first-time candidate, and unlike Dietzel he doesn\u2019t have the name recognition to cover up his new-guy status, and there is some pushback against Graves\u2019 candidacy in that he\u2019s seen as a Bobby Jindal acolyte because he ran the governor\u2019s coastal protection agency \u2013 and with Jindal not making an endorsement or campaigning for anyone in the race Graves bears all the negativity of being associated with an unpopular governor without getting any of the benefit of Jindal\u2019s imprimatur or positive notice.\n\nBut Graves also has an attractive message, as Dietzel does, and while Dietzel might have a larger grassroots army Graves has one of his own (he boasts of having over 40,000 volunteer calls logged and 13,000 home visits by his campaign), plus there is the matter of the 13 parish presidents who have signed on to his campaign. If those parish presidents utilize their political machines on Graves\u2019 behalf on Election Day, they could be his ace in the hole.\n\nOf course, if the Magellan poll is accurate Graves doesn\u2019t need an ace in the hole. He\u2019s holding a winning hand with his show cards alone if he\u2019s really sitting at 21 percent at present.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "Earlier this week we reported on a meeting with the campaign manager and pollster from the Paul Dietzel campaign, who touted a poll saying their man was holding a slight advantage over Garret Graves and Dan Claitor in the race to land a spot in the 6th...", "title": "Not Surprisingly, The Graves Campaign\u2019s Theory Of The LA-6 Race Differs From Dietzel\u2019s", "url": "http://thehayride.com/2014/10/not-surprisingly-the-graves-campaigns-theory-of-the-la-6-race-differs-from-dietzels/", "image": "http://thehayride.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/graves-poll-10-9-14-150x150.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "6th District, Dan Claitor, Garret Graves, Paul Dietzel, Polls", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2f8\"", "article_summary": "Today, the Graves campaign presented a completely different view of where things stand 26 days until Election Day.\nThe Graves campaign also took issue with Dietzel\u2019s presentation of the race with respect to polling.\nThey noted that the momentum among known polling where Dietzel\u2019s campaign is concerned is negative, not positive.\nWe predicted in that report \u2013 and this should be no surprise \u2013 that there would be disagreement with the Dietzel camp\u2019s theory of the race.\nTo wit\u2026Given all that, Graves\u2019 camp says Dietzel probably shouldn\u2019t be crowing about a poll which has him at 12."}
