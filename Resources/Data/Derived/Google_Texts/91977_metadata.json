DPI\u2019s CFO Philip Price explains that the new legislation, SB 793 or \u201cCharter School Modifications,\u201d does not change the fact that charter schools must abide by North Carolina\u2019s Public Records Act as well as requirements set forth in their charters that demand them to disclose all employees\u2019 salaries associated with the operation of their schools \u2013 whether they be employed by for-profit companies or not.\n\n\u201cAfter we looked at the law with lawyers, they ensured me it was our [the State Board of Education] authority to ask all charter schools, even for-profit education management organizations, to send all the salary info to us,\u201d said Cobey.\n\nCobey requests the following from all charter schools by September 30, 2014:\n\nA list of all employees paid by the EMO (or any vendor) that are assigned to manage or\n\nwork at the school. Minimum information to be included: Name\n\nDuties (brief description)\n\nAnnual Salary A Budget/expenditure report that outlines each year of the contract A description of the activity\n\nBudget amount (sum of which equals the contract total)\n\nPrior year/current year expenditures\n\nAccording to Joel Medley, director of the Office of Charter Schools, if any charter school fails to disclose this salary and budget information by September 30, it will be in financial non-compliance with the State Board of Education \u2013 which sets that school on a path toward losing its charter and being shut down.\n\nThe charter school legislation passed this summer ignited a firestorm when a late version of the bill was found to contain language that shielded for-profit charter school operators from having to disclose the salaries of their employees.\n\nThe last-minute changes to the legislation came at a time when one prominent Wilmington-based charter school operator, Baker A. Mitchell, Jr., had been fighting media requests for months that asked him to fully disclose the salaries of all employees associated with his charter schools \u2013teachers as well as employees of his for-profit education management company, Roger Bacon Academy.\n\nMitchell operates four charter schools in North Carolina, from which he has personally profited in the amount of 16 million taxpayer dollars in management fees over the past several years. He is also deeply involved in charter school politics at the state level.\n\nBefore signing the bill, Gov. Pat McCrory had said he would veto any legislation that shielded charter school salaries from the public eye.\n\n\u201cI still share my previous concerns with transparency for charter schools\u2026lawyers are currently reviewing the interpretations of this new law and I won\u2019t take action on the legislation until we have a clear interpretation on transparency,\u201d McCrory said upon learning of the changes to SB 793 that limited charter school transparency.\n\nThe Governor ultimately signed the bill, but said he\u2019d ask Chairman Cobey to ensure that contracts with private entities also require the disclosure of salary information.\n\nReached by phone, a spokesperson for Baker Mitchell\u2019s Roger Bacon Academy was not able to comment on whether or not they would comply with the salary disclosure request by September 30.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ab2\"", "article_summary": "Pat McCrory had said he would veto any legislation that shielded charter school salaries from the public eye.\nHe is also deeply involved in charter school politics at the state level.\nMitchell operates four charter schools in North Carolina, from which he has personally profited in the amount of 16 million taxpayer dollars in management fees over the past several years.\nThe charter school legislation passed this summer ignited a firestorm when a late version of the bill was found to contain language that shielded for-profit charter school operators from having to disclose the salaries of their employees.\nCobey requests the following from all charter schools by September 30, 2014:A list of all employees paid by the EMO (or any vendor) that are assigned to manage orwork at the school."}
