The U.S. Department of Agriculture spent $191 million to contain the outbreak\u2014though the total cost is closer to $700 million once cleanup, disinfection, and vaccine research are included, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in July.\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t cover farmers\u2019 lost sales. It took John Burkel more than three months to repopulate his turkey barns near Badger, Minn., after the flu claimed 14,000 of his birds in a single week. He\u2019ll have just two-thirds of his usual supply to sell this Thanksgiving\u2014as long as flu doesn\u2019t strike again. \u201cI don\u2019t know if a guy could do this two times in a row, to be honest,\u201d he says.\n\nU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, thinks Burkel shouldn\u2019t have to. Almost half of all bird flu detections were in her state, the nation\u2019s top turkey producer. In 2014, before the flu hit, she succeeded in getting language into the federal farm bill authorizing a USDA study into how to create insurance for poultry and pig producers along the lines of public programs covering growers of corn, soybeans, and other commodities prone to weather disasters. Klobuchar is pushing the agency to complete the study and move quickly to come up with a solution to ensure farmers like Burkel don\u2019t go under. \u201cThis is a way of life for these producers,\u201d she says. One option is to expand the program that already covers cleanup costs after an outbreak. \u201cYou could keep the USDA\u2019s current program and add insurance to losses not currently covered,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could make insurance a part of indemnification. You could have different programs for different types of birds.\u201d\n\nInsurance against bird flu is \u201ctop topic No. 1 through 5\u201d among poultry producers right now, says John Anderson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation. But setting up a bird flu insurance program is harder than doing so for crops because outbreaks are more difficult to predict.\n\nPrivate insurers say it\u2019s almost impossible to write policies covering bird flu losses as long as the risk of another outbreak remains high. Palomar Insurance in Atlanta, which tailors risk management policies to the needs of specific industries, is studying how to pool bird flu risks with other hazards, but it hasn\u2019t generated much interest from underwriters. \u201cIf we get through the fall with minimal problems, then it becomes more palatable,\u201d says Des Yawn, a Palomar senior vice president. \u201cIf there\u2019s a risk that what happened this year happens every year, there isn\u2019t going to be much interest.\u201d\n\nNational Crop Insurance Services, the Overland Park (Kan.) group that represents government-backed farmer insurance programs, referred questions about bird flu insurance to the USDA, which said it will report to Congress on the feasibility of a program later this year. Minnesota turkey farmer Burkel isn\u2019t waiting around. He\u2019s increasing his flu prevention measures, putting double screens on his roof vents to keep out wild birds and washing every truck that enters or leaves his farm. \u201cAt a certain level, you will always be responsible for your own barns,\u201d he says. \u201cI can tell you this: I don\u2019t want to spend my time composting the turkeys in my barn. That is something I never want to do again.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: Private insurers say there\u2019s no market to insure farmers against bird flu, so the government may act.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alan Bjerga", "twitter": {"description": "Minnesota poultry farmers ask for federal bird flu insurance", "title": "Turkeys Could Use Obamacare, Too", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-03/turkeys-could-use-obamacare-too", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iCkQBI0b2L7A/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alan Bjerga", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Politics &amp; Policy", "news_keywords": "Politics &amp; Policy", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-03/turkeys-could-use-obamacare-too", "parsely-title": "Turkeys Could Use Obamacare, Too", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-03T20:37:16.508Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Minnesota poultry farmers ask for federal bird flu insurance", "parsely-tags": "Politics &amp; Policy,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-09-03T20:37:16.508Z", "parsely-section": "businessweek-magazine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Minnesota poultry farmers ask for federal bird flu insurance", "title": "Turkeys Could Use Obamacare, Too", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-03/turkeys-could-use-obamacare-too", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iCkQBI0b2L7A/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Minnesota poultry farmers ask for federal bird flu insurance"}, "parsely-post-id": "NU3XWD6S972B01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iCkQBI0b2L7A/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd949\"", "article_summary": "But setting up a bird flu insurance program is harder than doing so for crops because outbreaks are more difficult to predict.\nThe arrival of cooler weather in the upper Midwest has poultry farmers worrying about the return of bird flu, which last spring wiped out more than 48 million chickens and turkeys nationwide.\n\u201cI can tell you this: I don\u2019t want to spend my time composting the turkeys in my barn.\nYou could have different programs for different types of birds.\u201dInsurance against bird flu is \u201ctop topic No.\nAlmost half of all bird flu detections were in her state, the nation\u2019s top turkey producer."}
