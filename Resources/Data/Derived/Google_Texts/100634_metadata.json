Its front-line workers earn from $19 to $28.50 an hour, with benefits.\n\nUber is estimated to be worth some $40 billion, and has 850 employees. Uber also has over 163,000 drivers (as of December \u2013 the number is expected to double by June), who average $17 an hour in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, and $23 an hour in San Francisco and New York.\n\nBut Uber doesn\u2019t count these drivers as employees. Uber says they\u2019re \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d\n\nWhat difference does it make?\n\nFor one thing, GM workers don\u2019t have to pay for the machines they use. But Uber drivers pay for their cars \u2013 not just buying them but also their maintenance, insurance, gas, oil changes, tires and cleaning. Subtract these costs and Uber drivers\u2019 hourly pay drops considerably.\n\nFor another, GM\u2019s employees get all the nation\u2019s labor protections.\n\nThese include Social Security, a 40-hour workweek with time-and-a-half for overtime, worker health and safety, worker\u2019s compensation if injured on the job, family and medical leave, minimum wage, pension protection, unemployment insurance, protection against racial or gender discrimination and the right to bargain collectively.\n\nNot to forget Obamacare\u2019s mandate of employer-provided healthcare.\n\nUber workers don\u2019t get any of these things. They\u2019re outside the labor laws.\n\nUber workers aren\u2019t alone. There are millions like just them, also outside the labor laws \u2014 and their ranks are growing. Most aren\u2019t even part of the new Uberized \u201csharing\u201d economy.\n\nThey\u2019re franchisees, consultants and freelancers.\n\nThey\u2019re also construction workers, restaurant workers, truck drivers, office technicians, even workers in hair salons.\n\nWhat they all have in common is they\u2019re not considered \u201cemployees\u201d of the companies they work for. They\u2019re \u201cindependent contractors\u201d \u2013 which puts all of them outside the labor laws, too.\n\nThe rise of independent contractors is the most significant legal trend in the American workforce \u2013 contributing directly to low pay, irregular hours and job insecurity.\n\nWhat makes them independent contractors is mainly that the companies they work for say they are. So those companies don\u2019t have to pick up the costs of having full-time employees.\n\nBut are they really independent? Companies can manipulate their hours and expenses to make them seem so.\n\nIt\u2019s become a race to the bottom. Once one business cuts costs by making its workers independent contractors, every other business in that industry has to do the same \u2013 or face shrinking profits and a dwindling share of the market.\n\nSome workers prefer to be independent contractors because that way they get paid in cash. Or they like deciding what hours they\u2019ll work.\n\nMostly, though, they take these jobs because they can\u2019t find better ones. And as the race to the bottom accelerates, they have fewer and fewer alternatives.\n\nFortunately, there are laws against this. Unfortunately, the laws are way too vague and not well-enforced.\n\nFor example, FedEx calls its drivers independent contractors.\n\nYet FedEx requires them to pay for the FedEx-branded trucks they drive, as well as the FedEx uniforms they wear and FedEx scanners they use \u2013 along with insurance, fuel, tires, oil changes, meals on the road, maintenance and workers compensation insurance. If they get sick or need a vacation, they have to hire their own replacements. They\u2019re even required to groom themselves according to FedEx standards.\n\nFedEx doesn\u2019t tell its drivers what hours to work, but it tells them what packages to deliver and organizes their workloads to ensure they work between 9.5 and 11 hours every working day.\n\nIf this isn\u2019t \u201cemployment,\u201d I don\u2019t know what the word means.\n\nIn 2005, thousands of FedEx drivers in California sued the company, alleging they were in fact employees and that FedEx owed them the money they shelled out, as well as wages for all the overtime work they put in.\n\nLast summer, a federal appeals court agreed, finding that under California law \u2013 which looks at whether a company \u201ccontrols\u201d how a job is done along with a variety of other criteria to determine the real employment relationship \u2013 the FedEx drivers were indeed employees, not independent contractors.\n\nDoes that mean Uber drivers in California are also \u201cemployees\u201d? That case is being considered right now.\n\nWhat about FedEx drivers and Uber drivers in other states? Other truck drivers? Construction workers? Hair salon workers? The list goes on.\n\nThe law is still up in the air. Which means the race to the bottom is still on.\n\nIt\u2019s absurd to wait for the courts to decide all this case-by-case. We need a simpler test for determining who\u2019s an employer and employee.\n\nI suggest this one: Any corporation that accounts for at least 80 percent or more of the pay someone gets, or receives from that worker at least 20 percent of his or her earnings, should be presumed to be that person\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d\n\nCongress doesn\u2019t have to pass a new law to make this the test of employment. Federal agencies such as the Labor Department and the IRS have the power to do this on their own, through their rule making authority.\n\nThey should do so.
