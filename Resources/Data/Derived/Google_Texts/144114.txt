DULUTH, Minn. -

They say there are two certain things in life, death and taxes and while there's no avoiding them, the tax season got a little longer this year.

Many of us think of April 15th as tax day, but this year it is April 18th.

April 15th is actually a government holiday this year and with it being the weekend, there's an extension to file federal taxes until Monday.

Many out there in the Northland are taking advantage of the three extra days and some are trying to wrap everything up today.

One in three taxpayers actually waits until April to file their taxes.

H&R Block in Duluth said they see every tax season come in waves, but each year people wait until the very last minute.

"There's still plenty of time. If people are thinking that they're just not going to be able to get it together before the 18th, they really need to file something because the penalties for not filing are ten times that of just not paying your balance in full," said Sandra Newman, H&R Block District Manager.

For many taxpayers out there, some habits die hard and many find themselves filing the same time each and every year.

".I always say I'm going to do it early, but I'll probably do it late," said taxpayer Tara Holbeck,

In both Wisconsin and Minnesota, the state deadline is also Monday.

New this year with the affordable care act, everyone had to file some sort of 1095.

Many tax professionals have extended their hours over the weekend.

H&R Block's Central Entrance Duluth location is open till 11 p.m. Friday and will be open until midnight on Monday.

They say they have plenty of staff and tax professionals for everyone who comes in.
