UNION CITY — If game No. 1 is any indication, it’s going to be quite a ride for the Union City boys basketball team, which started its season with a 70-58 victory over Dickinson last night.

After trucking through a first quarter that carried four lead changes, the Soaring Eagles seemed to have gained a hold of the game, dominating the second and third quarters.

Then, up 56-41 going into the fourth quarter, it looked like the Soaring Eagles were in place to glide to their first win of 2013-14, but the Rams had other ideas, breaking off a 12-0 run.

They started with a basket from Antwand Williams, followed it with a Carmine Marchitto bucket and continued the success by forcing Union City into turnovers, which eventually help cut the score to 56-53 with five minutes to play.

And that’s when Union City’s Jon Bejar stepped in.

Without thinking about how his team had failed to score a single basket up until that point in the fourth quarter, Bejar took off down the lane, drifting to the right before laying the ball off the glass and into the net to break the scoreless streak.

From that moment on, it would be all Union City as the Soaring Eagles scored 14 of the game’s final 19 points.

“We knew all it would take was one shot,” said Bejar, who finished with seven points. “The momentum just kept going after I hit the bucket and it was a good feeling to have started it.”

Before the contest drifted in Union City’s favor at the end of the first quarter, it was Dickinson that had the advantage early on. At one point, the Rams had a 16-13 lead in the game – after scoring five consecutive points – riding the play of Marchitto, who had eight of his 14 points in the first quarter.

However, a 27-2 run quickly put out that hot start and from there, it was an uphill battle for Dickinson, who was unable to hold on down the stretch.

Union City was led by Steven Sanchez, who had 21 points, and Daiquan Kelly, who had 12. Johnny Sanchez also chipped in with 11 points, while Luis Solorzano produced a 10-point performance.

For Dickinson, Marchitto was complemented by Williams, who finished with 13 points, along with Isaiah Epps and Troy Lopez, who combined to score 17.
