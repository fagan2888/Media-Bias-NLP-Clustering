Sometimes, the market does them anyway.\n\nWar, for example. Even conservatives, who often praise markets, assume that only government can fight terrorists. Tell that to Matthew VanDyke.\n\nVanDyke and his group, Sons of Liberty International, spent the past months in Iraq training the Nineveh Plains Protection Unit, several thousand Christians willing to risk their lives fighting against ISIS\u2019s brutal forces there.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Sons of Liberty are as competent (or more competent) than the U.S. military, but they\u2019re not using taxpayer dollars or getting the U.S. involved in a wider war.\n\nThe market is actually better than magic, because there\u2019s nothing mysterious about it -- it\u2019s all logical.\n\nMy TV show on \u201cmarket magic\u201d this week looks at other things markets do that we\u2019re always told only government can do -- like run courts.\n\nPeople frustrated by legal bureaucracy and tired of waiting endlessly for government courts to make decisions now have alternatives. They can go to private arbitration companies and have their day in court without ever entering a government courtroom. An ABA survey of lawyers found 78 percent said arbitration was more efficient than government.\n\n\u201cBut maybe the for-profit arbitrator is not fair or your opponent bribes the judge!\u201d say market skeptics. That can happen. But if an arbitration firm gets a reputation for making flaky decisions or taking bribes, customers just don\u2019t use it. It goes out of business. That\u2019s how the free market works.\n\nBy contrast, badly run government courts, like other government agencies, never go away. When they fail, they just claim to be \u201cunderfunded\u201d and demand more money. Congress usually gives it to them.\n\nOur air and most of our water are of course public property. It\u2019s good that we have an EPA (though we could use a less oppressive one) to protect such resources. But that also leads people to think we need more government force to handle problems like California\u2019s drought.\n\nEconomist Zachary Donohew points out that California\u2019s water shortage isn\u2019t just caused by drought, though. It\u2019s caused by government refusing to allow the price of water to be set by market forces.\n\n\u201cWater shortages are manmade,\u201d says Donohew. \u201cWe don\u2019t send the right signal to indicate how valuable it is, and we don\u2019t make it easy to move water from one use to the other.\u201d\n\nIn most of America, taxpayers pay for reservoirs and aqueducts, but water sent to consumers, farmers, etc., is practically \u201cfree.\u201d So people waste it. But if the price were allowed to rise to reflect its scarcity, everyone would economize. You might decide you need to cook but not wash your car. Important activities like agriculture would continue, but farmers might grow grapes instead of oranges, because oranges need so much water.\n\nDecisions like that happen naturally when markets set prices. A price is more than money -- it\u2019s information. It tells people what is valuable. Then people adjust.\n\nWhen we forget that, we panic needlessly. Even The Wall Street Journal, which generally understands markets, recently reported on a \u201clooming shortage\u201d of airline pilots.\n\nBut if there really is a shortage of pilots, pilot salaries will rise. More people will train to become pilots and any shortage will be brief.\n\nThe market steers people and resources to where they\u2019re most valued. That happens even faster if government doesn\u2019t interfere with markets by offering its own, poorly run versions of the services people want.\n\nMy fellow New York City subway riders believe government had to dig the subway tunnels and run the trains because \u201cthere\u2019s no profit in mass transit -- it loses money!\u201d But in fact, most of New York\u2019s subways were built by private businesses.\n\nThey only turned them over to government because politicians forced them to. A mayor claimed a proposed fare increase to 5 cents was \u201ctoo much.\u201d Now a subway ride costs $2.75.\n\nI used the phrase \u201cmarket magic,\u201d but the market is actually better than magic, because there\u2019s nothing mysterious about it -- it\u2019s all logical.\n\nThe mystery is why we keep letting government get in the way.\n\nJohn Stossel is the host of \"Stossel\" (Thursdays at 9 PM/ET), a weekly program highlighting current consumer issues with a libertarian viewpoint.
