Jake Cusack/CrossBoundary\n\nInvestments focused on fostering social or environmental goals are playing an increasing role in East Africa, which a new report says is a global center for so-called impact investing.\n\nNearly $10 billion in impact-investment funds have flowed into East Africa, the report, produced by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) and Open Capital Advisors, reveals.\n\nNairobi is the nexus of this funding and the base for many of the managers handling it, the report says, with about half of the $9.3 billion invested in Kenya. Neighboring Uganda and Tanzania receive 13% and 12% of the pie respectively. Ethiopia is trailing at 7% of the total.\n\nAccording to the report, impact investment is becoming an increasingly significant component of overall investment in the region. The report defines impact investors as \u201cthose who invest with the intention to generate a beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return\u2014and who seek to measure the social or environmental returns generated by their investments.\u201d\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to sign up for WSJ Frontiers\u2019 weekly newsletter\n\nThe report notes, however, that the overwhelming majority of the $9.3 billion total comes from development finance institutions (DFIs), organizations such as the World Bank that have traditionally dominated the financing space in the developing world. Only $1.4 billion of the total comes from funds that aren\u2019t related to DFIs, a sign that, while the impact-investment world is gathering pace, it\u2019s still dominated by traditional sources of funding.\n\nNairobi alone is home to dozens of such funds, often co-financed by state aid agencies from developed countries, and private-sector players, such as major Western banks.\n\nKenya will stay at the forefront of this type of investment in future, the report says, in part because of its better-educated workforce and relatively open markets. Still, the positive financial outcomes of impact funding\u2014in the profitability sense\u2014are yet to be seen broadly, as few funds have successfully exited investments, the report notes.\n\nIt also says many potential target companies are not yet ready for investment, and that there is a dearth of senior talent and limited bank lending for smaller companies, making investing in the region challenging.\n\nAmit Bouri, chief executive of GIIN, says East Africa is generating a great deal of excitement among impact investors and the key problems they\u2019re facing aren\u2019t unique to these investors but affect small and medium-sized enterprises more generally. These smaller firms struggle with access to financing and are vulnerable to slumps in growth or other events that can influence the environment in which they operate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous potential for socially and environmentally focused businesses in East Africa,\u201d Bouri told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s hard work, just as all investing is tough.\u201d\n\nThe sector attracting most interest is financial services, which accounts for almost 30% of capital disbursed. Other sectors getting attention include agriculture, energy, tourism and fast-moving consumer goods\u2014essentially those that stand to benefit from the ballooning middle class in Kenya and beyond.\n\nA Bridge International academy in Nairobi, Kenya. Phil Moore for the Wall Street Journal\n\nImpact investors often find themselves co-investing alongside purely profit-driven firms. For example, Bridge International Academies, a well-known chain of privately owned, low-cost schools in Kenya and Uganda, boasts Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg as investors alongside the DFID impact fund.\n\nThat coexistence isn\u2019t always easy, Bridge\u2019s cofounder Shannon May told the Wall Street Journal in an interview earlier this year. Impact investors are often chasing different outcomes and using different measures for success than private-sector investors. That can become cumbersome for these companies, in terms of financial reporting.\n\nIt\u2019s also tricky to measure success, when some investors are pursuing profits and others socially beneficial outcomes.\n\nThe impact-investing sector also faces a perception hurdle, with skeptics claiming that prioritizing social goals undermines financial ones, Bouri says.\n\nResearch published recently by GIIN suggests that is not the case, though. Its report on the study, released in May this year, said: \u201cIn aggregate, impact investment funds launched between 1998 and 2004\u2014those that are largely realized\u2014have outperformed funds in a comparative universe of conventional [private investment] funds.\u201d\n\nWrite to Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Investments focused on fostering social or environmental goals are playing an increasing role in East Africa, with nearly $10 billion invested so far, a new report said on Wednesday.", "title": "East Africa Emerges as Global Hub For Impact Investing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/07/29/east-africa-emerges-as-global-hub-for-impact-investing/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JP717_ipactW_G_20150729103507.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "East Africa Emerges as Global Hub For Impact Investing", "description": "Investments focused on fostering social or environmental goals are playing an increasing role in East Africa, with nearly $10 billion invested so far, a new report said on Wednesday.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Matina Stevis", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Investments focused on fostering social or environmental goals are playing an increasing role in East Africa, with nearly $10 billion invested so far, a new report said on Wednesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-07-29T14:58:16-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/07/29/east-africa-emerges-as-global-hub-for-impact-investing/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-2114", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Investments focused on fostering social or environmental goals are playing an increasing role in East Africa, with nearly $10 billion invested so far, a new report said on Wednesday.", "title": "East Africa Emerges as Global Hub For Impact Investing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/07/29/east-africa-emerges-as-global-hub-for-impact-investing/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JP717_ipactW_G_20150729103507.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-2114", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-07-30T22:38:46-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c0f\"", "article_summary": "According to the report, impact investment is becoming an increasingly significant component of overall investment in the region.\nImpact investors are often chasing different outcomes and using different measures for success than private-sector investors.\nJake Cusack/CrossBoundaryInvestments focused on fostering social or environmental goals are playing an increasing role in East Africa, which a new report says is a global center for so-called impact investing.\nNearly $10 billion in impact-investment funds have flowed into East Africa, the report, produced by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) and Open Capital Advisors, reveals.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous potential for socially and environmentally focused businesses in East Africa,\u201d Bouri told the Wall Street Journal."}
