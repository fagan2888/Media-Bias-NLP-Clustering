If all that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the climate trolls are coming out.\n\nThis time, top honors goes to the Federalist, which can\u2019t get over the irony of Senate Democrats scheduling a hearing on global warming right as a blizzard is expected to hit D.C. In fact, there\u2019s good reason to believe that global climate change is linked to extreme weather like this, but arguing that is an advanced move. Demonstrating that cold and snowy weather in no way disproves global warming? Anyone can do that.\n\nBelow, three tried-and-true retorts to climate deniers. You can try a fast and simple zinger, back it up with a blunt chart or, if you\u2019re tired of explaining, let one of these smart videos do it for you. Why not try a healthy combination of all three? And, as a last resort, there\u2019s always the weather report for Australia.\n\nThe zingers\n\n\u2014 SkepticalScience, a reliable font of detailed information, also breaks it down into this one-sentence explanation:\n\n\u201cA local cold day has nothing to do with the long-term trend of increasing global temperatures.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mother Jones\u2019 Tim Murphy is something of an evangelist for the cause:\n\nIn one sentence: \"Warming things up means the atmosphere can hold more moisture.\" Science! http://t.co/0jMUBSsoVK \u2014 DENALI (@timothypmurphy) February 12, 2014\n\n\u2014 Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer sums up the current reality of climate change:\n\n\u201cShorter snow season, less snow overall, but the occasional knockout punch. That\u2019s the new world we live in.\u201d\n\n\u2014 And, courtesy of the NRDC, a simple analogy:\n\n\u201cThe effect of global warming on our climate is not unlike the effect of steroids on an athlete\u2019s performance: It supercharges storms; it causes abnormal conditions like drought and heat and ultimately, it causes damage.\u201d\n\nThe charts\n\nHere, data from the NOAA and NASA clearly shows that global temperatures have been higher than average for the past 37 consecutive years:\n\nThis one, courtesy of Skeptical Science, plots the annual numbers of record high maximum temperatures (the red dots) along with the record lows (the blue dots), averaged over the U.S. That black line \u2014 the one that doesn\u2019t line up with what\u2019s plotted \u2014 shows where the dots would theoretically lie should no global warming or cooling be taking place.
