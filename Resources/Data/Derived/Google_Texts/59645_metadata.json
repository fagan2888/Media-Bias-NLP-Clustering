Thunder rolled in the distance. Fans wearing No. 17 jerseys filled the stands.\n\nBut it was Helton\u2019s 11-year-old daughter, Tierney Faith, wearing a black dress and black, high-top Converse All-Stars, who put the memorable day into sweet perspective.\n\n\u201cMy daddy has been a Colorado Rockie my entire life,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cThis stadium has been my second home. Thank you for that.\n\n\u201cNow that my daddy has been home with us this season \u2014 a lot \u2014 I want to ask you one question: Do you want him back?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d screamed the crowd.\n\n\u201cJust kidding, Daddy,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cI love you. We are so proud of you.\u201d\n\nHer words were greeted with cheers, laughter and a few tears from the crowd of 42,310 fans.\n\n\u201cA beautiful moment. What a great way to honor Todd,\u201d said Denverite Ellen Barnes, who proudly wore her decade-old purple Helton jersey.\n\nThe Rockies, who hosted the Cincinnati Reds in a split doubleheader Sunday, have played 3,463 regular-season games. Helton took the field for 2,247 of them \u2014 65 percent. He wore No. 17 for each of those games. Now, no Rockies player will ever don No. 17 again.\n\nThe Rockies officially retired Helton\u2019s number Sunday, unveiling a No. 17 plaque on the facade of the second deck in right-center field. He became the first player so honored by the franchise, which began play in 1993.\n\n\u201cI am proud to say that I am a Colorado Rockie for life,\u201d said Helton, wearing a dark suit and a light purple tie. \u201cThere is no greater honor, for me, than having my number retired from the team that I put my heart and soul into. Thank you, all of Colorado, for making my baseball dreams come true. God bless, and go, Rockies.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies retire Todd Helton\u2019s number 17\n\nSharing the day with Helton were his wife, Christy, and daughters Tierney and 4-year-old Gentry Grace.\n\nThe Rockies, skidding toward perhaps the worst season in franchise history, brought back some Rock- tober memories from the 2007 season with an improbable 10-9 victory. They had a five-run ninth inning, capped by Drew Stubbs\u2019 walk-off, three-run homer.\n\nThis game notwithstanding, the Rockies\u2019 overall performance this year has prompted many fans, including Thornton\u2019s J.P. Sampson, to severely cut back on the number of games they attend. Sampson, 35, used to attend about 20 per year. Now he\u2019s down to five. But he wasn\u2019t about to miss Helton\u2019s big day. He brought his 6-year-old son, Brody, with him to Coors Field.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in high school and at college, I would go to games and Todd was the guy who played every day; gave it his all every day,\u201d said Sampson, a teacher at Thornton High School. \u201cHe was such a classy guy, and he seems like a regular guy.\u201d\n\nThe only professional jersey Sampson owns is his gray Helton jersey, purchased in 2000 \u2014 the year Helton produced one of the greatest seasons in baseball history. Helton hit .372, with 42 home runs, 59 doubles and an OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage) of 1.162.\n\nBut his most important number is now displayed next to Jackie Robinson\u2019s No. 42 and a plaque bearing the initials \u201cKSM,\u201d for Keli Scott McGregor, the team president who died in 2010 at age 47.\n\nDuring his pregame news conference, Helton was asked if there was any significance to wearing No. 17.\n\n\u201cI showed up and it was in my locker, and I certainly wasn\u2019t about to say anything good or bad,\u201d Helton said, looking back to his first spring training. \u201cI just took the number and stuck with it.\u201d\n\nHelton retired from baseball at the end of last season \u2014 his 17th in the big leagues, appropriately. His career included five All-Star Games, three Gold Gloves, four Silver Slugger awards, 2,519 hits, 369 home runs and 592 doubles.\n\nBefore Helton took his brief turn at the podium, former teammates Brad Hawpe and Matt Belisle spoke about their good friend.\n\nHawpe, who played with Helton on the 2007 World Series team, spoke affectionately about Helton and also told a telling anecdote.\n\n\u201cI was a first baseman for my whole life,\u201d Hawpe said. \u201cMy first day in my first big-league camp, I was terribly nervous. I strolled over to first base to take a few groundballs with Todd Helton.\n\n\u201cAfter a few groundballs, he looked at me and said: \u2018You look good over here at first. And I hear you can hit a little.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was about to respond to him, but I look over at him and he\u2019s staring a hole right through me. He said, \u2018You better find a new position.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBefore the ceremony, Helton described what having his number retired will mean to him in the coming years.\n\n\u201cI think when I look back on it, the enormity will kick in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd probably anytime I walk into the stadium and see my number up there, the number \u2018one seven\u2019 up there, it will be incredible for me.\n\n\u201cMy girls are old enough now where they\u2019re going to see some things. They\u2019re going to hear the crowd clapping for Dad. I think, to me, that\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nHelton, a native of Knoxville, Tenn., who was drafted from the University of Tennessee in the first round in 1995, said Colorado will always be his home.\n\n\u201cWhen I came here from Tennessee, I always said that Tennessee had the nicest people and the greatest people,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWell, they said, \u2018What do you like about Colorado?\u2019 Well, the people are the same type of people. Just the same regular people you enjoy spending time with. I call this place home now. I\u2019ve raised my kids here, and I plan on staying here a long time. I could pretty much go anywhere I want, but at this point, I\u2019ll never leave Colorado.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdccf0\"", "article_summary": "As Todd Helton emerged from the Rockies\u2019 dugout at Coors Field on Sunday afternoon, theme music from \u201cThe Natural\u201d filled the ballpark.\nI strolled over to first base to take a few groundballs with Todd Helton.\nGod bless, and go, Rockies.\u201dPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies retire Todd Helton\u2019s number 17Sharing the day with Helton were his wife, Christy, and daughters Tierney and 4-year-old Gentry Grace.\n\u201cI am proud to say that I am a Colorado Rockie for life,\u201d said Helton, wearing a dark suit and a light purple tie.\nWhat a great way to honor Todd,\u201d said Denverite Ellen Barnes, who proudly wore her decade-old purple Helton jersey."}
