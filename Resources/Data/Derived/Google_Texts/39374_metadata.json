(Photo: By Ed Zuccarelli) Story Highlights Father and son Tom Lunger Sr. and Jr. formed 90 Proof in 1980 inspired by classic rock, Southern rock, country and blues.\n\nLunger Jr. was only 14 years old when recruited after nailing Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cGimme Three Steps\u201d during a rehearsal break.\n\nA 35th anniversary all-star jam with former members will benefit Veterans Haven North in Glen Gardner.\n\nSince 1994, Lunger Sr. has been an officer of the Clinton Elks, where he once again is exalted ruler.\n\nPITTSTOWN \u2013 For 35 years, Thomas Lunger, founding co-vocalist of the influential Hunterdon County-based Southern, classic and roots rock band 90 Proof, has defied his outlaw image and sound by raising more than $1 million for charity.\n\nMuch of the philanthropy for children, the elderly, veterans and the homeless has been accomplished through a partnership with the Clinton Elks, where Lunger has been an officer since 1994 and once again is exalted ruler.\n\nIn celebration of the band\u2019s 35th anniversary, 90 Proof and the Elks are partnering on another benefit for veterans. Proceeds from an Aug. 1 all-star reunion jam with many of the band\u2019s 20 former members will go to Veterans Haven North, a hospital for homeless vets in Glen Gardner.\n\n\u201cI call it \u2018Unsung Heroes,\u2019 \u201d said Lunger, 70, a Bloomsbury resident. \u201cI ask them what they want, and we go get it. The money goes directly to them with no overhead. We\u2019re going to get them new ping-pong tables.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he has wanted to raise so much money for charity, the Waylon Jennings-like Lunger simply said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nHe added that he joined the Clinton Elks in an effort to align the band with the organization\u2019s many charitable efforts. These include the U.S. Marines\u2019 Toys for Tots Foundation and Camp Moore, the State Elks Association\u2019s Woodbridge-headquartered summer for children with special needs.\n\nCamp Director Pia Grant sang the praises of Lunger and 90 Proof Band.\n\n\u201cGod bless him twice,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for a rock band to do that unless one is a member, like Tommy, who happens to be a member of a band. They absolutely have done a wonderful job over the years.\u201d\n\nTom Lunger, front, and his son, Tom Lunger Jr., back, both of Hunterdon County, will celebrate the 35th anniversary of their band 90 Proof with a benefit for Veterans Haven North on Aug. 1 at the Clinton Elks.

When his father took a break from a rehearsal, the teen stole the mic, nailed Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cGimme Three Steps,\u201d and the rest is a history that has carved a father-son bond from the root of Hank Williams.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re the only father-and-son duo out there,\u201d Lunger Sr. said.\n\nPlaying Rolling Thunder at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in front of 300,000 veterans, bikers and their friends and families throughout the mid-\u201990s remains the most memborable gig the Lungers said they have shared.\n\n\u201cThat was a little intimidating,\u201d said Lunger Jr., a resident of the Asbury section of Union Township. \u201cYou felt like you were Forrest Gump when you up there.\u201d\n\nMusic hasn\u2019t been the only bond between father and son. They have worked together for more than 30 years as commercial and residential painters, much of it with veteran 90 Proof guitarist Chris Hedges.\n\nThe band\u2019s family bond also goes beyond father and son. Like her brother, Lori Lunger is a member of the Elks, who organizes an annual weekend-long music festival that raises around $10,000 a year for children with special needs. The entire festival festival lineup showcases local bands, culminating with 90 Proof.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the same heart we all do, and it gets bigger every year because she\u2019s very good at what she does,\u201d the Lungers said.\n\n\u201cGrowing up with a father who is a rock \u2018n\u2019 roller has taught me a couple of things,\u201d Lori Lunger added, \u201ceventually all of your friends become his friends and fans. It showed me to always march to the beat of my own drum, even when some people don\u2019t like the sound.\u201d\n\nLunger Sr. also has two other daughters, who live in New York\u2019s Rockland County with their mother. Lunger Jr. has three children of his own, but he said he doesn\u2019t share with them the musical connection he has with his father.\n\nWhile the music 90 Proof Band mainly plays comes from the South, the Lungers\u2019 ancestors settled in New Jersey in 1741. Lunger Sr. grew up in Far Hills and Pluckemin, where he initially raised his own family before moving to Hunterdon around 1970.\n\n\u201cHe liked the (Rolling) Stones and country,\u201d Lunger Jr. said. \u201cHe was very Hank Williams Jr., and I was Lynyrd Skynyrd, and we used to bust each other about it because they do a lot of the same songs. And he\u2019d be like, \u2018He does it better,\u2019 and I\u2019d be like, \u2018No, these guys do it better.\u2019 And somewhere, we just meshed mesh, and I started liking his Stones, and he started liking my Skynyrd.\u201d\n\nRELATED:Pattenburg House steps up charitable efforts\n\n90 Proof Band performs in 1994 at Rolling Thunder in Washington, D.C.

Lunger Jr. said the band only has played about 20 paid gigs throughout its 35 years, mainly as a means to upgrade equipment. In comparison, the band and its members have participated in more than 200 benefit concerts.\n\nBlack Potatoe Festival founder Matthew Angus-Williams said he appreciated Lunger Sr.\u2019s generosity not only with local charities but also the many local musicians who have played his fundraisers.\n\n\u201cVery few musicians that I have been fortunate to know have worked so hard and tirelessly toward the benefit of one group of individuals,\u201d Angus-Williams said. \u201cTommy has been a great example in Hunterdon County how the arts can help make a difference in the lives of others. He has always been very supportive of me and all that Black Potatoe has done, and it is much appreciated.\u201d\n\nWhen not busy running the Elks or organizing a benefit concert, Lunger Sr. can be seen sitting in just about every Thursday at the weekly jam led by his bassist, Karl Dietel, also an extremely talented vocalist-keyboardist who leads an original band and a Billy Joel tribute act.\n\nThe last Sunday of the month, Lunger joins a jam with his drummer, Brian \u201cBam\u201d Bridge, and Bridge\u2019s local all-star band, Bones Weedsley. Both jams take place at the Pattenburg House, a historic venue in Asbury that is as charitable as the Lungers and 90 Proof Band.\n\n\u201cIt's no secret that the community of musicians in Hunterdon County has a long tradition of fundraising through their talents, and it all can be traced back to the 90 Proof Band and their park concerts and fundraising \"roundups\" of the late \u201980s,\u201d Bridge said. \u201cThere may have been others doing it, but none with the brazen \u2018bigger-is-better\u2019 attitude of Tom Lunger, who would think nothing of trucking in a giant flatbed and building a massive, two-tiered, intricate and completely unsafe stage on top, throwing 10 bands together and televising the whole thing on local access cable. There is whole host of local players still active in the scene who got their start with a chance to play with the 90 Proof Band, myself included.\u201d\n\nPattenburg House owner Lori Stocklinski added, \u201c90 Proof is a cornerstone of the local community, have been playing for so many years and donate their time selflessly to raise thousands of dollars every year to charities: veterans, local toy drives for children in need. There isn\u2019t a charity around that Tommy Lunger Sr. isn\u2019t the first to step up and want to be part of raising funds.\u201d\n\n90 Proof logo designed by the late John Manner, the band\u2019s original guitarist. (Photo: Courtesy of 90 Proof Band)\n\nAt their 35th anniversary show, the Lungers said they are looking forward to merging former members with their current lineup, which also includes guitarist Eliott Morris and keyboardist Donald Bogut. They said the miss their original guitarist, the late John Manner, who designed their logo of a black wide-brimmed outlaw hat dangling from a bottle of whiskey next to a shot glass.\n\nThe logo also symbolized the hard-drinking lifestyle of Lunger Sr., a stroke survivor who still smokes cigarellos but traded in shots for iced coffee in the wake of a near fatal infection two years ago that attacked his bladder, heart and kidneys. Yet, his dedication to local charity and music never wavered.\n\nReleased from the hospital the day before Russtival, a popular annual festival that raises money to battle pancreatic cancer, the never-say-die rock \u2018n\u2019 roller refused to cancel the gig, much to the amazement of the local music scene.\n\n\u201cI had a (catheter) bag,\u201d Lunger said. \u201cI just wore bigger pants with the bag, and I made it and sang. I had to sit down on a stool because I was tired, but I said, \u2018I ain\u2019t canceling it.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having more fun singing in the past two years,\u201d he added. \u201cI really am, and it\u2019s all because of Lori from the Pattenburg. I was really down when I was sick, but she was there to encourage me and be a friend.\u201d\n\nStaff Writer Bob Makin: 732-565-7319; bmakin@MyCentralJersey.com\n\nHunterdon County-based 90 Proof Band will celebrate its 35th anniversary on Aug. 1 at Clinton Elks with a benefit for Veterans Haven North, a hospital for homeless vets in Glen Gardner.
