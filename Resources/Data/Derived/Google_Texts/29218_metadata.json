Photo by commonwealth.club (CC BY 2.0)\n\nHistoric Obama critic Paul Krugman made an about-face in his opinion of the president\u2019s performance in a much-discussed Rolling Stone essay on Oct. 8 that Salon columnist Thomas Frank, who believes Krugman\u2019s \u201crelentless, one-man war on austerity\u2026 should have earned him a second Nobel Prize,\u201d finds incredible.\n\nIn the Rolling Stone essay, the economist and New York Times columnist declared Obama \u201cone of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history.\u201d\n\nFrank begins his critique of the piece by affirming that his disappointment with the president and the disappointment of so many others occurred in significant part \u201cbecause we paid such close attention to Paul Krugman.\u201d From the Affordable Care Act to the stimulus and financial reform, Krugman wrote time and again, Obama didn\u2019t go far enough. But now Krugman\u2019s decided that \u201cthe glass is half full,\u201d Frank states.\n\nFrank makes the case for half empty. \u201cOn the really momentous economic issues of our time,\u201d he writes, \u201call of them brought into sharp, awful focus by the financial crisis of 2008\u2014Obama\u2019s response has ranged from merely competent to disastrous.\u201d\n\nFor starters, \u201cwith the application of a little presidential muscle,\u201d Obama could have completely restructured the financial industry that helped tank the U.S. economy. And his ongoing lukewarm effort to tax the rich \u201cisn\u2019t even close to enough to reverse the drift toward plutocracy.\u201d Rather than push for a second New Deal, \u201cObama chose to deliver instead \u2026 a second round of \u201990s-style bipartisanship. \u2026 The president looked out over a nation laid low by epic white-collar misbehavior and decided that what we needed was for politicians in Washington to get along with one another.\u201d\n\nAll of the disappointments of Obama\u2019s presidency can be summed up in his failure to push for policies that could have halted the rightward shift of the country, Frank writes. In 2007 the Republican Party was on its back. Public mistrust in government lingered into the Obama years however, and the president did very little to combat \u201cthe perception that the government cared only for the views of the rich.\n\n\u201cThe Wall Street bailouts basically blasted the concept of accountability to dust,\u201d Frank writes. \u201cObama\u2019s Justice Department made sure the public got the message: some people are simply Too Big to Jail. Those people also seem to have been too smart to confront.\u201d Rather than restore public faith in government the president achieved the opposite. His supporters say that\u2019s because the right wouldn\u2019t let him.\n\nBut Frank has an answer for that.\n\n\u201c[A]nyone who has followed the news for the last five years knows there is another factor to be taken into consideration here: Obama didn\u2019t do these things because he or his advisors didn\u2019t want to do them. Oh, there were ways to get many of them done, especially in 2009 and 2010, when the world was at Obama\u2019s feet, begging for action. (The only possible obstacle in those days was the filibuster power of Senate Republicans, which should have been\u2014and eventually partially was\u2014taken away.) But the Democrats\u2019 heart wasn\u2019t in it. They didn\u2019t even try.\u201d\n\n\u2014Posted by Alexander Reed Kelly\n\nMore Below the Ad", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "barack obama, obama administration, paul krugman, rolling stone, stimulus, thomas frank", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Historic Obama critic Paul Krugman made an about-face in his opinion of the president\u2019s performance in a much-discussed Rolling Stone essay on Oct. 8 that Salon columnist Thomas Frank, who believes Krugman\u2019s \u201crelentless, one-man war on austerity\u2026 should have earned him a second Nobel Prize,\u201d finds incredible.\n - 2014/10/20", "title": "\u2018Paul Krugman\u2019s Sloppy, Wet Kiss\u2019 for Barack Obama", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/paul_krugmans_sloppy_wet_kiss_for_barack_obama_20141020", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/7257359946_2af4d14f1e_z_copy.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Historic Obama critic Paul Krugman made an about-face in his opinion of the president\u2019s performance in a much-discussed Rolling Stone essay on Oct. 8 that Salon columnist Thomas Frank, who believes Krugman\u2019s \u201crelentless, one-man war on austerity\u2026 should have earned him a second Nobel Prize,\u201d finds incredible.", "creator": "@truthdig", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/paul_krugmans_sloppy_wet_kiss_for_barack_obama_20141020/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/7257359946_2af4d14f1e_z_copy.jpg", "height": 254}, "title": "\u2018Paul Krugman\u2019s Sloppy, Wet Kiss\u2019 for Barack Obama | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, \u2018Paul Krugman\u2019s Sloppy, Wet Kiss\u2019 for Barack Obama, barack obama, obama administration, paul krugman, rolling stone, stimulus, thomas frank", "article": {"tag": "barack obama, obama administration, paul krugman, rolling stone, stimulus, thomas frank", "published_time": "2014-10-20T12:32:11-08:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-20T14:43:12-08:00"}, "description": "Historic Obama critic Paul Krugman made an about-face in his opinion of the president\u2019s performance in a much-discussed Rolling Stone essay on Oct. 8 that Salon columnist Thomas Frank, who believes Krugman\u2019s \u201crelentless, one-man war on austerity\u2026 should have earned him a second Nobel Prize,\u201d finds incredible.\n - 2014/10/20"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6b9\"", "article_summary": "Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman.\n\u201cThe Wall Street bailouts basically blasted the concept of accountability to dust,\u201d Frank writes.\n\u201c[A]nyone who has followed the news for the last five years knows there is another factor to be taken into consideration here: Obama didn\u2019t do these things because he or his advisors didn\u2019t want to do them.\nBut now Krugman\u2019s decided that \u201cthe glass is half full,\u201d Frank states.\n\u201cObama\u2019s Justice Department made sure the public got the message: some people are simply Too Big to Jail."}
