Locals looking to get their hands dirty for a good cause can team up on the Little Harpeth River next month.

The Brentwood Noon Rotary Club is seeking out volunteers when it holds the 11th annual Little Harpeth River Cleanup on Saturday, Jan. 30.

From civic groups, businesses, neighborhood HOA's and other citizens, everyone is welcome to help the club clean portions of the river where it flows through Brentwood.

The Environmental Projects Committee of the Rotary Club has divided the river into 12 manageable sections. Groups will meet at the Brentwood Library (on the corner of Concord Road and Knox Valley Drive) to register for the 9 a.m. cleanup.

Gear such as trash bags, safety vests and trash-removal supplies will be provided by Keep Williamson Beautiful. Volunteers will be removing debris and collecting trash along the river banks throughout the day.

Rotarians will be on hand to provide assistance and help dispose trash at the end of the cleanup.

"Members of our Rotary Club have been concerned about the health of the Little Harpeth River, so we decided to orchestrate this effort in 2006 and have been doing it each year since," Brentwood Noon Rotary said in a statement. "This service project has a direct benefit to all Brentwood citizens as well as our neighbors downstream.‚Äù
