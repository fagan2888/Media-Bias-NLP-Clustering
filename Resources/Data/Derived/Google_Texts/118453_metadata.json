Nancy Landon Kassebaum, and renowned poet and novelist Ben Lerner. The school\u2019s bevy of Advanced Placement courses and its acclaimed programs in music, theater and debate attract many transfer students who live outside the school district; I was one of them.\n\nTopeka High\u2019s tale, however, is ultimately one of two schools. Its racial and socioeconomic diversity is one of the school\u2019s most trumpeted selling points, but the lived experiences of the school\u2019s poor and minority students are vastly different from those of the predominantly white and affluent students who flock to the school for its robust academics. Nearly 30 percent of Topeka High\u2019s freshmen drop out before graduation, compared with a statewide average of 15 percent. More than two-thirds of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. According to figures provided by the school, about 40 percent of graduates do not go on to any postsecondary education or training.\n\nThose are the students slated to be hit hardest by Republican Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s public education cuts, which he has imposed to help fill the massive revenue shortfalls created by his income tax cuts for the wealthy. Under a block-grant funding scheme Brownback signed into law this winter, Topeka High\u2019s school district is slated to lose $3.6 million in funding this year and over the next two years after that, jeopardizing a wide array of academic and extracurricular offerings; for Topeka High students, athletics programs, arts education, and foreign language courses could be on the chopping block. Other districts have cut short their school years; others still warn they may not have enough toilet paper to last out the school year.\n\nI graduated from Topeka High in 2009 \u2014 one year ahead of my longtime friend Chloe Hough, the waitress who sparked a viral Internet sensation over the weekend after a chance encounter with Brownback. Working her last-ever shift at Boss Hawg\u2019s, a popular Topeka barbecue joint, the 22-year-old posted on Facebook Saturday night: \u201cYou guys 911 emergency: It\u2019s my last shift and I am waiting on our governor. What should I say to him. This is not a test. Go.\u201d Her ultimate decision? On the line where customers typically include a tip, Hough marked a big \u201cX,\u201d writing alongside it, \u201cTip the schools.\u201d\n\nBrownback\u2019s office has yet to comment; the closest we\u2019ve come to an official statement was a petty attack from the director of the Kansas Republican Party, who denounced Hough\u2019s \u201carrogant stupidity\u201d on Monday. Hough, who said her younger sister with special needs has lost educators because of budget cuts, discussed the brouhaha with me over the phone on Monday. Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity and length, is below.\n\nYou\u2019ve received media inquiries from the New York Times, the Daily Mail, and now you\u2019re being pestered by an old friend who works at Salon.
