And they don't look at the...network that they have.\"\n\nMasciarelli said,\"one of the ladies we saw said she called eight primary care offices before she found us...\" The rest would not treat people on her plan.\n\nRosemary Gibson of the Hastings Center and author of \"The Battle over Health Care,\u201d said many people find themselves in the same predicament. \"People are scrambling to find a doctor who will see them, who will accept their insurance, who's in their network. And if they can't, where they end up going is the safety net, which includes community health centers.\"\n\nIf the doctor these patients find orders additional tests or treatment, even those with ObamaCare are sometimes forced to go without.\n\nMasciarelli said patients are honest about their problems. \"They'll say you can't believe what this would cost me. I can't afford that. And they're trying to scrape together some money to get it done sometimes or, frankly, occasionally they'll say I'll just wait and see if things get worse.\"\n\nThat, he said, goes against the whole idea of preventive care, supposedly one of the advantages of ObamaCare, leaving many patients wondering what they're getting from the plan.\n\nHealth economist John Goodman said, \"They go to community health centers because it's free or almost free and or very low charges. And that's why they're doing it. So they were coaxed to go into the ObamaCare system, they're paying premiums over there. And now they're asking what did I get for my premium? I'm having to go outside the system to get health care.\"\n\nMasciarelli agreed. \"We do get asked that question at times, yes, wondering you know, I have this product. I can't even use it. \"\n\nMillions signed up after the president said premiums would be less than their monthly cell phone bill. But now, even those the law was most designed to help still must pay for their own care.\n\nThat may explain why the health care act remains unpopular.The latest Fox News Poll from October 25-27 found that by a 46-26 percent margin, more voters think ObamaCare \u201cwent too far\u201d than \u201cdidn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d\n\nIt also is why so many Republicans have mentioned it in their campaign ads, with one source saying it was the leading topic in mid-October, with Republicans running 12,000 ads on health care.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
