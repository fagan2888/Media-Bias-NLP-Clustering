Tjoflat, a Ford appointee; Stanley Marcus, a Clinton appointee; and Frank M. Hull, another Clinton appointee. Judge Marcus, although a Clinton appointee, is a Republican who had previously been appointed by Ronald Reagan to be a federal judge. Both Hull and Marcus were appointed as compromises by Clinton during a time when Republicans controlled the Senate.\n\nThe 11th Circuit is widely considered to be one of the most conservative federal appeals courts in the nation. Perhaps most notably in recent years, the 11th Circuit struck down portions of ObamaCare before their decision was overruled by the Supreme Court. With that in mind, more Court watchers are expecting SCOTUS to rule in favor of gay marriage later this year.\n\nThe couple who were the plaintiffs in the original lawsuit in Mobile have now filed a motion asking the lower court to lift the stay. There is \u201cno reason for stay to remain in place until Feb. 9,\u201d their attorney wrote in the motion. Feb. 9 was the date the judge had originally put in place in order to give the 11th Circuit the opportunity to weigh in.\n\nIt now appears that as of this coming Monday \u2014 and sooner if the judge goes ahead and lifts the stay \u2014 same-sex marriage will be legal in the state of Alabama.\n\nUPDATE: Attorney General Luther Strange has appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nLike this article?
