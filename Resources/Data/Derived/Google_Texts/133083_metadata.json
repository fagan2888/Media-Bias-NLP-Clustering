It\u2019s much the same thing we\u2019ve been saying here all along, but it\u2019s Dave Ramsey.\n\nAnd he pulls no punches. ObamaCare is communism. And once he explains why, it\u2019s really not even arguable. ObamaCare obliterates basic principles that govern how insurance works, taking away every method insurers use to mitigate risk, and mandates a) everyone be treated exactly the same, regardless of who they are or the level of risk they represent; and b) everyone participate whether they want to or not.\n\nYou know how auto insurers reward you with lower premiums if you\u2019re a good driver? Sensible policy, yes? ObamaCare makes anything like that impossible in health insurance, because the whole idea is that low-risk policyholders and high-risk policyholders must be treated exactly the same, and must pay the same - and no one can opt out because if you can afford to pay and won\u2019t take much from the system, the system needs you! Or more precisely, the system needs your money.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "VIDEO: Dave Ramsey lays it out that ObamaCare is communism, It's a nice moral imperative, but it doesn't change the math . . . your insurance premiums are going to go way up.
