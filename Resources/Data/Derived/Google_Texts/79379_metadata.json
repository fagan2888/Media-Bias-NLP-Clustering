Public nudity could result in an arrest if the person is taking part in lewd and lascivious behavior.\n\nApparently some people have noticed Herrold and called police. Topeka police Lt. Colleen Stuart says the Shawnee County Parks and Recreation Department, which controls the Shunga Trail, may be posting signs stating people are expected to wear clothing in the parks.\n\nThat would put Herrold in violation of a policy -- not an ordinance.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Topeka man who likes to walk a local trail without clothing isn't breaking any local laws.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-man-walks-trail-in-the-nude-legally-311638031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/covering_kakeland-graphic.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Topeka man who likes to walk a local trail without clothing isn't breaking any local laws.", "title": "Kansas man walks trail in the nude, legally"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A Topeka man who likes to walk a local trail without clothing isn't breaking any local laws.", "title": "Kansas man walks trail in the nude, legally", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-man-walks-trail-in-the-nude-legally-311638031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/covering_kakeland-graphic.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Kansas man walks trail in the nude, legally", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kansas man walks trail in, the nude"}, "article_summary": "A Topeka man who likes to walk a local trail without clothing isn't breaking any local laws.\nHe's been spotted several times walking naked on the Shunga Trail.\nTopeka police Lt.
