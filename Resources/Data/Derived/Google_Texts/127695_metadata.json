Others can\u2019t afford coverage, choose not to buy it, or are unaware that they qualify for free or subsidized insurance.\n\nNo matter who they are or what their circumstances, they get sick, too.\n\nQ. I\u2019m uninsured but need medical care. What are my options?\n\nA. It\u2019s hard to pin down exactly how many Californians remain uninsured, but Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, believes there are roughly 3 million of you.\n\nThe good news is that more than a third of you are eligible for coverage, either Medi-Cal or subsidized insurance, through Covered California, says Laurel Lucia, an ACA expert at UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Labor Research and Education.\n\nSo my first piece of advice is perhaps the most important: Find out if you\u2019re eligible for some kind of coverage.\n\nThough Covered California\u2019s open enrollment season has ended for this year, the exchange is offering an extended enrollment period, through April 30, for people who say they were unaware of the tax penalty for not having coverage.\n\nMedi-Cal enrollment stays open year-round, and Medi-Cal is free for most people who qualify.\n\nIf you have a specific disease, you may be able to get coverage from state programs such as California Children\u2019s Services and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, says Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of the California Endowment.\n\nAlso, San Francisco, Los Angeles and some other counties offer county-based health benefits for uninsured residents, such as Healthy San Francisco and My Health LA, Wright says. Check to see what your county offers.\n\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for anything, your health care options will depend largely on three things: your location, your income and your immigration status.\n\n\u201cIt really is a patchwork,\u201d Wright says. \u201cDepending on your county, you may have very different levels of access to care.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s counties run a mishmash of health programs. Some operate public hospitals, others contract with private providers, and still others run clinics.\n\nYour eligibility also varies widely by county, whether we\u2019re talking income or immigration status.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re undocumented in L.A. County, the county clinics are where you\u2019d go,\u201d Zingale says. That is not the case in 48 of the state\u2019s 58 counties, he says. Check with your county to explore your options.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s roughly 1,100 community health clinics, which are separate from the county clinics, serve about 5.6 million people each year, says Carmela Castellano-Garcia, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association.\n\nOf those, about 2 million are uninsured, she says.\n\nThere are different types of clinics, but in general they provide primary and preventive care regardless of immigration status. Their fees are set on a sliding scale based on income, she says.\n\nFree clinics charge nothing at all.\n\n\u201cHow much you pay depends on the kind of clinic you go to,\u201d she says.\n\nWant to find a clinic near you? Castellano-Garcia suggests going to CaliforniaHealthPlus.com and using its online clinic-locator tool.\n\nFederal law requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients without asking about their immigration status or ability to pay.\n\nBut if you\u2019re uninsured, you\u2019ll be responsible for the bills, which can easily climb into the tens of thousands of dollars and wreck your credit.\n\nWant proof? A December report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that medical collections are the source for more than half of collection accounts on credit reports.\n\nBut there are some options. Though unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for full Medi-Cal benefits, they may be eligible for emergency care and pregnancy-related services, based on income.\n\nAlso, most hospitals offer financial assistance and \u201ccharity care\u201d to patients, also based on income, Wright says.\n\nThe ACA offers new protections to consumers who use nonprofit hospitals, such as limiting how much people with certain incomes can be billed.\n\nBut California has stronger protections, Wright says. A pre-existing state law requires all hospitals to inform consumers about their rights and financial options, give them 150 days before their bills are sent to collections and limit the amount that uninsured consumers at certain income levels must pay, he says.\n\nHealth Access and other groups host a website \u2013 HospitalBillHelp.org \u2013 that will help you find discounted or charity care in your area. You can also visit a state-run website to search for similar information: syfphr.oshpd.ca.gov\n\nConsumer groups also support legislation that would address health coverage for the uninsured.\n\nFor instance, one proposed law would make undocumented immigrants eligible for Medi-Cal, assuming they met the program\u2019s criteria. And it would allow them to buy unsubsidized plans from Covered California with their own money. A similar measure stalled last year.\n\nQuestions for Emily: AskEmily@usc.edu\n\nThe CHCF Center for Health Reporting partners with news organizations to cover California health policy.
