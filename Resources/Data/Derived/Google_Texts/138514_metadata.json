I think Alec Baldwin is a great actor.\n\nSome of his performances in \u201c30 Rock\u201d, if I\u2019m honest, were nothing short of genius.\n\nTo me, however, that just proves a point, the relationship between emotion and liberalism. To be a truly great actor, one has to strip away all reason and logic. This is why in acting class, students are told to \u201cact like an omelet\u201d or something just as silly. It\u2019s not that you can be an omelet, but you are learning to remove the logical side of your brain that tells you, \u201cwhat a stupid thing, I\u2019m not an omelet!\u201d\n\nThis is what the great actors are able to do better than anyone. They can \u201cfeel\u201d like the character they\u2019re playing. it\u2019s how they \u201cbecome\u201d that person. It\u2019s an excellent practice for TV, movies and plays.\n\nThe problems start when these shells of human beings are taken serious for deep political thought.\n\nThink about some of the great actors, Marlon Brando \u2026 nutty. Sean Penn\u2026 kooky! (although I will give him credit for his work in Haiti, not just money but the dude moved down there\u2026 ) and Alec Baldwin\u2026 Unhinged!\n\nWhich brings me to the sad news this week, as Mr. Baldwin ran afoul of the law in New York City. His offense was kind of stupid, riding his bike the wrong way down a one-way street. I think they should have let that slide with a warning but then, when the police asked him for ID, he got all lippy and was then slapped with a disorderly conduct charge, too.\n\nIt turns out he wasn\u2019t even carrying any ID. I can just imagine him yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I think I am!\u201d at the cops as they wrote out his summons. He actually did criticize the arresting officers for being too young to recognize his pretty, famous face when he got to HQ.\n\nAfter the encounter, Mr. Baldwin took to Twitter and said, \u201cNew York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.\u201d Okay, he\u2019s right right about that.\n\nThe thing is, we\u2019re all drowning in this atmosphere of criminalization and thought control. Big celebrities and high-rolling politicians think you should fall in line and they should be immune.\n\nMr. Baldwin\u2019s list of outrageous behavior is really too long to fully list here, but it includes calling his own daughter a \u201cpiggy\u201d, allegedly attacking his ex-wife, photographers, journalists and allegedly random people on the street. He made threatening statements about the vice president of the United States on national TV. He\u2019s used anti-gay and racist slurs in his diatribes that cost him jobs with MSNBC and Capital One Bank. He thought he could skate away from those incidents by offering simple apologies, because he\u2019s a liberal. He can\u2019t really be a racist or a homophobe, no matter what he says, because he\u2019s got the correct politics, right?\n\nSpecial exemptions to official rules and cultural understandings for special people are all over the place. Even when it comes to the supposedly most dire issue of all time, climate change, the people who lecture us about driving less and turning up our thermostats have bigger carbon footprints than Godzilla. The people who run wind farms have a license to chop bald eagles to bits. And let\u2019s not even get started on all those special Obamacare exemptions and waivers.\n\nEverything depends on who you are, which political party you belong to, and what kind of connections you have. It\u2019s not surprising that Alec Baldwin thought he could ride his bike the wrong way on a one-way street, or that he doesn\u2019t need to carry identification, or that his response to getting busted was \u201cHow DARE you!\u201d\n\nNo Alec \u2026 your behavior and sense of entitlement is outrageous and borders on insanity. Mr. Baldwin \u2026 How dare YOU!\n\nWhy do you think Hollywood is so far to the left? Is it the acting schools, the money, the fame?\n\nLet me know here at the washingtontimes.com and until our next briefing this is The Rusty Humphries Rebellion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We\u2019re all drowning in this atmosphere of criminalization and thought control.
