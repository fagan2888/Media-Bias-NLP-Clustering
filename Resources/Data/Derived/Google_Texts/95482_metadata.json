James Moran. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nCanek Aguirre knows the positions of each of the seven Democrats running for Congress in his Northern Virginia district as well as anyone not working on a campaign. He has talked to most of the candidates.\n\nBut Aguirre, 29, can\u2019t make up his mind about who will get his vote in the June 10 Democratic primary to replace Rep. James P. Moran (D-Va.).\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all very similar, that\u2019s one of the first things that jumps out,\u201d he said, weighing his choices as he ate a meatball gyro at an Alexandria patio restaurant.\n\nIn a field in which all candidates call themselves progressive or liberal, support the Affordable Care Act and women\u2019s reproductive rights, view climate change as a given and immigration reform as necessary, how can a voter decide who gets the nod?\n\nThe winner of the primary will probably beat Republican Micah Edmond and Libertarian Jeffrey Carson in November, given the overwhelmingly Democratic leanings of the 8th Congressional District, which encompasses Alexandria, Falls Church, Arlington and parts of Fairfax.\n\nThis is a district that gave Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) some of their largest margins of victory last fall. President Obama won 67 percent of the vote here in 2012. Given the power of incumbency, that means next week\u2019s balloting could crown a new member of Congress for many years to come.\n\nAnd yet Aguirre, who will soon start a new job in community relations for Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, cannot interest his friends in any of the candidates: front-runner Don Beyer, a former lieutenant governor and ambassador; Del. Patrick Hope ; state Sen. Adam Ebbin; Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille; talk show host Mark Levine; Virginia Tech professor Derek Hyra; or Lavern Chatman, former head of the Northern Virginia Urban League.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even know there\u2019s a race going on,\u201d Aguirre said, shaking his head in frustration. \u201cThey\u2019re young professionals like me, and the interest isn\u2019t really there. They say \u2018Ah, I\u2019m not going to vote in the primary. I\u2019ll wait until November.\u2019 The problem with that is, it\u2019s decided now.\u201d\n\nThe typical Democratic primary voter in Northern Virginia is a retirement-aged white woman, campaign operatives say. Charilyn Wells Cowan of McLean is one of them. Like Aguirre, she is well-versed in the choices. And, like Aguirre, she doesn\u2019t know whom she wants to back.\n\nCowan, who describes herself as \u201ca concerned senior citizen,\u201d took copious notes at a May 15 forum as she narrowed her choices to Beyer, Levine and Hope.\n\n\u201cGenerally, I thought that Beyer had thoughtful, nuanced answers to many questions and seemed to fit the part,\u201d she said. But she also is thinking of the future.\n\n\u201cPatrick Hope and Mark Levine are both young enough to be there awhile, and actually gain some seniority,\u201d she said. For Beyer, 63, a victory \u201ccould be a capstone\u201d to his career.\n\nThe candidates know that their similarities are making it hard for voters to separate them. In response to a moderator\u2019s question last month, most identified as \u201cElizabeth Warren Democrats\u201d \u2014 although Beyer said he is more in the mold of a \u201cHillary Clinton Democrat.\u201d\n\nAt candidate forums, Hope often says: \u201cEveryone up here is qualified to be your next member of Congress.\u201d\n\nAguirre, who is Mexican American, previously worked for the Alexandria school system, helping at-risk students and their parents connect with school officials. He grew up in Southern California, where his mother supported the family as an elementary school teacher.\n\nIn 2007, Aguirre graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nEducation is highest on his list of priorities, he said, because he thinks that better-educated citizens will help the economy grow. Women\u2019s reproductive rights and equal pay, he said, are \u201cjust basic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like that shouldn\u2019t even be an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration is extremely important because it ties into the economy. We need this global influx.\u201d\n\nHe has listened closely at campaign events for discussion of how to address Northern Virginia\u2019s steep cost of living \u2014 a theme that threads through many conversations in the 8th District, and is particularly relevant to a renter like Aguirre.\n\nHe shares an apartment with his girlfriend in the Delray area of Alexandria, near a bus line that he used to get to his job before he could afford a car. When his girlfriend was briefly out of work, they struggled to cover the rent.\n\nAnd as a volunteer for Tenants and Workers United, a grass-roots social action organization based in Alexandria\u2019s Arlandria section, he has met much-lower-earning residents, who are worried about being displaced by the gentrification that accompanies redevelopment.\n\nThe candidates met for a final debate Friday night in Arlington. One last time, Aguirre asked his friends if they wanted to attend.\n\n\u201cI try not to push them too hard. I try to sneak it into the conversation,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cI\u2019m not even trying to convince them of one person or another. I\u2019m just trying to convince them to go listen.\u201d\n\nBut no one was willing. So, again, he went alone. He had narrowed his choices to Beyer, Levine and Chatman, but concluded after a lively, 90-minute session that Levine did not seem collaborative enough. So now he\u2019s down to two.\n\nBeyer is \u201cthe most polished,\u201d Aguirre said. Chatman, who is African American, caught Aguirre\u2019s attention \u201cbecause she\u2019s so different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a lot of community and life experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you consider the makeup of Congress in general, there is a lack of different faces.\u201d\n\nHe sat near the back of the auditorium, in a crowd of more than 300, taking notes on his phone.\n\n\u201cJust things I want to think about, to remind myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very torn.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "va08, virginia congressional race, virginia's 8th, jim moran, don beyer, arlington democrats, northern virginia democrats, canek aguirre", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "An undecided voter tries to find his candidate in a field of seven, where differences are few.", "title": "Northern Virginia voters face quandary in Democratic primary to replace Moran", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/northern-virginia-voters-face-field-of-similar-candidates-in-8th-congressional-district/2014/06/01/b49b69d6-e5b8-11e3-afc6-a1dd9407abcf_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/01/Others/Images/2014-06-01/VAVoter031401643270.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@psullivan1"}, "description": "An undecided voter tries to find his candidate in a field of seven, where differences are few.", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va08, virginia congressional race, virginia's 8th, jim moran, don beyer, arlington democrats, northern virginia democrats, canek aguirre", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "b49b69d6-e5b8-11e3-afc6-a1dd9407abcf"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fce\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019ll wait until November.\u2019 The problem with that is, it\u2019s decided now.\u201dThe typical Democratic primary voter in Northern Virginia is a retirement-aged white woman, campaign operatives say.\nPatrick Hope ; state Sen.
