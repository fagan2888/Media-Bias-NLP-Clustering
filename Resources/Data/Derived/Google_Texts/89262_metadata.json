But the GOP can\u2019t bask in these victories, it\u2019s time to get to work. Here\u2019s what the new majority should do, and not do.\n\nTop priority is repealing ObamaCare. Yes President Obama will veto it and thus elicit even more public opposition than was displayed in the election that actually gave the GOP a \u201crepeal majority.\u201d They can pass repeal bills through the same procedure Democrats used to make ObamaCare a reality: reconciliation, in which they only need a simple majority of 51 votes.\n\nOnce Obama vetoes the repeal bill the Republicans can go about repealing pieces of it, an incremental approach that will likely garner a fair number of Democratic votes including repeal of the employer mandate, the 30-hour work week, the Medicare payment board and the medical device tax.\n\nEven if Obama vetoes every single ObamaCare repeal measure, that will only upset the public more as they deal with higher costs for less care.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nAnother top priority for the new Congress should be border security: the public was infuriated this past summer as illegal immigrants poured across our southern border.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nPresident Obama maintains he will carry out his threat to grant amnesty to millions of more illegals before the end of the year and the GOP must use every avenue available to stop it \u2013 and do so as publicly as possible so the American people know the Republicans \u2013 not Obama \u2013 are on their side.\n\nWith the new majority there should now be no more impediments to the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline which will create upwards of 20,000 new jobs in America\u2019s heartland and bring us closer to energy independence. If Obama still wants to stand in the way of more jobs and less expensive energy, his party will suffer even more public indignation.\n\nRepublicans have said they\u2019d also like to return to regular order and do a real budget \u2013 after years of funding America\u2019s priorities through haphazard \u201ccontinuing resolutions\u201d that last for one month here, four months there.\n\nThis would also allow the party to follow through on its campaign promises to make true spending cuts that draw down the national debt. At almost $18 trillion, every American citizen \u2013 whether they work or pay taxes or not \u2013 owes over $56,000 in national debt.\n\nAlong those lines, another priority for the new Congress should be addressing the housing market, given that\u2019s where all the trouble started six years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s critical Congress help restore trust in the housing market and take steps to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a responsible manner that strengthens the housing sector, spurs sustainable investment and protects property rights.\n\nA top social issue priority for the new majority should be passage of the 20-week abortion ban, versions of which have passed in several states and upon which GOP candidates campaigned during the election. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said back during the summer he would push for this if the Republicans won a majority and conservatives anticipate he will follow through.\n\nA couple of cautionary notes for Republicans as well. There has been a great deal of speculation that Republicans may want to move quickly on a patent reform bill in order to show common ground with the White House. Republicans should tread very carefully in rushing into any legislation that overhauls our entire patent system \u2013 which is a critical part of our constitutional protection of property rights.\n\nAfter failed big government overhauls like ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank, the last thing we need is another \"Washington fix\"of a key component of our economy.\n\nRepublicans need to stand firm in defending our property rights and say no to another Washington takeover, this time of the innovation industry. This would severely weaken patents and be a step backward for American exceptionalism that would model poor patent protection like that of China or India.\n\nOne other course that would be a mistake for the new Senate would be to bring back the filibuster, which would amount to the GOP unilaterally disarming in the battle over the courts. After Harry Reid\u2019s invocation of the nuclear option and using simple majority votes to pack federal courts with Obama\u2019s nominees, it makes no sense whatsoever for Republicans to limit a future GOP president by bringing back the filibuster only to see Democrats go nuclear again the next time they gain control of the chamber.\n\nA sober, realistic GOP Senate conference cannot trust the Democrats again on this issue, given the precedent. Therefore, Republican Senators should protect future GOP presidents in their efforts to fill the nation\u2019s courts with judges who fairly apply the law instead of imposing someone\u2019s political agenda from the bench.\n\nThe new majority should embrace these opportunities, they were elected because President Obama and the Democrats either wouldn\u2019t lead or had the wrong answers.\n\nJ.
