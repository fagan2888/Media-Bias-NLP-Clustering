That\u2019s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, many of the news stories spawned by the hour-long interview he recorded with comedian Marc Maron for his popular podcast WTF, focused on the fact that Obama had chosen to pronounce the racial epithet rather than use a sanitized variant. But those stories tended to miss one of the more depressing points raised in the interview.\n\nRelated: Charleston Shooting Makes Confederate Flag a GOP Issue\n\nEven in the wake of the murder of nine innocents in an historically black church in Charleston, SC last week, President Obama has given up on the possibility of any sort of gun control legislation getting through Congress. The National Rifle Association\u2019s control over Congress when it comes to gun control issues, he said, is just too strong.\n\nSpeaking of the reaction to the Charleston shootings, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to feel bad. There are actions that could be taken to make events like this less likely. One of those actions we could take would be to enhance some basic, common sense gun safety laws that, by the way, the majority of gun owners support. This is unique to our country. There is no other advanced nation on earth that tolerates multiple shootings on a regular basis and considers it normal. And to some degree that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in this country. It\u2019s become something we expect.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, he\u2019s not hopeful that any significant action will be taken while he is in office.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the grip of the NRA on Congress is extremely strong,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee any legislative action being taken in this Congress, and I don\u2019t foresee any real action being taken until the American public feels a sufficient sense of urgency and they say to themselves, \u2018This is not normal. This is something that we can change and we\u2019re going to change it.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Republicans Avoid Talk of Race, Guns After Charleston Shootings\n\nObama showed his frustration with Congress, but said that in many policy areas, he has been able to effect change through rulemakings and other executive actions -- even when Republicans in Congress have refused to work with him. Gun control, he said, has been the exception.\n\nReferring to the horrific murder of 26 people, including 20 small children in a Connecticut school in 2012, he said, \u201cI will tell you, right after Sandy Hook \u2013 Newtown \u2013 when 20 6-year-olds are gunned down and Congress literally does nothing? Yeah. That\u2019s the closest I came to feeling disgusted. I was pretty disgusted.\u201d\n\nWhile the president did not attack gun manufacturers directly, he did point out the irony that they tend to do very well financially in the wake of mass shootings.\n\nRelated: Bush Says U.S. Should Protect Christians Overseas\n\n\u201cRight after Newtown, gun sales shot up, ammunition shot up, and each time these events occur; ironically, gun manufacturers make out like bandits, partly because of this fear that\u2019s churned up that the federal government and the black helicopters are coming to get your guns.\u201d\n\nWhile he acknowledged that gun ownership, as well and hunting and shooting sports is an ingrained part of American culture that \u201cis really important to a lot of people,\u201d he also said that the reality of gun violence in the U.S. is something the country has failed to confront.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that we have ever fully come to terms with,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s decision to pronounce a racial epithet out loud during an interview for a podcast got a lot of attention, partly obscuring the more interesting fact that, even in the wake of a mass murder in a South Carolina Church last week, the president has given up on gun control legislation.", "title": "Obama Has Given Up on Gun Control", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/22/Obama-Has-Given-Gun-Control", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06222015_Obama_Skeet_Shooting.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/22/Obama-Has-Given-Gun-Control", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06222015_Obama_Skeet_Shooting.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s decision to pronounce a racial epithet out loud during an interview for a podcast got a lot of attention, partly obscuring the more interesting fact that, even in the wake of a mass murder in a South Carolina Church last week, the president has given up on gun control legislation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s control over Congress when it comes to gun control issues, he said, is just too strong.\nGun control, he said, has been the exception.\nPresident Obama made headlines on Monday when he matter-of-factly said that racism hasn\u2019t been eliminated in the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019re not cured of it,\u201d he said.\nRelated: Charleston Shooting Makes Confederate Flag a GOP IssueEven in the wake of the murder of nine innocents in an historically black church in Charleston, SC last week, President Obama has given up on the possibility of any sort of gun control legislation getting through Congress.\nOne of those actions we could take would be to enhance some basic, common sense gun safety laws that, by the way, the majority of gun owners support."}
