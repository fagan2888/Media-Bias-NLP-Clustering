And that\u2019s really saying something.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly,\u201d said Ms. Obama, \u201cif we lose these midterm elections, it\u2019s going to be a whole lot harder to finish what we started.\u201d\n\nThe first lady implored supporters to turn out in November to elect Democrats Michelle Nunn to the U.S. Senate and Jason Carter as governor.\n\nMs. Nunn trails Republican David Perdue by 2.6 points, and Mr. Carter lags behind Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, by 2.8 points in the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls in the state.\n\n\u201cIf just 50 Democratic voters per precinct who didn\u2019t vote in 2010 get out and vote this November \u2014 just 50 per precinct \u2014 then Michelle Nunn and Jason Carter will win,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThink about it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s pitch could do more damage than good in Georgia, where President Obama remains very unpopular.\n\nMr. Perdue has made tying Ms. Nunn to the unpopular president a cornerstone of his campaign. He used Mrs. Obama\u2019s visit to drive that point home.\n\n\u201cWhile Michelle Nunn is trying to distance herself from President Obama and Washington Democrats publicly, she clearly has no problem raising money from them directly on the taxpayers\u2019 dime in order to deceive Georgians about her true allegiance to President Obama and [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid,\u201d a Perdue campaign spokeswoman told The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First lady Michelle Obama is warning Democratic voters that Washington will \"be even worse\" if they let Republicans win in November.", "Author": "S.A.
