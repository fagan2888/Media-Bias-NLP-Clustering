We once spent 30 minutes arguing about a comma.\u201d\n\nHutchison extensively covered the birth of the Colorado Rockies as well as immigration issues.\n\nWhether it was chasing down a reluctant source, poring over files, or shepherding copy, Hutchinson was passionate in his work.\n\n\u201cHutch\u2019s frequent bursts of fury, his yelling, his stomping about, all underscored his deep passion for the written word, for the story, for the truth,\u201d Stanton said.\n\nBorn in Denver, Hutchinson graduated from Denver East High School. In his youth, Hutchinson was a paper boy, throwing the Rocky Mountain News.\n\nIn November of 1960, on Election Day, John F. Kennedy campaign brochures found their way into every paper on his route, said Julie Hutchinson, Paul\u2019s sister.\n\n\u201cWhen the circulation director for the Rocky visited him that afternoon, Paul promised never to do it again,\u201d she said.\n\nHutchinson was studying journalism at Metropolitan State College of Denver when the department chairman, Greg Pearson, encouraged him to apply at the Rocky Mountain News. The News hired him as a police reporter, Julie Hutchinson said.\n\nHutchinson\u2019s journalism career took him to New Orleans with the United Press International, the Kansas City Star and the Boulder Daily Camera, before returning to Denver where he went to work at the Post in 1985.\n\nAfter leaving the Post, Hutchinson spent time fishing, shooting pool and bike riding.\n\nEight years ago, he underwent open heart surgery and about a year later suffered a massive stroke.\n\nDoctors told him he would be extremely limited in recovery, \u201che would never drive a car again.\u201d But they had \u201cnever dealt with Paul Hutchinson before,\u201d Julie said.\n\nHe indeed drove, including a pickup truck with a camper shell. Hutch kept a pool cue and a fishing pole in the truck bed, in case either mood struck. And they did.\n\n\u201cHe came back about 95 percent\u201d from the stroke, Julie said. \u201cHe was still enraged \u2014 on a daily basis \u2014 by politics and still followed the Denver Broncos with great passion.\u201d\n\nThis December, Hutchinson and his wife, Becky, were to celebrate 40 years together.\n\nA celebration of Hutchinson\u2019s life will be held at 4 p.m. Friday at the Mount Vernon Event Center, 17173 Mount Vernon Road, Golden.\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former Post, Rocky, staff writer Paul Hutchinson dies at 66", "title": "Former Post, Rocky, staff writer Paul Hutchinson dies at 66", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/21/former-post-rocky-staff-writer-paul-hutchinson-dies-at-66/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821__paul-hutchinson-at-workp1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821__paul-hutchinson-at-workp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T12:30:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:21:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "During his dozen years \u2014 1985 to 1997 \u2014 at the Post, Hutchinson covered a variety of beats and assignments, including hard news investigations.\nBorn in Denver, Hutchinson graduated from Denver East High School.\nAfter leaving the Post, Hutchinson spent time fishing, shooting pool and bike riding.\nA native son who went on to be an award-winning journalist at both The Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News died Aug. 15 at home in his sleep.\nIn November of 1960, on Election Day, John F.
