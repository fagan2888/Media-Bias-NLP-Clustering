With employee benefit costs exceeding 46 percent of wages and workplace litigation spiking, \u201cemployees\u201d don\u2019t exist in the future of work.\n\nA start-up companies like ride-sharing Uber has 160,000 contractors, but only 2,000\u2013about 1 percent\u2013are employees. The rest do what was traditionally known as \u201ccontract work.\u201d The 1099 society has also arrived at more traditional companies, such as Microsoft, that has nearly two-thirds as many contractors as full-time employees. Even small business sole proprietorships have increased their use of contract workers nearly two-fold since 2003, according to TechCrunch.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019s latest employer compensation costs estimates that the wages and salary of a full-time worker averaged $22.88 per hour in March. But the cost of benefits adds an additional $10.61, or 46 percent, more for a total of $31.65 an hour.\n\nBy turning employees into \u201cgig\u201d workers, corporations save 30 percent by eliminating the 7.65 percent employer portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes, state unemployment compensation insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, Obamacare burdens, company\u2019s 401K and any profit sharing contribution.\n\n\u201cGoing gig\u201d also slashes lawsuit exposure to the breadth of employees\u2019 legal \u201crights\u201d that ballooned under the Obama Administration. Gig workers lack the myriad of new \u201cemployee protections\u201d against discrimination and wrongful termination, along with enhanced rights to unionize, be paid overtime, and take numerous family leaves.\n\nStaffing agency employment has been among the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy for the last several years. Since the recession\u2019s official end in June 2009, the industry has added 1.24 million new jobs, or about 12.3 percent of all new private sector jobs. Staffing of temporary and contract workers rose 5.4 percent in 2014, but accelerated by 4.2 percent from the third to fourth quarter\u2013a 16.8 percent annualized rate. G. Palmer and Associates predicts that temp employment will grow 10.5 percent in 2015.\n\nAs the financial and legal costs of the \u201cemployee\u201d have spiked, 24 hour \u201cdigital connectedness\u201d has been evolving from the social realm to the workforce as the preferred means to \u201cinteract and transact digitally.\u201d Most Americans and soon most people on earth will have their \u201cdigital profiles\u201d stored in digital devices and digital clouds. Those profiles are increasingly \u201cowned\u201d by corporations like a LinkedIn, a Gild, or Entelo.\n\nCVs and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are rapidly becoming things of the past for long term work engagements (as in \u201cpermanent jobs\u201d) or short-term ones (ranging from projects to micro-tasks). The digitally-capable and digitally-enmeshed population of workers in the gig economy of the future will increasingly be hired and fired through some digital \u201cintermediated\u201d processes, referred to by Andrew Sharpie, analyst/consultant at The Research Platform, as the \u201cNew-Net-Work-Force.\u201d\n\nThis brave new world has been romantically evangelized by success stories from entrepreneurial contractors that get referrals, early customers, and a stream of repeat business from 1099 gigs through apps like Handy, Eaze, Luxe, and Upwork.\n\nThere has not been a good count of \u201cindependent workers,\u201d since the U.S. Census estimated there were 42 million in 2006. The Census found that about one-third of the workforce was self-employed or paid as contract workers. But the \u201cThird Annual Independent Workforce Report,\u201d compiled last year by management-services firm MBO Partners, suggests that by 2020 about 50 percent of the U.S. workforce will work independently as freelancers, contractors or small business owners.\n\nThe future is not just about the growth of contract jobs in the U.S., but as Breitbart News reported in February there is an huge \u201ctransition effort\u201d to dump American tech employees with cheap H-1B visa contract workers from abroad.\n\nDespite the uproar, the Department of Homeland Security refused Senate requests for an investigation of the activity as \u201cpremature.\u201d But similar employee dumping actions by Disney and Fossil Group have since forced the Department of Labor to investigate India contractors Infosys and Tata.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With employee benefit costs exceeding 46 percent of wages and workplace litigation spiking, \u201cemployees\u201d don\u2019t exist in the future of work.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "With employee benefit costs exceeding 46 percent of wages and workplace litigation spiking, \u201cemployees\u201d don\u2019t exist in the future of work.", "title": "\u201cGig Economy\u201d Future = Employees Don\u2019t Exist", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2499, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Tech-workers-Oli-Scarff-Getty.jpg", "height": 1874}, "updated_time": "2015-06-15T07:44:12-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/15/in-gig-economy-future-employees-dont-exist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With employee benefit costs exceeding 46 percent of wages and workplace litigation spiking, \u201cemployees\u201d don\u2019t exist in the future of work.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Tech-workers-Oli-Scarff-Getty.jpg", "title": "\u201cGig Economy\u201d Future = Employees Don\u2019t Exist", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "employment, gig, gig economy, going gig, immigration, Social Media, tech,Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-15T06:09:30-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T07:44:12-07:00", "tag": "tech", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1e1\"", "article_summary": "With employee benefit costs exceeding 46 percent of wages and workplace litigation spiking, \u201cemployees\u201d don\u2019t exist in the future of work.\nEven small business sole proprietorships have increased their use of contract workers nearly two-fold since 2003, according to TechCrunch.\nGig workers lack the myriad of new \u201cemployee protections\u201d against discrimination and wrongful termination, along with enhanced rights to unionize, be paid overtime, and take numerous family leaves.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe \u201cgig economy\u201d is the term for corporations embracing the \u201con demand economy,\u201d \u201ccollaborative consumption\u201d and \u201csharing economy\u201d bandwagons to restructure \u201cwork\u201d into small projects of limited duration so that big business can justify legally dumping employees and hiring contractors.\nStaffing of temporary and contract workers rose 5.4 percent in 2014, but accelerated by 4.2 percent from the third to fourth quarter\u2013a 16.8 percent annualized rate."}
