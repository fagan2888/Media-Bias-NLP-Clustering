Jerry Springer and a couple of his bodyguards from the show road along with krewe members Saturday night.\n\nThis isn't the first ride for Springer. He served as the celebrity Grand Marshal of Endymion in 1998.\n\nSpringer told us that it was New Orleans that set the idea for the Jerry Springer Show. \"Mardi Gras is where we got the idea for the show. The craziness and the needs,\" Springer said.\n\nThe former Tulane graduate is no stranger Mardi Gras or New Orleans.\n\nThe Jerry Springer Show is celebrating 25 years on the air. The first episode aired on September 30 1991.\n\nAlways fun being in New Orleans for Mardi Gras!
