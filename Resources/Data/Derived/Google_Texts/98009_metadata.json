Several area residents quoted in the story welcomed the extension, saying it would make it easier for them to get to other areas of Phoenix as well as discover what downtown Mesa and the East Valley have to offer.\n\nDowntown Mesa is not the final terminus for this extension: The line will be extended two miles further east by 2018.\n\nVictoria Line Upgrade Reaches Halfway Point\n\nThe London Underground has reached the halfway point in its project to bring one of its busiest routes into the 21st century, according to an article in the International Railway Journal.\n\nThe London Underground crossovers at Walthamstow Central must be rebuilt. (Photo by Duncan)\n\nThe project to install communications-based train control (CBTC) and automatic train operation (ATO) on the Victoria Line will allow that route to handle 36 trains per hour in each direction. But to achieve this throughput, the 50-year-old crossovers at Walthamstow Central, the line\u2019s northern terminus, must be rebuilt, for their design permits only 24 trains an hour to operate through them.\n\nTo perform this work expeditiously, LU has closed the Victoria Line\u2019s northernmost section, from Seven Sisters to Walthamstow Central, for 23 days through August 30th.\n\n\u201cThe Victoria Line now carries a record 200 million passengers each year and demand is rising,\u201d David Waboso, London Underground\u2019s capital programs director, told the IRJ. \u201cThis is one of the biggest single closures we\u2019ve undertaken on the Tube network in over a decade. The outcome will enable us to deliver a 40 percent capacity boost for customers northeast of Seven Sisters. We\u2019ve carefully timed our program schedule down to the last hour, and our engineers are working around the clock to keep the closure period as short as possible.\u201d\n\nMalaysian Resort Goes to Work Implementing Transit Master Plan\n\nThe government of the state of Penang, which includes the resort city in northern Malaysia, has selected the firm that will turn its Transport Master Plan (TMP) into reality.\n\nAccording to an International Railway Journal news report, the SRS Consortium will be the delivery partner for the government\u2019s 27-billion-ringgit ($6.48 billion U.S.) transport master plan, which will create a network of light rail, tram, bus and ferry routes along with new highways. The goal of the plan is to relieve traffic congestion in the region, especially on Penang Island.\n\nThe rail component of the plan includes five light-rail and two tram lines on Penang Island and two regional rail lines on the mainland. The consortium will be responsible for engineering studies and designs, gathering public feedback, and gaining the necessary state and federal approvals for each component of the plan.\n\nCurrently, only 3 percent of commuters in Penang use public buses for the morning commute, and another 8 percent use factory or school buses. The TMP seeks to increase public transport\u2019s share of commuter traffic to 40 percent by 2030.\n\nKnow of a project that should be featured in this column?
