The WHO says these deaths were mostly caused by air pollution.\n\nThese are preventable deaths, the WHO reminds us.\n\n\u201cA healthy environment underpins a healthy population,\u201d WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in a statement. \u201cIf countries do not take actions to make environments where people live and work healthy, millions will continue to become ill and die too young.\u201d\n\nLow- and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific Region, where rapid economic growth has been blamed for soaring levels of air, water and soil contamination, were the worst affected by environmental-related deaths. Those regions had an estimated death toll of 7.3 million, mostly as a result of indoor and outdoor air pollution.\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nThe very young and the very old were the most vulnerable members of the global population: 1.7 million children under the age of 5 and 4.9 million adults aged between 50 and 75 years old lost their lives because of environmental factors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "However bad you thought it was, a new World Health Organization report reveals the reality is infinitely worse", "title": "The breathtaking human toll of environmental pollution", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "However bad you thought it was, a new World Health Organization report reveals the reality is infinitely worse", "title": "The breathtaking human toll of environmental pollution", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/20/environmental_pollution_kills_more_than_12_million_people_every_year_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/shutterstock_336888689.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "However bad you thought it was, a new World Health Organization report reveals the reality is infinitely worse", "title": "The breathtaking human toll of environmental pollution", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/shutterstock_336888689.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Allison Jackson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GlobalPost, Pollution, World Health Organization", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: GlobalPost, Pollution, World Health OrganizationThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostWe all know that pollution is bad for our health.\nThose regions had an estimated death toll of 7.3 million, mostly as a result of indoor and outdoor air pollution.\n\u201cA healthy environment underpins a healthy population,\u201d WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in a statement.\nJust how bad was laid out by the World Health Organization this week in a bleak new report on environmentally related deaths.\nThe WHO says these deaths were mostly caused by air pollution."}
