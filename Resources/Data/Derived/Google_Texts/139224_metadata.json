Burwell challenging whether enrollees through the federal signup site, healthcare.gov, are entitled to premium-reducing subsidies \u2014 one key justice has casually dropped what could be a huge clue to his thinking.\n\nAnd this potential clue suggests to some court watchers that Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 who often casts the high court\u2019s swing vote \u2014 may be siding with plaintiffs who want to gut a key part of Obamacare and likely bring the law crashing down.\n\nThe Daily Caller reports that Justice Kennedy said something intriguing, and quite possibly revealing, in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s comments in a run-of-the-mill budget meeting Monday may have signaled how he intends to vote in this year\u2019s biggest Obamacare lawsuit over the legality of federal premium subsidies. Kennedy\u2026made comments that could suggest he\u2019s leaning in favor of the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell. The question in the pivotal case is whether the text of Obamacare restricts the law\u2019s popular premium subsidies to state-run exchanges\u2026.\n\nKennedy\u2019s remarks to the committee related to the Obama administration\u2019s argument that all ObamaCare subsidies must be maintained because to declare the federal marketplace customers ineligible would be disastrous for the law\u2019s future.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe Daily Caller article notes that the administration \u201cseems to be trying to convince the Court that ruling otherwise would be catastrophic for the health-care law, and therefore for the Court\u2019s image.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Obama, his legal team, and his liberal allies want the high court to go beyond considering what the law actually says and to give weight to what impact striking down the controversial provision would have on the millions of people who would be affected.\n\nResponding to a question during Monday\u2019s hearing, Justice Kennedy seemed to say that\u2019s a faulty and largely irrelevant argument, that the Supreme Court should not be concerned with the impact of a decision or with the ability of Congress to \u201cfix\u201d a flawed law.\n\n\u201cWe have to assume that we have three fully functioning branches of the government that are committed to proceed in good faith and with good will toward one another to resolve the problems of this republic,\u201d Kennedy argued.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn fact, the head of the agency responsible for implementing Obama\u2019s healthcare takeover scheme, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, has said there is no backup plan for fixing the law should the Supreme Court rule against it in the subsidies case.\n\nThe justices are expected to issue their ruling in the latest challenge to ObamaCare in June. That\u2019s when we will learn if what Anthony Kennedy said to lawmakers in the hearing on the Supreme Court\u2019s budget was, in fact, a clue to how he will vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A swing vote that could deliver a death blow to ObamaCare...", "author": "Norvell Rose", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "A swing vote that could deliver a death blow to ObamaCare...", "title": "What A Supreme Court Justice Just Let Slip May Mean Obamacare Is On Death Row", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WCJ-images-SCOTUS-Obamacare.jpg", "height": 422}, "updated_time": "2015-03-27T16:27:56-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/obamacares-fate-heres-what-a-key-supreme-court-justice-just-said-that-could-be-a-huge-clue/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A swing vote that could deliver a death blow to ObamaCare...", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WCJ-images-SCOTUS-Obamacare.jpg", "title": "What A Supreme Court Justice Just Let Slip May Mean Obamacare Is On Death Row", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-24T11:26:56-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Best Of The Week", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2015-03-24T11:26:56-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-27T16:27:56-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "justice anthony kennedy, , barack obama, health, obamacare, supreme court, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "The Daily Caller reports that Justice Kennedy said something intriguing, and quite possibly revealing, in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee.\nThe question in the pivotal case is whether the text of Obamacare restricts the law\u2019s popular premium subsidies to state-run exchanges\u2026.\nThat\u2019s when we will learn if what Anthony Kennedy said to lawmakers in the hearing on the Supreme Court\u2019s budget was, in fact, a clue to how he will vote.\nAnd this potential clue suggests to some court watchers that Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 who often casts the high court\u2019s swing vote \u2014 may be siding with plaintiffs who want to gut a key part of Obamacare and likely bring the law crashing down.\nThe justices are expected to issue their ruling in the latest challenge to ObamaCare in June."}
