Then an online effort began to save the animal diagnosed with cataracts.\n\nOn Feb. 11, Matt Brockman, the show\u2019s publicity manager, hauled Oatmeal to the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in College Station for examination.\n\n\u201cHe loaded like a champ and hauled like a champ,\u201d Brockman said Friday. \u201cIt was clear that he had functional eyesight, and in my opinion this steer could have entered the food system. \u2026 I\u2019ve worked with totally blind steers, and this steer wasn\u2019t that.\u201d\n\nOatmeal was moved to his new home after being examined at Texas A&M.\n\n\u201cIt was established by our board-certified ophthalmologist that the steer is not completely blind and does have partial vision, although cataracts are present in both eyes,\u201d Dr. Eleanor Green, dean of the veterinary college, said in an email to the Star-Telegram on Friday.\n\nBrockman said young exhibitors at the Fort Worth Stock Show are learning about the industry and providing a safe food supply.\n\n\u201cA young livestock show exhibitor knows the animal they raise to show will someday enter the food system. \u2026 The youth participants are fully aware that at some point their \u2018project\u2019 will be processed and enter the food system,\u201d Brockman said in a previous email to the newspaper. \u201cThey\u2019re helping feed the world.\u201d\n\nRenee King-Sonnen, founder of the Rowdy Girl Sanctuary in Angleton, which sought to save Oatmeal, said volunteers collected about $12,000 for the animal\u2019s care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy if he\u2019s really safe, I just don\u2019t understand all the secrecy,\u201d King-Sonnen said. \u201cI just hope he never, ever, ever sees a slaughterhouse.\u201d\n\nThe money raised for the steer will now go toward scholarships for young people who indicate they have a change of heart about showing and selling livestock for slaughter, she said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAzL2JsaW5kLXN0ZWVyLXNhdmVkLWZyb20tc2xhdWdodGVyLWFmdGVyLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtc3RvY2stc2hvdy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Jamie Knodel", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "From The Associated Press FORT WORTH \u2014 A partially blind steer that was among the winners of the Fort Worth Stock Show has avoided slaughter after critics decried plans to\u2026", "title": "Blind steer saved from slaughter after Fort Worth Stock Show", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2016/03/blind-steer-saved-from-slaughter-after-fort-worth-stock-show.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2016/03/LIFE_PETS-BLIND-STEER_2_FT_48828843.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-03-27T16:52:39Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "From The Associated PressFORT WORTH \u2014 A partially blind steer that was among the winners of the Fort Worth Stock Show has avoided slaughter after critics decried plans to butcher the animal.\nKendyll Williams, 13, of Huntsville raised and showed the steer at this year\u2019s Fort Worth Stock Show, and a buyer paid $8,000.\nBrockman said young exhibitors at the Fort Worth Stock Show are learning about the industry and providing a safe food supply.\nOatmeal was recently moved to an undisclosed ranch, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported Saturday.\n\u201cIt was clear that he had functional eyesight, and in my opinion this steer could have entered the food system."}
