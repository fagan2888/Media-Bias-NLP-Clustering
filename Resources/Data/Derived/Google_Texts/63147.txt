Michelle Coulter's Obamacare experience began with computer glitches and even paperwork problems. But she has no complaints anymore.

In late 2013, when the Obamacare exchange first opened, she went online and, like millions of people, was thwarted by glitches. She then requested a paper application, which took three weeks to arrive at her home in Henryville, Monroe County. But her completed application never went through. She never heard what happened to it.

Coulter, 45, runs a communications business from home and takes care of her two children. Her 58-year-old husband is a freelance photographer who recently became licensed to sell real estate as well. Having failed to connect with Obamacare coverage the first year, they stuck with a plan that cost them about $1,000 a month for family coverage â€” more than twice the amount of their mortgage.

For 2015, they found a plan from Geisinger that cost $179.27 per month for Coulter and her husband, with a $350 per person deductible and an out-of-pocket maximum of $4,500. The $179.27 monthly premium represents what they pay after an income-based tax credit. Their children are covered by Pennsylvania's CHIP program, which provides affordable coverage for children.

In late 2015, Geisinger informed the Coulters their plan was being canceled. Coulter had seen news reports of skyrocketing premiums for 2016 and feared the worst.

Yet she found another plan, also from Geisinger, with a slightly higher deductible, but with monthly premiums of only $155.97 after the tax credit.

Coulter had left a job and started her home-based business so she could be at home with their children. She regards Obamacare as tailored made for the self-employed. "It is very difficult for us to do what we're doing and this coverage helps so much," she says.
