JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Jacksonville Electric Authority crews are working to repair a water main that broke early Wednesday morning in the Mandarin area.

A portion of Hartley Road has reopened after being completely closed near San Jose Boulevard due to the break.

Police with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office are asking drivers to detour behind the Steak & Shake and Bob Evans parking lots.

It was the second water main break on Hartley Road in just the past three weeks.

JEA said there are old pipes in the area, and when they break, they are being replaced with thicker newer pipe.



Officials warned that there may be more water breaks in the area until all the old pipe is replaced.

No homes were affected by Wednesday's break, but some businesses in the area were, officials said.?
