The Community Health Assistance Program, a program that helps Texans get access to insurance, will run out of federal grant money in a few weeks.\n\nAt year's end, Texas will shut down its high-risk insurance pool for some of the state\u2019s sickest residents, pushing participants to find private coverage in the federal health insurance marketplace created under the federal Affordable Care Act. And patient advocates say those participants should focus on making the transition sooner rather than later to ensure that they don't experience a lapse in coverage or lose access to current health care providers and services. \"Pool policyholders who are in the middle of treatment will especially need to be sure the network offered by their replacement health plan includes their treatment team,\" Steven Browning, executive director of the Texas Health Insurance Pool, said in an email.\n\nThe high-risk pool is financed mainly by patient premiums and assessments paid by health insurance companies and HMOs, along with some funding from federal grant programs. Since 1998, it has provided high-priced coverage to Texans with pre-existing conditions who can\u2019t find coverage elsewhere. The state has deemed the high-risk pool obsolete, as the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies participating in the federal marketplace, which launched on Oct. 1, from denying coverage to Texans with pre-existing conditions. Gov. Rick Perry signed Senate Bill 1367 in June, scheduling the pool\u2019s abolishment.\n\nThe pool will close Jan. 1, and the 23,000 people currently participating in the pool must sign up for coverage on the insurance exchange by Dec. 15 or find coverage elsewhere to avoid a lapse in care.\n\nBrowning said the pool is making ample efforts to inform its policyholders of the closure and Dec. 15 deadline, including posting information on its website, sending letters and emails and making phone calls. There should be adequate time for those in the pool to get enrolled in a plan by Dec. 15, he said, and the pool is encouraging its patients to use a health insurance agent to sign up for coverage.\n\n\u201cIn our various communications to policyholders, and on our website, we are stressing the importance of carefully evaluating the provider networks of the health plans in which they are interested, to be sure they retain adequate access to their physicians and hospitals,\u201d Browning said.\n\nWith many of the health plan options in the federal marketplace being cheaper than the high-risk pool and covering additional benefits, Stacey Pogue, a senior policy analyst for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, said the situation presents an opportunity for Texans in the pool.\n\n\u201cI think that people are going to have many more options and many better options in the marketplace than they do in the health pool today,\u201d Pogue said.\n\nAs a condition of the pool, Texans generally pay twice the market rate for coverage, said Pogue. The marketplace also offers tax credits to help purchase a health plan to everyone who makes 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty line \u2014 $11,490 to $45,960 annual income for an individual or $22,550 to $94,200 for a family of four.\n\nPogue said health plans offered in the federal marketplace could also raise the level of care patients receive, as they must cover \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d some of which, such as maternity care, aren\u2019t covered in the pool.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t expect there to be major issues with people meeting the Dec. 15 deadline either, she said, because many high-risk pool policyholders have health conditions that require them to deal with their health insurance on a consistent basis and are more likely to interact with their health care provider.\n\nLance Lunsford, vice president of communications for the Texas Hospital Association, said that if those in the pool experienced a lapse in coverage, hospitals would still be required by federal law to stabilize and secure them and would probably be able to aid them in securing additional coverage.\n\nLunsford said one of the big issues for people in the pool will probably be evaluating all the insurance options available.\n\n\u201cTheir options may be wider and that may be part of one of the issues that they have,\u201d Lunsford said. \u201cIt will be about selecting the right coverage.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
