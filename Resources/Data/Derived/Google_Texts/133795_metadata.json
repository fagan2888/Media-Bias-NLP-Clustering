Massachusetts\u2019 median household income of about $68,000 is nearly 30 percent above the national median of about $53,000, according to the US Census.\n\nState and federal data show that after slowing in recent years, health care spending is accelerating. In 2014, Massachusetts spent $54 billion on health care, or $8,010 per person, an increase of 4.8 percent from the previous year, according to state figures. That exceeded a state target of holding health spending increases below 3.6 percent a year and was much higher than the local rate of inflation, 1.6 percent.\n\nPartners has taken steps to control costs by embracing new insurance payments that encourage doctors to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and procedures. But Torchiana indicated that too much pressure to cut health care costs could mean less money for patient care and medical research.\n\nIn October, Governor Charlie Baker, a former health insurance executive, made comments similar to Torchiana\u2019s, saying Massachusetts health care costs are not unusually high when incomes are considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut employers, consumer advocates, and health care specialists who have watched medical costs climb higher over the years challenged those assertions.\n\n\u201cHealth care remains one of the top concerns among Massachusetts employers,\u201d said Christopher P. Geehern, spokesman for Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a business group. \u201cEvery health care institution has to look at: are you bringing the average up, or are you bringing the average down? It\u2019s no secret that Partners is on the higher end of that average.\u201d\n\nAmy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of the consumer advocacy group Health Care for All, said many consumers are struggling not just with rising premiums but also with other out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles in the thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe hear every day from consumers from Massachusetts who are struggling to pay for health care,\u201d Slemmer said, \u201cand it seems like those calls are increasing.\u201d\n\nStories in the Boston Globe and reports from the attorney general\u2019s office have shown that Partners charges more than its competitors for similar care. Attorney General Maura Healey has said this market \u201cdysfunction\u201d is pushing medical spending higher across the state.\n\nThe price gaps are also the target of a ballot campaign from the Service Employees International Union, which is seeking to regulate hospital payments so Partners collects less money and its smaller competitors collect more.\n\nTorchiana, a heart surgeon and longtime executive at Massachusetts General Hospital, became chief executive of Partners, Mass. General\u2019s parent company, about nine months ago. In doing so, he quipped, he became the head of an \u201c800-pound gorilla,\u201d referring to Partners\u2019 size and place in the health care market.\n\nBoston-based Partners includes 10 hospitals and 6,000 doctors and is the largest private employer in Massachusetts. Its hospitals are world famous, but locally Partners is also known for being the most expensive health system.\n\nTorchiana, in his speech, remarked on Partners\u2019 role as the largest biomedical research institution in the country, with an annual research budget of about $1.4 billion, and offered some personal anecdotes. He recalled moving to Boston as a young newlywed to attend Harvard Medical School many years ago, settling into a basement apartment in Jamaica Plain, and how the apartment filled with snow after the blizzard of 1978.\n\nTorchiana, known to friends and colleagues as \u201cTorch,\u201d said that after medical school and eight years of training at Mass. General, he felt \u201cjust barely ready\u201d to work as a heart surgeon. He felt the same way when he left his role as head of the Mass. General physicians group to become chief executive of Partners, he said.\n\nIn an interview after his speech, Torchiana said that his new job is challenging, and that he takes it more to heart than he expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been prickly about criticism,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cbut it feels personal now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1458610817", "eomportal-id": 195471, "description": "Dr. David Torchiana cited figures that found health insurance premiums represent 18 percent of median income for Massachusetts families, but 21 percent nationally", "eomportal-instanceid": 26, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Dr. David Torchiana cited figures that found health insurance premiums represent 18 percent of median income for Massachusetts families, but 21 percent nationally", "title": "Partners CEO says health care in state \u2018very affordable\u2019 - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/12/03/partners-ceo-says-health-care-state-very-affordable/LuYoMFF4pD5w2V840bzcxJ/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/08/21/BostonGlobe.com/Spotlight/Images/kreiter_torchiana3_biz-4681.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 05:36:32 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "partners,torchiana,Commonwealth Fund, Boston Globe, Service Employees International Union, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "a55e7446-99d4-11e5-ba53-b31e2b5dabde", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "partners,torchiana,Commonwealth Fund, Boston Globe, Service Employees International Union, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Twitter"}, "article_summary": "Despite concerns about rising health care costs, the head of the state\u2019s largest and most expensive network of doctors and hospitals said Thursday that health care is \u201cvery affordable\u201d in Massachusetts.\nState and federal data show that after slowing in recent years, health care spending is accelerating.\nBut Torchiana indicated that too much pressure to cut health care costs could mean less money for patient care and medical research.\n\u201cEvery health care institution has to look at: are you bringing the average up, or are you bringing the average down?\nIn October, Governor Charlie Baker, a former health insurance executive, made comments similar to Torchiana\u2019s, saying Massachusetts health care costs are not unusually high when incomes are considered."}
