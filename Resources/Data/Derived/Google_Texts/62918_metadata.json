Tammy Baldwin are just a few of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s more famous fans. In a new video, they join politicians, activists, and civil rights leaders in paying tribute to the Supreme Court justice in honor of a new biography, Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe book takes its name from the eponymous Tumblr blog launched two years ago by MSNBC reporter Irin Carmon and then\u2013NYU law student Shana Knizhnik, who used memes and GIFs to reimagine Ginsburg as such hip-hop icons as the Notorious B.I.G. and Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nWhile Notorious RBG has catapulted Ginsburg, 82, to caricature status and cemented her place in pop culture\u2014her image appears on everything from shirts and onesies to stickers and tattoos\u2014it doesn\u2019t overlook her contributions to the American justice system. The blog was inspired in part by Ginsburg\u2019s dissent in a Supreme Court ruling weakening parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Here, we explore that ruling and two other cases that earned Ginsburg her \u201cnotorious\u201d reputation for fervent opposition.\n\n1. Voting Rights Act\n\nIn June 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the portion of the Voting Rights Act that allowed nine mostly Southern states to bypass federal approval to modify their election laws\u2014allowing states to enact voting restrictions that have led to lower voter turnout among black and younger voters, according to a congressional study published last year. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. maintained that the original 1965 provision was outdated and out of step with \u201ccurrent conditions.\u201d Ginsburg dissented, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. to argue that his commitment to civil rights had been \u201cdisserved\u201d by the decision. \u201cJust as buildings in California have a greater need to be earthquake proofed, places where there is greater racial polarization in voting have a greater need for prophylactic measures to prevent purposeful race discrimination,\u201d she wrote.\n\n2. Texas Voter ID Laws\n\nAs a result of the Voting Rights Act ruling, Texas announced it would begin enforcing a law requiring voters to show approved forms of identification before casting a ballot. When the law was challenged, the Supreme Court ruled in October 2014 that it could be used in the November election, despite outcry from civil rights groups that the law was discriminatory and could disproportionately prohibit blacks and Latinos from voting. Ginsburg was one of three justices who dissented; the other two were Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg wrote: \u201cThe greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters.\u201d\n\n3. Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n\nIn June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that certain employers are exempt from a portion of the Affordable Care Act and can legally deny their employees insurance coverage for contraceptives if it infringes on their religious beliefs. While Justice Samuel Alito held that the decision in favor of the for-profit corporation Hobby Lobby would have a limited effect, Ginsburg dissented, insisting that the decision would have wide-sweeping consequences for women\u2019s reproductive health care. \u201cThe court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield,\u201d she wrote. \u201cReligious organizations exist to foster the same interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jennifer Swann", "description": "In honor of the new biography \u2018Notorious RBG,\u2019 we recount the Supreme Court justice\u2019s most memorable fights for equality.", "rights": "TakePart is the Social Action Network\u2122 of Participant Media. \u00a9 2008-2016 TakePart, LLC", "og": {"site_name": "TakePart", "description": "In honor of the new biography \u2018Notorious RBG,\u2019 we recount the Supreme Court justice\u2019s most memorable fights for equality.", "title": "3 Times Ruth Bader Ginsburg Earned Her Reputation for Dissent", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/10/28/rbg", "image": {"width": 775, "identifier": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/notoriousrbg.jpg", "height": 515}, "type": "article"}, "abstract": "In honor of the new biography \u2018Notorious RBG,\u2019 we recount the Supreme Court justice\u2019s most memorable fights for equality.", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-28 15:03:52", "MobileOptimized": 320, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "culture,social-justice,openpublish_article", "fb": {"admins": 1327833247, "pages": 9287842439, "app_id": 247137505296280}, "keywords": "Culture, Social Justice", "tab-keywords": "Culture, Social Justice", "twitter": {"description": "In honor of the new biography \u2018Notorious RBG,\u2019 we recount the Supreme Court justice\u2019s most memorable fights for equality.", "title": "3 Times Ruth Bader Ginsburg Earned Her Reputation for Dissent", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/10/28/rbg", "image": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/notoriousrbg.jpg", "creator": "@TakePart", "site": "@TakePart", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e27\"", "article_summary": "The blog was inspired in part by Ginsburg\u2019s dissent in a Supreme Court ruling weakening parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.\nHere, we explore that ruling and two other cases that earned Ginsburg her \u201cnotorious\u201d reputation for fervent opposition.\nIn a new video, they join politicians, activists, and civil rights leaders in paying tribute to the Supreme Court justice in honor of a new biography, Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nFilmmaker Lena Dunham, journalist Janet Mock, and Wisconsin Sen.
