Only about 30 percent of us voted, so maybe not everyone knew. But Election Day it was, with a few key government jobs up for grabs.\n\nLike, say, governor, for instance, with perennial Democratic nominee Jack Conway, Republican outsider Matt Bevin and Independent outsider Drew Curtis vying for the job.\n\nThe Atlantic listed it as the top race worth watching in 2015, as did The Washington Post, giving it the No. 1 spot in the \u201c8 races worth watching.\u201d From the Post:\n\nOne of the top issues: Obamacare. Popular outgoing Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear (D) expanded Medicaid for more than half a million people in the state as part of President Obama\u2019s 2010 health-care reform law, and the election is becoming a referendum on whether that was the right move.\n\nThe Kentucky race attracted the attention of John Oliver, who issued a scathing review of then-candidate Mr. Bevin on his show, \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d It\u2019s an HBO show, so only click if you don\u2019t mind a few expletives:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d3nASKtGas\n\nThe day before the election, Wired ran an essay from Mr. Curtis, entitled \u201cSomeday, Tech Will End Our Dumb Two-Party System.\u201d\n\nHe concludes:\n\n\u201cCan I Win? Do I have a chance to win the race tomorrow? To be honest, it\u2019s probably slim. It\u2019s kind of a tragedy because everyone says they want a candidate like me, who doesn\u2019t bow to ideology, who looks out for society instead of selling government to the highest bidder, and most of all is smart enough to handle the unknown challenges ahead. But I ran into a strategic problem I couldn\u2019t overcome. The other two candidates are barely average. Even their supporters don\u2019t really like them. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times people have told me they like me better than their own party\u2019s candidate. But the problem is, the Democrats in particular really hate the other party\u2019s candidate. Democrats may dislike their own candidate but they are downright terrified of the Republican. They are primarily voting to keep him out of office, and that makes them unlikely to take a flier on a third-party candidate; they\u2019d rather pick the second-best candidate than vote for me. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been picking up GOP support no problem because they don\u2019t seem as afraid. That tells me that if the GOP candidate had been more adequate, I\u2019d have pulled this off.\u201d\n\nSaid The New York Times of the race:\n\nAnalysts say much will depend on turnout. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in Kentucky, but if Mr. Bevin \u2014 a staunch opponent of same-sex marriage \u2014 can drive enough Christian conservatives to the polls, it could help him eke out a victory.\n\nAnd then there was a low turnout and Mr. Bevin is now the governor-elect.\n\nThe Huffington Post suggests polls accurately captured support for Mr. Conway; the error was in underestimating the surge of support for Mr. Bevin. They echo the Times piece as well, citing low turnout as another benefit for the Republican candidate.\n\nThe Washington Post asks the question I heard many times over Wednesday morning: Matt Bevin is the new governor of Kentucky. Now what?\u201d They talk to the Lexington Herald-Leader\u2019s Sam Youngman:\n\n\u201cI think Bevin\u2019s best asset \u2014 and this should be noted in the context of next year\u2019s national races \u2014 was that he was not a politician. I know, I know. Yes, he ran for the Senate just last year, but he was viewed as an outsider and a businessman. And at least right now, that certainly seems to be a winning combination.\u201d\n\nThe Nation makes a similar observation. They declare the race a \u201cWarning From Kentucky: Managerial Democrats Can Lose to Extreme Republicans.\u201d They suggest the Democrats put forth a serviceable, albeit safe candidate and that candidate lost to \u201cKentucky\u2019s Trump.\u201d So for all those not taking Trump\u2019s Trump seriously, they\u2019re going to want to take another look.\n\nTo The Washington Post once more \u2014 Max Ehrenfreund asserts Mr. Bevin\u2019s win \u201ccould be the future of American politics.\u201d\n\nMany researchers now think that anger at and fear of the opposing party, rather than enthusiasm for one\u2019s own party, are what motivates voters these days. As the chart below shows, while Democrats\u2019 views of the Democratic Party haven\u2019t changed, they see the Republican Party more negatively, and vice versa. And Abramowitz and Webster argue that those negative emotions come from how the major political parties and the national figures who represent them are portrayed in the media, rather than voters\u2019 personal appraisals of particular politicians in their jurisdictions. In other words, loathing leads voters to paint candidates with a broader brush.\n\nSo we see the fruit of the political climate in which we\u2019ve been living, in which candidates court our basest instincts to create an electorate both increasingly bombarded with information, yet simultaneously more reactionary and less sophisticated. That may be the most bipartisan platform we have.\n\nSo to Kynect, ACA, \u201cObamacare\u201d:\n\nSalon says Mr. Bevin\u2019s win \u201cundermines a major Democratic Party theory.\u201d\n\nBy almost any metric, after all, Kynect \u2014 what they call the ACA in Kentucky \u2014 has been an inspirational success. Democrats hoped voters would reward the party for successfully implementing such a major policy. But from today\u2019s vantage, it\u2019s painfully obvious that they didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s not just a problem in the Bluegrass State \u2014 it\u2019s a problem for all Democrats. Because one of the foundational assumptions behind Kynect, the ACA, and much of the entire Democratic Party agenda is that good policy makes for good politics. In Kentucky, at least, it didn\u2019t.\n\nIn Bloomberg\u2019s piece, \u201cA Republican Can Kill Obamacare. Will He?\u201d they suggest:\n\n\u201cKentucky just volunteered to be a national political experiment, and it can\u2019t help but be an edifying one for the whole country.\u201d \u201cIn Kentucky, Democrats are out of power and Republicans are out of excuses. Health insurance for thousands of families is now in the hands of the Republican governor-elect. Either subsidized health insurance is here to stay, with or without the histrionics of Tea Party freedom fighters. Or the curb is about to get crowded.\u201d\n\nTalking Points Memo Says Mr. Bevin is unlikely to be able to deliver on that particular campaign promise. They speak with Caroline Pearson, VP of consulting firm Avalere Health. Says Ms. Pearson:\n\n\u201cIt is nearly politically impossible to take benefits from people \u2014 even for Republicans. I think that\u2019s not likely to happen, even though that might sell well on the campaign trail.\u201d \u201cObamacare is here to stay. At this point it\u2019s going to be about how you deliver that coverage more efficiently and sort of modifying the flavor a bit, but none of it\u2019s going to disappear.\u201d\n\nSlate piggybacks off of Bloomberg, saying just about every Republican governor will be watching both what Governor Bevin does and how it\u2019s received. The question according to Slate:\n\nIf he claws back insurance from people who vote Republican but also enjoy their health coverage, will he pay a significant political price?\n\nSo I guess we\u2019ll all find out together.\n\nKentucky Staple: The day after your big Kentucky elections, you had the Country Music Awards in Nashville.\n\nKentucky\u2019s own Chris Stapleton won the night, taking home new artist of the year, album of the year and male vocalist of the year for his debut album, Traveller, says The Guardian, ABC News, Fox News and The New York Times.\n\nUSA Today gives his moving acceptance speech from his third award of the night.\n\nThe question asked by many that night (and the days to follow): Who is Chris Stapleton?\n\nFox News would like to know; ditto USA Today; double ditto Here and Now (WBUR). Rolling Stone asks and answers: Who Is Chris Stapleton: 5 Things You Need to Know About the CMA King. The Tennessean has 5 more things for you.\n\nBillboard offers some assistance with \u201c10 Things to Know About CMA King Chris Stapleton\u201d (first on the list: He\u2019s from Kentucky).\n\nHere\u2019s your bullet list:\n\nHe\u2019s 37.\n\nPlayed with the band The SteelDrivers.\n\nHe\u2019s written a truckload of songs, including some big time hits for some big players.\n\nTraveller is his solo debut.\n\nHe\u2019s from Kentucky.\n\nThe second most asked question is what does Stapleton\u2019s win mean. The Washington Post calls it a move back to credibility and away from \u201cbro-country.\u201d The New Yorker suggests Stapleton has \u201ccracked the country code \u2014 uniting roots authenticity with Nashville-radio success\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic says he\u2019s already conquering country music, though his debut has yet to yield a single radio hit and likely won\u2019t.\n\nDeadspin says he\u2019s \u201cyour \u2018real country music\u2019 savior.\u201d\n\nWeighing down a relative unknown like Stapleton with Album of the Year, Best New Artist, and Male Vocalist of the Year trophies is the CMAs\u2019 not terribly subtle way of hanging a PLEASE GOD LISTEN TO THIS GUY INSTEAD banner across the stage, and across the television screens of fans industry stalwarts wish had way better taste.\n\nOne other thing his victory likely means, according to Billboard, is that Traveller is heading to No. 1 on the charts when the next list comes out.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the awards making headlines this week; it\u2019s his epic, show-stealing, duet with none other than a genre-hopping Justin Timberlake that has the internet\u2019s attention, with raves from USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, TIME, The Huffington Post, Rolling Stone, and Country Rebel.\n\nYou can thank me later:\n\nPlease if there is a God let there be more music like this that people are craving! #ChrisStapleton #justintimberlake #CMAAwards2015 \u2014 Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) November 5, 2015\n\n@jtimberlake @ChrisStapleton I'll never get over that performance. #CMAs \u2014 Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert) November 5, 2015\n\nJustin was positively glowing after the performance, says Entertainment Weekly. Here\u2019s what he had to say on Instagram:\n\nAbout last night\u2026 I've been friends with @castapleton and his lovely wife Morgane for a couple of years now, but sometimes you meet people and feel like you've known them your whole life. He is one of THE MOST gifted musicians, songwriters, and vocalists I've ever met. So stoked to share this moment with him and watch him put the WHOLE WORLD on notice. So happy for you brother. Chalk one up for the good guys. A photo posted by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Nov 5, 2015 at 2:07pm PST\n\nAs for Stapleton, he says, \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d according to CMT. He said a bunch more, but that\u2019s the headline.\n\nHome Stretch: Your big finale to \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d series is just two weeks away, as \u201cThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay\u2014Part 2\u201d hits theaters Nov. 20. That means it\u2019s premiere season and everyone\u2019s talking about your girl, Jennifer Lawrence, on London\u2019s red carpet. Or rather what she\u2019s wearing. Or not wearing.\n\nThe Huffington Post, US Weekly, People, Popsugar and Scotland\u2019s Daily Record say her stunning Dior Haute Couture allowed a lot of space to breathe, with a plunging neckline and open sides, giving a peek at what many quaintly refer to as sideboob.\n\nHere you go:\n\nJennifer Lawrence at the #MockingjayPremiere in London today! pic.twitter.com/MSCZiP01lB \u2014 Jennifer Lawrence (@JLdaily) November 5, 2015\n\nUSA Today forgoes the conversation on the dress and moves the conversation to her \u201cpower pose.\u201d They cite Shonda Rhimes\u2019 new book, \u201cYear of Yes,\u201d in which the \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal\u201d creator recommends the Wonder Woman pose for success.\n\nListen, no matter your affiliations and allegiances, it\u2019s been a stressful week, so I want to leave you with a batch of feelgood this weekend.\n\nHere\u2019s a video Megan gave me of people getting puppies as Christmas gifts and the ensuing joy only puppydom can provide:\n\nThe Verge and The Huffington Post say a terminally ill Star Wars fan saw the new movie, \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d this week, a month before its official release. Daniel Fleetwood was diagnosed with a rare cancer and given just two months to live back in July. A twitter campaign, #ForceforDaniel, took off and caught the attention of some of the film\u2019s stars before ultimately making its way to director J.J. Abrams and the folks at Disney. Fleetwood received a screening of the film in his home.\n\nSpeaking of, the Fencing Senior World Championships Moscow 2015 featured an epic lightsaber duel.\n\nSure, the remix of Maroon 5\u2019s Sugar might belie the never-ending struggle of the battle between good and evil, but perhaps that\u2019s what you want. Something to tip the favor for the light side of the Force over the dark side of the Force.\n\nIs that right? You hear the dark side referred to constantly, but nary a mention of the terminology for its opposite. Maybe in the comic books or what have you. Light side sounds off to me.\n\nHarry Potter fans, of which I know there are many, will rejoice at the first images of the spinoff, \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\u201d starring the incomparable Eddie Redmayne. He graces the cover of Entertainment weekly as his character, Newt Scamander, says ComingSoon.\n\nSo here\u2019s that:\n\nMore information available from Jessica Chobot at Nerdist.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this Good News Network story of Greta Hokanson, a leukemia survivor thanks to a bone marrow transplant. At her wedding, she danced with the donor who saved her life:\n\nBe good to each other.\n\nSee you next week.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "description": "A look at Louisville and Kentucky in the national news, from Bevin's win to Lawrence's power-pose.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "A look at Louisville and Kentucky in the national news, from Bevin's win to Lawrence's power-pose.", "title": "In Other News...
