Immigration Iowa Congressman: Impeach Obama If He Grants Deportation Relief To Undocumented Immigrants CREDIT: Fox News Sunday Rep. Steve King (R-IA)

Just five days after House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) attempted to dismiss talk of impeachment as a “scam started by Democrats at the White House,” a key Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee told Fox News Sunday that the Republican House should impeach President Obama if he uses his executive authority to defer deportation for millions of undocumented adults.

Rep. Steve King (R-IA), who has led the charge to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), successfully pushed this week to pass a House bill to defund the renewal of the deferred status for hundreds of thousands of undocumented residents brought to the United States as children.

Asked by host Chris Wallace about the probability of executive action by the Obama administration to stop deporting the millions of undocumented adults, King made it clear that this would be an impeachable offense. If Obama should take unilateral action to expand DACA beyond its current levels, he said, “Congress has to sit down and have a serious look at the rest of this constitution and that includes that ‘i’ word we don’t want to say.” Wallace pressed him to clarify the threat:

Wallace: But you’re saying if he were to do that then impeachment would be on the table? King: I think then we have to start, sit down and take a look at that. Where would we draw the line otherwise? If that’s not enough to bring that about, then I don’t know what would be.

King had dabbled in impeachment advocacy before, but told CNN last week “I am not pushing impeachment.”

Speaker Boehner, ironically, urged President Obama to take unilateral executive action to address the border crisis this week — a day after almost every House Republican in his caucus voted to sue the president for using similar authority to implement Obamacare.
