But an automatic deduction from her checking account left her broke and no way to get her money back under the Obamacare plan. She was out of luck \u2019till she called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.\n\nThey are words that will make the strongest person weaken; you have cancer.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was in front of me with the cancer, if I was gonna have chemo, I had no clue.\u201d\n\nThe good news: so far Josephine Diaz has beaten breast cancer. The bad news: she had to quit work and live on social security.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cAnd it just won\u2019t stretch that far. $1,298 is my monthly social security check.\u201d\n\nAfter battling cancer, Josephine couldn\u2019t find health insurance even if she could afford it. Then Obamacare was passed.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cOh I jumped at it. We picked our option. I was happy with my coverage.\u201d\n\nJosephine is now paying $197 a month for health insurance and it\u2019s withdrawn directly from her checking account. Then she went to a store to buy some food.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cAnd I swiped my card thinking there was money and it shows declined. Wow.\u201d\n\nWhen she got home, she went online and discovered her insurance company under the Obamacare plan had deducted $697 instead of the $197 dollars from her account. She called them to get the $500 back.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201c\u2018Oh no, that is the regular monthly rate for your coverage under Obamacare.'\u201d\n\nThe insurance company said Josephine\u2019s rate had gone up because they never got her tax information that qualified her for the lower rate.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cI did send my tax information but I did not send it certified. I didn\u2019t feel I had to.\u201d\n\nJosephine sent the information again to prove she was eligible for the $197 rate and again asked for the $500 overpayment to be returned to her.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cShe said we don\u2019t return money. No refund.\u201d\n\nThe insurance company said an appeal could take three to six months. Josephine\u2019s reply; without that $500, she had no money to live the rest of the month.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cThat is half my check, I need to pay for everything else. I had to ask my son to bail me out.\u201d\n\nWell Howard, when you are dealing with a government agency working with a private insurance company in Obamacare, can you quickly solve a problem?\n\nHoward Finkelstein: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way yet. Obamacare is a new program and there are remedies to fix problems like Josephine has but they can take months. She doesn\u2019t have months to get her $500, she needs that to survive this month. One day Obamacare may have that quick fix, but it\u2019s not been implemented yet.\u201d\n\nWe contacted the government agency called Marketplace which handles Obamacare. They couldn\u2019t talk to us because of federal privacy laws but they told us they would look into it. We then contacted Humana, who insurance\u2019s Josephine under Obamacare. Humana then resolved it.\n\nA spokesperson told us although the marketplace would not go back to allow the credit, Humana agreed to an exception after taking the entire circumstance into account. Humana then sent Josephine her $500 refund.\n\nHoward Finkelstein: \u201cTo avoid this with any government agency or business, send your paperwork certified mail. A few days later, call to confirm they got it and it\u2019s everything they need.\u201d\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cThank you. Thank you.\u201d\n\nJosephine got her money and won\u2019t have to worry about money being automatically taken from her account again. She will now make the payments.\n\nJosephine Diaz: \u201cI stopped the autopay because there went my confidence level. That is not going to happen again on my watch.\u201d\n\nPatrick Fraser: \u201cAs a rule of thumb, I never use autopay. I want to control when I pay. And by the way, trying to resolve Josephine\u2019s problem was unusually frustrating for us. In part because we are dealing with a government agency working with a private insurance company and because it\u2019s a medical issue. Under HIPAA, they really can\u2019t talk about the details of a specific case.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, if you have a similar problem, there is a website that oversees Obamacare and can answer your questions.\n\nGetting no care in treating your problem?

We will give you a healthy dose of support and try to automatically deduct the problem from your life.\n\nWith this Help Me Howard, I\u2019m Patrick Fraser, 7News.\n\nCONTACT HELP ME HOWARD:\n\nE-mail: helpmeHoward@wsvn.com (please include your contact phone number when e-mailing)\n\nReporter: Patrick Fraser at pfraser@wsvn.com\n\nMiami-Dade: 305-953-WSVN\n\nBroward: 954-761-WSVN\n\nQuestions or Problems under ObamaCare.\n\nhttps://questions.cms.gov/faq.php?id=5005&rtopic=1993", "article_metadata": {"contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare Problem\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/wsvn.com\\/news\\/obamacare-problem\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"June 3, 2015\",\"mod_date\":\"June 3, 2015\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":1606,\"author_id\":42216,\"author_name\":\"\",\"author_display_name\":\"\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Help Me Howard\",\"News\"],\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/sunbeamwsvn.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/02\\/7970126_g.jpg?w=630\",\"app_id\":\"wsvn\",\"version\":\"3.0\"}", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://wsvn.com/news/obamacare-problem/", "image": "https://sunbeamwsvn.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/7970126_g.jpg?w=630", "type": "article", "description": "(WSVN) \u2014 When Obamacare was enacted, she was able to get health insurance at a price she could afford.
