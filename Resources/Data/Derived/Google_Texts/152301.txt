The debate over Islam got heated again on “Real Time with Bill Maher” last night, when the Muslim journalist Rula Jebreal told Maher the way he talks about Islam makes some Muslims anxious.

“When you talk about Islam in a certain way, I have to tell you, it’s offensive sometimes,” she said. “And some people feel threatened.”

Jebreal told Maher that to him, “we are all jihadists.”

Maher replied: “I know that in many places in the world, if you left your religion, what would happen?”

“‎Maybe not in Gaza, to be honest,” Jebreal said. “But you can do it in Jordan, you can do it in Lebanon. You are blaming the majority for the criminal act of a minority.”
