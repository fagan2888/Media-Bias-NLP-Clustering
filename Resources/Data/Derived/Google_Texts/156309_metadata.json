America\u2019s youth are already familiar with a benevolent black man with immense powers who gives gifts to children: President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nAfter airing a package report from NBC News White House reporter Kristen Welker, Tour\u00e9 thanked her but noted she did not go far enough. \u201cSanta Claus is black. He just is,\u201d the MSNBC host mock-insisted.\n\nRELATED: Slate Writer Who Began \u2018White Santa\u2019 Discussion Accuses Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly of \u2018Playing the Victim\u2019\n\n\u201cI, for one, am glad Santa is black because I don\u2019t want my kids worshipping some white dude who flies in to give them stuff,\u201d Tour\u00e9 continued. \u201cThinking a benevolent white man gives them stuff every year is good training for a life on welfare.\u201d\n\nHe added that he is not surprised by the resistance to the notion that a powerful figure like Santa could be black.\n\n\u201cThe insistence he\u2019s not black and can\u2019t be black strikes me as an attempt to perpetuate white supremacy and to posit that whiteness is somehow normal and central while blackness is other or different,\u201d Tour\u00e9 continued. He insisted that \u201crace is fictional\u201d and, as a social construct, it bears little bearing on day-to-day life.\n\n\u201cYou do know, there is already a generous, benevolent black man in your children\u2019s lives who lives in a place that is magical, who has given something to each and every American, whether they have been naughty or nice,\u201d the MSNBC host concluded. \u201cYou know who I\u2019m talking about?\u201d\n\nTour\u00e9 signed off by playing a portion of a parody video promoted by the White House featuring an Obama impersonator touting the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWatch the clip below via MSNBC:\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tour\u00e9 put a period on the Santa Claus' scandal in his commentary on The Cycle when he said that the controversy over the race of a mythical figure was off base.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/toure.jpg", "title": "Tour\u00e9 Says There\u2019s Already a Benevolent Black Man Who Gives Gifts to Kids: Obama"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tour\u00e9 put a period on the Santa Claus' scandal in his commentary on The Cycle when he said that the controversy over the race of a mythical figure was off base.
