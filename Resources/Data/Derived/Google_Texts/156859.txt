Welcome to another edition of Curbside Consult.

Joanne Kenen is the lead health care reporter and editor for Politico and Politico Pro. She is one of the top sources of Washington reporting on health reform and many other subjects.

This week, Joanne and I had a wide-ranging conversation about the troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov, the perils of covering misleading anecdata, and the marathon of covering such a difficult political story for so many years.

In the second segment of our multi-part interview, Joanne and I talk about whether healthcare costs are really slowing down and whether the Affordable Care Act – with its multitude of cost-cutting measures – can take any credit.

It’s a great conversation. Hope you enjoy it.
