Some of the pools, however, are closing at the end of the year, and AP reports that it is unclear whether enrollees will be able to obtain new coverage by that date. One enrollee, Kelly Bachi of Oklahoma, is worried that she will have to discontinue her treatment for breast cancer:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared. I\u2019m in the middle of my cancer treatment, and if my insurance ends, I\u2019m going to have to cancel the rest of my treatment,\u201d said Kelly Bachi, an Oklahoma boat repair business owner who has breast cancer and is covered through a pool. Cancer treatment without insurance would cost her about $500,000, she said. Bachi has not been able to enroll via the healthcare.gov federal website, although not for lack of trying. She attempted to sign up half a dozen times and was eventually able to create an account but was later blocked from accessing the account.\n\nHow many thousands of Kelly Bachis are out there?\n\n23,000 sickest Texas, in high risk pool, got health insurance cancellation notices recently, including me. #MyHealthPlanDied \u2014 George Conner (@Lawyergeorge) November 4, 2013\n\nLots of calls from people in previous high-risk pool saying their manageable plans are gone, premiums 2-4x higher. Dems in trouble 2014. \u2014 Brad Cundiff (@bradcundiff) November 1, 2013\n\nPresident Obama has often talked about ensuring that Americans who have pre-existing conditions can obtain health insurance:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/BppYO9n7IKE\n\nThose words must sound a bit hollow to Kelly Bachi right now, but by focusing on people like her we\u2019re guilty of sensationalizing the news, right Jay Carney?\n\nBy the way, high-risk pool plans tend to be quite expensive. Even so, enrollees who are able to obtain new coverage through Obamacare may find themselves paying more.\n\nA couple with pre-existing conditions will face higher rates under Obamacare than they did in the high risk pool in N. Carolina. \u2014 Jim Angle (@JimAngleFox) November 6, 2013\n\nAin\u2019t \u201caffordable\u201d care grand?\n\nRelated:\n\nDespicable: WH smears cancer survivor who lost her insurance plan due to Obamacare\n\nFlaming douche: Jay Carney dismisses story of woman losing coverage as \u2018sensational\u2019\n\nObamacare train wreck: Stage IV gallbladder cancer survivor can\u2019t keep her doctors\n\n\u2018Simple.
