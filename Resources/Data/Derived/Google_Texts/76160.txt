WASHINGTON (AP) — Defender Gerard Pique says reigning champion Spain is one of several favorites to win this year’s World Cup, mentioning host Brazil, Argentina and Germany as other teams to beat.

“Anything can happen in a World Cup,” Pique said at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday. “There are several favorites, and it is clear we are among that group.”

Spain lost 3-0 to Brazil last year in the finals of the Confederations Cup in Rio.

The Spaniards arrived in Washington on Monday to train. They face El Salvador at FedEx Field on Saturday in their last tuneup game before heading to Brazil.

Spain plays its Group B opener against the Netherlands on June 13 in Salvador, then takes on Chile and Australia.
