Karl Rove agrees that defunding is plainly impossible and everyone knows it. Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, says the whole defunding campaign is nothing more than \"theatrics,\" and a clean budget bill will end up passing the House in short order.\n\nThis is not a bunch of RINOs talking. They'd repeal Obamacare in a heartbeat if they could. But they're smart enough to know that tea-party Republicans are boxing themselves into a corner with no exit possible except a humiliating and ruinous capitulation. That's Highway 1.\n\nAlternatively, they could drive a hard bargain on other items and quite possibly come out the other end with half a dozen genuine victories. That's Highway 2.\n\nSo which road are Republicans going down? Highway 1, of course. As a native Californian, I can confirm that this is indeed a very scenic route that will satisfy your yearning for a dramatic\u2014and occasionally even hair-raising\u2014ride. Unfortunately, it doesn't always get you where you want to go.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "But no one's listening", "title": "Republicans warn Republicans of imminent crackup", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/republicans-warn-republicans-imminent-crackup", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_highway_1_collapse_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Republicans warn Republicans of imminent crackup", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/republicans-warn-republicans-imminent-crackup", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_highway_1_collapse_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_highway_1_collapse_0.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "That's Highway 2.\nThat's Highway 1.\nThe Wall Street Journal thinks congressional Republicans are idiots for pretending they can force the president to defund Obamacare.\nBut they're smart enough to know that tea-party Republicans are boxing themselves into a corner with no exit possible except a humiliating and ruinous capitulation.\nAlternatively, they could drive a hard bargain on other items and quite possibly come out the other end with half a dozen genuine victories."}
