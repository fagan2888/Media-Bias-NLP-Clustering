In 2013, Massachusetts state troopers pulled over a car allegedly transporting more than 1,000 bags of heroin labeled \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia is known for having the most potent heroin in the country,\u201d AP Sports claimed about the drug sold in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nOfficials with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) confiscated the Steph stash this week, The Big Lead reported.\n\n\u201cRough week for Stephen Curry. First the face of the NBA suffered a knee sprain that will keep him out of the playoffs for at least two weeks. Now we find out he\u2019s apparently the face of heroin in Philadelphia. The Chief of SEPTA Transit Police tweeted out this image showing Chef Curry\u2019s face inside tiny baggies of heroin. This is so not jawn.\u201d\n\nThinking Steph Curry wouldn't be happy that he is this week's brand for heroin in Philly. cc: @StephenCurry30 pic.twitter.com/mmRcC741YM \u2014 Thomas J. Nestel III (@TNestel3) April 27, 2016\n\nAbout the Steph Curry dope baggies discovered by police, NBC10 in Philadelphia explained that \u201cThe stamp, as the branding is called, is like a logo drug dealers use to market the potent opioid to drug addicted people. They can be named after companies (like Facebook), objects, feelings, or in Curry\u2019s case, people. These stamps come and go quickly with dozens being sold at a time across the area, narcotics officers say.\u201d\n\nSteph Curry\u2019s face is apparently being used to brand heroin in Philadelphia: https://t.co/Yd9431zZDd pic.twitter.com/H3SDfFjAjf \u2014 Complex Sports (@Complex_Sports) April 28, 2016\n\nA SEPTA officer reportedly discovered the Steph smack after he stopped and frisked a teenage suspect on Tuesday evening.\n\nIn October 2014, as the Inquisitr previously reported, New Jersey police busted an alleged drug dealer for trying to sell packets of heroin labeled with the pseudo trademark \u201cEbola\u201d as a marketing technique.\n\n\u201cDifferent dealers have different potencies and products. Many times they are labeled with catchy phrases,\u201d said one officer at the time. \u201cIn the past we have had Bin Laden, Hello Kitty, D.O.A., Twin Towers, 911, Gumball, Pow, etc.\u201d\n\nAnother narcotics investigator remarked that \u201cIt\u2019s usually a marketing tool for [dealers]\u2026 We have [drugs] stamped as the president, as the Pope. You name it, they stamp it.\u201d He noted that he\u2019s also encountered an \u201cO.D.\u201d stamp on drug packets.\n\nWhile obviously not lending his likeness to illegal street drugs, Stephen Curry \u2014 who led his team to a record-breaking 73 regular season wins in the 2015-2016 NBA campaign \u2014 has endorsed various legitimate products, SportsRageous observed. \u201cThe reigning MVP also has sponsorship deals with Under Armour (UA), Degree, Express, State Farm, Muscle Milk and JBL. He also has his own brand of shoes with UA\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter eliminating the Houston Rockets from the playoffs, the Warriors will return to action (likely without Curry until he is cleared to play) in the NBA West Conference semifinals once the first-round contest between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Los Angeles Clippers gets resolved, probably in favor of Portland.\n\n\u201cNBC10 reached out to Curry\u2019s reps to get his thoughts about the stamp, but we haven\u2019t heard back. A spokeswoman for the Golden State Warriors had no comment,\u201d the station added about the Steph Curry heroin.\n\n[image via Shutterstock]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Steph Curry-branded heroin is reportedly being sold on the streets of Philadelphia according to local cops.
