He, again, said that he made a mistake. That he \u201cgot it wrong.\u201d That he \u201cis sorry.\u201d That he is \u201ctrying to get it right.\u201d That the league \u201cneeds outside help.\u201d\n\nBut the general public has heard those lines many times throughout these past few months, from him and his owners.\n\n(The commissioner also said he has not considered resigning \u2014 \u201cWe have a lot of work to do. That\u2019s my focus.\u201d \u2014 and that he believes he has the full support of the league\u2019s owners \u2014 \u201cThat has been clear to me.\u201d)\n\nBut while Goodell may have been very sincere in his words, that he was indeed very sorry for how the NFL has handled the Ray Rice incident and the other cases that have come up since, he didn\u2019t offer a concrete plan for how the league would change its ways.\n\nHe said the league would strive to get a new personal conduct policy in place by the Super Bowl, but he didn\u2019t say what changes he would like to see made to the policy.\n\nHe said the league has partnered with two outside organizations for domestic violence awareness, but he didn\u2019t say how that would change things within the league.\n\nHe said he there have been inconsistencies in how the NFL has handled the varied cases over the last few weeks, but he didn\u2019t explain why.\n\nHe said \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d when asked if he would consider giving up some of his power to allow for more checks and balances in the league.\n\nWhen asked about Robert Mueller conflict of interests in investigating a league his firm has represented in past contract negotiations, Goodell asked why anyone would question Mueller\u2019s credibility.\n\nWhen probed by reporters, Goodell failed to answer succinctly how things will change and why things have happened as they have. In short, he said he has been in numerous meetings, that there are many things that the league \u201cneeds to consider,\u201d that they \u201cneed to get it right.\u201d But offered no answers and no plans with real changes.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the media who appeared baffled by Goodell\u2019s lack of reasoning Friday. Players, fans and countless others expressed their views on his address:\n\nAll u have to do is look around social media of current and former NFL players see lack of respect for goodell. #dividedleague #usVSthem \u2014 Scott Shanle (@scottshanle) September 19, 2014\n\nSponsors pulling out and disassociating them selves from the nfl.
