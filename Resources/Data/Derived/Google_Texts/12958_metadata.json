The Russian leader deflected reporters\u2019 questions about his whereabouts, saying only, \u201cIt\u2019s boring without rumors.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s reappearance coincided with several reports sure to raise tensions among his neighbors. Putin put Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet, as well as associated airborne troops and other military units, on full alert as part of a readiness drill aimed at potential conflict in the Arctic, a region where Russia has become more assertive in recent months.\n\nRelated: Putin and Kim Jong-un Declare Themselves Besties\n\nAlso on Monday, Russian media released a documentary film about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year. Putin reveals he\u2019d been prepared to put his considerable nuclear forces on alert at the time.\n\n\"We were ready to do it,\u201d Putin said in the interview in the film. \u201cI talked with colleagues and told them that [Crimea] is our historic territory, Russian people live there, they are in danger, we cannot leave them.\u201d\n\nOne of Russia\u2019s pretenses for invading Crimea and for supporting an ongoing armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine was the ostensible threat to ethnic Russians living there.\n\nPutin also directly accused the U.S. of organizing the Maidan uprising which, early last year, ended with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country.\n\nRelated: 17 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Vladimir Putin\n\n\u201cFormally, the opposition was primarily supported by Europeans, but we knew very well ... that the real puppeteers were our American partners and friends. It was them who helped prepare nationalists (and) combat troops,\u201d he said, according to CNN.\n\nIn the film, Putin is reportedly forthright about his personal involvement with the invasion of Crimea, saying he ordered it personally and managed it throughout. At the time, the Russian president made public statements in which is claimed, falsely, that Russia had sent no troops to Crimea, and that the thousands of armed men in insignia-free Russian uniforms who appeared throughout the region were independent actors.\n\nThe announcement of another major military exercise, and the admission that he was prepared to take the initial steps toward a nuclear response over Crimea, will no doubt crank up the tension in Europe, where Russia\u2019s neighbors have become increasingly nervous about the Kremlin\u2019s increasingly aggressive posture. Last week, the president of the European Commission called for the creation of a Pan-European army designed specifically to serve as a counterweight to Russia.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After an unexplained 10-day absence from public view, Russian President Vladimir Putin reappeared at a meeting in St. Petersburg on Monday.
