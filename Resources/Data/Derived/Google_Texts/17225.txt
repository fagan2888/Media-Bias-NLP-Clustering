He nailed it. Brit Hume last week on Fox News’ Special Report described what motivated the House Tea Party Caucus and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) in moving forward with a government shutdown in an attempt to defund Obamacare. The transcript of the primary point is below:

They look back over the past half century, including the supposedly golden era of Ronald Reagan, and see the uninterrupted forward march of the American Left. Entitlement spending never stopped growing. The regulatory state continued to expand. The national debt grew and grew, and finally, in the Obama years, exploded.

They see an American population becoming unrecognizable from the free and self-reliant people they thought they knew. And they see the Republican party as having utterly failed to stop the drift toward an unfree nation supervised by an overweening and bloated bureaucracy.

They are not interested in Republican policies that merely slow the growth of this leviathan. They want to stop it and reverse it. And they want to show their supporters that they’ll try nearly anything to bring that about. And if some of those things turn out to be reckless and doomed, well, so be it.
