She expanded the memorial\u2019s reach and facilities, and in particular enlarged its outreach to Native Americans. That outreach has included scholarships for Native students, educational and training programs, job opportunities and direct donations to the reservation.\n\nTribal people returned the favor Tuesday with traditional honoring ceremonies. Ben Good Buffalo, a spiritual leader from the Pine Ridge Reservation, said Ruth earned the ceremonial goodbye by her work to benefit Native people\n\n\"I'm here at Crazy Horse celebrating, honoring Ruth on her leaving for the spirit world,\" Good Buffalo said.\n\nGood Buffalo said Ruth will be honored again later when family members go to the Pine Ridge Reservation for a wiping of the tears ceremony, which is a great honor.\n\nMany Native Americans were at the public viewing, filing slowly past a wooden casket built by one of Ruth's children and draped with a star quilt. It was the kind of simple understated ceremony that Ruth Ziolkowski would have loved, on a day to make a dream shine more brightly than ever.\n\nMonday's public viewing was just the start of honoring services for Ruth Ziolkowski. There will be a celebration of her life at the memorial at 10 a.m. today. Services are open to friends and the public and admission fees will be waived from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Thousands of people came to Crazy Horse Memorial near Custer Tuesday, not just to see the famous mountain carving, but also to say goodbye.
