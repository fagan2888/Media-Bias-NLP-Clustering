They swung down, log after rolling log, bouncing off his rib cage, burying him. He would wake, eyes wide, mouth agape. Only seconds later did he hear himself screaming.\n\nCarol was used to her husband's unconscious thrashing. The nightmares were once the price he paid for a good job. But the Rough & Ready mill that employed Jones all of his adult life closed in early February, and now what Carol Jones often wakes to in the middle of the night is her husband sitting alone in the living room with a bottle of Jack Daniel's.\n\n\u201cHe's all wired up, nothing to do with that energy,\u201d she says. Before, when he was working, \u201che'd pull extra shifts and come home tired, really tired. Now he's got just time.\u201d\n\nKeven Jones, 36, blames a band saw for the two fingers he lost years ago on his right hand. For the quiet panic he's in now, for the over-regulating that he's convinced shut down the mill and threw 63 people out of work, that, he figures, was the government's fault.\n\nCave Junction, Ore.

But this mountainous corner of southwest Oregon, just up the Redwood Highway from the California border, has always leaned Republican.\n\nAnd even as GOP voters across the state have waffled ahead of the May 17 primary, drifting from retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich before leaning toward Trump, the New York real estate magnate's support in Josephine County has never wavered.\n\n------------\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\n6:13 a.m.: An earlier version of this article stated that the Oregon primary is scheduled for May 19. It is is set for May 17.\n\n------------\n\nFamily man Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times Keven Jones greets daughter Emilee upon his return home from a trip to town.

But he's a CEO. He'll hire the right people to do that.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFrom Oregon's earliest days, the seemingly unending supply of timber from the coastal rainforest made the local lumber barons rich men. For more than a century, demand for the boards produced by Cave Junction's mills led to massive tree cutting and soaring profits.\n\nJones and his friends grew up planning to stay in town and raise families. He'd known Carol from childhood. When he was 18 and she was 16, she told him she was pregnant, and he got hired as a saw filer at Rough & Ready. They raised their children in rooms built from wood planed at the mill.\n\nCarol Jones at meeting Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times Carol Jones learns about health coverage options while her husband, a saw filer, is on unemployment.

To keep timber-dependent counties afloat, the federal government offered money to replace the taxes they lost, until they could develop new industries.\n\nBut the payments have dwindled and are scheduled to expire next year. People here are waiting to hear whether Washington will provide job training to laid-off timber workers via the federal Trade Act. If the money is approved, Jones hopes he can send Carol to nursing school; she'd earn four times what he was making at the mill. If the federal money comes through, town leaders keep saying, Cave Junction just might make it.\n\nJones roams his house, restless, doing laundry and the dishes, trying and failing to avoid thinking about the Trade Act money. Once again, Jones finds himself at the mercy of the government.\n\nNeeding something from the government is the last place Jones wants to be in. He doesn't trust Obamacare, so he and his family have gone without health insurance since the mill closed. He doesn't believe the state has the right to require vehicle insurance, so he has been cited multiple times for driving uninsured.\n\nStill, it was the federal government most people turned to the last time the mill closed, eight hours into a nine-hour shift in 2013. That time, 85 people were out of a job. Two committed suicide.\n\nTrade Act money helped Jones start classes to earn a commercial truck driver's license. Then the mill owners came back with a promise: The mill was reopening, and if he dropped the truck driver training and came back to work, they would guarantee him five years of employment. \u201cSo I dropped it,\u201d Jones recalls.\n\nThe mill didn't make it to a second anniversary, much less five years.\n\n***\n\nCarol Jones crunches to a halt in the parking lot of Rogue Community College under the lazy drifting petals of a just-blooming lavender dogwood. She looks into the back seat, where two 10-year-old girls sit, her daughter Emilee and her niece, Alicia.\n\nThe family adopted Alicia seven years ago when Carol's brother, driving drunk, had a crash that killed his other child. His wife ended up in a mental asylum. Alicia moved in while her father was in prison.\n\n\u201cI already know all the bad words,\u201d Alicia begins. \u201cFart, booger \u2014\u201d\n\nKeven Jones with Linc Phillippi Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times Keven Jones talks with his former boss, mill owner Linc Phillippi, a month after being let go.

Coming back to school for Carol is a calculated investment. College costs $500 a semester, plus $400 for books and the gas it will take to drive 40 minutes each way to school from Cave Junction. Keven is getting $470 every two weeks in unemployment, and the math is giving her a dull ache behind her eyes.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "In a down-on-its-luck Oregon mill town, the savior they're waiting for is Donald Trump", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "He used to wake her up nights, shouting out his terror in the dark, his tattooed biceps continuing their clench-and-spasm dance long after a shift feeding cedar logs into the endless maw of the lumber mill.", "title": "In a down-on-its-luck Oregon mill town, the savior they're waiting for is Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ff-trump-nation-oregon-20160502-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57268df7/turbine/la-na-ff-trump-nation-oregon-20160502", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Donald Trump, campaign, presidential, Oregon", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/87041625", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-02", "Description": "He used to wake her up nights, shouting out his terror in the dark, his tattooed biceps continuing their clench-and-spasm dance long after a shift feeding cedar", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, campaign, presidential, Oregon"}, "article_summary": "(Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times) (Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times)Carol leads the two girls like a pair of chittering ducklings across the campus, silent and abandoned during spring break.\n(Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times) (Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times)Then a series of environmental lawsuits in the 1980s and early 1990s brought new federal restrictions on logging from public lands.\n------------Family man Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times Keven Jones greets daughter Emilee upon his return home from a trip to town.\nCarol Jones at meeting Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times Carol Jones learns about health coverage options while her husband, a saw filer, is on unemployment.\nIn his nightmare, Keven Jones pushed the logs into neat rows, but as he dreamed, the logs started to tumble."}
