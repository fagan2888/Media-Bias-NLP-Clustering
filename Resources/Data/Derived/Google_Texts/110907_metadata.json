The risk-corridor program is designed to help insurers deal financially with not getting enough in premium payments to offset their costs from paying out health benefits.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Other insurers face financial pressure from Obamacare plans, but the market has seen a net increase in the number of plans sold for 2016.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Other insurers face financial pressure from Obamacare plans, but the market has seen a net increase in the number of plans sold for 2016.", "title": "UnitedHealth's Obamacare stunner: More to come?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/19/big-bad-day-for-obamacare-as-unitedhealth-considers-exit.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/19/103183772-GettyImages-159980335.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Other insurers face financial pressure from Obamacare plans, but the market has seen a net increase in the number of plans sold for 2016.", "title": "'Big' bad day for Obamacare as UnitedHealth considers exit", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/19/big-bad-day-for-obamacare-as-unitedhealth-considers-exit.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/19/103183772-GettyImages-159980335.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Obamacare, Health Care, Health Insurance, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, UnitedHealth Group Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-11-19T15:39:42-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2015-11-19T17:26:37-0500", "tag": "UnitedHealth Group Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 103182907, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, UnitedHealth, Aetna, health insurance, open enrollment"}, "article_summary": "\"Fundamentally, the carriers have to be allowed to sell health plans that people want to buy,\" Laszewksi said.\n\"Premiums after subsidies are still too high,\" he said, referring to the tax credits most exchange customers get to lower their monthly premium cost.\n\"The Obamacare business model doesn't work,\" said Robert Laszewski, president of consultancy Health Policy and Strategy Associates in Virginia.\nClare Krusing, spokeswoman for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, said that UnitedHealth's comments Thursday reflect what members of AHIP have been experiencing themselves in recent months with their exchange products.\nHe called for the administration to loosen regulatory restrictions on the design of insurance plans so that insurers can offer customers coverage that is more affordable while still being attractive."}
