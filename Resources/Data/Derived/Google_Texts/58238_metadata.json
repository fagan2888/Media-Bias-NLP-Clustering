Photo courtesy of Exercise ETC Inc.\n\nWhen private equity firm HGGC prepared for its annual fitness challenge in early 2012, its office in the West Palm Beach, Florida, hired bikini fitness competitor and personal trainer Veronica Salerno to help coach the participants.\n\nThe competition ended that spring, and Salerno was contracted to lead workouts for small groups of employees twice a week in the on-site fitness center. But she soon discovered that HGGC employees often are on the road and couldn\u2019t attend the workouts.\n\n\u201cOur employees travel a lot, and their health isn\u2019t always on their minds, but our company understands that health is important,\u201d said Ashley Truett, administrative assistant and office manager for HGGC. \u201cIf you keep your employees healthy and happy, they\u2019ll stay motivated, want to be at work and continue to do well for you. The problem is traditional training doesn\u2019t work on today\u2019s schedules.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, Salerno\u2019s fitness training met the company\u2019s mobile workforce, using a hybrid of traditional personal exercise and social media. She meets less frequently with clients in person, but can work them out virtually almost daily.\n\nWith workplace wellness programs becoming more widespread \u2014 pushed in part by federal health care reform \u2014 Salerno said an out-of-office component can help employees fully engage no matter where they are.\n\nAccording to Automatic Data Processing Inc.\u2019s 2012 HR/Benefits Pulse Survey on Wellness, 41 percent of midsize companies (those with 50-999 employees) and 53 percent of large companies (those with 1,000-plus workers) offer exercise programs as part of their overall employee wellness program.\n\n\u201cAs health care costs continue to rise, many companies adopt employee wellness programs to motivate their employees to lead healthier lives,\u201d said Jessica Saperstein, division vice president of strategy and business development for ADP. \u201cImproving employee health and well-being is the ultimate goal, and healthier employees are often more satisfied and productive in their professional lives.\u201d\n\nThis year, under federal rules, the maximum reward an employee could save through workplace health incentives is 20 percent of the worker\u2019s health insurance premium.Most employers offer discounts of 3 percent to 11 percent, according to Stand Up for Health Care, part of the consumer group Families USA. Next year, under the Affordable Care Act, there will be a maximum reward of 30 percent.\n\nRobert Matthews, national director of sales for well-being and productivity at HumanaVitality, said there are benefits for employers, too. If employees are engaged in the health plan, including exercise offerings, and enough of a percentage of workers sign up, the employer can see a premium discount coming from insurers.\n\nSalerno, who moved to the United States from Ecuador, has created a Facebook page for her company, Home Fitness Trainers Inc., and has encouraged every HGGC client to add it. She posts recipes, exercise routines and motivational tips on the page daily to keep clients engaged. She also adds all clients on Skype and pushes them to use MyFitnessPal, a free online calorie counter and diet plan. Clients \u201cadd\u201d her on the website or app, and she monitors their progress. She checks in regularly through these portals to make sure her clients stay on track.\n\n\u201cCorporate training is often a group activity, but it\u2019s all about individual goals,\u201d Salerno said. \u201cI give everyone their own speed, agility and strength training exercises and couple those with diets that meet their needs. Social media lets me maintain a one-on-one relationship and pushes clients to be more accountable.\u201d\n\nGuy Andrews, executive director of Exercise ETC Inc., a provider of continuing education programs for the fitness community, said that fitness coaching makes personal training services more accessible to more people.\n\n\u201cSome people either cannot devote a set number of hours per week to training, or do not have the luxury of a structured schedule to plan for training sessions in advance,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cFor others, the price of regular, personal training sessions is not sustainable. Fitness coaching is making training affordable and accessible.\u201d\n\nLadan Nikravan is a Workforce associate editor. To comment, email editors@workforce.com.
