"Time is of the essence here. They have a three-day commitment on the outbound leg and overnight commitments on the inbound leg on the shipping. That's really critical for us."

The facility is dedicated to the shipping and logistics of high-end medical devices, such as those from Alphatec Spine, which specializes in spinal products. One 300-piece kit is delivered to hospitals on a loaner basis, and then sanitized and returned — sans certain parts implanted patients — to Swedesboro to be inventoried and replenished over the course of a day. The kits then ship back out to hospitals for more surgeries as soon as 36 hours later, and the process repeats. UPS says 60 percent of returned kits are sent back out within 24 hours.



"The medical profession is focused on reducing cost of services. That is where UPS, FedEx and DHL are involved. It creates greater opportunity for them," said Jindel. In the case of Alphatec, utilizing UPS's network means kits can be reused, thereby reducing the number that need to be manufactured.



It's not just surgical equipment being transported — it's also highly sensitive things such as drugs that often require special handling.

"The products that require temperature-controlled movement and storage that are time sensitive — that's what makes us attractive," said UPS's Menna.
