Onlookers filed through back streets in Mansfield west of U.S. 287 on Friday morning to see black smoke billowing from Spectrum Polymers.

The smoke resulted from a fire at the plastics company at 600 Justice Lane. No injuries were reported.

City spokeswoman Belinda Willis told KRLD News Radio that four fire units responded and the fire is contained to an outside building.

Check back for more details as they develop.
