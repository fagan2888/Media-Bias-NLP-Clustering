Bill Flores, R-Bryan, knew he\u2019d been handed both an enormous opportunity and a challenge.\n\nIn last year\u2019s elections, Republicans took control of the Senate and built their largest majority in the House since the 1920s. As the leader of the most powerful conservative bloc in Congress, Flores won an unprecedented chance to steer House legislation to the right.\n\nBut after recent reports about a group of study committee members forming a rival conservative caucus, Flores\u2019 task got even harder. In addition to cashing in on Congress\u2019 current conservative makeup, he must also keep his group together or risk losing its considerable clout. In just his third term in Congress, the Central Texas lawmaker is suddenly in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cI feel pressure to deliver,\u201d Flores said. \u201cBut that comes with the territory of being chair of the Republican Study Committee.\u201d\n\nFlores, 60, knocked off Democrat Chet Edwards in the tea party wave of 2010. He had previously worked as a CPA, and as an executive for several oil and gas companies.\n\nFlores has served on the Budget, Natural Resources, and Veterans\u2019 Affairs committees. He looks every bit an accountant and speaks in a fast Panhandle twang.\n\nInside his office, trinkets from Texas A&M University, his alma mater, cover the walls and shelves. Pocket copies of the Constitution and the Bible sit side-by-side on a coffee table. He\u2019s quick to quote Ronald Reagan, often invoking the former president\u2019s metaphor of the U.S. as a \u201cshining city on a hill.\u201d\n\nTexans make up more than 10 percent of the group\u2019s total membership, more than any other state delegation. Other Texans have held the chairman post, including Rep. Jeb Hensarling from 2007 to 2009.\n\nHensarling went on to serve in Republican leadership and currently chairs the Financial Services Committee. But chairing the study committee has been his favorite job in Congress.\n\n\u201cOf all the positions I\u2019ve held in the House, I probably enjoyed that one the most,\u201d Hensarling said.\n\nHensarling ran the group when Republicans were the minority in the House. Now that the GOP controls both chambers, Hensarling said Flores is \u201cplaying with real money.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough this is a committee of both study and action, action is more important than study,\u201d Hensarling said.\n\nFlores recently tasked his members to formulate the committee\u2019s priorities for the 114th Congress. They came back with policy items grouped into \u201cfive key themes\u201d: economic development, rebuilding national defense, addressing Washington\u2019s fiscal issues, rolling back the reach of the federal government, and protecting American values.\n\nThey listed repealing the Affordable Care Act as their top legislative priority. Flores said he secured a commitment from Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise that the House would vote on that by mid-February. But as with dozens of previous such House votes, repeal won\u2019t happen. Even if the new GOP-led Senate were to vote the same, President Barack Obama would surely defend his signature legislative accomplishment with a veto.\n\nFor Flores, getting committee members\u2019 other priorities a House vote won\u2019t be easy.\n\nThe group is filled with lawmakers who are more than willing to buck party leadership. And with a GOP majority in both chambers, they may be emboldened to demand legislation that\u2019s popular with staunch conservatives but politically impossible.\n\nFlores said his job is to represent the will of the group\u2019s members, regardless of the political landscape.\n\n\u201cIf there is an issue that the bulk of our membership is passionate about, my role is to do all I can to get our leadership to hear it and put it on the floor irrespective of three things: is it politically feasible, can the Senate pass it, or will the president sign it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while Flores\u2019 style is to build rapport and negotiate behind closed doors, he doesn\u2019t mind if his members take a more outspoken approach.\n\n\u201cYou need some people that are more deliberative in their approach to the deal, and then you need some of those that are out there keeping everything stirred up,\u201d he said.\n\nOf the 25 Republicans who did not vote for Boehner for House speaker this term, 18 are study committee members. An additional four are freshman who may yet join the group.\n\nMembers also accounted for 58 of the 67 Republican votes against the recent $1.1 trillion government funding measure that GOP leadership backed. Flores was one of them.\n\nRep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, said Flores\u2019 style should yield results.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got credibility with Scalise and McCarthy and Boehner. I think he intends to use that credibility in a positive fashion,\u201d Barton said.\n\nFlores, who is good friends with Scalise, said he wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cshill for leadership.\u201d But navigating between the interests of party leaders and study committee members can be tricky, Hensarling said.\n\n\u201cOccasionally there\u2019s the opportunity and imperative to try to move \u2026 the leadership in a rightward direction. That takes a lot of skill, a lot of leadership, a lot of aplomb,\u201d Hensarling said. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit more art than science to it.\u201d\n\nBut Flores\u2019 relationship with leadership may be one of the reasons that a group of study committee members plans to form their own group.\n\nThe National Journal reported that some group members, including Reps. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Justin Amash of Michigan, Raul Labrador of Idaho and Jim Jordan of Ohio, who once chaired the study committee, plan to form an invitation-only group to push the Republican conference even further to the right.\n\nSome viewed Flores as the \u201cleadership candidate\u201d in the contest among Flores, fellow Texan Rep. Louie Gohmert and Mulvaney. Labrador said after the vote that party leadership had \u201ctwisted arms\u201d to ensure Flores\u2019 victory. Flores brushed those claims aside.\n\nThe new group claimed that the study committee\u2019s size, which has ballooned in recent years, is another reason for the split, according to the National Journal. Some members want a more purely conservative group.\n\nFlores said that being the largest caucus in Congress is crucial to the group\u2019s effectiveness. It had about 170 members in the last Congress, and Flores predicted it will have \u201cnorth of 150\u201d for the 114th.\n\nBarton cautioned that splitting the GOP caucus could mean squandering a historic opportunity for the Republican agenda.\n\n\u201cIf we are unified we can actually get stuff to the president\u2019s desk, which we\u2019ve not been able to do recently because of the Democratically controlled Senate,\u201d Barton said. \u201cYou don\u2019t normally gain influence by splitting up. You gain it by coming together.\u201d\n\nIf Flores can hold his group together and win legislative victories, he might be in line for additional responsibilities.\n\nPast chairmen like Hensarling, Scalise and former Rep. Mike Pence have won party leadership posts after helming the study committee. And Pence is now the governor of Indiana.\n\nFlores insists he\u2019s not thinking about that now.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run for Congress to be part of leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the good of the American people.\u201d\n\nFollow Michael Marks on Twitter @michaelpmarks\n\nBACKGROUND: William H. \u201cBill\u201d Flores\n\nAge: 60\n\nBirthplace: Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo.\n\nEducation: Bachelor\u2019s degree, Texas A&M University, 1976; Master of Business Administration degree, Houston Baptist University, 1985\n\nCareer: 2011-present: U.S. House; 2005-09: president and CEO, Phoenix Exploration Co.; 2004-09: commissioner, Texas Real Estate Commission.
