Eight staff members were recognized by the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS) for completing the system's Leadership Development Program (LDP) during a ceremony on December 8. This selective program identifies up-and-coming staff members and provides them with training and resources to hone their leadership skills. LDP graduates include:

• Francisco Angulo, Scientific Officer, North Riverside

• Keyona Denton, Talent Business Partner, Chicago

• Denita Fobs, Nurse Coordinator, Chicago

• Heather Holberg, Enrollment & Retention Manager, Chicago

• Constance Johns, Tumor Registry Supervisor, Chicago

• Keith Marino, APN-CRNA, Chief Nurse Anesthesia, Lemont

• Nkiru Okolo, Nurse Coordinator, Matteson

• Linda Walker, Respiratory Therapy Supervisor, South Holland

"This program is an integral part of our system-wide patient experience initiative. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, many of our patients now have choice in where they can seek medical care. We want to earn the privilege of being their provider of choice. By lifting up some of our most promising team members, we hope to empower them to be agents of change as we continue to improve our patients' interactions with CCHHS," said Dr. Jay Shannon, CEO, CCHHS.

Over the past three months, LDP participants studied strategies and skills that can be utilized to improve patient experiences. Participants then developed projects to implement these approaches into everyday practice to create new processes that enhance patients' interactions with the health system. To date, 38 individuals have completed the program.
