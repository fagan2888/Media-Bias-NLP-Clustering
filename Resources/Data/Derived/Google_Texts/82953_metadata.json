The scheme called \u201cmarriage equality\u201d is not an end in itself, and never really has been. The LGBT agenda has spawned too many other disparate agendas hostile to the existence of marriage, making marriage \u201cunsustainable,\u201d if you will. By now we should be able to hear the growing drumbeat to abolish civil marriage, as well as to legalize polygamy and all manner of reproductive technologies.\n\nConsider also the breakneck speed at which the push for same sex marriage has been happening recently. The agenda\u2019s advocates have been very methodical in their organization, disciplined in their timing, flush with money, in control of all information outlets, including media, Hollywood, and academia. And perhaps most telling is the smearing of any dissenter in the public square, a stigma made de rigueur by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in his animus-soaked opinion that repealed the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen also how the Obama Administration\u2019s push for same sex marriage has occurred in lockstep with policies that are hostile to marriage, such as the severe marriage penalty written into Obamacare.\n\nActivist judges have taken their cues from Attorney General Eric Holder who used the DOMA repeal to proclaim open season on any state that recognizes marriage as an organic (i.e., heterosexual) union of one man and one woman. In their crosshairs are state constitutions, businesses, students, communities, churches, and all of those bogus \u201cconscience clauses\u201d that were written into same sex marriage legislation in order to sway wavering state legislators to vote \u201caye.\u201d\n\nThe tipping point came soon after certain big name conservatives and pundits swallowed the bait on same sex marriage. Folks like Michael Barone, John Bolton, George Will, S. E. Cupp, and David Blankenhorn have played a huge role in building momentum for this movement, which, as we will see, is blazing a trail to the abolition of state recognized marriage. And whether they know it or not, advocacy for same sex marriage is putting a lot of statist machinery into motion. Because once the state no longer has to recognize your marriage and family, the state no longer has to respect the existence of your marriage and family.\n\nWithout civil marriage, the family can no longer exist autonomously and serve as a wall of separation between the individual and the state. This has huge implications for the survival of freedom of association.\n\nThe notion of marriage equality was never about marriage or about equality. It\u2019s all about the wrapping paper. It\u2019s been packaged as an end in itself, but it is principally just a means to a deeper end. It is the means by which marriage extinction \u2013 the true target \u2014 can be achieved. If marriage and family are permitted to exist autonomously, power can be de-centralized in society. So the family has always been a thorn in the side of central planners and totalitarians. The connection between its abolition and the limitless growth of the state should be crystal clear. So anyone who has bought into this movement, or is tempted to do so, would want to step back and take a harder look.\n\nSix Indicators We\u2019re Headed Directly for Abolishing Civil Marriage We can sort out six developments that indicate we\u2019re on the fast track to abolishing civil marriage. They include: 1) The blueprint for abolishing family, developed by the founder of feminist legal theory, Martha Fineman; 2) support and advocacy of Fineman\u2019s model by facilitators and regulators in the Obama Administration; 3) the statements of prominent LGBT activists themselves, including their 2006 manifesto which in effect established the abolition of marriage as the goal of the same sex marriage movement; 4) the demographic shift to single rather than married households; 5) the growing shift in social climate from marriage equality to marriage hostility; and 6) the recent push to export the LGBT agenda globally, particularly targeting poor and developing nations of Africa.\n\n1) The Gender Theorist Model: Replace civil marriage with government-regulated contractual relationships\n\nCollectivist style parenting may still seem like the stuff of science fiction to a lot of folks, but the ground for it has softened a lot since Hillary Clinton\u2019s 1996 treatise It Takes a Village and American Federation of Teachers president Sandra Feldman\u2019s 1998 op-ed \u201cThe Childswap Society.\u201d We now have MSNBC anchor Melissa Harris-Perry declaring open war on traditional families by announcing \u201cWe have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.\u201d\n\nShe envisages that the State will fill the vacuum left by the abolition of family The abolition of marriage and family has been a longtime project of gender theorists. Among them is internationally renown feminist law theorist Martha Albertson Fineman whose 2004 book The Autonomy Myth argues strenuously for \u201cthe abolition of marriage as a legal category.\u201d Her treatise is breathtaking in its brazen approach to ending family autonomy and privacy.\n\nFineman advocates for a system that would unavoidably result in the regulation of personal relationships through legal contracts. \u201cContract,\u201d she writes \u201cis an appealing metaphor with which to consider social and political arrangements. It imagines autonomous adults\u201d hashing out the terms, etc. Yet she envisages that the State will fill the vacuum left by the abolition of family [emphasis added]:\n\n\u201c. . . in addition to contract rules, I anticipate that ameliorating doctrines would fill the void left by the abolition of this aspect of family law. In fact, it seems apparent to me that a lot more regulation (protection) would occur once interactions between individuals within families were removed from behind the veil of privacy that now shields them.\u201d\n\nFineman operates on the apparent assumption that family privacy serves no purpose other than to afford institutional protection for men behaving badly. Her prescription is sweeping: \u201cOnce the institutional protection [is] removed, behavior would be judged by standards established to regulate interactions among all members of society.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\nThere you have it. All of your social interactions judged by certain standards. Standards established by whom? The state. And lest our eyes glaze over at mention of it, we ought to think of the State for what it really is: a hierarchy of cliques, with one dominant clique at the top. (Think mean girls in charge of everything and everyone.)\n\nFineman replaces the word \u201cspouse\u201d with the term \u201csexual affiliate,\u201d because, she professes, what we think of as \u201cfamily\u201d should be defined by its function, not its form. In other words, only \u201ccaretaker-dependent relationships\u201d would be recognized in the sense that \u201cfamily\u201d is recognized today.\n\nSo the abolition of marriage, according to Fineman:\n\n\u201cwould mean that sexual affiliates (formerly labeled husband and wife) would be regulated by the terms of their individualized agreements, with no special rules governing fairness and no unique review or monitoring of the negotiation process.\u201d\n\nFeel better? Fineman also states approvingly that:\n\n\u201cif the family is defined functionally, focused on the caretaker-dependent relationship, the traditionally problematic interactions of sexual affiliates (formerly designated \u201cspouses\u201d) are not protected by notions of family privacy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, no interaction could be protected by \u201cnotions of family privacy\u201d in Fineman\u2019s model. She elaborated further and more recently on all of this in an October 2013 article in the Chicago-Kent Law Review.\n\n2) Friends in High Places promote Fineman\u2019s Model of State-Regulated Contracts\n\nCass Sunstein, who served as President Obama\u2019s regulatory czar from 2009 to 2012, has advocated strongly for the abolition of civil marriage and its replacement with contracts that would negotiate the terms of personal relationships.\n\nIn 2008 Sunstein published an article in the Cardozo Law Review arguing that there is no constitutional right to marry and suggesting that \u201cstates may abolish marriage without offending the Constitution.\u201d And an entire chapter of a popular book Sunstein co-authored with Richard Thaler in 2008 is devoted to arguing for the abolition of civil marriage. This is from Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.\n\n\u201cUnder our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government. . . . Under our approach, the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.*(*Footnote: We duck the question of whether civil unions can involve more than two people.)\u201d\n\nSunstein and Thaler dub their approach \u201clibertarian paternalism,\u201d an odd jargon which seems contrived to win over readers by evoking a strange juxtaposition of moderation and a heavy touch of the archaic.\n\nClearly, Sunstein has been laying the groundwork for the abolition of civil marriage. He purports that this would get the government out of a \u201clicensing scheme,\u201d but his specious phrasing is a fig leaf covering up the predictable effects of his approach: greater government regulation of personal relationships. His popular writing on the subject comes in the guise of \u201cprivatization\u201d of relationships \u2013 even as gender theorists like Fineman argue against America\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with privacy and individualism. But this is not a difficult circle to square. Thaler and Sunstein argue, pretty much in line with Fineman, that people ought to make use of contracts to define the terms of their relationships. And contracts invite \u2013 indeed, for Fineman, they demand \u2013 that the government function as an intimate partner in this legal m\u00e9nage a trois.\n\n3) LGBT Activists Say So Themselves: The Goal is to Abolish Marriage\n\n\u201cGay marriage is a lie,\u201d announced gay activist Masha Gessen in a panel discussion last year at the Sydney Writers\u2019 Festival. \u201cFighting for gay marriage generally involves lying about what we\u2019re going to do with marriage when we get there.\u201d [Applause.] \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that the institution of marriage should not exist.\u201d\n\nGessen was merely echoing a message from an LGBT manifesto of 2006 called Beyond Same Sex Marriage. The manifesto is a blatant rallying cry to bring about a post-marriage society, one in which there is no room for state-recognized marriage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that the institution of marriage should not exist.\u201d Ethics and Public Policy Institute scholar Stanley Kurtz wrote extensively about this document in two National Review articles, entitled The Confession and The Confession II. Kurtz noted that the intent of the sponsors of the manifesto \u2013 which as of 2006 had hundreds of prominent signatories, including Cornel West, Barbara Ehrenreich, Martha Fineman, and Gloria Steinem \u2013 was \u201cto dissolve marriage by extending the definition to every conceivable family type.\u201d\n\nSunstein needn\u2019t have \u201cducked the issue\u201d of more than two parties in a domestic contract because legalizing polygamy is central to the manifesto. And there can be no doubt that the legalization of polygamy would result in the abolition of all state-recognized marriage. Polygamy \u2014 repackaged in the now trendy term \u201cpolyamory\u201d \u2013 comes with an array of configurations too dizzying and with too many moving parts to be sustained as state-recognized marriage.\n\nDespite the existence of the manifesto, the official line of the LGBT community still seems to be that gay marriage is only about equal rights for couples who love one another. Their spokespersons have been disciplined \u2013 with a friendly media running cover for them \u2013 in maintaining the official line so as not to provoke a debate about the real agenda to abolish marriage.\n\nSupposedly conservative gay activists like Jonathan Rauch have also run cover and protected the timing of the agenda by claiming that the manifesto was merely a \u201cfringe\u201d of the LGBT movement. It\u2019s irrelevant whether or not Rauch really believes his own propaganda that gay marriage will somehow strengthen a marriage culture by bringing loving gay couples into it. The main effect of the Rauch meme is to accelerate the abolition of civil marriage by hastening a legal framework for genderless marriage that will pave the way for total abolition of civil marriage, and with it private family life.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the gloves are coming off and timing has entered a new phase. The push for polyamory has gone mainstream, right on schedule. Supportive puff pieces on it are popping up in places like Atlantic Monthly and the erstwhile women\u2019s magazine Redbook. In the end, polyamory serves only as a transitory way station between the legalization of same sex marriage and the abolition of civil marriage.\n\n4) Growing Dominance of Singles\n\nRecent decades have seen a sharp upsurge of unmarried households. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2012 there were 103 million unmarried people 18 and older. That\u2019s 44 percent of all US residents over 18. And 62 percent of those 103 million had never been married. Unmarried individuals represented 56 million households in 2012. The rise in singles has had an undeniably huge impact on the electorate. In the 2012 election 39 percent of the voters were unmarried, compared to 24 percent of the voters in the 1972 election.\n\nThe \u201cCommunication League for Unmarried Equality,\u201d is a coalition of singles\u2019 rights organizations which argues that government benefits for marriage \u2013 including tax breaks and survivor benefits in social security \u2014 amount to marital status discrimination. Its advocates argue that civil marriage unjustly awards financial, social, and cultural benefits to married individuals at the expense of unmarried individuals who end up subsidizing marriage and children, without compensation. In addition, proponents of \u201cunmarried equality\u201d insist that the existence of these privileges serve to perpetuate prejudices and stereotypes about singles that inflict harm on them. (Sounds like a Supreme Court case brewing.)\n\nBella DePaulo spearheaded the movement as a blogger and author of Singled Out and Singlism: What it is, Why it Matters and How to Stop It.\u201d According to DePaulo, the discrimination she calls \u201csinglism\u201d may seem more subtle than racism or sexism, but is just as damaging. She has tip-toed to the edge of advocating for the abolition of marriage, with a professor of feminist philosophy Elizabeth Blake, by saying that marriage should be \u201cminimized\u201d (for now) so that singles have the same benefits as married individuals. Which, naturally, means abolishing marriage.\n\n\u201cSinglism\u201d itself is not yet considered a form of illegal discrimination. But DePaulo believes it should be:\n\n\u201cBecause singlism is built right into American laws, it is not possible to be single and not be a target of discrimination. If you have followed the marriage equality debate, then you probably know that there are more than 1,000 federal laws that benefit or protect only those people who are legally married. Even if same-sex marriage becomes legal throughout the land, all those people who are single \u2014 whether gay or straight or any other status \u2014 will still remain second class citizens.\u201d\n\n5) Morphing of the Memes \u2013 from Marriage Equality to Marriage Ambivalence to Marriage Hostility\n\n\u201cWhy would anyone get married?\u201d That\u2019s a quote from Nancy Pelosi in a Valentine\u2019s Day interview last month, downplaying the importance of marriage. While some might say she\u2019s simply courting the singles demographic, she\u2019s mostly reinforcing and echoing a narrative that marriage is irrelevant or perhaps even harmful. She is contributing to the drumbeat to abolish civil marriage.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget Julia, the mascot of Obama\u2019s reelection campaign who serves as a Stepford wife to the State. Major cultural forces \u2013 the media, academia, and Hollywood \u2013 have already adopted an increasingly hostile view of marriage. We can see it in the use of the term \u201cgreedy marrieds\u201d from a recent New York Times feature \u201cThe Changing American Family\u201c: \u201cSingle people live alone and proudly consider themselves families of one \u2014 more generous and civic-minded than \u2018greedy marrieds.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd look at NBC Sports in its coverage Olympic gold medalist skier David Wise. It described him as living an \u201calternative lifestyle\u201d because he happened to be young and married with children. The clear inference was that he was abnormal.\n\nThe promotion and glorification of single parenting which got its start with the Murphy Brown TV series of the 1990s has gone into hyperdrive now. Check out online services such as Modamily, that matches people with \u201cparenting partners,\u201d with whom they can draw up a contract, arrange for artificial reproductive technologies, and forgo marriage.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Julia, the mascot of Obama\u2019s reelection campaign who serves, with more than a bit of irony, as a Stepford wife to the State. The narrative was clearly hostile to the idea of marriage and supportive of policies to abolish it.\n\n6) LGBT Push for Same Sex Marriage in Developing Countries\n\nThe rush by LGBT activists and the Obama administration to lift bans on gay marriage in all 50 states is peculiarly fast and furious. Oddly so for a movement that seems to be gaining steam and social compliance. A reasonable question would be: What\u2019s the rush if things are going so swimmingly your way? The only answer seems to be one of fragile timing.\n\nThe sudden LGBT push globally, especially in Africa, should give us pause as well. Why the abrupt shove into poor countries, threatening to cut off aid unless they comply with such a massive cultural shift and adopt the Western LGBT agenda? Why the laser focus on Uganda and Malawi instead of places like Iran where abuses of homosexuals are likely just as common?\n\nWe are witnessing a major strategy to export gay marriage \u2013 and all it entails for the abolition of marriage \u2014 worldwide. President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have made an example of Uganda by threatening to cut off its aid over the existence of its anti-sodomy laws. Other developing nations are expected to take note and fall into line, creating a cascade effect until any other nation who resists will feel the noose tightening.\n\nWe might reasonably ask why this particular agenda is getting so much attention while the world goes to hell in a hand basket. Syria is overrun with vicious terrorist gangs at least as bad as its president. Russia is flexing its muscles, having just invaded the Ukraine and Crimea. Christians are being exterminated in record numbers throughout the Middle East. We\u2019re looking at nuclear weapons in Iran. There\u2019s a nuclear threat from North Korea, which not only starves its own people but is run by a guy who, it was said, feeds his political enemies to starving dogs. And yet President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have been spending special quality time focusing on the LGBT agenda in in the poor countries of Africa?\n\nClearly the Western LGBT agenda represents a new brand of cultural imperialism that is not content to shape life at home, but intends to propagate itself \u2013 and all it entails \u2013 worldwide.\n\nEnding Marriage Leads To A Centralized All Powerful State\n\nThe hard push for marriage equality was never about marriage. Neither was it about equality. It\u2019s a convenient vehicle to abolish civil marriage, whether to rid the world of paternalism, evade responsibility for children, \u201cprivatize\u201d relationships, or whatever. Abolishing marriage strips the family of its autonomy by placing it much more directly under the regulating control of the state.\n\nOnce the state no longer has to recognize the marriage relationship and its presumption of privilege and privacy, we all become atomized individuals in the eyes of the state, officially strangers to one another. We lose the space \u2013 the buffer zone \u2013 that the institution of the natural, organic family previously gave us and that forced the state to keep its distance.\n\nIsn\u2019t it ironic that feminists would replace the \u201cpaternalism\u201d of marriage (what happened to strong women?) with the new paternalism of state regulation of personal relationships? Isn\u2019t it ironic that singles in this scheme of things simply end up marrying the state?\n\nAt some point, we must conclude that freedom of association has its source in state acceptance of the core family as the primary buffer zone between the individual and the state. There is no escaping this fact, no matter a particular generation\u2019s attitude or public opinion polling, or advances in medical technology, or whatever else comes our way.\n\n\n\nMarriage Is The Template For Freedom Of Association\n\nWithout state recognition of \u2013 and respect for \u2013 marriage, can freedom of association survive? How so? On what basis?\n\nCivil marriage provides the entire basis for presuming the rights and responsibilities of biological parents to raise their own children. It also assumes the right of spouses to refuse to testify against one another in court. It presumes survivorship \u2013 in guardianship of children as well as inheritance of property. If we abolish civil marriage, these will no longer be rights by default, but rights to be distributed at the pleasure of a bureaucratic state.\n\nWhen a couple enters into a civil marriage, they are not inviting the government into their relationship, but rather putting the government on notice that they are a family unit. It\u2019s the couple \u2013 not the state \u2013 that\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat.Otherwise, they needn\u2019t marry. Otherwise, central planners wouldn\u2019t be so intent on abolishing marriage as a private and autonomous association from which the state must keep its distance, unless one partner wishes to exit by divorce.\n\nChildren \u2013 i.e., all of us born into a family \u2013 inherit that presumption of autonomy and broadcast it into society. We do so whether or not we ever get married ourselves. The presumption of family autonomy and privacy informs our right to freely associate with others \u2013 through romances, friendships, business contracts, and so on. It would be catastrophic to freedom if we threw it away.\n\nState recognition of this autonomy cannot exist without state recognition of marriage. In fact, traditional marriage \u2014 just like traditional oxygen if you will \u2013 helps all of society breathe more freely.\n\nIf civil marriage is abolished, you can say hello to the government at your bedroom door because that comfortable little meme about \u201cgetting the state out of the marriage business\u201d will have flown out your bedroom window while you were sleeping.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 09 Apr 2014 07:48:27 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Whether proponents know it or not, advocacy for same sex marriage is putting a lot of statist machinery into motion.", "title": "Bait And Switch: How Same Sex Marriage Ends Family Autonomy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/marriage.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-04-16T07:48:41+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/04/09/bait-and-switch-how-same-sex-marriage-ends-marriage-and-family-autonomy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Whether proponents know it or not, advocacy for same sex marriage is putting a lot of statist machinery into motion.", "creator": "@Stella_Morabito", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/marriage.jpg"}, "title": "Bait And Switch: How Same Sex Marriage Ends Family Autonomy", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "The Sexes", "tag": "Barbara Ehrenreich,Bella DePaulo,Beyond Same Sex Marriage,Cass Sunstein,Communication League for Unmarried Equality,Cornel West,Gloria Steinem,Jonathan Rauch,LGBT,Life of Julia,marriage penalty,Martha Fineman,Masha Gessen,Melissa Harris-Perry,Nancy Pelosi,Nudge,polygamy,Richard Thaler,Same-sex marriage,singlism,Stanley Kurtz,The Autonomy Myth", "published_time": "2014-04-09T07:48:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-16T07:48:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Whether proponents know it or not, advocacy for same sex marriage is putting a lot of statist machinery into motion."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde947\"", "article_summary": "Six Indicators We\u2019re Headed Directly for Abolishing Civil Marriage We can sort out six developments that indicate we\u2019re on the fast track to abolishing civil marriage.\nAbolishing all civil marriage is the primary goal of the elites who have been pushing same sex marriage.\nEnding Marriage Leads To A Centralized All Powerful StateThe hard push for marriage equality was never about marriage.\nWe\u2019ve seen also how the Obama Administration\u2019s push for same sex marriage has occurred in lockstep with policies that are hostile to marriage, such as the severe marriage penalty written into Obamacare.\nThe notion of marriage equality was never about marriage or about equality."}
