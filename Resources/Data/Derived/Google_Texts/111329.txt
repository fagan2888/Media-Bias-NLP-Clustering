Quarterback Jim Kelly #12 of the University of Miami Hurricanes passing during a game against the Penn State Nittany Lions in November 1981 in Miami, Florida.

The Miami Hurricanes are paying homage to Jim Kelly's fight against cancer.

The Hurricanes are posting a banner inside Sun Life Stadium this season bearing an image of Kelly and the words "We Are KellyTough." The banner is part of the signage ringing the lower deck of the stadium at Miami home games.

Kelly was informed earlier this week that he no longer shows any signs of having sinus cancer, and the phrase "KellyTough" became popular on social media as the former quarterback for the Hurricanes and Buffalo Bills fought the disease.

Kelly played for Miami from 1979-82 and is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as well as the Hurricanes' Hall of Fame.
