If states simply make it too hard for women to get an abortion \u2014 whether that\u2019s because there aren\u2019t any nearby clinics, or because the procedure is too expensive, or because it\u2019s too difficult to wade through all the red tape \u2014 then it won\u2019t be necessary to enact an actual ban that directly challenges Roe v. Wade.\n\nAbortion opponents have been extremely successful at this incremental strategy, particularly because some of these abortion restrictions don\u2019t appear to pose a threat on the surface. For instance, the harsh regulations on abortion providers that are forcing clinics across the country to close their doors don\u2019t immediately appear to be unreasonable, since they\u2019re couched in terms of patient safety. And one of the next big fights over reproductive rights, insurance coverage for abortion, is similarly deceptive.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps understandable, considering the fact that the insurance industry confuses most Americans. Many people may not pay attention to the services that are covered in their plan, or understand why that has anything to do with abortion rights. But this has actually become a hugely important battleground for reproductive justice.\n\nThanks to the federal Hyde Amendment, the policy that prevents low-income women from using their Medicaid coverage to help pay for the cost of an abortion, insurance coverage for abortion has been an issue for decades. Since poorer women already struggle to afford abortion, the Hyde Amendment is a particularly insidious method of cutting off millions of women\u2019s access to health care. And over the past several years, the issue has spread beyond Medicaid. The federal health law actually provided an opening for abortion opponents to impose further restrictions on abortion coverage in the new state-level marketplaces. Some states have gone a step further and enacted sweeping restrictions in the private market.\n\nNow, according to a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), 34 states have some kind of limit on which insurance plans are allowed to cover abortion care:\n\nCREDIT: Kaiser Familly Foundation\n\nAnti-Obamacare politicians sometimes claim that the health law represents an expansion of abortion coverage. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In fact, the health law maintains the artificial divide between abortion care and the rest of women\u2019s reproductive health services. By KFF\u2019s estimations, about half of the U.S. women of reproductive age who are gaining insurance under Obamacare won\u2019t have access to abortion coverage for elective procedures.\n\n\u201cThese coverage limitations are occurring at a time when many states are taking other actions to curtail access to abortion through multiple fronts,\u201d KFF\u2019s report notes, explaining that the combination of these anti-choice policies \u201cwill have the expected result of limiting access to and the availability of abortion services in some states.\u201d\n\nMaureen Shaw, the editor-in-chief of the women\u2019s rights and issues site sherights.com, echoed that sentiment. \u201cThese coverage limitations, especially when combined with the current political maelstrom against abortion rights, are very dangerous. Poor and low-income women will shoulder the brunt of these restrictions and their health will suffer,\u201d Shaw told ThinkProgress. \u201cBy targeting abortion care, politicians are sending a clear message that women do not deserve comprehensive health coverage.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, anti-choice lawmakers aren\u2019t satisfied. Congressional Republicans continue to push for even more restrictions on insurance coverage for abortion. Last week, a House Judiciary Committee advanced HR 7, a sweeping measure that ultimately threatens to discourage abortion coverage in both the private and public insurance markets. That measure would dramatically reshape KFF\u2019s map by outlawing abortion coverage in every single state\u2019s insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe status quo is that abortion has been regularly covered \u2014 not called out, not controversial \u2014 as part of general medical coverage in private health insurance,\u201d Susan Wood, an associate professor of health policy at George Washington University and one of the individuals who testified against the proposed legislation, told ThinkProgress in an earlier interview. \u201cHR 7 could really change the nature of the insurance market such that ultimately it becomes the norm not to cover abortion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, the varying restrictions on abortion coverage have created a confusing environment, and many women who have insurance simply assume that their plan must not cover abortion. If abortion opponents have their way, that assumption will eventually become a reality.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Insurance coverage for abortion is gradually shrinking -- and anti-choice lawmakers hope to narrow it even further.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Insurance coverage for abortion is gradually shrinking -- and anti-choice lawmakers hope to narrow it even further.", "title": "The Next Battleground For Reproductive Rights: Maintaining Insurance Coverage For Abortion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/21/3187161/abortion-insurance-coverage/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/abortion.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Insurance coverage for abortion is gradually shrinking -- and anti-choice lawmakers hope to narrow it even further.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/abortion-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Next Battleground For Reproductive Rights: Maintaining Insurance Coverage For Abortion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/abortion.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/abortion.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-21T14:38:07+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca208\"", "article_summary": "And one of the next big fights over reproductive rights, insurance coverage for abortion, is similarly deceptive.\nThat measure would dramatically reshape KFF\u2019s map by outlawing abortion coverage in every single state\u2019s insurance marketplace.\nAbortion opponents have been extremely successful at this incremental strategy, particularly because some of these abortion restrictions don\u2019t appear to pose a threat on the surface.\nThanks to the federal Hyde Amendment, the policy that prevents low-income women from using their Medicaid coverage to help pay for the cost of an abortion, insurance coverage for abortion has been an issue for decades.\n\u201cThese coverage limitations, especially when combined with the current political maelstrom against abortion rights, are very dangerous."}
