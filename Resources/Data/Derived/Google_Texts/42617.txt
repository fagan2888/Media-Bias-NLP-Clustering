The Bayonne City Council voted unanimously Wednesday night to put the city's contract for ambulance services out to bid, with plans in place to opt out of the existing five-year contract with McCabe Ambulance by the end of the year.

The decision by Bayonne council members comes less than two months after both CarePoint Health, whose Hudson County hospitals own a majority share of McCabe Ambulance, and Jersey City Medical Center-Barnabas Health put in bids to provide ambulance services at no cost to Jersey City.

"Our taxpayers are paying over $650,000 a year, when McCabe Ambulance gave a proposal to Jersey City for zero," City Council President Sharon Nadrowski told The Jersey Journal yesterday. "If that's the trend, and they're going to provide services for free, then we would expect a comparable offer."

For the 2015 fiscal year, Bayonne is paying McCabe more than $815,000.

"We have a deficit, so we need to save any money we can," she added.

Bayonne's existing contract with McCabe Ambulance runs from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016, but includes an "out clause" that allows city officials to unilaterally end the contract upon 30 days written notice at its sole discretion.

According to a copy of the contract released to The Jersey Journal, the payment schedule to McCabe Ambulance is as follows: Year 1 (July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012), $704,281; Year 2 (July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013), $739,496; Year 3 (July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014), $776,470; Year Four (July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015), $815,294; Year Five (July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016), $856,059.

"The hope is that the winning bid will be at zero dollars. The city can't do better than zero dollars," city business administrator Joe DeMarco said Wednesday night.

"But that would translate to over $1.2 million in savings over the next two years."

City officials said that they had been in talks with CarePoint Health and McCabe Ambulance before making their decision, and that McCabe Ambulance will be rebidding for the contract, which Mickey McCabe confirmed yesterday.

When asked about the council's decision, McCabe was unperturbed about the company's current contract with Bayonne ending earlier than scheduled.

"Now with Obamacare and with hospital affiliations, I'm in a much stronger position to say to the city 'Look, I no longer need your subsidy,'" he said. "The city has some financial concerns, and McCabe wants to help them with that."

"I'm always concerned that other people will bid," McCabe went on to say.

"However, I'm also very comfortable in the history of our service to the citizens and the community. ... There is no other company that can provide anything near what we provide to the citizens and the community."

He said McCabe Ambulance has served Bayonne for 41 years, and that it has won public bids for the city's ambulance services since 1982, when public bidding for the services was first introduced.

If McCabe Ambulance were to win this year's bid and end up offering ambulance services to Bayonne for free, no one working for the company would lose their jobs due to a drop in revenue, McCabe said.

"Everyone here would maintain their positions," he said. "There would be no change in operations whatsoever."

When contacted yesterday, JCMC-Barnabas Health spokesman Mark Rabson said the hospital will wait for Bayonne to issue a request for proposals, at which point it will consider whether to submit a bid.

"Now that the Bayonne City Council has recommended re-bidding the EMS contract we will await release of the RFP to evaluate whether we will extend the same quality emergency medical services and dispatch to the residents and businesses of Bayonne that we have taken pride to provide to the residents of Jersey City for the last 130 years," he said.

DeMarco said Bayonne is looking for a 3- to 5-year contract for ambulance services to take effect starting on Jan. 1, 2015.
