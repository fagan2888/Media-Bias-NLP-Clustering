We never should be in this situation,\" Sen. Susan Collins told CNN. \"But I do believe there's going to be a resolution this week.\" Sen. Charles Schumer told CBS News he\u2019s \u201ccautiously hopeful.\u201d But Reid and McConnell were still at an impasse earl Sunday afternoon, according to Politico. The two main sticking points? Government funding levels and the length of the debt ceiling increase.\n\nNow that the two sides are negotiating funding the government at least until the end of January, Republicans want to be sure to lock in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester while Democrats want to undo some of those cuts, explains ABC News. Republicans see this as a nonstarter, accusing Democrats of moving the goal posts. \u201cI agree that Republicans started with the overreach, but now Democrats are one tick too cute,\u201d Sen. Bob Corker told Fox News. \u201cThey are now overreaching.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\"If you break the spending caps, you're not going to get any Republicans in the Senate,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said on ABC News.\n\nBut what about Obamacare? Isn\u2019t that what the whole shutdown was about anyway? Seems Republicans have recognized that\u2019s a losing battle. Graham acknowledged that delaying or defunding Obamacare was \u201cnot a realistic possibility now.\u201d Indeed, Graham suggests Republicans would have been able to more effectively speak up against Obamacare if the government shutdown hadn\u2019t happened at all. \u201cWhat breaks my heart is for the last 12 days, you have had a complete meltdown of the portal called Obamacare; the whole system is just not working. And we're overshadowing how badly Obamacare has been rolled out,\u201d he said, according to NBC News.\n\nOver at Business Insider, Joe Weisenthal says that the debate over spending is \u201ca little bit of evidence showing how much the government shutdown has blown up in the GOP's face.\u201d Republicans now \u201care just fighting to keep in place current spending levels, which they would have had automatically had they agreed to a clean continuing resolution right off the bat and never shut down the government.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Oct. 12 at 4:30 p.m.: Looks like it\u2019s up to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell now. The two leaders launched a new series of talks to re-open the federal government and avoid a U.S. default. \u201cThe fact that the two leaders have taken over negotiations suggests an intensifying desire in both parties to end the fiscal impasse,\u201d notes the Washington Post. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re close to an agreement. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet\u201d to bring the two sides closer together, Reid said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOptimism earlier in the day that a plan led by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine could lead to an agreement were dashed when Democrats rejected the plan. Still, Collins said her plan could serve as a blueprint for a bipartisan deal. Reid said Democrats should not have to make concessions on Obamacare. They also rejected the length of the debt-limit increase saying it should last longer than January 31, notes USA Today. Most importantly though, Republicans want to keep automatic spending cuts known as the sequester in place. McConnell, however, was eager to defend the sequester, saying Republicans will not compromise on that unless there are equivalent cuts in entitlement programs. Still, the Senate leaders said they\u2019re concerned about how the market could react Monday if there is no deal over the weekend, reports the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\nFor now, House Republicans acknowledged \u201cthey had temporarily been reduced to virtual bystander status,\u201d points out the Associated Press. Some Republican lawmakers were quick to say they still want any agreement to contain Obamacare concessions. Still, some Democrats expressed hope the House GOP would eventually go along with a Senate plan, assuming one emerges, of course.\n\nOriginal post, Oct. 12 at 11:43 a.m.: House Speaker John Boehner did not mince words early Saturday morning, telling House Republicans at a closed-door meeting that he had been unable to reach a deal with President Obama to reopen the government and increase the debt ceiling. Boehner reportedly told lawmakers negotiations had ended without an agreement, according to the Hill. \"There is no deal,\" Boehner reportedly told Republican lawmakers, \"no negotiations going on.\"\n\n\n\nNow, on the 12th day of the shutdown, all eyes turn to the Senate, where a plan is in the works that could open the government and raise the debt limit. Three Senate Republicans led by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine are spearheading the proposal that would delay the medical device tax for two years and create a provision to make sure only those eligible receive subsidies in the insurance exchanges, reports the Hill. To make up for the lost revenue, the proposal would change the way pensions are calculated, notes Politico. The deal would extend government funding for six months at the current leveland raise the debt ceiling until January 31, according to Reuters.\n\nLawmakers are working against the clock as the Treasury has warned the debt limit must be increased before Thursday to avoid the first-ever U.S. debt default. House Republicans, so far at least, aren\u2019t too optimistic. \u201cThe deal that we understand they\u2019re offering would be very problematic,\u201d Rep. John Fleming said Saturday morning, according to the Post, adding that the House GOP is \u201cmore unified now than ever before.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Senate Talks Deadlocked Over Spending", "sailthru.author": "Daniel Politi", "description": "Update: There was a bit of optimism in the Sunday talk shows from senators who said that talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Min ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Update: There was a bit of optimism in the Sunday talk shows from senators who said that talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Min ...", "title": "Senate Talks Deadlocked Over Spending", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/12/government_shutdown_and_debt_ceiling_all_eyes_on_plan_proposed_by_sen_susan.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/12/government_shutdown_and_debt_ceiling_all_eyes_on_plan_proposed_by_sen_susan/184222604.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Update: There was a bit of optimism in the Sunday talk shows from senators who said that talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Min ...", "title": "Senate Talks Deadlocked Over Spending", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/12/government_shutdown_and_debt_ceiling_all_eyes_on_plan_proposed_by_sen_susan.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/12/government_shutdown_and_debt_ceiling_all_eyes_on_plan_proposed_by_sen_susan/184222604.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@dpoliti", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-13T13:15:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Senate Talks Deadlocked Over Spending", "sailthru.headline": "Senate Talks Deadlocked Over Spending, GOP Appears to Give Up on Obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Senate Talks Deadlocked Over Spending\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/12/government_shutdown_and_debt_ceiling_all_eyes_on_plan_proposed_by_sen_susan.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/12/government_shutdown_and_debt_ceiling_all_eyes_on_plan_proposed_by_sen_susan/184222604.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"227131012001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-13T13:15:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"briefing\",\n  \"author\": \"Daniel Politi\",\n  \"tags\": []\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "All Eyes on Senate After Negotiations Between House GOP and White House Collapse", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "shutdown, debt ceiling, US default, susan collins", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "shutdown, debt ceiling, US default, susan collins", "sailthru.description": "Update: There was a bit of optimism in the Sunday talk shows from senators who said that talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Min ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2013/10/12/government_shutdown_and_debt_ceiling_all_eyes_on_plan_proposed_by_sen_susan/184222604.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey are now overreaching.\u201dAdvertisement\"If you break the spending caps, you're not going to get any Republicans in the Senate,\" Sen.
