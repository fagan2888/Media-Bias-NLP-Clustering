Insurers have promised refunds, but he hasn\u2019t received one yet.\n\nThe Anthem Blue Cross headquarters in Woodland Hills, Calif. Pharmacist Kevin Kingma says the insurer rolled him into a new plan and deducted money from his bank account without his approval, a problem hundreds of consumers say they're having. (David McNew/Getty Images)\n\nThanks to a subsidy, Kingma\u2019s monthly premium went down, from about $300 to $175, and his benefits improved.\n\nWhen California pharmacist Kevin Kingma received a letter last fall notifying him that his high-deductible health plan was being canceled because of the Affordable Care Act, he logged into his state\u2019s health insurance exchange and chose another plan beginning Jan. 1.\n\nBut this month, Kingma logged into his bank\u2019s website and saw that his old insurer, Anthem Blue Cross, had deducted $587.40 from his account and had enrolled him in another of its insurance products for this year -- he says without permission.\n\nHundreds of other consumers are caught in the same predicament, insurers acknowledge. And the California Department of Insurance said it is exploring whether any laws were broken when insurance companies withdrew money from consumers\u2019 accounts for plans they didn\u2019t select.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened to Kingma and others: When they received letters last fall, they were informed that their plans had been canceled. But within the letter, it also said that if they did nothing, they would be switched over to a different plan and if they had set up their payment to autodraft from their account, it would continue to do so.\n\nKingma said he didn\u2019t read the whole letter, just enough of it to know his old plan was being canceled.\n\nOnce he noticed the withdrawals from his account this month, Kingma said he tried calling Anthem\u2019s customer service hotline but couldn\u2019t reach anyone because of \u201chigh call volume.\u201d Dozens of consumers have reported long phone waits trying to reach Anthem.\n\nKingma then repeatedly faxed and contacted the insurer through its website. An Anthem representative first told him that he may only receive reimbursement for about half of January, until the date he actually canceled the new policy. Since then, it appears the insurer canceled his policy at the end of 2013. But as of Friday afternoon, it hadn\u2019t refunded Kingma\u2019s money, he said.\n\n\u201cI and a number of other former Anthem policy holders are stuck in Anthem's Kafkaesque nightmare as part of healthcare reform,\u201d Kingma, 57, wrote to me in an email.\n\nDarrel Ng, a spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross, said in an email that insurers across California had moved members from canceled plans to new ones that comply with the law \u201cand that transition retained their payment preference.\n\n\u201cIn cases where members neglected to inform insurers that they had selected a new plan or informed insurers too late that they had selected a new plan, members are receiving a full refund for any amount paid.\u201d\n\nKaiser Permanente spokesman Chris Stenrud confirmed that his insurer has also found cases similar to Kingma\u2019s.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, about 500 of our existing members in California who had automatic payment set up for their current plans were inadvertently charged before our systems recognized their enrollment in new plans through Covered California,\u201d the state\u2019s exchange, he wrote in an email. \u201cWe have identified the affected members and are in the process of contacting them to make them aware of the mistake, and of course, our commitment to refund the extra charge.\n\n\u201cWe take this seriously, and want to assure our members that we will make them whole,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThese actions may not fully satisfy the California Department of Insurance. Janice Rocco, deputy commissioner for health policy and reform, wrote in an email that insurers have cooperated with her agency and refunded premiums when questions arose, so \u201cwe hadn\u2019t been focused on what the potential legal violations might be.\u201d\n\nShe said insurers may have violated the law in two ways by deducting funds from customers\u2019 bank accounts electronically. \u201cMoving a policyholder from one product to another would be considered a \u2018material change\u2019 that would trigger a requirement in law to provide information about how to cancel the electronic funds transfer agreement. We did not see any notice of how to cancel an electronic transfer of funds in the policy cancellation notices, so there may be some violations of law in this regard.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, Rocco said, some of the new products used by two health insurers were technically \u201csold by one of the insurer\u2019s affiliated companies with which that policyholder had no prior electronic funds transfer agreement, so that might be another area of potential legal violations,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt isn\u2019t known whether similar complaints have been lodged outside of California. But insurers in a number of states sent consumers letters saying they would be moved to new plans unless they said otherwise. (This letter was posted online by Politifact.) The Associated Press reported last month that at least 4.7 million people were told their old health plans were going away because they didn\u2019t meet the coverage standards of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers have taken to Twitter to voice their frustration. Here\u2019s a sampling of their tweets (ProPublica has not verified their claims):\n\n@AnthemPR_CA I've been on the phone for 2.5 hours to cancel part of a plan I never purchased. Can you please help cancel it? \u2014 gregmachlin (@gregmachlin) January 24, 2014\n\n@AnthemPR_CA It looks like you had charged me for a cancelled plan, please refund. \u2014 mortanyong (@mortanyong) January 18, 2014\n\n@AnthemPR_CA Been trying to cancel my policy for a month. You stole money from my bank acct. Can't get anyone to help. What do I have to do? \u2014 Kathi Kruse (@kathikruse) January 20, 2014\n\nKingma said the whole situation has left him frustrated.\n\n\u201cNo business conducts fair business that way,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIn December, they should be telling customers, this is the plan you will be converted into, this is the cost. I don\u2019t put anything past large corporations.\u201d\n\nHas your insurance been canceled? Have you tried signing up for coverage through the new exchanges?
