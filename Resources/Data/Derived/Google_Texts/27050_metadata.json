We are honored to serve as the host for an evening of libations, sandwiches, and spirited debate in the style of 18th century patriots in pubs before the founding of this great country.\n\nTonight was the latest edition with the question on the table: \u201cResolved: Act! If not us, whom? If not now, when?\u201d\n\nPerhaps the wording of the question was too open-ended \u2014 as one speaker argued in the negative for the evening\u2019s resolution \u2014 but I argued vigorously against that point, and very much in the positive on the question (which carried the vote in the end, by the way). Now is the time to act. And if not we few citizens who cherish our liberty, then whom?\n\nOur liberties are under constant assault in ways big and small from a modern American Leviathan James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams would not recognize. They\u2019d be horrified, as were most of the attendees at tonight\u2019s Tavern Debate, that the federal government has usurped enough authority over the years to now consider itself the ultimate Masters of Our Universe. That our Masters are proving incompetent \u2014 especially with Obamacare \u2014 is not a bug in the plans of our supposed masters, but an inevitable feature. Tyranny, soft or hard, does not worry itself with the details. Control and forced obedience is what matters \u2014 and exactly what our Founders well understood and hoped to spare us from experiencing.\n\nThe Leviathan in the modern democratic state counts on us to simply throw up our hands and submit. Act to resist? How? We have elections and the people have spoken. Besides, who am I, as an individual, in the larger scheme of things? I can\u2019t stop Obamacare by myself. I\u2019ll just try to buck up and plug along. That\u2019s the American Way!\n\nNo. I refuse to submit \u2014 especially when it comes to the Obamacare Disaster \u2014 and I pray that I won\u2019t be alone.\n\nMy health insurance hasn\u2019t been canceled yet, but I expect it will be next year under the current state of the law. When that happens, I will seek a doctor who will accept chickens as payment before I sign up at Heatlthcare.gov. I will seek \u201cconcierge medical service\u201d \u2014 which will be the buzz words of 2014 \u2014 and pay what I can afford to escape the forced-choice of Obamacare before I enter all my personal information into the hacker\u2019s paradise that is Healthcare.gov. I\u2019ll pay what our Masters sometimes call \u201cfines\u201d and sometimes call \u201ctaxes\u201d (as it suits them) in lieu of submitting my health care to their will for the \u201ccommon good,\u201d but not mine.\n\nIt is the duty of a free citizen to take all legal recourse to avoid submission to a government that passes laws to control your activity, but then decides to not follow them when it becomes inconvenient. What justice is there in a law that can be made up as it goes along by the president and his bureaucrats \u2014 with statutory deadlines arbitrarily postponed by the executive for the political expediency of his party, and waivers for unions that support him? If the chief executive can defy the law, why can\u2019t I? Why can\u2019t you?\n\nAsking such questions is exactly what I did at the Tavern Debate, and what all citizens who want to restore the republic bestowed upon us must also ask themselves. What are you willing to do \u2014 in ways large and small \u2014 to preserve the rule of law, and not of men? I\u2019m willing to go \u2026 Off. The. Grid.\n\nEarlier today, the Democratic leader of the U.S. Senate invoked the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d changing the rules of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Deliberative Body\u201d to ensure less deliberation on the desires of the Masters, and more rules on the rest of us. But a still-free people also has a \u201cnuclear option\u201d available: Refuse to submit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/11/refuse-to-submit-a-federalist-society-debate-obamacare-and-the-nuclear-option/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/coffeehousetaverndebate.jpeg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Refuse to Submit: A Federalist Society Debate, Obamacare, and the Nuclear Option"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf55d\"", "article_summary": "The Chicago Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society has a \u201cTavern Debate\u201d every third Thursday of every odd-numbered month in the library of The Heartland Institute.\nI refuse to submit \u2014 especially when it comes to the Obamacare Disaster \u2014 and I pray that I won\u2019t be alone.\nAsking such questions is exactly what I did at the Tavern Debate, and what all citizens who want to restore the republic bestowed upon us must also ask themselves.\nBut a still-free people also has a \u201cnuclear option\u201d available: Refuse to submit.\nThey\u2019d be horrified, as were most of the attendees at tonight\u2019s Tavern Debate, that the federal government has usurped enough authority over the years to now consider itself the ultimate Masters of Our Universe."}
