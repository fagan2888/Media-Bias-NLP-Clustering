And, it turns out, a surprising amount of it can be accessed using your discarded airplane boarding pass.\n\nAs Brian Krebs just detailed at Krebs on Security, the information stored in a boarding pass barcode could make it surprisingly simple for an interested party to wreak some havoc for the ticketed passenger.\n\nA Krebs reader found that reading the barcode using a decoding website revealed the passenger\u2019s name, frequent flyer number, record locator and other personal information.\n\nRelated: Why Flying Is Getting Even More Miserable\n\nUsing that information, the reader could then access the passenger\u2019s account on the Lufthansa airline website. He or she could then find the passenger\u2019s phone number, email address and the name of the person who booked the flight. Most troubling is that someone intent on mischief could view any of your future travel itineraries and make changes to them \u2014 including canceling a flight or changing your seat. The information accessible through the account could be used, along with other personal details, to reset the PIN number for the passenger\u2019s Star Alliance frequent flyer account.\n\nMuch of the data stored in the barcode is more readily available on the boarding pass itself \u2014 your name, flight number and the like are all printed clearly for anyone to see. And that\u2019s generally harmless. The point Krebs makes, though, is that \u201cSome airlines treat frequent flyer codes as semi-secret, and redact them from boarding passes and email communications, but leave them in plaintext on the barcode.\u201d\n\nThat suggests two takeaways for security-minded travelers: First, if you don\u2019t want anyone to see your personal information or to risk having someone access your travel booking details, take your boarding pass with you when you leave the plane. Second, these days your personal data might be stored in places you wouldn\u2019t imagine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Your personal data is everywhere \u2014 stored in your phone, your computer, your credit ca", "title": "Is Your Boarding Pass Putting Your Private Information at Risk?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/07/Your-Boarding-Pass-Putting-Your-Private-Information-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06132013_Texting_Plane_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/07/Your-Boarding-Pass-Putting-Your-Private-Information-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06132013_Texting_Plane_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Your personal data is everywhere \u2014 stored in your phone, your computer, your credit ca", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And, it turns out, a surprising amount of it can be accessed using your discarded airplane boarding pass.\nAs Brian Krebs just detailed at Krebs on Security, the information stored in a boarding pass barcode could make it surprisingly simple for an interested party to wreak some havoc for the ticketed passenger.\nA Krebs reader found that reading the barcode using a decoding website revealed the passenger\u2019s name, frequent flyer number, record locator and other personal information.\nMuch of the data stored in the barcode is more readily available on the boarding pass itself \u2014 your name, flight number and the like are all printed clearly for anyone to see.\nThe information accessible through the account could be used, along with other personal details, to reset the PIN number for the passenger\u2019s Star Alliance frequent flyer account."}
