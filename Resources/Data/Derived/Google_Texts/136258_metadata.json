As Ms. Southern reported [CLICK], the Northampton County Board of Supervisors\u2019 meeting that followed the rousing but cordial rally on the Courthouse green drew a packed house with standing room only. Out of the 18 speakers, many of whom were former county officials and current heads of civic and environmental organizations, only one speaker spoke in favor of the Board\u2019s unilateral attempt to completely rewrite Northampton County\u2019s zoning ordinance with virtually and literally no public involvement (except for our obligatory three-minute comment period at the BOS meetings). This same lone speaker also submitted a lengthy letter to a local newspaper which was printed on the same day as the lead story about the rally, and I greatly appreciate this opportunity to respond to several of her comments.\n\nThe writer insinuates that those of us who merely want to be more involved in the decision-making process that will dictate the future economic and environmental future of this great county are misinformed and using scare tactics to prevent Northampton County from growing and prospering in this otherwise difficult fiscal climate. She cites many examples of our alleged \u201cfear mongering\u201d and refutes many of the claims made by those opposing the unilateral changes proposed by the Board.\n\nUpon information and belief, the writer is a real estate professional with roots in Virginia Beach. And while we all love to visit Virginia Beach and its many offerings, we do not choose to live there. Frankly, it is just too crowded for the likes of many of us, and most do not want to pay the high taxes of living in such a congested area. Note VB\u2019s taxes are about 50% higher than Northampton County\u2019s. That said, the writer\u2019s theory that we need to develop Northampton County in a more intensive and commercial manner to bring more revenue into the county is belied by the tax profile in Virginia Beach, as well as Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nAs for the misinformation that has been put out by the major organizations which have been intricately involved in this proposed zoning revision, there is not one clear example of what has been presented that has been wrong. Indeed, much of the information distributed in newsletters, flyers, and letters has been based on in-depth analysis and careful consideration by former Planning Commissioners and other county officials who were intensely involved in writing the current zoning ordinance, and also in reviewing the proposed zoning revisions while they still served in an official capacity on the Planning Commission.\n\nCONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE\n\nHere is a recap of the facts, and they cannot be disputed: The BOS has proposed dozens of uses on land zoned as agriculture which are much more suited for industrial and commercial zones. They include waste incinerators, biofuel refineries, prisons, racetracks, shooting ranges, wastewater treatment plants, large scale chicken houses, manure storage, and many other invasive uses. That is in the proposed zoning document. They propose to eliminate Mobile Home Parks as a district, disallowing any expansion of these existing affordable housing options. The proposed zoning calls for reducing the lot widths along the waterfronts from 250 feet to 60 feet, allowing a Virginia Beach look-alike scenario that greets us as we near the western side of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. They propose to add a number of residential new zones, allowing many more houses per acre than the current ordinance. The proposed plan disregards any consideration for the recharge of our sole-source aquifer, as it calls for reduced limits on how much land along our recharge spine can be paved over. Contrary to what the writer claims, the proposed revisions DO rezone nearly 3,000 acres of farmland into residential and commercial use, and this cannot be disputed. Finally, the Board of Supervisors HAS proposed eliminating the protections of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act on the Seaside, and there has been no official vote to date to take that off the table. These are just a few of the many changes the writer would have us believe will solve our economic woes \u2014 making this the first county in history whose taxes have gone down once we pave over our farmland and grow houses and hotels where our crops once grew.\n\nFinally, as for the fear factor, the writer is right. Most of us are incredibly fearful that the BOS will get away with their singular plan to reshape Northampton County into something it was never meant to be. But most of all we are afraid that this trampling of our constitutional right to have our voices heard and factored into the decisions that will affect our future, on every level, will continue on the path that is far too worn.\n\nROBERT TONER\n\nExmore", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.1", "og": {"site_name": "Cape Charles Wave", "description": "December 22, 2014 DEAR EDITOR, First of all, thanks to the Cape Charles Wave and reporter Dorie Southern for the expert coverage of the\"Occupy the Old Courthouse\" rally in Eastville on Tuesday evening, December 9.
