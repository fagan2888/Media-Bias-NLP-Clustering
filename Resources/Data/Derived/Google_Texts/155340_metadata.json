Why is it so tough for Doctors to go digital? Athenahealth Chairman & CEO Jonathan Bush discusses health care innovation and where we\u00bfll be in five years.\n\nHospitals and doctors have been slow to join the digital revolution that's ushered in change in other sectors.\n\nYet a few observers think that resistance won't last for much longer.

Bush pointed to outdated technology still in use in many doctors' offices, some of which still store data on CD-ROM discs. \"Our companies don't even give us computers with CD-ROM slots anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"You have these isolated hospitals and doctors' offices each with their own data center.\" Bush said, with \"each using off-the-shelf software that we stopped using in the rest of society.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush predicts we\u2019ll have a \u201chealth-care internet\u201d within five years, with most routine health care managed online.", "author": "Trent Gillies", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush predicts we\u2019ll have a \u201chealth-care internet\u201d within five years, with routine health care managed online.", "title": "Connect the docs with technology: Athenahealth CEO", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/24/health-care-will-have-its-own-internet-soon.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/05/06/101646328-1236465_710825742265990_1807686085_n.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush predicts we\u2019ll have a \u201chealth-care internet\u201d within five years, with routine health care managed online.", "title": "Health care will have its own Internet soon, Athenahealth chief says", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/24/health-care-will-have-its-own-internet-soon.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/05/06/101646328-1236465_710825742265990_1807686085_n.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@trentCNBC", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "On The Money, Big Data Download, Big Data, Health Care IT, Obamacare, Managed Health Care, Health Care, Athenahealth Inc, Anthem Inc, Amazon.com Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-07-25T14:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "On The Money", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T10:16:46-0400", "tag": "Amazon.com Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 102862613, "news_keywords": "big data, health care, medicine, medical records, Athenahealth, cyber attacks, Amazon.comm, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "America's health care industry is being dragged into the 21st century when it comes to being connected.\nAthenahealth Chairman & CEO Jonathan Bush discusses health care innovation and where we\u00bfll be in five years.\nHe said \"the lion's share of routine health care will be\u2026managed online.\nSo why has the medical sector has been so slow to make the move to digital records?\nWhile just 15 percent of hospitals used electronic health records in 2010, that number skyrocketed to 59 percent in 2013, according to data from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology."}
