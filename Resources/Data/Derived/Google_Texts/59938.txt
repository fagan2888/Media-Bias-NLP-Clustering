Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has created a division to sell several lines of coverage to small businesses directly through the Internet.

Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Co. will initially offer workers’ compensation and business owners’ package policies, according to a statement from A.M. Best, which assigned an A++ grade to the company, paving the way for Berkshire to begin operations.

Berkshire Hathaway owns Geico, the nation’s second-largest auto insurer that sells policies directly to consumers.

Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett, 85, has said that the reinsurance business is experiencing a glut of investors, and that he was looking at ways to begin sales of insurance directly to small business over the Internet.

“The reinsurance business is not as good as it was,” Buffett said in May during the company’s annual meeting in Omaha, Neb. “It’s a business whose prospects have turned for the worse and there’s not much we can do about it.”

Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance was formed from the shell of American Centennial Insurance Company, which was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2008.

Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance will get a backstop on its policies through an agreement with National Indemnity Co., the main insurance unit at Buffett’s company, according to A.M. Best. Back office functions, investment management and risk oversight will also be supported by other parts of the parent company.
