In a federal lawsuit filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, attorneys note that the human resources director of Tampa Family Health Centers questioned applicant Sara Hellwege about her involvement with the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a pro-life organization.\n\nWhen Hellwege, who submitted an application for a nurse-midwife position, confirmed her membership with AAPLOG, the director notified her in an e-mail that she was rejected due to her involvement with the organization.\n\n\u201cFederal and state law make it clear that being pro-abortion cannot be a prerequisite for employment, nor can federally funded facilities force nurses to assist with practices that could lead to an abortion,\u201d said Matt Bowman, Senior Legal Counsel with ADF.\n\nAttorneys note that the health center violated multiple federal laws by refusing Hellwege employment because of her religious and pro-life views. The lawsuit, Hellwege v. Tampa Family Health Centers, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division,\n\nADF also filed complaints on behalf of Hellwege with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission field office in Tampa and with the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTampa Family Health Centers are federally funded.\n\n\u201cWillingness to commit an abortion cannot be a litmus test for employment,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Steven H. Aden. \u201cAll we are asking is for the health center to obey the law and not make a nurse\u2019s employment contingent upon giving up her respect for life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A pro-life woman was refused employment by a Florida health center based on her unwillingness to prescribe birth control that could cause an abortion.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "A pro-life woman was refused employment by a Florida health center based on her unwillingness to prescribe birth control that could cause an abortion.", "title": "Pro-life woman denied employment by Florida health center", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/TampaFHC.jpg", "height": 680}, "updated_time": "2014-07-04T13:18:31-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/pro-life-woman-denied-employment-by-florida-health-center/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A pro-life woman was refused employment by a Florida health center based on her unwillingness to prescribe birth control that could cause an abortion.", "creator": "@Becky_Yeh", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/TampaFHC.jpg", "title": "Pro-life woman denied employment by Florida health center", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Human Rights", "tag": "tampa family health centers", "published_time": "2014-07-04T14:13:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-04T13:18:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe386c\"", "article_summary": "Attorneys note that the health center violated multiple federal laws by refusing Hellwege employment because of her religious and pro-life views.\nA Florida health center has allegedly refused an applicant employment based on her pro-life view and unwillingness to prescribe contraception that could cause the death of a human embryo.\nTampa Family Health Centers are federally funded.\n\u201cAll we are asking is for the health center to obey the law and not make a nurse\u2019s employment contingent upon giving up her respect for life.\u201d\nIn a federal lawsuit filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, attorneys note that the human resources director of Tampa Family Health Centers questioned applicant Sara Hellwege about her involvement with the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a pro-life organization."}
