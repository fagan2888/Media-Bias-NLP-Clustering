Looking for something to read? This should keep you busy through much of 2014: A roundup of Top Ten and Best of lists related to science and medicine in 2013. In 2012 the Higgs bosun topped everybody\u2019s lists. 2013 was more of a miscellany.\n\nTracking the lists\n\nLet\u2019s begin with our friends at the Knight Science Journalism Tracker. They have kindly assembled several such lists, so I don\u2019t have to. Many thanks.\n\nFirst up, Tracker Charlie Petit, who not only presents us with his annual compilation of top ten and best of lists, but this year mines them to come up with a consensus list of 2013\u2019s most important science stories.\n\nIn his List of Lists, he covers Discover\u2018s top 100 stories of 2013, Real Clear Science\u2019s Top Ten, and also its list of Worst of the Worst, the biggest junk science stories in 2013. Plus the Australian Media Center\u2019s Top Ten Best and also Top Ten Weirdest, Time magazine\u2019s many Top Ten lists (only some of which pertain to science and medicine), and the Times (UK) list of most-read stories.\n\nTopping Scientific American\u2018s Top Ten news stories was the sequester because of its impact on US science funding. That\u2019s an odd self-seeking choice because the sequester affected government support of many things in addition to science. But never mind. There is also Wired Science\u2019s list of top discoveries, Longform\u2019s best stories, and Live Science\u2019s list.\n\nScience chose to promote what it called Top Ten Breakthroughs. Arrrrgh! For shame, doesn\u2019t Science, of all places, know that \u201cbreakthrough\u201d is a banished term if you\u2019re serious about science?\n\nThen Charlie consulted all his lists and drew from them a consensus on the biggest science stories of 2013. There turned out to be four that were widely agreed upon by list-assemblers:\n\nAtmospheric CO2 reaching 400 parts per million for the first time in modern history.\n\nCloning human stem cells and getting them to differentiate.\n\nThe Chelyabinsk meteor explosion over Russia.\n\nVoyager 1 entering interstellar space, which\u2013as Charlie is at pains to point out several times\u2013is not the same thing as leaving the solar system.\n\nMore tracking from the Trackers\n\nTracker Faye Flam presented 2013 science stories \u201cin which reporters repeated a conclusion that was not supported by the evidence they presented.\u201d One example was the claim that reading fiction makes you more empathetic. She also cited an Economist piece on how science gets it wrong. The piece focuses on mistakes and fraud in clinical and behavioral research and extrapolates to argue that all science is riddled with error. That reminded me of one of Jonah Lehrer\u2019s New Yorker pieces, one from 2010, before his public disgrace, in which he argued that it\u2019s OK to choose what to believe about scientific conclusions. The piece generated a lot of perfectly justified indignation, which I wrote about at the time.\n\nShe also presents discouraging examples of a continuing issue in science writing: the mistaken conflation of correlation and cause. This ought to be a simple problem to fix. But it keeps happening, so apparently not. I suppose it\u2019s partly due to non-science writers writing about research who don\u2019t understand that just because two events occur together doesn\u2019t mean that one causes the other. But some of these misleading conclusions seem to be asserted by science writers who should know better. Perhaps they can\u2019t resist the lure of potential headlines for what seems to be an off-the-wall finding.\n\nFaye Flam\u2019s example is a New York Times story claiming that women should avoid short-term relationships because they result in bad sex. She notes that the writer never considered another plausible explanation of the data, which is that bad sex causes women to cut relationships short. She\u2019s quite right, of course. If I had time I\u2019d deconstruct those two possible conclusions. I\u2019d point out that the first one is a product of reflexive woman-as-victim-and/or-slut thinking, while the second assumes women are in charge of their relationships. If I had time.\n\nHead Tracker Paul Raeburn alerted us to 2013\u2019s longer features related to science that you may have missed. Another of Paul\u2019s year-end summations calls attention to a post about 2013\u2019s worst health-related press releases, this from the estimable Gary Schwitzer of HealthNewsReview. Paul quotes Schwitzer thus: \u201cI don\u2019t think all public relations messages about health care are crap,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut most of what I see is. And I can\u2019t stand seeing public relations that may end up hurting the public.\u201d\n\nPaul also wrote ruefully about the publications that trumpeted \u201ccures\u201d that were nothing of the kind: cures for AIDS and HIV infection, several different cures for cancer (these from, among others, Time magazine and the New York Times), cures for type 1 diabetes and high cholesterol. And, my favorite, junk food as a cure for obesity. Looking forward to 2014, Paul says, \u201cI predict, with great confidence, that we will see many more \u2018cures.\u2019 Modern medicine is a wonderful thing. Not to mention modern reporting.\u201d\n\nSome other 2013 Top Ten and Best-of lists\n\nBetsy Mason of Wired Science has put together several galleries of 2013\u2019s best images. They range from striking landforms to microscopic structures to many gorgeous spiders (and some that eat bats.) There\u2019s also a gallery of best photos of Earth from space. Feast your eyes, terrific stuff. I am including a couple of them here, both NASA images because they\u2019re in the public domain and I won\u2019t get sued for copyright infringement.\n\nTechnology Review provides several \u201cBest of\u201d lists. They are all about their own articles, but that shouldn\u2019t put you off. Check out pieces on the origin of life and also best communications stories (topped by the controversy over NSA spying, which if anything seems to be getting bigger rather than fading away. See also best computing stories, best biomedicine stories, best energy stories, and best long reads.\n\nAnd now, the top medical news of 2013.\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\u2018s Journal Watch is a pay publication aimed at medical professionals, mainly docs, who are presumably too busy to actually read journals in their specialties. Quite helpful to science writers too. Journal Watch does offer some of its posts free. These include year-in-review summaries for several medical specialties with links to their top articles on each.\n\nThere\u2019s also a list of NEJM Journal Watch General Medicine\u2019s most important medical topics overall, but those links are behind the pay wall. Odd. The list all by itself, though, is useful for a glimpse into what topics the medical profession believes matters.\n\nLooking forward to 2014\n\nFrom space.com, new space missions.\n\nAll this month Medpage Today is running a video series on hot topics for medicine in 2014. They cover cardiology and heart surgery, infectious disease, breast cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, autism, diabetes, prostate cancer, diet, Crohn\u2019s disease, asthma and allergy, AIDS, dermatology, rheumatology, emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, stroke, health policy, and lung cancer. Some topics command more than one video, and several haven\u2019t been posted yet.\n\nAs the year began, things were looking up for the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, aka ACA. The federal web site was doing better, people were enrolling in new insurance plans, and the giant attempt at a capitalist version of health care reform was looking as if it would survive after all last fall\u2019s attempts to bring it down (although perhaps in modified form, depending on Congress.) On January 2 Phil Galewitz took stock at Kaiser Health News, outlining six developments that may alter public perception of Obamacare for the better. Kaiser is, of course, following Obamacare closely; find its (very long) story list here.\n\nAlso on January 2, the CDC warned that the H1N1 pandemic flu strain that first surfaced in 2009 appears to be this winter\u2019s predominant flu type. The elderly are usually the chief victims of flu, but this strain hits mostly the young and middle-aged. Find the CDC weekly flu surveillance report here.\n\nInside BGI, the world\u2019s largest genomics institution\n\nChina\u2019s visibility in science continues to grow, and maybe we ought to be paying more attention. In 2013, China went to the moon. We begin 2014 with Michael Specter\u2019s long piece about the Chinese genomics giant BGI, which generates a startling 25% of the world\u2019s genome data. The piece appeared in the January 6 New Yorker. It\u2019s behind a paywall, but I wrote about it Tuesday for the Genetic Literacy Project, which is not behind a paywall.\n\nSpecter\u2019s piece is stuffed with information about the little-known BGI, a Chinese institution\u2013I keep wanting to call it a company\u2013with outposts all over the world. It\u2019s also quite a nice example of science writing. My take: \u201cIt\u2019s a case study in how to place an enormous amount of scientific information before a largely non-technical audience with no pedagogical seams showing. While telling the BGI story, Specter has achieved a compact and uncomplicated primer on genetic basics, genes and their molecules. He even explains, very simply to be sure, how a sequencing machine works.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Happy New Year. Looking for something to read?
