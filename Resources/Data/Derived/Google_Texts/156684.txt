Saturday was a beautiful day for the the 25th Clarke County Forestry and Wildlife Festival.

The festival is held every year at Archusa Water Park in Quitman. On-hand was entertainment from The Blackwood Brothers Quartet, Lane Chapel Quintet. There were activities for the kids, a car show, food and arts and craft booths. All activities are geared toward all ages. They had something for everyone at the park Saturday.
