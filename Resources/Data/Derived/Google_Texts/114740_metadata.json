In 2012, the county billed the presidential campaigns more than $180,000 for providing police for security on a visit by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The state GOP reimbursed them just under $2,000, leaving the rest not reimbursed.\n\n\n\n\"I can't make them pay it, but I want them to be aware that it's not free for you to come here,\" said Henrico, VA, Police Chief Douglas Middleton in an article published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\n\n\n\nFor some, that doesn't seem fair. Co-founder of the Festival and Events Association of Tucson and Southern Arizona Mia Hansen has spent more than 30 years managing major Tucson festivals, and believes the campaigns need to pay.\n\n\n\n\u201cPolitical rallies are great events,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cIt brings people out, it\u2019s a time for people to come together and to debate, but they\u2019re still private events that turn into public events and thus, they should follow the same rules as any other event organizers require to.\u201d\n\n\n\nHansen said when local groups host similar events, organizers are required to get permits and pay for officers the provide security.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe work with the city to figure out: Can we use off duty police officers? Can we use private security?\u201d said Hansen. \u201cThe city of Tucson is requiring now that people have a much higher liability insurance policy as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpokeswoman for TPD Sgt. Kim Bay said the city will pay the officers through its general fund but will bill the campaigns.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown according to TPD billing records:\n\n\n\nFor the Bernie Sanders' rally held on Friday, March 18 - 76 officers worked 638 hours at a cost of $44,013.\n\n\n\nThe Donald Trump rally on Saturday, March 19, cost the city $81,838 after 180 officers worked 1,171 hours.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday,March 20, former president Bill Clinton spoke at a rally for his wife, Hillary. That event cost the city $7,312 for the 23 officers who worked 96 hours.\n\n\n\nTucson News Now reached out to the three campaigns asking if they'll pay for the cost of their rallies.\n\n\n\nStephanie Grisham with the Trump campaign says, \"it will depend on if it was agreed to in the contract or if the city just did it themselves. A lot of times cities, towns, venues, will do that without clearing it with the campaign first.\"\n\n\n\nTim Hogan with the Clinton campaign said they do not control security issues, therefore they don\u2019t request any additional security.\n\nMeanwhile, TNN hasn\u2019t received a response from The Sanders campaign.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
