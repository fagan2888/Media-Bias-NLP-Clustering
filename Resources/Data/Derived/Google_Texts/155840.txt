This week, Private Equity Beat is introducing you to five of the 40 most influential young private equity executives in Europe, selected by our colleagues at Private Equity News.

Athens-born Alex Fotakidis has been instrumental in structuring more than 100 billion euros worth of financing packages for the firm’s portfolio investments in Europe and the U.S. since being recruited to CVC Capital Partners’ four-strong financing team in 2006 by managing partner Marc Boughton.

Since 2010, London-based Mr. Fotakidis has been particularly driving convergence on debt structures, helping the firm benefit from increasingly standardized U.S.-style terms on European deals.

Most recently, Mr. Fotakidis has secured debt arrangements from a range of lenders for CVC’s investments in online payments business Skrill, which was valued at €550 million, and software company Avast, valued at roughly $1 billion.

Other investments include the world’s largest olive-oil bottler Deoleo, outsourcing group Advantage Sales & Marketing and healthcare companies IDCSalud and Quirón, which merged in July 2014.

A snowboarder and diver in his spare time, Mr. Fotakidis has 15 years’ experience in the leveraged finance markets, having previously worked at CIBC World Markets. He studied economics and geography before gaining a master of science degree in environmental and natural resource economics.
