In addition, Hughes is the former chair of the Utah Transit Authority and still serves on that body as a board member. In his private life, he is a Manager for Steelers Holdings, a Real Estate agency.\n\nRepublicans also tapped Jim Dunnigan from Taylorsville to be the House Majority Leader. Dunnigan, who has also served in the House since 2003, most recently made headlines by chairing the House investigative committee behind the Swallow scandal. Dunnigan, also a pragmatist, has also made hay in recent years for his opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nConservative lawmaker, Francis Gibson of Mapleton, who made headlines this past session for carrying Lockhart\u2019s technologically based education initiative (along with its $350 million price tag), will be the next Majority Whip while Brad Wilson of Kaysville will be the Republican Caucus\u2019 Assistant Majority Whip.\n\nOn the Senate side, the upper body opted to not shake things up. Sandy Republican Wayne Niederhauser will maintain his position as President of the Senate, as he ran unopposed for the position. Similarly, Monroe Republican, Ralph Okerlund was unopposed in his bid for Senate Majority Leader. Layton Republican, Stewart Adams, will be Majority Whip while Brigham City Republican, Peter Knudson will serve as Assistant Whip.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With the ink all but dry on the 2014 election, Republican House members elected Draper representative, Greg Hughes, to be the next Speaker of the House, ending months of speculation on who would be arguably the second most powerful person in the state.\nHughes replaces outgoing Speaker Becky Lockhart (Republican \u2013 Provo), who stepped away from the position, fueling speculation that Lockhart is seeking higher office.\nLayton Republican, Stewart Adams, will be Majority Whip while Brigham City Republican, Peter Knudson will serve as Assistant Whip.\nDunnigan, who has also served in the House since 2003, most recently made headlines by chairing the House investigative committee behind the Swallow scandal.\nRepublicans also tapped Jim Dunnigan from Taylorsville to be the House Majority Leader."}
