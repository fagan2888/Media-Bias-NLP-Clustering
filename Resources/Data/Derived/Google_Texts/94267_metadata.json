Wendt was told, after nearly two months and countless hours on the phone with supervisors for the federal marketplac e that her only option was to file a written recourse with the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS would then reply within 90 days, bringing the family right up to the final deadline for coverage at the end of open enrollment period.\n\nWendt had feared her family would be without coverage for a full year.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe did find an interim plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield,\u201d she says. \u201cThe premium is $400, and the deductible is high as well. We are waiting to get all of our information in the mail.\u201d\n\nWendt says Blue Cross Blue Shield told her the family was eligible for a subsidy via Healthcare.gov, but they were not eligible to claim it with the interim plan because they are purchasing coverage strictly on their own in the private market. Her old plan, pre- ACA, cost the family $260 per month with a $5,000 deductible.\n\nHHS cannot comment on individual cases, a spokesperson told FOXBusiness.com, but did say it is continuing to work on eligibility determinations on the exchange.\n\n\u201cAs part of the technical enhancements to healthcare.gov, we have fixed several issues related to eligibility determinations, and we are working to implement additional fixes soon for bugs that are impacting a limited number of people. Individuals who disagree with their determinations should file an appeal. As part of our effort to reach out to individuals who may have experienced difficulty using the website, we are reaching out to these consumers so they know their next steps for enrollment, which may include resetting their application and starting over, enrolling in Medicaid/CHIP with their state agency, or filing an appeal. \u201d\n\nThe plan the Wendts now hold is from month-to-month, and Wendt says she plans on cancelling it once they are able to secure coverage via the exchange.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit frustrating, but still a worse plan is better than nothing at all,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso there is no one to get mad at, that I can actually speak to. I will keep trying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-06 11:26:08 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url":
