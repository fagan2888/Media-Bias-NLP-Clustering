In Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology (1989) he described how the silicon chip would usher in a new information age. In TELECOSM: How Infinite Bandwidth will Revolutionize Our World (2000), he predicted the rise of hand-held computers and fiber optics. In Life After Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and American Life (1990), Gilder predicted that \"telecomputers\" would one day provide a limitless alternative to broadcast television. That was 15 years before the launch of YouTube.\n\nReason TV's Nick Gillespie sat down with Gilder to talk about why he thinks Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology. The interview took place at FreedomFest 2014, an annual convention for libertarians held each year in Las Vegas.\n\nShot and edited by Jim Epstein; additional camera Zach Weissmueller.\n\nAbout 19:30.\n\nScroll down for downloadable versions and subscribe to Reason TV's YouTube Channel to receive automatic notifications when new material goes live.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\"The currency the Internet deserves and needs.\"", "title": "Tech Visionary George Gilder: \"Bitcoin is the Libertarian Solution to the Money Enigma.\"", "url": "http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/08/12/tech-visionary-george-gilder-bitcoin-is", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jepstein/2014_08/gilderknowledgeandpower.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Bitcoin is a breakthrough in information theory that allows\n[users] to conduct provable transactions that can't\nbe&nbsp;changed...without reference to trusted third parties,\" says\ntech writer and investor George Gilder. \"[Bitcoin] is the perfect\nlibertarian solution to the money enigma.\"\nWhen Gilder makes tech predictions, it's worth paying attention.\nIn \nMicrocosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and\nTechnology (1989) he described how the silicon chip would\nusher in a new information age.
