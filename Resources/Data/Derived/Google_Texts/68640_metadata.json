(AP) \u2014 With All-Star weekend finished, the WNBA turns its attention to the second half of the season.\n\nThe sprint to the playoffs and the WNBA championship will most likely hinge on which team can stay the healthiest. Minnesota is leading the Western Conference right now, but the Lynx are without two of their three All-Stars as Lindsay Whalen and Seimone Augustus are sidelined with injuries.\n\nWhalen, who hurt her eye last week, should be back soon. Augustus is out until mid-August while recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery.\n\n\u201cI like where we are and I like our mindset, how we\u2019ve handled the adversity,\u201d said Maya Moore, who was the MVP of the league\u2019s All-Star contest. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep pushing through and get better. We\u2019d love to have everyone healthy. For now, we\u2019ll go with what we got and I like what we have.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles is sitting in last in the conference, but the Sparks are going to get a big boost this week with the return of Candace Parker.

We don\u2019t look like a team that\u2019s losing. We\u2019re not giving in.\u201d\n\nWhile the West is quite spread out, the East is bunched \u2014 as usual. New York enters the second half of the season in first, but all six teams are within five games of the Liberty.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, the previous years, for the \u2018W\u2019, especially for the East, teams are always clustered,\u201d Indiana\u2019s Tamika Catchings said. \u201cYou can go from being fourth to first to sixth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Second half of WNBA season set to get under way", "title": "Second half of WNBA season set to get under way", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Second half of WNBA season set to get under way", "title": "Second half of WNBA season set to get under way", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/27/second_half_of_wnba_season_set_to_get_under_way/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/wnba-all-star-game-basketball.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Second half of WNBA season set to get under way", "title": "Second half of WNBA season set to get under way", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/wnba-all-star-game-basketball.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Doug Feinberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsUNCASVILLE, Conn.
