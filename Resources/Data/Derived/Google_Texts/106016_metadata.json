He sat among the folks in fifth-deck section 404, had to be concerned his nose would bleed and watched on the mammoth TV scoreboard as his son coached the Washington tight ends.\n\nHarold Phillips was out of the game he loved and had spent all of his life around. He was 67, and nobody in football cared about hiring him.\n\nBut he wanted back in.\n\nAt 68, \u201cWade\u201d (his middle name) Phillips is all in and deserves to be the NFL coach of the (first half) of the year \u2014 by acclimation.\n\nWade has produced the No. 1 defense in the NFL \u2014 the defense that held Green Bay to 10 points and the great Aaron Rodgers to 77 yards passing, and the defense that primarily is responsible for the Broncos\u2019 immaculate record, which will ascend to 8-0 with a 30-16 victory over the Colts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing pretty good,\u201d the self-effacing, unassuming coach of 45 seasons says. \u201cI don\u2019t do a lot.\u201d\n\nI was having dinner with friends at Shanahan\u2019s when Wade suddenly materialized in a stylish checked shirt and a pair of dress pants, and said hello. I introduced him as the \u201cS.O.B.\u201d \u2014 \u201cSon of Bum\u201d (his Twitter handle).\n\nYes, Wade likes to interact with fans and media. However, he rankled sensitive Packers loyalists by tweeting that he likes \u201cchicken parm \u2026 especially with Cheese.\u201d\n\nSome stupid people don\u2019t get Wade\u2019s wry sense of humor and \u201caw-shucks,\u201d good-ol\u2019-boy attitude reflective of his home state \u2014 Texas.\n\nThirty-two head coaches didn\u2019t get Wade in 2014. They thought he was too ancient and yesterday\u2019s defensive coordinator. He couldn\u2019t get a phone call. In early January, Washington did interview him \u2014 but made no offer.\n\nThen, finally, after new Broncos coach Gary Kubiak sought another defensive coordinator, he turned to his former defensive coordinator at Houston. \u201cI\u2019m used to being second choice,\u201d Wade said.\n\nIs everyone obtuse? Wade has been a defensive coordinator for eight teams. All improved considerably in his first season. There was sound reasoning why he became the highest-paid NFL assistant.\n\nThe unintelligencia didn\u2019t understand. Wade had trained under two of the premier defensive coaches in history \u2014 his father and Buddy Ryan, architect of the Bears\u2019 defense in 1985. Perhaps they didn\u2019t comprehend that Wade has proven himself over and again since he was a defensive coordinator at Luther Stark High School in West Orange, Texas. Maybe they looked at Wade as failed since, he says in that syrupy Texas accent, \u201cI was a lousy head coach.\u201d\n\nSorry, Wade. He won 56 percent of his games when assuming control, and every team he was head coach of made the playoffs. He was fired in Buffalo, Dallas and, yes, Denver because owners wanted a coach who had footballs flying out of his skull, and Wade was not a screamer or a dreamer. He is a sound, fundamental, hard-working, smart-scheming football man for whom players crave to play.\n\nBum Phillips was Wade\u2019s idol. Wade played for his father, coached for his father, replaced his father as interim coach in New Orleans when Bum decided to step down. Bum died in 2013, just weeks before Wade took over as interim coach of the Houston Texans when Kubiak experienced a health problem, then was fired. (\u201cLook at the teams I became interim coach,\u201d Wade says. The three were 9-29. Wade was asked to go naked into a blast furnace.)\n\nWade is a kid at 68, I told him. I was born the same month a year earlier. Wade certainly feels young again with this defensive bunch. \u201cBest talent I\u2019ve ever taken over.\u201d\n\nWhen Wade really was a kid, his father moved eight times as a high school and college coach. One day, Wade was called into the principal\u2019s office and thought he was in trouble. As he sat there, he could see his house down the street. A moving van pulled up. Wade knew he was transferring again.\n\nIn his life, Wade has moved 22 times and lived in 11 states. He settled long enough once to be an exceptional high school quarterback and middle linebacker, and ask the head cheerleader on a date. Wade was recruited by Bear Bryant at Alabama, but decided to join dad at the University of Houston. A few years later, he reconnected with his high school sweetheart, and Wade and Laurie have been married 38 years. Their son, Wes, is an NFL assistant, and their daughter, Tracy, is an actress who has appeared in several major movies.\n\nIn his wandering career, Wade has rejoined only one team \u2014 the Denver Broncos. He cherishes his five years before (one Super Bowl as coordinator, and as head coach for two seasons) and these incredible Broncos now.\n\nHe has a job again. He doesn\u2019t have to pay to get in. He\u2019s not too old.\n\nAnd Harold Wade Phillips is continuing to prove that he is a brilliant defensive coordinator \u2026 especially with Cheese.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or @woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Wade Phillips a good ol\u2019 \u2013 and funny \u2013 coach", "title": "Paige: Wade Phillips a good ol\u2019 \u2013 and funny \u2013 coach", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/07/paige-wade-phillips-a-good-ol-and-funny-coach/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-07T18:18:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:07:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb80a\"", "article_summary": "Then, finally, after new Broncos coach Gary Kubiak sought another defensive coordinator, he turned to his former defensive coordinator at Houston.\nAnd Harold Wade Phillips is continuing to prove that he is a brilliant defensive coordinator \u2026 especially with Cheese.\nHe won 56 percent of his games when assuming control, and every team he was head coach of made the playoffs.\n(\u201cLook at the teams I became interim coach,\u201d Wade says.\nAt 68, \u201cWade\u201d (his middle name) Phillips is all in and deserves to be the NFL coach of the (first half) of the year \u2014 by acclimation."}
