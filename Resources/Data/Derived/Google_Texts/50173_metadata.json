The Convertible Peso (CUP) is almost exclusively for the use of tourists and is of significantly greater value; one CUC is the equivalent of an American dollar and the equivalent of 26.5 CUPs. The other 24 CUPs Cuban workers will not receive amount to 92% of their salaries.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nGranma explains:\n\nThe payment will now be agreed to with businesses possessing foreign capital taking into consideration the salaries issued to workers in jobs of similar complexity in entities in the same area or sector of our geographic area, the salary scale that is applied in the country (as a reference point) and some additional payments for the corresponding law.\n\nIn other words, even if a foreign company has the means to pay more than a Cuban company, the worker will receive the same salary as if he were working for a Cuban company, and the government will pocket the rest.\n\nThe Havana Times, an online publication dedicated to issues related to Cuba, notes that Zamira Mar\u00edn Triana, vice-minister of Labor and Social Security, described the new laws as offering a \u201csignificant increase\u201d for workers.\n\nIn addition to the 92% of salaries being pocketed by the Cuban government, Cuban government employment offices will charge 20% of the salary of each worker they connect to the corporation for the service of finding said corporation employees. Employees will also lose 9.09% of their salaries for \u201cvacation time.\u201d\n\nThe new measures, though enacted hours before the release of USAID worker Alan Gross and President Obama\u2019s announcement of new trade measures, should inspire caution in American companies that would like to do work on the island. American companies would be keeping very little of the money they invest and earn in business on the island, while lining the pockets of the communist government. As Ra\u00fal Castro noted in his speech, the Cuban government made no concessions in this recent negotiation with the United States, save the freedom of Gross and one other American agent whom President Obama did not name, which leaves it open to sanctioning American companies who dare attempt to do business on the island as they see fit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Castro to Pocket 92% of Worker Salaries from Foreign Companies", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Castro to Pocket 92% of Worker Salaries from Foreign Companies", "title": "Castro to Pocket 92% of Worker Salaries from Foreign Companies - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Ra\u00fal-Castro-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2014-12-19T10:06:00-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/12/19/castro-to-pocket-92-of-worker-salaries-from-foreign-companies/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Castro to Pocket 92% of Worker Salaries from Foreign Companies", "creator": "@francesmartel", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Ra\u00fal-Castro-ap.jpg", "title": "Castro to Pocket 92% of Worker Salaries from Foreign Companies - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "castro, Cuba, Obama,National Security,Castro", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-12-19T09:24:21-07:00", "section": "National Security", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T10:06:00-07:00", "tag": "Obama", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5ce\"", "article_summary": "American companies would be keeping very little of the money they invest and earn in business on the island, while lining the pockets of the communist government.\nThe other 24 CUPs Cuban workers will not receive amount to 92% of their salaries.\nIn addition to the 92% of salaries being pocketed by the Cuban government, Cuban government employment offices will charge 20% of the salary of each worker they connect to the corporation for the service of finding said corporation employees.\nIn other words, even if a foreign company has the means to pay more than a Cuban company, the worker will receive the same salary as if he were working for a Cuban company, and the government will pocket the rest.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJust one day before President Obama announced sweeping changes that would allow potential American investment in Cuba, the Cuban government apparently had begun preparing itself by announcing new measures that would allow Cubans who work for foreign companies to keep only 8% of their salaries."}
