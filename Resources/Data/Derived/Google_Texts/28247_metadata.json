Polls show Democrats and Republicans, and independents, too, want the government to step in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLobbying groups and health care professionals are pressing candidates to talk about how they would rein in the prices of medications \u2014 not just the most expensive new drugs for chronic conditions but also those that have long been available but have become much more costly.\n\nAdvocates for government intervention point to eye-popping examples: a new drug for hepatitis C that costs $84,000 for 12 weeks of treatment, cancer drugs that now average more than $100,000 a year, and a commonly used antibiotic known as tetracycline whose price tag shot up nearly 70-fold in one year.\n\nOther health care initiatives, especially Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, have deteriorated into partisan shouting matches about the proper scope of the government\u2019s role in medicine. This issue could be different.\n\nOne poll, released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 93 percent of Democrats, 83 percent of independents, and 74 percent of Republicans want the federal government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare \u2014 even though the Republicans in the survey were skeptical the approach would actually work.\n\nOn the campaign trail, most candidates have shied away from the subject, but there are signs that might not last. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s main challenger from the Democratic left, raises the issue of drug prices in nearly every speech. Clinton has mentioned it on the campaign trail. And Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida wants to bring down prices as well, though aides say his plan is based on overturning Obama\u2019s health care law, which isn\u2019t one of the main factors the drug industry blames for high prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to lobbying for lower prices by powerful industry groups, including America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, there have also been pleas from those on the front lines. More than 100 cancer doctors this summer called for stronger regulation of prices. Insurers and hospitals are pushing for drug costs to become a 2016 issue.\n\nTheir argument: It will take a broad public discussion about the causes of high drug costs to develop a solution \u2014 the kind of debate that is made possible by a presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI do believe this will become not just a side issue, but a central issue in the campaign,\u201d said John Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care and the leader of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, a project that\u2019s trying to draw attention to the cost pressures of the most expensive drugs.\n\nDrug industry officials say appeals for lower prices are understandable but overlook the benefits of new medications.\n\n\u201cMedicines that are coming out on the market today would have been considered science fiction 10 years ago,\u201d said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America, the main trade group for the companies. \u201cThey\u2019re also incredibly difficult to develop.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a system that incentivizes and rewards innovation so companies will go after the hardest-to-treat diseases,\u201d Zirkelbach said.\n\nDemocrats have signaled they see the political potential in the issue. At a town hall meeting in Iowa in April, Clinton declared \u201cwe need to drive a harder bargain with drug companies about the cost of drugs.\u201d\n\n\u2018It may make sense to the manufacturer how it was priced, but to the public, it won\u2019t make much sense. The question is, if there are new cures, can people even afford them?\u2019 Robert Blendon, health care public opinion expert at Harvard University\n\nIn his speeches, Sanders usually notes the bus trip he organized from Vermont to Canada years ago so people could buy cheaper drugs there, spokesman Michael Briggs said. And former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley is planning to talk more about \u201cbold, progressive ideas\u201d on health care later in the campaign, including how to bring down costs across the board, spokeswoman Haley Morris said.\n\nDespite this attention, advocates for lowering prices have had only limited success getting other presidential candidates to tackle the issue, especially Republicans.\n\nRepublicans might find it challenging to address drug costs, in part because they remain most focused on repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut there\u2019s another challenge, policy analysts say: Republicans, who are speaking to conservative primary voters, have to be careful not to sound as though they\u2019re suggesting price controls. And any suggestion of stronger regulations would contradict the message of Republican candidates such as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker: Health care should be regulated by state and local leaders, not Washington.\n\nRobert Blendon, a health care public opinion expert at Harvard University, said the issue of drug costs is only going to become more urgent in the coming years as new cures and treatments become available \u2014 many of which could be painfully expensive.\n\n\u201cIt may make sense to the manufacturer how it was priced, but to the public, it won\u2019t make much sense,\u201d Blendon said. \u201cThe question is, if there are new cures, can people even afford them?\u201d\n\nMany oncologists say the problem is that there\u2019s no real oversight for prices. Medicare is legally banned from negotiating drug prices, patients want the full course of cancer treatments, and no one is about to tell them they can\u2019t have it \u2014 not the insurance companies, and certainly not the doctors.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what has to be a part of the campaign: You can\u2019t have a benefit where you can\u2019t control the price, and whether it works for one year or one week, I have to pay whatever the drug companies want to charge,\u201d said S. Vincent Rajkumar of the Mayo Clinic, one of the 100-plus oncologists who published a joint letter about rising prices this summer.\n\nThere are other problems in the health care system, Rajkumar said, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t highlight a problem that\u2019s easily fixable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.4289915552", "eomportal-id": 76279, "description": "Presidential candidates in both parties face growing pressure to explain what they\u2019d do about a burning medical issue that has little to do with President Obama\u2019s health law: high prescription drug costs.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Washington", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Presidential candidates in both parties face growing pressure to explain what they\u2019d do about a burning medical issue that has little to do with President Obama\u2019s health law: high prescription drug costs.", "title": "Prescription drug prices becoming presidential campaign issue - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/08/24/prescription-drug-prices-becoming-presidential-campaign-issue/tOlUbF6UBlAxj4ppnTgeSP/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-77.03687070000001", "state": "DC", "latitude": "38.9071923", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "campaign,drug prices,2016,treatment,issues,prescriptions, Bernard Sanders, Marco  Rubio, John  Rother, Scott  Walker", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 03:42:35 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "campaign,drug prices,2016,treatment,issues,prescriptions, Bernard Sanders, Marco  Rubio, John  Rother, Scott  Walker,Democratic Party, Republican Party, Kaiser Family Foundation, Food and Drug Administration, Harvard University, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Wall Street Journal, American Hospital Assn, Mayo Clinic, Twitter,Valeant Pharmaceuticals International|VRX|NYSE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "462570e6-4ac0-11e5-bc73-947b3c59ac47"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e4a\"", "article_summary": "The issue is rising fast on the agenda of Americans, with large majorities saying the government should take action to lower drug prices.\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s main challenger from the Democratic left, raises the issue of drug prices in nearly every speech.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Presidential candidates in both parties face growing pressure to explain what they\u2019d do about a burning health care issue that has little to do with President Obama\u2019s politicized insurance law: high prescription drug costs.\nInsurers and hospitals are pushing for drug costs to become a 2016 issue.\nThere are other problems in the health care system, Rajkumar said, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t highlight a problem that\u2019s easily fixable.\u201d"}
