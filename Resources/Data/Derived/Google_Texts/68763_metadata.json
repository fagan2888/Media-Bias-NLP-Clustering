But I hadn\u2019t, until CommonHealth co-host Carey Goldberg encouraged me to. If you also haven\u2019t, I encourage you to watch it right now.\n\nGo ahead. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nSo, now that you\u2019ve watched it, I can go ahead and talk about it without worrying that I\u2019ll spoil the big reveal for you. Actually, even if you didn\u2019t listen to me and haven\u2019t watched it, I\u2019m not too worried about that, because the huge secret in this video is simply that (last chance to watch before I spoil it for you!) we should all be walking or exercising or in some way moving our bodies about half an hour every day.\n\nWe should all be walking or exercising or in some way moving our bodies about half an hour every day.\n\nNot exactly news, right? But for me, anyway, something about the very simplicity of the video\u2019s presentation made me sit up and pay attention in a fresh way. Dr. Mike Evans, the video\u2019s creator, has made it his mission to present preventative-medicine information in as clear and useful a way as possible \u2014 and, to my mind, he\u2019s done exactly that here.\n\nThe point: We all have 24 hours in a day. Spend 23 and a half of those hours any way you want, but just use the remaining 30 minutes to go for a walk. And the health benefits will be incredible. He\u2019s got charts and stats and everything to prove it. By the end of the presentation, I just couldn\u2019t wait to get up from my desk and go for a walk.\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to do that in one minute. First, though, I\u2019ll pass along another link to a Dr. Mike insight \u2014 this one from a post on his blog. It\u2019s in the form of an infographic, and I\u2019m thinking of blowing it up and putting it on my wall. Again, a simple and obvious point with a powerful potential for lasting change: There is no one big thing we have to do to make ourselves healthier. It\u2019s all about making a lot of little changes, sticking with them, then making more little changes and sticking with those, too.\n\nLittle changes like going for a walk.\n\nOK, I\u2019m out of here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A video says we should all be walking or exercising or in some way moving our bodies about half an hour every day.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A video says we should all be walking or exercising or in some way moving our bodies about half an hour every day.", "title": "Project Louise: \u2018The Single Best Thing You Can Do For Your Health\u2019", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/08/project-louise-mike-evans-half-hour", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/Capture0812-620x383.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/08/project-louise-mike-evans-half-hour", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/Capture0812-620x383.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Project Louise: 'The Single Best Thing You Can Do For Your Health'"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-12", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 12 Aug 2014 11:47:25 -0400"}, "article_summary": "Project Louise: \u2018The Single Best Thing You Can Do For Your Health\u2019Maybe you\u2019ve seen this video already \u2014 it went viral on YouTube a while back.\nSo, now that you\u2019ve watched it, I can go ahead and talk about it without worrying that I\u2019ll spoil the big reveal for you.\nwe should all be walking or exercising or in some way moving our bodies about half an hour every day.\nWe should all be walking or exercising or in some way moving our bodies about half an hour every day.\nIt\u2019s all about making a lot of little changes, sticking with them, then making more little changes and sticking with those, too."}
