That was the biggest challenge.\"\n\nLively is from sunny California. Reynolds is Canadian, so he should be used to more challenging weather.\n\n\"Ironically, she coped with it far better than I did,\" Reynolds admitted.\n\nThe two are clearly allowing work to help make up for lost time. Lively has been a brilliant presence on the Cannes Film Festival red carpets as Reynolds shows off his film at Cannes. The film is part of the official festival competition.\n\nCaptives also gave him an opportunity to work with respected Canadian director Atom Egoyan.\n\n\"I felt privileged to get the chance just to be there,\" says Reynolds of shooting the movie.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "Ryan Reynolds started off his marriage to Blake Lively with a supremely romantic 2012 honeymoon following their...", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
