This is what it must be like dealing with a government agency in a third-world country.\u201d\n\nThat was the lament on Twitter of just one poor citizen this week trying to get his tax records in order.\n\nNationwide, hard-working Americans are struggling to meet the April 18 IRS filing deadline. Standing in the way: the bumbling ObamaCare bureaucracy.\n\nIn Minnesota, an estimated 18,000 people who were on health insurance plans last year offered through MNsure, the state ObamaCare health insurance exchange, still haven\u2019t received their 1095-A form. It\u2019s the \u2018\u2018health insurance marketplace statement\u201d required to file accurate tax returns and claim the premium tax credit.\n\nTwin Cities officials blame \u2018\u2018technical bugs\u201d and promise they\u2019ll be sending more of the documents out next week. But it\u2019s small consolation to farmers in Minnesota who were required to file their taxes by March 1.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is the second year in a row MNsure has been late sending my 1095-A form and it\u2019s cost me extra money when I have to file for an extension on my tax filings,\u201d farmer Robert Marg of Winona County, Minnesota, told his local TV station.\n\nIn Hawaii, the paper-pushers sent out their 1095-A forms on time \u2014 but the documents are worthless to thousands of taxpayers enrolled in the state\u2019s now-defunct ObamaCare exchange, the Hawaii Health Connector. According to the Pacific Business News, \u2018\u2018approximately 80 percent of the forms sent out to taxpayers\u201d contain errors, including address problems.\n\nThe Aloha State is still digging out from the mess the overseers of the bankrupted state exchange made last year, when Hawaii Health Connector staff issued 1095-A forms manually because the bureaucracy didn\u2019t have a working automated system for creating 1095-As. How many taxpayers were affected? \u2018\u2018CMS and IRS have not been able to provide error rates for 2014,\u201d PBN reported.\n\nWhat century is this?\n\nAfter I reported on my own bizarro 1095-A nightmare last year and revisited the ObamaCare tax-time troubles last week in Conservative Review, I gathered yet more horror stories.

I just want my 1095A or B form.\n\n#nomoreescalationsplease,\u201d one ObamaCare hostage wrote.\n\n\u2018\u2018So apparently you have to re-escalate the escalation of the escalation. All to get my 1095A. This is INSANE,\u201d another wrote.\n\nOne reader detailed for me how she had withdrawn from Covered California, the state\u2019s exchange, in 2014, yet received 1095-A forms two years in a row incorrectly showing that she was enrolled.\n\nInsurer Anthem \u2018\u2018said that they called Covered California and reported that I did not have coverage for 2015,\u201d the reader told me. \u2018\u2018Then 45 days later, we received a corrected 1095. However, it was not corrected. It was the same 1095 we previously received containing the same mistakes. After being on hold for 40 minutes with Covered California, the person I spoke with said, Yes, I was not covered in 2015, but no one had gone into the system to generate a corrected 1095 and that I will be receiving the new one within 45 days.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, that will be after April 15 when I am due to file taxes. What a nightmare.\u201d\n\nYet another reader lamented that DC politicians have been deaf to their plight. \u2018\u2018Thank you so much for the kindness in responding to me,\u201d she wrote after we traded stories. \u2018\u2018I am not kidding, I just about cried that a real human being has finally heard me.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I know we are nobodies in the world.
