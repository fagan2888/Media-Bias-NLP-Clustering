But although the enrollment period opened Tuesday, there wasn't a lot for Beres to do.\n\n\"Things aren't working the way they should be right now,\" she said.\n\nThere were some technical glitches on the government website Healthcare.gov where people go to compare insurance plans and enroll. A security question failed to appear, which kept people from creating an account.\n\n\"We take that as a good sign,\" Beres said. \"I think that means there's a lot of traffic on that website so you're getting a lot of interest in the marketplace.\"\n\nBeres is located at the Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland. Other Cleveland community health centers offering enrollment assistance are Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Services, Care Alliance and Neighborhood Family Practice.\n\nBeres and the other certified application counselors do not tell clients which insurance plans to choose. They simply help them sort through the plans and answer questions.\n\nBeres said anyone who couldn't enroll Tuesday should be patient. The enrollment period is six months.\n\n\"We have a lot of time to figure this out and get people enrolled,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "Enrollment in the Obamacare Health Insurance Marketplace got off to a slow start in northeast Ohio Tuesday because of technical glitches on the government website.", "author": "Deb Lee, newsnet5.com", "og": {"site_name": "newsnet5", "description": "Enrollment in the Obamacare Health Insurance Marketplace got off to a slow start in northeast Ohio Tuesday because of technical glitches on the government website.", "title": "Insurance enrollment under Affordable Care Act off to a slow start in Cleveland", "url": "http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/insurance-enrollment-under-affordable-care-act-off-to-a-slow-start-in-cleveland", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.newsnet5.com//photo/2013/10/01/Exchange_Navigators_965970000_20131001175510_640_480.JPG", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481449100, "iphone": 487296004}}, "site": "@wews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Glitches slow down insurance enrollment", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.newsnet5.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 117981068372285}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Deb Lee, newsnet5.com"}, "keywords": "Local news, Cleveland, metro, cuyahoga county, cuyahoga", "google-site-verification": "DiabNvdHVXRDa2QCnoOOtjKaIvq8CtH1446fPeFerd0", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WEWS5", "section": "Cleveland Metro", "tag": "cleveland, obamacare, affordablecareact, deblee", "published_time": "2013-10-01T23:33:45+0000", "modified_time": "2013-10-01T23:33:45+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "CLEVELAND - Justine Beres has been trained to assist northeast Ohio residents who need help enrolling in the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nOther Cleveland community health centers offering enrollment assistance are Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Services, Care Alliance and Neighborhood Family Practice.\nThere were some technical glitches on the government website Healthcare.gov where people go to compare insurance plans and enroll.\nBut although the enrollment period opened Tuesday, there wasn't a lot for Beres to do.\nThe enrollment period is six months."}
