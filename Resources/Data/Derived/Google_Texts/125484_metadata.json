What it\u2019s about is showing just how totally relatable and adorably authentic and marvelously self-aware is this president of ours. \u2018Can I live?\u2019 the president says when caught shooting imaginary hoops in his study by a young visitor. \u2018You do you,\u2019 the visitor gamely replies before walking off\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2018You do you\u2019 is the ultimate self-referential slogan for the ultimate self-referential presidency. It\u2019s the \u2018be yourself\u2019 piety of our age turned into a political license by Mr. Obama to do as he pleases. It\u2019s what drives his political choices: the immigration amnesty; arbitrary rewrites of the Affordable Care Act; the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s coal rules; the $128 billion in settlements the administration extorted from six banks convicted of no wrongdoing.\n\nThis is a fair criticism of a man we elect to execute our laws, not spice up our social lives. But our president\u2019s demeanor implicates quite a lot of other people Stephens doesn\u2019t discuss (perhaps for lack of space). Count among them the 65 million who voted for Obama in 2012. But even those of us who didn\u2019t vote for President Obama are guilty of behaving similarly, and not in trivial ways. If one believes, as I do, that \u201cpolitics is downstream from culture\u201d (or at least that the two have a symbiotic, sometimes parasitic, relationship), then it\u2019s not just President Obama reveling in \u201cyou do you.\u201d It\u2019s all of us.\n\nDon\u2019t Like Politics or Culture? Blame Yourself In his Republic, Plato famously constructed a fake city, then used it as an analogy for the inner workings of human beings. By magnifying and labeling the human mind and soul this way, he asserted, we could more easily discover the meaning of justice. There are lots of debates over whether he really meant it all, or specific parts, but I do think it\u2019s clear that a body politic reflects its composition. What our politicians assert is reasonable and just are generally what the polls tell them we think is reasonable and just. There are a few statesmen who attempt to \u201crefine and enlarge the public views,\u201d as Madison (perhaps too optimistically) predicted in Federalist No. 10, but my close interactions with politicians and their staff have indicated nearly all follow, rather than shape, public opinion.\n\nWhat our politicians assert is reasonable and just are generally what the polls tell them we think is reasonable and just. President Obama and his far-Left allies may be genuinely far afield of public opinion on almost every major issue, but he keeps getting elected despite this, and that is our own damn fault. That so many in the electorate either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care that Obama voted to protect people who kill babies delivered alive is a genuine moral problem with us as a people. And that\u2019s no excuse for blame-shifting or attempting to \u201cotherize\u201d the \u201cbad people.\u201d We\u2019re all bad. We all participate in and perpetuate this situation.\n\nA portion of the blame for traces directly back to the \u201cyou do you\u201d attitude. Americans have grown unwilling to tell or hint to family and neighbors when they\u2019re not living up to the best possibilities open to them, or making choices that create a better future for us all. \u201cYou do you,\u201d we imply or forthrightly chorus when confronted with friends who live on borrowed money, couples who delayed childbearing to near physical impossibility so decide to destroy a few embryos for the sake of snatching lost time, or bums who won\u2019t get out of mom and dad\u2019s basement. \u201cYou do you\u201d we nod along with TV personalities when they celebrate Bruce Jenner\u2019s psychological confusion. \u201cYou do you\u201d we imply when friends run through a series of live-in boyfriends and moan to us about why they can\u2019t ever get a man to commit, while we never drop a hint about why that might be. \u201cYou do you\u201d we tell high school students (and their parents) aiming for college, when tech school or an apprenticeship would be a wiser choice.\n\nTry Developing Some Accountability Muscles I\u2019m not suggesting we start marching around condemning everyone else for all their stupid decisions. God knows we\u2019ve all made them. But the fact of our brokenness doesn\u2019t mean we shrug our shoulders at it, or deny it exists. It doesn\u2019t mean we give up and withdraw. It doesn\u2019t mean that we succumb to mass despair. Can\u2019t we be authentic about the reality that our authentic selves are in need of continual improvement?\n\nYour real friends inform you when there\u2019s spinach in your teeth, and they tell you when you\u2019d better get back there and apologize to your husband, because you\u2019re being an idiot. We all could use some assistance in learning and carrying through on what is right. So, for example, I\u2019ve authorized my little boy to point it out me when I\u2019m losing my temper at home. His little finger pointed at me while he says, \u201cStop, momma!\u201d does make a difference, and bless him for it. There are some stores I don\u2019t set foot in any more now that the family budget is graduate-school-sized. I\u2019ve taken license a few times to advise young married and first-baby friends about financial and child discipline, hoping to pass on what we\u2019ve learned from our mistakes. Sometimes they don\u2019t listen, but at least I said it. At least I delivered the message in as loving a fashion as I could figure. And, remember, telling the truth means love. Your real friends inform you when there\u2019s spinach in your teeth, and they tell you when you\u2019d better get back there and apologize to your husband, because you\u2019re being an idiot.\n\nIn short, if we want accountability at the highest levels of politics, business, and culture, we have to start creating the social infrastructure for it from the ground up. People talk a big game about accountability, but nobody likes to have a friend commissioned to ask them how many times they swore in front of the kids this week, much less whether they\u2019re strictly following tax laws (as best they can figure them out) or how they are saving for retirement so they don\u2019t have to burden taxpayers. But if we have attenuated accountability muscles for our own lives, how can we ever expect to exercise them upon politicians, too?\n\nOur Deep-Rooted Narcissism Requires Restraint Narcissism can only be dispelled by its opposite: humility. Not false humility, but a genuine openness to learning what we\u2019re doing wrong, and in correcting course, because the truth is there\u2019s no way we\u2019re doing it all (or even very much) right.\n\nThis is the humility at the heart of conservatism (by way of Christianity): The belief that man is inherently flawed. This is the humility, by the way, at the heart of conservatism (by way of Christianity): The belief that man is inherently flawed. This leads us to restrain government because, by necessity, all its laws are created and carried out by inherently messed-up human beings. So we limit their power. This same principle applies in private life. We need limits. We need friends to bring it up when wife is distressed because husband spends too much money on his boat, or not enough time helping out with the kids. We need that little boy with his upheld finger shouting, \u201cStop!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 07:44:49 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "President Obama's narcissism helps us ask, 'Do we really want to behave this way, given the consequences?'", "title": "President Obama's Narcissism Reflects Our Own", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BuzzfeedObama1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-20T07:45:07+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/02/18/president-obamas-narcissism-reflects-our-own/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "President Obama's narcissism helps us ask, 'Do we really want to behave this way, given the consequences?'", "title": "President Obama's Narcissism Reflects Our Own", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BuzzfeedObama1.jpg"}, "creator": "@JoyPullmann", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Culture", "tag": "accountability,BuzzFeed,human nature,humility,narcissism,Plato,President Obama,Progressivism,sin nature,The Republic,You Do You", "published_time": "2015-02-18T07:44:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-20T07:45:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama's narcissism helps us ask, 'Do we really want to behave this way, given the consequences?'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bff\"", "article_summary": "But even those of us who didn\u2019t vote for President Obama are guilty of behaving similarly, and not in trivial ways.\nPresident Obama and his far-Left allies may be genuinely far afield of public opinion on almost every major issue, but he keeps getting elected despite this, and that is our own damn fault.\nWe need friends to bring it up when wife is distressed because husband spends too much money on his boat, or not enough time helping out with the kids.\nWhat it\u2019s about is showing just how totally relatable and adorably authentic and marvelously self-aware is this president of ours.\n\u2018Can I live?\u2019 the president says when caught shooting imaginary hoops in his study by a young visitor."}
