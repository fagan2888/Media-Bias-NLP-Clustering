Ted Cruz of Texas have dismissed the proposal as a lot of ill-conceived hot air. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America,\u201d Cruz told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in Iowa five weeks ago in Iowa. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we enforce the law for any crime.\u201d\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Rejects Trump\u2019s Plan to Deport 12 Million Illegal Immigrants\n\nBut Cruz has taken a tumble since he beat Trump and the rest of the GOP field in the Iowa caucuses Feb. 1. He is struggling to overcome poor showings in New Hampshire and South Carolina and to weather attacks from Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who accuse him of dirty campaign tricks and lying about his opponents\u2019 records. On Monday, Cruz had to fire his campaign spokesman, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Rubio.\n\nIn a thinly veiled attempt to rekindle conservative support for his campaign, Cruz said Monday evening on Fox News that \u2013 if elected president \u2013 he would deploy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to round up and deport the 11 million to 12 million people living in the country illegally.\n\nCruz reaffirmed his support for Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall, while tripling the Border Patrol and bolstering funding for ICE. When asked by Fox Host Bill O\u2019Reilly whether he would \u201clook for\u201d illegal immigrants to round up and deport, Cruz replied: \u201cLook, Bill, of course you would. That\u2019s what ICE exists for. We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws, that apprehend them and deports them.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons the Trump Immigration Plan Doesn\u2019t Pass the Reality Test\n\nCruz spokesperson Catherine Frazier told the Dallas Morning News that \u201cThere\u2019s no change here\u201d in her boss\u2019s position, although it sure sounded like it.\n\n\u201cCruz has been very clear: People who are here illegally should be deported,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThat is the law today. Period. They broke the law, they face the consequence. ICE exists for that purpose and they should continue to do their job. And on top of that, any law enforcement that encounters those here illegally should follow the law and deport them.\u201d\n\nTrump, campaigning in Nevada today as he seeks another big victory in tonight\u2019s GOP caucuses, gleefully criticized Cruz for toughening his position after finishing a disappointing third to Trump and Rubio in South Carolina last Saturday. \"Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nA new NBC News/Survey Monkey poll shows the billionaire Trump still leading the GOP presidential pack nationwide with 36 percent of the Republican vote, followed by Cruz with 19 percent, Rubio at 16 percent, Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 8 percent and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson with 8 percent.\n\nRelated: 9 Trump Positions that Make Liberals Want to Move to Canada\n\nRubio, one of the architects of a stymied Senate comprehensive immigration plan that would have granted millions of illegal immigrants a path to legal status or even citizenship, said recently that he would not deport 12 million people in the U.S. illegally, and would instead propose solutions to accommodate those who have no criminal record.\n\n\"We're not going to round up and deport 12 million people,\" Rubio told the Associated Press during a campaign trip in eastern Iowa. \"Criminals can't stay. Felons, people who are dangerous \u2014 they are not staying,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has had relatively little to say in recent months", "title": "A Struggling Cruz Doubles Down on Mass Deportation", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/23/One-Eye-Trump-Cruz-Gets-Tough-Illegal-Immigrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/23/One-Eye-Trump-Cruz-Gets-Tough-Illegal-Immigrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has had relatively little to say in recent months", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration,\" Trump tweeted.\nWhen asked by Fox Host Bill O\u2019Reilly whether he would \u201clook for\u201d illegal immigrants to round up and deport, Cruz replied: \u201cLook, Bill, of course you would.\n\"We're not going to round up and deport 12 million people,\" Rubio told the Associated Press during a campaign trip in eastern Iowa.\nOn Monday, Cruz had to fire his campaign spokesman, Rick Tyler, for spreading a misleading video about Rubio.\n\"Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C."}
