A new case study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms the high risk for adverse outcomes when a pregnant woman contracts the Zika virus.The study was small--only nine pregnant women who had confirmed cases of the virus--but all the women had at least one of the four most commonly observed symptoms (fever, rash, conjunctivitis or arthralgia). Six of the women reported symptoms during the first trimester. Two of those women suffered miscarriages, two decided to terminate their pregnancies, one delivered an infant with microcephaly and one pregnancy is continuing.
