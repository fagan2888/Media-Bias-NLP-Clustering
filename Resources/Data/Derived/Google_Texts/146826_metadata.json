But even by that standard, Wednesday, April 22, was particularly fraught.\n\nIn the imposing state capitol that Huey Long built, the Senate Finance Committee was wrestling with a complicated cost-cutting scheme to repeal an inventory tax that businesses pay to local governments and that the state rebates to the businesses, all while promising to somehow make stressed-out local leaders whole.\n\nJust down the road, Louisiana State University President and Chancellor F. King Alexander said that the state\u2019s flagship university, which could lose 80 percent of state funding after years of already deep cuts, was developing a worst-case scenario plan for financial exigency\u2014basically the academic equivalent of bankruptcy.\n\nIn the midst of it all came a message from Republican Governor Bobby Jindal, whose policies and priorities have contributed mightily to the state\u2019s fiscal mess.\n\n\u201cHelp wish my friends Willie, Phil and Si a happy birthday,\u201d said the tweet, which was accompanied by a photo of Willie Robertson, whose family is featured on the popular homegrown reality TV show Duck Dynasty. It then directed readers to the website for the American Future Project, a 527 issue advocacy group that Jindal has set up in advance of his anticipated presidential run.\n\nIf the tweet suggests a stunning disconnect from the dire budget situation that\u2019s unfolding on his watch, well, that\u2019s how it is these days.\n\nA Pure Record on Taxes\n\nJindal, a hard-charging former Rhodes Scholar, has always nursed grander ambitions, and voters generally gave him a pass. That was when things were going well.\n\nThese days they\u2019re not, and Jindal\u2019s focus on the upcoming presidential primaries has taken a toll back home. While he was popular and powerful enough to avoid a reelection fight in 2011, by 2015 his approval rating had sunk to 27 percent, according to one poll; a friendly survey by his own consulting firm pegged the number at 46 percent, hardly a resounding vote of confidence.\n\nIt\u2019s not just his frequent trips to places like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Washington, D.C., that have angered his constituents. (He spent 165 days out of state in 2014, according to The Advocate newspaper.) Nor is it only his odd forays into international and national affairs, from the tall tales in London about Muslim no-go zones, to his op-ed in The New York Times accusing companies that oppose religious freedom laws inspired by the spread of gay marriage of forming an unholy alliance with the \u201cradical liberals.\u201d It\u2019s not even his need to bask in the Robertsons\u2019 reflected glory.\n\nMore than any of that, his constituents are frustrated that their governor can\u2019t be bothered to do his day job\u2014and when he does, that his actions are often transparently designed to build a national profile rather than meet Louisiana\u2019s needs.\n\nThat\u2019s clear in his refusal to take federal money to expand Medicaid\u2014which, of course, would mean acknowledging there are benefits to Obama\u2019s health care law. But nowhere is it more obvious, or more damaging, than in Jindal\u2019s stewardship of fiscal affairs.\n\nJindal chalks up the current budget shortfall to the drop in oil prices, and that\u2019s definitely contributed. A larger piece of the puzzle has been his determination to maintain a pure record on taxes.\n\nJindal hasn\u2019t always been reckless about taxation. In the midst of a budget surplus early in his first term, Jindal tried to quietly head off the Legislature\u2019s move to roll back a big income tax increase that had been enacted several years earlier. It was only after lawmakers seemed like they might eliminate the income tax entirely that he got on board with the rollback, and he soon was boasting that he\u2019d signed the biggest tax cut in state history.\n\nThe first real glimpse of the future came in 2011 when Jindal fought tooth and nail against extending a temporary four-cent levy on the state\u2019s cigarette tax\u2014at 36 cents, including the levy, the third lowest in the nation. His reasoning? If the tax rate is scheduled to automatically drop and the state acts to prevent that from happening, it amounts to an effective tax increase.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Rhodes scholar seemed bound for big things.
