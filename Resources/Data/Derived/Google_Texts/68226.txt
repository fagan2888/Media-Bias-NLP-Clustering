In case you were wondering, Dr. Ben Carson won’t be President Obama‘s Surgeon General. And even if asked, he would absolutely, 100 percent refuse. I know, I know, the chances of any of that actually happening are zilch to zip, but Carson just wanted to make it clear on Hugh Hewitt‘s show today that even if Obama asked him to step in to deal with this current Ebola crisis, he would refuse.

Hewitt asked Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, if he would serve in that position under Obama. Carson said, “No, because I would, if I were going to serve in that position, I would have to serve under someone that I trusted.”

And even with Hewitt saying Obama would hypothetically be telling him he wouldn’t interfere in any way, and he just needs someone to make sure the country is “calm and appropriately prepared,” Carson insisted he would still refuse. He suspected that there are plenty of government officials who are speaking on behalf of the White House and can’t exactly speak their minds right now, because if they did, the country might hear something altogether different.
