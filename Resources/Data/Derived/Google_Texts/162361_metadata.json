The nation\u2019s largest rooftop solar installer is coming to Rhode Island. Starting this week, California-based SolarCity will offer Rhode Islanders loans to buy home solar systems.\n\nSolarCity will offer homeowners in 10 Rhode Island cities and towns loans to buy solar panels for their homes with no money down. Homeowners would pay for the loan in monthly installments, said Lee Keshishian, the company\u2019s vice president for its East Coast operations.\n\n\u201cOur model is offering a system that we would install for free,\u201d said Keshishian, \u201cand then you pay over time for the system with the power savings that you are getting off of it.\u201d\n\nThat means monthly payments will be based on how much electricity the solar panels produce.\n\n\u201cSay for example, we have a system installed in your home that offsets maybe 50 percent of your consumption and you have a $200 electric bill\u2014just making easy numbers here\u2014you 'd still have a bill from the utility of $100 a month,\u201d said Keshishian, \u201cbut you have now a payment to us that\u2019s may be $70 a month.\u201d\n\nCustomers may pay off their loans faster if the panels produce more energy than projected.\n\nSolarCity started its business by leasing solar panel systems to its customers, but now offers this option to buy the solar panels after receiving feedback from its customers.\n\nThe company recently opened a warehouse in Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cWe like to be within 35 to 40 minutes of the majority of our customers that are serviced by a warehouse,\u201d said Keshishian. \u201cSo as we\u2019ve expanded, that\u2019s necessitated going further and opening up facilities to cover more geographic areas.\u201d\n\nThe Fall River, Massachusetts warehouse will service the communities of Coventry, Cranston, Cumberland, East Providence, Johnston, North Providence, South Kingstown, Warwick, West Warwick and Woonsocket.\n\nKeshishian said the company will soon open a warehouse in Rhode Island. The company expects to hire between 70 and 100 workers.\n\nKeshishian attributes the wide reach of SolarCity to at least a couple of factors: low upfront costs and the fast speed of installing solar panel systems. (Listen to NPR's PlanetMoney story on why solar energy has gotten cheap.)\n\nRhode Island is the 18th state where SolarCity is offering service, and the fourth in New England.\n\nDo you have insight or expertise on this topic?
