It was an election year, so he kicked off the meeting by discussing politics. He noted that the word comes from Greek, with \u201cpoli\u201d meaning \u201cmany,\u201d and \u201ctics\u201d meaning \u201cblood-sucking bugs that are hard to get rid of.\u201d Robin Williams used the same joke.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t speak for others, but this is why I believe Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee , even though he repels so many people. He points out what we all know \u2013 politicians regularly avoid hard questions, outright lie, and fail to follow through on much of what they promise.\n\nWe\u2019re tired of it. For many people, the answer is \u201canyone but a current politician.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make the Donald\u2019s campaign right or wrong. It\u2019s just a natural extension of where we\u2019ve been for way too long. We live in a divided world. Not between the rich and poor, but between those that suffer consequences for their actions and words, and those that get off scot-free.\n\nThe free-pass list starts with politicians and appointees, and isn\u2019t limited to one side of the aisle. We were lectured ad nauseam by former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner about sharing the burden of the recession, and how higher taxes were needed to rebuild the nation.\n\nThis is the guy who failed to pay his own taxes, blamed it on TurboTax, and got a free pass. Funny, I can\u2019t think of a single instance where anyone I know underpaid their taxes and wasn\u2019t hit with penalties and interest by the IRS .\n\nThis pales in comparison with the cost of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which politicians told us would be, as you might guess from the name, affordable.\n\nOf course, they also said any legislation would be posted online for three days before Congress voted, giving all Americans a chance to read it and weigh in. That\u2019s a far cry from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s declaration , \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pass it to see what\u2019s in it,\u201d about the ACA.\n\nNow we\u2019ve had it for three years, and premiums have increased by more than 10% per year. Premiums are expected to jump by more than 11% in 2017. My own premium more than doubled since 2010, as my coverage declined. I can\u2019t find a single politician who supported the Affordable Care Act who is willing to kick in for my insurance bill.\n\nShady Ratings Agencies Contribute to Financial Pain\n\nWe can\u2019t leave out the many contributors to the financial crisis. Sure, executives at banks that packaged trashy mortgages and sold them deserve a lot of blame, but there\u2019s one group that holds singular responsibility for the mess \u2013 the rating agencies.\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s are identified by the SEC as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO\u2019s), which allows other firms to rely on them for regulatory purposes. This gives the two companies enormous advantages in their market, which they used to make billions of dollars over the years.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThey slapped the highest ratings on a bunch of junk mortgage bonds to increase revenue. This is a fact, not a guess, as stated in court by several employees. When called out by companies that relied on their ratings, executives at the rating agencies claimed their ratings were mere opinions that are protected free speech. Not one of these cowards went to jail.\n\nAnd then there are central bankers, the lovely group of bureaucrats who steal from savers daily with exceptionally low and even negative interest rates, all in the hopes of driving economies higher. It hasn\u2019t worked for eight years, and has no prospect of working in the future, but hey, they\u2019re still trying!\n\nWhen do we get our money back? Unfortunately, I think I know the answer.\n\nAt least in the financial markets \u2013 absent government intervention, like we had with the auto industry and large banks \u2013 companies usually suffer for their bad acts.\n\nThat\u2019s why I cheer on equity sleuths like John Del Vecchio, who spend their days rooting out firms that, while not technically lying to investors, are doing everything they can to stretch the truth about their financial results .\n\nSo many companies use stock buybacks to boost their earnings per share, or strip out what they call \u201cone-time\u201d costs from quarterly results to improve their numbers, that it\u2019s hard to believe earnings when reported. With stock indexes near all-time highs, while GDP growth languishes near zero and rosy corporate earnings posting yet another decline, the time seems right for traders in John\u2019s Forensic Investor to profit handsomely.\n\nFinally, a consequence\u2026 and this one can actually deliver profits to investors.\n\nDISCLOSURE: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors, and do not represent the views of equities.com.
