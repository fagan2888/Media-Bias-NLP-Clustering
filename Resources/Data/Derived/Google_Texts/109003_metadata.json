Newman, a professor in the organization and human resources department at the University at Buffalo. \u201cThe issues of equity are foremost in the minds of at least the small business owners.\u201d\n\nAccording to Iwan Barankay, a professor of management at the Wharton School, we need to consider both the short- and long-run effects of a higher minimum wage. \u201cIn the short run, companies will struggle and jobs will be lost,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the long run, most of the additional wages go straight back into consumption.\u201d\n\nBarankay provided some context to the L.A. decision. He said some 77 million workers in the U.S. earn an hourly wage, of which only four percent -- or three million people -- are at or below the minimum wage. More than two-thirds of those three million are women, and the majority of them (67 percent) are young, aged between 16 and 25 years.\n\nHigher minimum wages are unlikely to displace jobs within states or cause the positions to move overseas, Barankay argued. About half of the minimum-wage jobs are in the food preparation business, such as waiters, baristas or fast-food workers. \u201cUnless you go for your mocha to another state, these jobs cannot really move,\u201d he said.\n\nSocial Unrest, Union Power\n\nNewman forecast trouble in the wake of the L.A. move. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause all kinds of social unrest within particular companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a hierarchy of wages in organizations and in our entire economy. People who have historically earned $5 or $6 more than the lowest-paid workers are now going to be agitating for increases, too.\u201d\n\nHigher wages tend to lead to more stable jobs, which bring in other unintended consequences, according to Newman. The fast food industry, Newman noted, has traditionally attracted a young demographic of high school or college students, who tend not to stay long in those jobs. He recalled how five years ago McDonald\u2019s tried to contain its labor turnover of 150 percent by hiring older workers. That backfired as those workers began demanding higher wages once they stayed on longer in their jobs.\n\nNewman predicted that a more stable workforce could lead to unions becoming more active. He noted that while unions have been in decline since their peak in the 1930s, they have tried to grow in the public sector, where their pie is getting smaller. In the private sector, only seven or eight percent of the workforce is unionized, he noted.\n\n\u201cSo this is the direction for [the unions] to go,\u201d Newman said. \u201cWhen you get all the fast food workers in the country, that would be a huge increase in numbers.\u201d Barankay agreed that a higher minimum wage could provide a pathway for unions to get stronger.\n\nWill Others Take the Cue?\n\nBoth Newman and Barankay suggested that other states and cities would take the cue from Los Angeles and introduce their own higher minimum wages. Other big U.S. cities that recently increased the hourly minimum wage include Chicago ($13 by 2019), San Francisco ($15 by 2018) and Seattle ($15 from April).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s a hot potato, but people will be watching this economic and social experiment in Los Angeles very closely,\u201d said Newman.\n\nBarankay predicted that more states and cities would decide to raise minimum wages as a preemptive move against employers trying to seize the initiative. For example, Walmart last February said it would increase wages to $10 over the next year. \u201cThere is such a strong wind in the sails of the $15 movement in the country that big employers try to weaken that wind and come up with a commitment themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in Knowledge@Wharton.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti recently announced an increase in the city\u2019s mini", "title": "How a Higher Minimum Wage Could Shake the Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/How-Higher-Minimum-Wage-Could-Shake-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12282011_McDonalds1_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/17/How-Higher-Minimum-Wage-Could-Shake-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12282011_McDonalds1_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti recently announced an increase in the city\u2019s mini", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c4a\"", "article_summary": "Higher minimum wages are unlikely to displace jobs within states or cause the positions to move overseas, Barankay argued.\nHe said some 77 million workers in the U.S. earn an hourly wage, of which only four percent -- or three million people -- are at or below the minimum wage.\n\u201cThe issues of equity are foremost in the minds of at least the small business owners.\u201dAccording to Iwan Barankay, a professor of management at the Wharton School, we need to consider both the short- and long-run effects of a higher minimum wage.\nBoth Newman and Barankay suggested that other states and cities would take the cue from Los Angeles and introduce their own higher minimum wages.\nOther big U.S. cities that recently increased the hourly minimum wage include Chicago ($13 by 2019), San Francisco ($15 by 2018) and Seattle ($15 from April)."}
