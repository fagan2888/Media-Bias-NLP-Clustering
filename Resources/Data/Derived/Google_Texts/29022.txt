Still, insurance can be confusing and aggressive sales agents only make the problem worse. To help clear things up, we're debunking some of the most pervasive myths about different types of insurance.

Auto Insurance

Myth: The color of the car your drive can impact your car insurance premium.

Plenty of people believe that red cars are more expensive to insure, but this is simply not true. Other factors do matter, like how old the car is and whether or not it has added safety features, but color doesn't matter. If a red car will make you happy, go ahead and buy it.

Renter's Insurance

Myth: Your landlord's insurance will cover your stuff if something happens to the building.

Your landlord has building insurance, but the coverage does not extend to replacing your stuff. That's your responsibility. Don't expect someone else to pick up the tab if your property is ruined or stolen. That's what renter's insurance is for.

Homeowner's Insurance

Myth: If something happens to your home, you'll be given the money to replace your items.

Many people mistakenly believe their homeowner's insurance will pay for them to replace an item if it's damaged or stolen, but that's not usually how it works. If you lose an old computer most policies won't foot the bill for a brand new one. All they'll give you is the amount of cash your old one was worth when you lost it. Policies do exist that cover full replacement of items, but you'll pay a higher monthly premium for those.
