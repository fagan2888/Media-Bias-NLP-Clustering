They set up a lab experiment in which \u201cmanagers\u201d hired people to complete mathematical tasks that, on average, men and women performed equally well.\n\nWith no information about the job \u201capplicants\u201d other than their appearance, the managers (of both sexes) were twice as likely to hire a man over a woman.\n\nThe professors, Ernesto Reuben of Columbia Business School, Paola Sapienza of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern and Luigi Zingales of the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, tried another version of the experiment, which they labeled \u201cCheap Talk.\u201d In this version, the job candidates were allowed to predict their own performance. Men tended to exaggerate their acumen, while women downplayed theirs. But the managers failed to compensate for that difference, and were again twice as likely to choose a man.\n\nThe bias persisted even when managers were given hard data about the applicants\u2019 ability to perform the tasks in question. Managers were still one-and-a-half times more likely to hire a man. When they knowingly chose the lower-performing candidate, two-thirds of the time they were choosing the male applicant.\n\nThe managers were also given an \u201cimplicit association test,\u201d or I.A.T., to measure their gender bias when it comes to math and science. \u201cThe very people who are biased against women about math, they\u2019re also less likely to believe that men boast,\u201d Mr. Zingales said. \u201cSo they\u2019re picking up a negative stereotype of women, but not a negative stereotype of men.\u201d\n\nThe study showed that hard evidence could reduce prejudice, Mr. Zingales said, but that it was even more important for managers to understand their own preexisting beliefs. \u201cAnyone can do an I.A.T., and if they know that they are biased they should correct for that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Zingales said the findings could apply to graduate school admissions as much as to the workplace. And, he said, they also shed light on why many women opt out of science and technology majors before they even reach graduation \u2014 they may assume that the negative response they are getting is based on their actual performance. \u201cPeople don\u2019t even learn,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they are equally capable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140310172006, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 10, 2014", "keywords": "Discrimination,Science and Technology,Women and Girls,Economix", "GBLC": "Economix", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Study: Women Who Can Do Math Still Don't Get Hired ( 20140310 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Shaila Dewan", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Shaila Dewan", "byl": "Shaila Dewan", "twitter": {"description": "Managers, of either sex, tended to hire men over women when the criteria was math skills, three business school professor found.
