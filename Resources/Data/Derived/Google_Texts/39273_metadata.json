We have since made friends on all sides, deep behind \u201cenemy lines.\u201d\n\nSince the fall of Mosul to Sunni militants in June, the world has struggled to accept the failure of the American project in Iraq, the rise of \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d and the marking of Iraqi Christians and other minorities for death or expropriation.\n\nThe world may watch from afar and denounce all Iraqi Muslims as militants bent on conquest. But up close, the reality is very different.\n\nIt was a Muslim cleric who may have saved this Christian's life. And I'm not the only one.\n\nEven as jihadists justify their atrocities in the name of Islam, millions of Muslims are standing in solidarity with Christians who have been expelled from their homes.\n\nIn Najaf, displaced Christians are being housed in the most revered holy site in Shia Islam. Sunnis, Shia, and Christians worship side by side in Baghdad, praying for the peace and future of Iraq.\n\nOur first six months in Iraq were difficult. The lack of electricity and water, the drive-by shootings, the explosions that more than rattled our windows \u2014 they shook our souls.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until we began helping a little girl who needed lifesaving heart surgery that we could drive back the gripping fear. Working with her father to save her life injected meaning into an otherwise confusing conflict.\n\nSoon after, word began to spread that we were helping \u201clast chance children\u201d who had been rejected by the other humanitarian aid organizations. The larger organizations looked at pediatric heart surgery and saw nothing but risk.\n\nWe spent tens of thousands of dollars sending children outside the country to Israel and Turkey for surgery. Soon Sunnis and Shia, Kurds and Christians were lining up in our office in search of hope.\n\nOne day in a hotel lobby I bumped into a Muslim cleric decked out in robes and headdress and found myself fumbling for words. We had been taught to fear these types of clerics. They were supposed to be the crazies who promoted suicide bombings and sectarianism.\n\nBut that wasn't the case with Sheikh Ali.\n\n\u201cPeace be upon you,\u201d he said with a huge smile. \u201cWe are here as a conference of Muslim scholars. We are against the terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe sheikh welcomed me for tea with 10 other clerics and, at great personal risk, welcomed me deeper into his life.\n\nOver time, Ali joined our effort to eradicate the backlog of children who were waiting for these lifesaving surgeries. He introduced me to Muslim leaders. He told me stories about fending off Shia militias as they sought to capture his neighborhood hospital and turn it into a partisan outpost.\n\nWhen a top Sunni cleric issued a fatwa calling for our death because we sent children to Israel for surgery, our lives turned upside down.\n\nIt was Sheikh Ali who defended us against his friend, arguing that if we had saved just one life, as the Quran said, it was as if we had saved the whole of humanity.\n\nHe may have saved our lives with that move, but he fell out with the cleric after sending us a baby girl from his own mosque who needed surgery.\n\nDemand for our work at Preemptive Love Coalition rose as international news reported on Iraq's shocking birth-defect crisis. We stopped sending children abroad and partnered with the Iraqi government to train Iraqis in their own hospitals.\n\nHeart surgery is full of meaning in every culture, but especially in Iraq, where fathers find themselves begging anyone who will listen to donate blood while their child lies vulnerable in the operating room.\n\nOnce enemies have each other\u2019s blood coursing through their veins, or your nemesis is holding your child\u2019s heart in his hands, it is impossible to hate without condemning oneself, as well.\n\nWe know the world is not all rainbows and roses. There is a version of Islam out there that is dangerous and scary.\n\nBut there are far more Muslims like Sheikh Ali.\n\nThere is a lesson to learn from the fatwa that called for our death: It\u2019s not violence or pre-emptive strikes that terrify the terrorists. They need violence to be done against them to justify their cause.\n\nBut pre-emptive love \u2014 shown through heart surgeries or simple hospitality \u2014 upends our simplistic stories and threatens hatred everywhere.\n\nOr, in the words of the fatwa issued against our work:\n\n\u201cWe must stop [these heart surgeries] lest it lead our children and their parents to love their enemies!\u201d\n\nGod willing, Preemptive Love Coalition will mark our 1,000th operation next month in Iraq, with the help of Christian donors and Muslim sponsors like Sheikh Ali.\n\nOne thousand children, with thousands of fathers, mothers, aunts, and uncles across Iraq.\n\nWe\u2019ve drunk their tea, celebrated miracle birthdays, and prayed for their children as they go off to school. The Iraqis we are training will save the lives of tens of thousands more.\n\nSo, in the end, I have to admit the cleric was right: Pre-emptive love does work. It destroys enemies by making them friends.\n\nJeremy Courtney is executive director of Preemptive Love Coalition, an international development organization in Iraq, and author of \"Preemptive Love: Pursuing Peace One Heart at a Time.\" The views expressed in this column belong to Courtney.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinion by Jeremy Courtney, special to CNN (CNN)\u00a0--We had no idea what we were doing, so we helped everyone.
