I had to struggle for change in circumstance. It\u2019s just unacceptable,\u201d Jewett told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nAn estimated 14,000 Vermonters are tied up in \u201cchange of circumstance\u201d glitches with Vermont Health Connect. Since CGI launched the site this past October, health officials have received a steady stream of complaints from people unable to make adjustments to plans online.\n\nChief of Health Care Reform Lawrence Miller explained CGI\u2019s firing in a statement to press.\n\n\u201cFor many, Vermont Health Connect works as it should. For others, the system is still failing them and causing deep frustration. That is unacceptable to me, and we will explore every option and take every step to make this system work for all Vermonters,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s changes are steps in that direction and more can be expected in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nVermont has paid CGI $57 million of an $83 million contract. The state will pay CGI an additional $9.7 million through Sept. 20 for completed work. The Department of Vermont Health Access announced it will transition the remaining work to Optum.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time CGI has been fired.\n\nThe Obama administration canned CGI in January after the government services firm failed to deliver an exchange website for the federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov. Massachusetts announced in March it was dumping the firm due to technical failures. The company\u2019s contract with Hawaii is currently under fire for the same technical hang-ups.\n\nClick for more from Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Northeast/Vermont,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Northeast", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 08:58:51 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The state of Vermont has fired CGI, the technology firm responsible for creating the Vermont Health Connect website.", "twitter": {"description": "The state of Vermont has fired CGI, the technology firm responsible for creating the Vermont Health Connect website.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/05/vermont-fires-creator-its-unacceptable-glitchy-obamacare-site.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/080514/0/0/080514_hn_barber2_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Vermont fires creator of its \u2018unacceptable,\u2019 glitchy ObamaCare site", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Northeast/Vermont\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Northeast\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Vermont fires creator of its \\u2018unacceptable,\\u2019 glitchy ObamaCare site\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/080514/0/0/080514_hn_barber2_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-05T11:58:05Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/05/vermont-fires-creator-its-unacceptable-glitchy-obamacare-site.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"83a1e6f0-ecec-47ff-b473-249507031f4d\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "The state of Vermont has fired CGI, the technology firm responsible for creating the Vermont Health Connect website.", "dc.identifier": "83a1e6f0-ecec-47ff-b473-249507031f4d", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "vermont,healthcare,northeast", "description": "The state of Vermont has fired CGI, the technology firm responsible for creating the Vermont Health Connect website.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "watchdog.org", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Vermont Fires Creator Of Its \u2018unacceptable,\u2019 Glitchy Obamacare Site", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-31 08:58:51 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The state of Vermont has fired CGI, the technology firm responsible for creating the Vermont Health Connect website.", "title": "Vermont fires creator of its \u2018unacceptable,\u2019 glitchy ObamaCare site | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/05/vermont-fires-creator-its-unacceptable-glitchy-obamacare-site.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/080514/0/0/080514_hn_barber2_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-08-05", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Northeast/Vermont\",\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Northeast\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Vermont fires creator of its \\u2018unacceptable,\\u2019 glitchy ObamaCare site\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/080514/0/0/080514_hn_barber2_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-05T11:58:05Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/05/vermont-fires-creator-its-unacceptable-glitchy-obamacare-site.html\",\"post_id\":\"83a1e6f0-ecec-47ff-b473-249507031f4d\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7290\"", "article_summary": "The state of Vermont has fired CGI, the technology firm responsible for creating the Vermont Health Connect website.\n\u201cFor many, Vermont Health Connect works as it should.\nAn estimated 14,000 Vermonters are tied up in \u201cchange of circumstance\u201d glitches with Vermont Health Connect.\nThe Department of Vermont Health Access announced it will transition the remaining work to Optum.\nHouse Majority Leader Willem Jewett, D-Ripton, was among thousands of Vermonters unable to sign up properly through the site."}
