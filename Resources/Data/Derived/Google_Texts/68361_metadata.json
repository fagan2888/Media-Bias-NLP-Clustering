There are a number of reasons I am supporting Nancy Rotering for Congress and this is the one of the most important.\n\nHis support for specific legislation (HR 2575) would have deprived health care benefits to those who need it most. This legislation, supported by Schneider, would have changed the definition of \"full-time employee\" under the Affordable Care Act. Currently, employers must provide health care for any employee who works an average of at least 30 hours a week. HR 2575 would have changed the law so employers would be required only to offer health care to employees who work a minimum of 40 hours.\n\nThis bill would have undermined Obamacare by reducing the number of employees receiving health insurance coverage. That is why the Obama administration adamantly was against the legislation. All Republicans and only 18 Democrats voted for it (only Schneider and Daniel Lipinski in Illinois).\n\nI heard Schneider try to downplay this serious error in judgment by saying on WTTW Channel 11 recently that this was just a change in \"category definition\" \u2013 which he had to know was false. In fact, this change in \"category definition\" would have forced 1 million people to lose their health insurance coverage and increase the number of uninsured. The independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office conducted that analysis.\n\nAs the director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services during the critical period when the Affordable Care Act was being implemented, I saw the immediate benefits in terms of improved lives and cost savings. I remain today totally committed to the continued expansion of and access to health care. That's why I am supporting Nancy Rotering, who has the professional background and values I believe in and the strength to pursue them effectively. I hope you will too.\n\nJulie Hamos\n\nEvanston", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Letter: Brad Schneider trying to hide harmful health care vote", "Description": "Julie Hamos, an Evanston resident, former state representative and former director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services pledges her support in the 10th District Democratic primary race to Nancy Rotering.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Dear Editor:", "title": "Letter: Brad Schneider trying to hide harmful health care vote", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/community/ct-evr-letter-schneider-rotering-tl-0307-20160307-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56ddad2c/turbine/ct-evr-letter-schneider-rotering-tl-0307-20160307", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/86136997", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-03-07", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Currently, employers must provide health care for any employee who works an average of at least 30 hours a week.\nHis support for specific legislation (HR 2575) would have deprived health care benefits to those who need it most.\nI remain today totally committed to the continued expansion of and access to health care.\nHR 2575 would have changed the law so employers would be required only to offer health care to employees who work a minimum of 40 hours.\nThis legislation, supported by Schneider, would have changed the definition of \"full-time employee\" under the Affordable Care Act."}
