She said the man\u2019s last name is Dillion but gave no other details.\n\nDozens of people have claimed to be the sandy-haired Etan since he vanished on his way to school. He was among the first missing children to be pictured on milk cartons. His mother, Julie Patz, testified about some of the claims earlier at the trial.\n\nDetectives on the case over the years have received thousands of fruitless tips. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon said the calls continue as the trial gets publicity.\n\n\u201cAs this trial goes on \u2026 reported in the media, we get phone calls from people,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are concerned that maybe they\u2019re Etan.\u201d\n\nMs. Illuzzi-Orbon handed over a police report to attorneys for Pedro Hernandez, who is on trial in Etan\u2019s death after confessing to choking the boy.\n\nMr. Hernandez was a teenage stock clerk at a convenience store near where the boy\u2019s bus stop was located. He has said he lured Etan to the basement with a promise of a soda and then killed him, stuffed the body in a bag, put the bag in a produce box and tossed it a few blocks away.\n\nDefense attorneys say that the confession is the fictional ravings of a mentally ill man and that longtime suspect Jose Ramos, a convicted pedophile, is the real killer. They suggested the store was too busy for a murder to take place unseen. But a former store worker testified this week that he was once injured in the basement of the convenience store, and no one could hear him scream for help.\n\nMr. Ramos, who remains jailed on a Megan\u2019s Law violation, was never charged criminally and says he didn\u2019t do it. But he was declared responsible for Etan\u2019s death in a civil court.\n\nMs. Illuzzi-Orbon legally had to disclose the information to the attorneys. The trial is proceeding.\n\nEtan\u2019s body was never found, nor was any stitch of clothing.\n\nAfter his shocking disappearance, Etan\u2019s parents helped modernize how law enforcement nationwide handles cases of missing children. May 25, the day he vanished, became National Missing Children\u2019s Day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A man who thinks he could be Etan Patz was interviewed by police amid the murder trial of a suspect accused in the boy's 1979 disappearance, prosecutors said Tuesday, noting they have received similar calls before.", "Author": "COLLEEN LONG", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A man who thinks he could be Etan Patz was interviewed by police amid the murder trial of a suspect accused in the boy\u2019s 1979 disappearance, prosecutors said Tuesday, noting they have received similar calls before.", "title": "Man claims to be missing boy Etan Patz amid murder trial", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/3/amid-murder-trial-man-calls-to-say-he-could-be-eta/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/c626785ee80dd12e660f6a706700e066.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/c626785ee80dd12e660f6a706700e066.jpg", "title": "Man claims to be missing boy Etan Patz amid murder trial", "description": "A man who thinks he could be Etan Patz was interviewed by police amid the murder trial of a suspect accused in the boy's 1979 disappearance, prosecutors said Tuesday, noting they have received similar", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Etan Patz, Joan Illuzzi Orbon"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf34e\"", "article_summary": "Dozens of people have claimed to be the sandy-haired Etan since he vanished on his way to school.\nHis mother, Julie Patz, testified about some of the claims earlier at the trial.\nNEW YORK (AP) - A man who thinks he could be Etan Patz was interviewed by police amid the murder trial of a suspect accused in the boy\u2019s 1979 disappearance, prosecutors said Tuesday, noting they have received similar calls before.\nAfter his shocking disappearance, Etan\u2019s parents helped modernize how law enforcement nationwide handles cases of missing children.\n\u201cAs this trial goes on \u2026 reported in the media, we get phone calls from people,\u201d she said."}
