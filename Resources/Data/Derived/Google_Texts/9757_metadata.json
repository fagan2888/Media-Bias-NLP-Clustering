Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over both agencies\u2019 funding.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, the bill includes a number of provisions to address some of these concerns, and to stop unnecessary damaging regulatory overreach by the agency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe legislation would specifically stop the EPA from moving forward on last month\u2019s proposal to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants by 30 percent by 2030. It would also stop a proposal from earlier this year to limit carbon from new power plants, as well as a rule to redefine the government\u2019s jurisdiction over water bodies for the Clean Water Act.\n\nThose policy riders and others, along with the EPA funding cuts, were unacceptable to the subcommittee\u2019s Democrats.\n\n\u201cOf the 11 FY15 bills that have been released, this is perhaps the worst,\u201d said Rep. Nita Lowey (N.Y.), the top Democrat in the full Appropriations Committee, drawing laughter in the hearing room.\n\n\u201cI am strongly opposed to a number of legislative riders, which amount to an industry wish list of giveaways,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Jim Moran Jim MoranBottom Line Congress and new labor laws: what goes around comes around Ten House seats Dems hope Trump will tilt MORE (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the subcommittee, said the policy riders belong in authorization bills, not appropriations.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of authorizations on an appropriations bill ... do not belong in this bill,\u201d Moran said. \u201cAnd their effect, of course, is to undermine important environmental laws, threaten public health and safety and deny the impact that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have on our plant.\u201d\n\nRep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, welcomed the riders.\n\n\u201cThe Congress must exercise its prerogative to prevent this kind of bureaucratic overreach that would be crippling for the U.S. economy,\u201d he said.\n\nRogers also sought to make it clear that the committee why the committee is trying to cut EPA\u2019s congressional affairs, budget and administrator\u2019s offices\u2019 funding by half. He wants to punish those offices for what he sees as a refusal to provide information to the panel.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge there\u2019s been no agency that\u2019s been more unresponsive to the inquiries of the Congress about how their spending our dollars than EPA,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just simply will not respond to inquiries.\u201d\n\nMoran, who is retiring at the end of the year, allowed the bill to pass by voice vote. But he promised that the Democrats would introduce amendments and take other measures to fight the legislation when it reaches the full Appropriations Committee.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Republicans said the policy riders are necessary to stop costly, job-killing regulations.", "description": "Republicans said the policy riders are necessary to stop costly, job-killing regulations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Republicans said the policy riders are necessary to stop costly, job-killing regulations.", "title": "Panel votes to cut EPA funding, block regulations", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/211694-house-panel-clears-bill-to-cut-epa-funding-9-block-regs", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-09T12:21:33-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-09T12:21-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/211694-house-panel-clears-bill-to-cut-epa-funding-9-block-regs", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-09T11:34-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-09T11:34:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T12:21:33-04:00"}, "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department, power plant rules,Ken Calvert, Nita Lowey, Jim Moran, Hal Rogers,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/211694-house-panel-clears-bill-to-cut-epa-funding-9-block-regs", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Republicans said the policy riders are necessary to stop costly, job-killing regulations.", "card": "summary", "title": "Panel votes to cut EPA funding, block regulations"}, "dcterms.title": "Panel votes to cut EPA funding, block regulations"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8400\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThese kinds of authorizations on an appropriations bill ... do not belong in this bill,\u201d Moran said.\nA House subcommittee approved legislation Wednesday that would cut the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) funding by 9 percent while stopping the agency from finishing carbon pollution regulations for power plants.\nBut he promised that the Democrats would introduce amendments and take other measures to fight the legislation when it reaches the full Appropriations Committee.\nThose policy riders and others, along with the EPA funding cuts, were unacceptable to the subcommittee\u2019s Democrats.\nRogers also sought to make it clear that the committee why the committee is trying to cut EPA\u2019s congressional affairs, budget and administrator\u2019s offices\u2019 funding by half."}
