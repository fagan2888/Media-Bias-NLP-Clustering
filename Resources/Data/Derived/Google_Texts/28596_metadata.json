They\u2019d suppressed flames and black smoke changed to gray on Sunday afternoon.\n\nFirefirefighters were using an excavator to try to churn up scrapyard materials, apparently including plastics and vinyls from vehicles from which metal and fluids had been removed.\n\nThe pile is about 70 feet deep, Duran said. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped the fire from spreading.\u201d\n\nAn Environmental Protection Agency response team, arriving a bit after 8 p.m., was monitoring the air impact of the fire.\n\nFirefighters continued spraying water on the smoldering scrap.\n\nRoadways closed Sunday afternoon were re-opened Sunday night as shifting wind helped reduce smoke.\n\nAt 4:20 p.m., Pueblo County Sheriff\u2019s authorities made a reverse 911 phone call to Salt Creek residents after Pueblo\u2019s city-county health department issued a shelter-in-place advisory. The advisory urged Salt Creek residents to shut down air-conditioning systems and close their windows and doors.\n\nResidents with lung and respiratory issues were told to leave until smoke dissipated. According to a census survey, about 648 people live in 225 households.\n\nLocal health officials could not be reached.\n\nThe scrapyard burned on April 19, Duran said. Owners had begun to address the hazards, he said, but to his knowledge had not been cited for violations.\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pueblo residents told to seal homes as scrapyard burns", "title": "Pueblo residents told to seal homes as scrapyard burns", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/07/pueblo-residents-told-to-seal-homes-as-scrapyard-burns/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__1837p1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__1837p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-07T22:22:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T19:42:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5c9\"", "article_summary": "The advisory urged Salt Creek residents to shut down air-conditioning systems and close their windows and doors.\nAt 4:20 p.m., Pueblo County Sheriff\u2019s authorities made a reverse 911 phone call to Salt Creek residents after Pueblo\u2019s city-county health department issued a shelter-in-place advisory.\nThe fire at the American Iron and Metal scrapyard, at the southeast edge of Pueblo near the steel mill, rocketed plumes of particulate-heavy black smoke into the adjacent Salt Creek and Blende neighborhoods.\nResidents with lung and respiratory issues were told to leave until smoke dissipated.\nEPA crews wearing respirators joined Pueblo firefighters Sunday night as a scrapyard the size of a football field burned, for the second time in two months, and health offcials advised residents to seal their homes and evacuate if they had health problems."}
