( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images )\n\nIn advance of the Nov. 1 start of open enrollment for Covered California, new numbers show that just over half of the state\u2019s remaining uninsured are eligible for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe estimate was part of a state-by-state analysis compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nResearchers found that California has 3.845 million people still uninsured. Of those:\n\n37 percent are eligible for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid (1.428 million people)\n\n16 percent are eligible for subsidies to purchase insurance on Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace (623,000 people)\n\nNationally, 58 percent of the remaining uninsured qualify for coverage under the ACA.\n\nThe nation\u2019s 50 states as a whole break into two groups \u2014 those that opted to participate in the expansion of the Medicaid program and those that didn\u2019t. Under the Medicaid expansion, people under 65 with an income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level ($16,242 for an individual or $33,365 for a family of four in 2015) are eligible for coverage.\n\nCalifornia, the most populous state in the country, has the highest number of remaining uninsured of the states that expanded Medicaid. Of the states that have not expanded the program, Texas has the most people still uninsured \u2014 4.425 million.\n\nOf those Californians still uninsured but not eligible for benefits under the ACA, about half (922,000 people) are undocumented immigrants and by law cannot qualify for benefits. The rest either have an income too high for a subsidy or they have an offer of health insurance from their employer.\n\nThese estimates are compiled from the 2015 Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau. They are similar to another estimate from researchers at UCLA and UC Berkeley, known as CalSIM (California Simulation of Insurance Markets).\n\nProf. Gerald Kominski, an author of that estimate, said the CalSIM modeling showed about 500,000 fewer people eligible for Medi-Cal and 500,000 more people in the undocumented group, but overall the two estimates \u201care in the same ballpark.\u201d\n\nThe challenge will be reaching those still without insurance, Kominski said. The remaining uninsured who are eligible for Obamacare benefits are people who have sat out during the two open enrollments since the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014.\n\nKominski said that for families with mixed immigration status, where some members are lawfully present and others are not, there\u2019s \u201congoing concern \u2026 that trusting the process will not result in information being shared\u201d with immigration authorities. Some other people, he said, may have a distrust of government.\n\nJames Scullary, a spokesperson for Covered California, said that \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d the remaining uninsured will be a more challenging population to reach, but he also pointed to Covered California\u2019s success so far in signing up those eligible.\n\nAs noted above, 16 percent of the remaining uninsured are eligible for Covered California subsidies. Only five states have a better enrollment rate than California (Arizona, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico).\n\nScullary said Covered California is \u201cright in the middle of taking a look at the various models. \u2026 We have not settled yet on an official number of our own.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They are eligible for Medi-Cal or subsidized insurance through Covered California.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"2 Million Uninsured Californians Are Eligible for Obamacare Benefits\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/10\\/13\\/2-million-uninsured-californians-are-eligible-for-obamacare-benefits\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-13 00:13:46\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-03 11:17:34\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":91524,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\",\"Medi-Cal\",\"News\",\"Uninsured\"],\"categories\":[\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/10\\/RS10854_481763249-e1444711911704.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "They are eligible for Medi-Cal or subsidized insurance through Covered California.", "title": "2 Million Uninsured Californians Are Eligible for Obamacare Benefits", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/10/13/2-million-uninsured-californians-are-eligible-for-obamacare-benefits/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/10/RS10854_481763249-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california,medi-cal,news,uninsured", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As noted above, 16 percent of the remaining uninsured are eligible for Covered California subsidies.\nThe remaining uninsured who are eligible for Obamacare benefits are people who have sat out during the two open enrollments since the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014.\nOf those Californians still uninsured but not eligible for benefits under the ACA, about half (922,000 people) are undocumented immigrants and by law cannot qualify for benefits.\nScullary said Covered California is \u201cright in the middle of taking a look at the various models.\nInformational pamphlets are displayed during a health insurance enrollment fair in Richmond, Calif. in March, 2014."}
