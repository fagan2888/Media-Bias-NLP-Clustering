At this point he could accidentally nuke Vermont and still blame racism for the falling approval ratings.\n\nBarack Obama said that racial tensions may have softened his popularity among white voters within the last two years, according to a story posted on the New Yorker magazine\u2019s website today. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black president,\u201d Obama said.\n\nFor his first term, these crazy racist white voters liked him just fine. And then suddenly, coinciding with his implementation of a disastrous national health care problem that destroyed health insurance for millions of people, they turned on him... because they're racists.\n\nObama never fails at anything. He just gets hit with the racism stick.\n\nIt's not the bad $600 million website. It's not the millions who are paying more for health insurance. It's not his attack on religious freedom. It's all about racism.\n\n\u201cThere is a historic connection between some of the arguments that we have politically and the history of race in our country, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to disentangle those issues,\u201d Obama said.\n\nNo, it's not actually. If you had high approval ratings and they sank after a policy you championed turned bad, that's not racism. It's all you.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Obama never fails at anything.
