For the most part, we either don\u2019t notice the vegetation surrounding us or stop to admire its striking beauty. Rarely is our first thought: \u201cRun and hide.\u201d\n\nNow there are certain species of plant out there capable of treating a condition as serious as cancer. There are also species that can kill us in a matter of minutes. The berries, seeds, or leaves, from both house and outdoor plants could be teeming with compounds that result in nausea, vomiting, headaches, irregular heart rhythm, and even death.\n\nIn some cases, we don\u2019t even have to come into contact with a poisonous plant for it to kill us. If a cow or other livestock consumes a deadly plant, it can get into their milk and kill the person who drinks it. This used to be called milk sickness and it was fairly common until doctors discovered White Snakeroot to be the cause of most poisonings caused by milk. The plant has since been removed from all areas livestock graze in.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, burning poisonous plants can result in the most severe type of reaction. The smoke from burning toxic foliage can lead to the inhalation of allergens and compounds that cause lung irritation.\n\nHere are 10 species of plants we should be especially cautious of.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "deadly, nightshade, oleander, shrub, wolfsbane, and, 7, other, poisonous, plants, can, kill, you", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Here are 10 poisonous plants that can kill you.", "title": "10 Poisonous Plants That Might Kill You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/deadly-nightshade-oleander-shrub-wolfsbane-poisonous-plant-377794", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/14/deadly-nightshade-oleander-shrub-wolfsbane-and-7-other-poisonous-plants-can-kill-you.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here are 10 poisonous plants that can kill you.", "title": "10 Poisonous Plants That Might Kill You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/deadly-nightshade-oleander-shrub-wolfsbane-poisonous-plant-377794", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/03/14/deadly-nightshade-oleander-shrub-wolfsbane-and-7-other-poisonous-plants-can-kill-you.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/14/deadly-nightshade-oleander-shrub-wolfsbane-and-7-other-poisonous-plants-can-kill-you.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-14T12:19:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T12:19:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here are 10 poisonous plants that can kill you."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb32e\"", "article_summary": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, burning poisonous plants can result in the most severe type of reaction.\nIn some cases, we don\u2019t even have to come into contact with a poisonous plant for it to kill us.\nIf a cow or other livestock consumes a deadly plant, it can get into their milk and kill the person who drinks it.\nHere are 10 species of plants we should be especially cautious of.\nFor the most part, we either don\u2019t notice the vegetation surrounding us or stop to admire its striking beauty."}
