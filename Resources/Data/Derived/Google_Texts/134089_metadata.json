That doesn\u2019t mean that his campaign was a failure\u2014in fact, most observers would say that Bernie\u2019s campaign has overachieved beyond all expectations. Back in the summer of 2015, the idea that a 74-year-old self-proclaimed socialist would become a major contender for a major party\u2019s nomination would have seemed far-fetched, even laughable, to most mainstream political pundits. But even though he\u2019s going to lose the nomination fight, Bernie Sanders has proved the doubters wrong and has amassed several noteworthy victories:\n\nHe Moved Hillary Further to the Left\n\nFirst, please indulge me in a bit of political wonkery. Full disclosure: I used to work in politics (for Democrats) and I have good friends who still work in politics (for Democrats). One of my favorite political operative friends once said: \u201cThe thing that most people don\u2019t understand about American elections is that the primary campaign is where the real \u2018democracy\u2019 happens.\u201d\n\nAmerica does not have a parliamentary system of democracy like Britain or Germany or Canada, where multiple smaller political parties have to align to form a coalition government, and where power tends to be distributed more proportionally along the political spectrum, with various interest groups and ideologies represented among the political parties. Instead, the bulk of the American political spectrum is represented within our two major political parties, who constantly have to do battle in our winner-take-all system. But this is why the American primaries matter: a primary election is a big, complicated, extended negotiation-and-coalition-building session between the various factions within each major political party. It\u2019s where all the various groups and wings of the party hash out their differences, find common ground, and set a vision for what the party stands for and where it\u2019s heading.\n\nWhen it works, you get the party to unify around a battle-tested nominee who represents the values of the broadest possible coalition within the party and who can be a competitive, electable candidate in the general election.\n\nWhen it doesn\u2019t work, you get Ted Cruz and Donald Trump settling the nomination debate with a shirtless Turkish oil-wrestling match on prime time TV at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Put it on pay-per-view!\n\nThe primary election process is a mess, but it\u2019s kind of a beautiful mess. It\u2019s not perfect and it\u2019s not always pretty or fair\u2014in fact, there are lots of things that I admire about parliamentary systems that I wish America could emulate. But the fact is, if you want to really have an impact on the American political system, it pays to get involved in party politics at the primary level.\n\nThat\u2019s what Bernie Sanders has accomplished, just by staying in the race for so long and by winning as many delegates as he has. Instead of letting the primary become a simple single-candidate coronation, Bernie\u2019s campaign helped create a vigorous debate that pushed Hillary to be a more progressive candidate and (hopefully) a more electable nominee. He\u2019s helped to influence her rhetoric and motivated her to adjust her agenda to be more aggressively progressive, and less compromisingly moderate.\n\nBernie\u2019s going to have a massive number of delegates at the Democratic National Convention, too\u2014and there are lots of things that happen at the national convention, other than confirming the nominee, that are important to the party platform and the overall direction of the Democratic party. This is where Bernie\u2019s campaign is going to have a bigger influence than most people might have realized.\n\nHe\u2019s Laying the Groundwork for Ongoing Grassroots Political Revolution\n\nAlong with helping to drive the party platform in a more progressive direction, Bernie\u2019s campaign has a unique opportunity lay the groundwork for future victories for progressive Democrats. Elections come and go, but the long game of politics is an ongoing, ever-evolving process. Many times in politics, you don\u2019t get what you want in the current election, but you can lay the groundwork for getting more of what you want in the future.\n\nThis is where Bernie can play a unique role \u2013 as an ongoing leader of a new progressive activist organization within the Democratic Party. He has millions of enthusiastic fans and donors, and a social media-savvy organization that can raise a ton of money to funnel to progressive causes and candidates. He can influence down-ballot races by mobilizing voters and donors. Perhaps he could even create a longer-lasting infrastructure of progressive activists to help boost turnout among younger, poorer voters in midterm elections\u2014which would make a huge difference in sending more Democrats (and more progressive Democrats) to Congress.\n\nJust as evangelical conservatives and the Christian Coalition and the \u201cMoral Majority\u201d became a major force within the Republican Party\u2014by years of dogged hard work to organize and raise money and influence candidates at the local level\u2014perhaps Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters can become a new progressive \u201cshadow interest group\u201d that can exercise its own outsized influence on the Democrats and hold candidates accountable to support progressive policy ideas.\n\nHe\u2019s Changing the Terms of Mainstream Political Debate for Millennials\n\nBernie Sanders, at 74 years old, is the candidate of the future of the Democratic Party. He has been by far the most popular candidate among young voters (age 18 to 29) and this group of voters\u2019 attitudes on key political issues has actually become more liberal during the past year of Sanders\u2019 candidacy. According to survey data cited by the Washington Post, key tenets of Sanders\u2019 stump speech are widely popular among young voters: 48 percent of whom believe that \u201cbasic health insurance is a right for all people\u201d (up from 42 percent in 2014), 45 percent of whom say that \u201cThe government should spend more to reduce poverty\u201d (up from 40 percent last year).\n\nSimply put: millennials appear to be much more liberal than the older generations. And this is not just the na\u00efve idealism of idle youth; lots of millennials are parents and homeowners and real grownups now\u2014they\u2019re no longer a bunch of constantly Snapchatting, Justin Bieber-obsessed teenagers and underemployed boomerang children living in their parents\u2019 basements like the dismissive media caricatures make them out to be. (\u201cOh, those wacky Millennials! With their Tinder apps and their texting and their selfies and their massive student loan debt!\u201d)\n\nBernie Sanders perhaps represents a permanent, generational shift in bringing ideas that were just recently thought of as radically liberal into the political mainstream.\n\nLook at how dramatically the acceptable terms of political debate have shifted in the U.S. just within the past 10 years! Despite the flaws and limitations of Obamacare, universal health insurance is now the law of the land. Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide. Marijuana is legal in several states, with more to come. We\u2019re having a national conversation about criminal justice reform (with supporters from both political parties). These are all things that would have widely been considered impossible (not to mention \u201cbad politics\u201d) even as recently as 2006. Who knows what \u201cimpossible\u201d liberal fantasy might become a mainstream idea by 2020 or 2024? Free college tuition and/or major student loan debt relief? Single-payer universal health care? An end to for-profit prisons and mass incarceration? Universal basic income, maybe? Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign has helped today\u2019s liberal activists dream bigger and organize for more audacious goals to come.\n\nSkeptics and cynics have argued that the Sanders campaign\u2019s success is a sign of the weakness of the Democratic Party, or a sign of progressives\u2019 discontent\u2014after all, Democrats have had President Obama in the White House for 8 years, so why do so many of them think the country is heading in the wrong direction?\n\nFirst of all, Congress has much lower approval ratings than Obama or Hillary (as of this writing: Obama: 48% approval, Democrats: 45%, Hillary: 39%, GOP: 32%, Congress: 14%). Democrats, like lots of other Americans, do not blame Obama for the country\u2019s woes. Progressives are not feeling disillusioned by Obama\u2019s presidency; they are emboldened by it. Bernie Sanders\u2019 support is not a sign of fracturing within the Democratic Party, it\u2019s a sign that young progressives are feeling ascendant and are hungry for even bigger victories.\n\nOnce the primary is officially over, and the party unites in Philadelphia, many of the harsh words and hard feelings from the past months of this primary campaign will be forgiven and forgotten. Lots of people forget this now, but 2016 is not the first Democratic primary to see heated debate and regrettable rhetoric from supporters of the different Democratic contenders. Remember how harsh and hostile the 2008 campaign got between supporters of Obama and Hillary, and how some of Hillary\u2019s so-called PUMA (\u201cParty Unity My Ass\u201d) supporters threatened to refuse to support Obama and fight all the way to the convention?\n\nAnd yet, in the end, the candidates reconciled their differences, and the Democrats went on to win the White House in November. This is what healthy political parties do, and it\u2019s going to happen again in 2016. Bernie\u2019s first victory will be to help elect the first woman president of the United States, enhance his stature within the (probably Democratically-controlled) Senate, and then help serve as a spearheading activist, leader and mentor for the next generation of progressive American political leadership for the 21st century.
