At least nine others also are set for trial in Tarrant and Johnson counties.\n\nChesapeake and some Barnett Shale mineral rights owners earlier this month reached an out-of-court settlement over allegations of underpaid oil and gas royalties. The settlement included billionaire investor Edward Bass of Fort Worth. The terms weren\u2019t released.\n\nIn court filings, Chesapeake and related companies have described the theories of the plaintiffs as \u201clegally irrelevant.\u201d\n\nKaren Jacobs, of Joshua in Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, says she and her husband didn\u2019t expect to get rich from their one-acre property but the extra cash was welcome. The checks dropped dramatically a few years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping there will possibly be some back payments, and it will force Chesapeake to pay what is due,\u201d she said.\n\nMcDonald contends in the lawsuits that from 2009 to 2013 Chesapeake was in a \u201cdesperate struggle for financial survival\u201d because of heavy debt and declining gas prices and sold 25 percent of its Barnett Shale interests in 2009 to the French conglomerate Total. Then two years later, under what the plaintiffs say was pressure from Total, Chesapeake notified nearly 19,000 royalty owners that their checks might decrease because of a change in calculating post-production costs. That\u2019s when payments dropped off sharply, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAmong the complicated legal maneuvering in the cases, McDonald is seeking approval under international treaties take a deposition in France from a ranking Total official.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Dallas Morning News, http://www.dallasnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 400 lawsuits have been consolidated in Texas, where energy drilling giant Chesapeake Operating Inc. is accused of withholding more than $1 billion in royalty payments from about 25,000 property owners.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/20/hundreds-of-royalties-lawsuits-against-chesapeake-/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "More than 400 lawsuits have been consolidated in Texas, where energy drilling giant Chesapeake Operating Inc. is accused of withholding more than $1 billion in royalty payments from about 25,000 property owners.", "title": "Hundreds of royalties lawsuits against Chesapeake combined"}, "twitter": {"title": "Hundreds of royalties lawsuits against Chesapeake combined", "description": "More than 400 lawsuits have been consolidated in Texas, where energy drilling giant Chesapeake Operating Inc. is accused of withholding more than $1 billion in royalty payments from about 25,000 prope", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "The first of several cases is set to be tried in February by a state district judge in Fort Worth.\nThen two years later, under what the plaintiffs say was pressure from Total, Chesapeake notified nearly 19,000 royalty owners that their checks might decrease because of a change in calculating post-production costs.\nChesapeake and some Barnett Shale mineral rights owners earlier this month reached an out-of-court settlement over allegations of underpaid oil and gas royalties.\nThe settlement included billionaire investor Edward Bass of Fort Worth.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping there will possibly be some back payments, and it will force Chesapeake to pay what is due,\u201d she said."}
