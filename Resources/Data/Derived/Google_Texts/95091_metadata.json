Yet nearly all (95%) of the credit cards providers we looked at use 084 or 087 numbers for complaints or customer service helplines and nine in 10 (89%) of current account providers use them for complaints or customer service helplines.\n\nBarclays drops costly calls\n\nExisting customers are also being charged more than new ones, as free-from-landline 0800 numbers are used for 52% of sales or new customer lines, compared to just 26% for existing customers and 21% for complaints.\n\nIn a positive response to our Costly Calls campaign, Barclays and Barclaycard have announced that they will be offering a freephone or basic rate number for all customer helplines so they are cheaper to call from both landlines and mobiles.\n\nNatWest and RBS have also committed to introducing basic rate numbers for all of their customer enquiry lines and a free phone line for complaints from the end of this month.\n\nWhich? is pleased that Barclays and Barclaycard are the first major providers to drop costly calls and we ask others to follow their example.\n\nWhich? calls for FCA action\n\nThe EU Consumer Rights Directive ban on the use of expensive numbers for customer helplines comes into force next year, but financial firms are excluded. Which? is calling on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to clarify existing rules to stop financial services companies from using high rate numbers on complaints lines, and change the rules so they also cover customer helplines.\n\nRichard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said: \u201cMillions of us prefer to deal with our bank on the phone, yet we are expected to cough up for a costly call when we do. We applaud Barclays and Barclaycard for breaking from the pack on high rate numbers and want to see other financial firms follow their lead.\n\n\"It's also great news that NatWest and RBS are doing the right thing for their customers by dropping costly calls. The new leaders at RBS have promised to renew the banks' efforts to improve customer service, and this is a very welcome start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right that financial companies are being let off the hook. The FCA must act now to put an end to costly calls in this sector.\u201d\n\nJoin our Costly Calls campaign\n\nWe want a ban on costly calls to all customer service and complaint lines.\n\nThe financial regulator should immediately clamp down on companies with expensive complaint numbers and introduce a ban on costly customer service calls\n\nThe government should extend the ban to travel companies\n\nPublic bodies should lead by example and stop using expensive phone lines\n\nAlmost 60,000 people have already signed up to our Costly Calls campaign \u2013 you can show your support at www.which.co.uk/costlycalls\n\nMore on this...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Which? is calling on financial firms to cut off costly calls after finding 73% of customer service or complaint lines are high rate telephone numbers.", "sectionName": "News", "og": {"url": "http://www.which.co.uk/news/2013/11/which-calls-on-banks-to-cut-out-costly-calls--341025/", "image": "http://www.staticwhich.co.uk/media/images/in-content/call-centre-332372.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Which? is calling on financial firms to cut off costly calls after finding 73% of customer service or complaint lines are high rate telephone numbers."}, "contentId": 341025, "robots": "NOODP", "categoryIds": "191887,317849,", "omniturePageName": "home: news: 2013: November: which? calls on banks to cut out costly calls , 17 November 2013", "fb": {"pages": 141323599261898}, "timestamp": 160524021719, "omniturePageType": "news", "categoryId": 213176, "categories": "news,which?-home", "omnitureAccount": "whichdev"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd863f\"", "article_summary": "The FCA must act now to put an end to costly calls in this sector.\u201dJoin our Costly Calls campaignWe want a ban on costly calls to all customer service and complaint lines.\ncalls on banks to cut out costly calls 73% of customer numbers are high rateWhich?\n\"It's also great news that NatWest and RBS are doing the right thing for their customers by dropping costly calls.\nFinancial Services costly calls No.\nis pleased that Barclays and Barclaycard are the first major providers to drop costly calls and we ask others to follow their example."}
