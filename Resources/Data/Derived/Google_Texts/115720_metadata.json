For too long, progressive special interests have been manipulating the news to damage free market and liberty-minded candidates and elected officials. Further, they use mass media as a pedestal from which they attack the principles that conservative Americans cherish.\n\nPossibly the worst offender is Comcast, the largest cable company in the country and owner of NBCUniversal \u2013 the parent company of NBC News and MSNBC. Comcast is a media empire, whose business model includes both media content and delivery. What this means is that you, the cable customer, don\u2019t just watch shows, you\u2019re also paying the salaries of liberal talking heads like Al Sharpton and Ed Schultz.\n\nSharpton, a progressive pundit who relies more on sensationalism and race-baiting than facts, uses his platform as the host of MSNBC\u2019s Politics Nation to manipulate the news, divide our nation on race and advance his left-wing ideology.\n\nEd Schultz, who just recently won back a prime time position at 5:00 p.m. (EST), has promoted the outrageous claim that conservatives support segregation. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s an undercurrent of anger out there, that there is this conservative separatist movement that is taking grip in America to separate. We\u2019re not as equal as we think we are.\u201d\n\nTo advance this theme, his program used a map of the U.S. covered with the image of the Confederate flag labeled, \u201cPride in Prejudice.\u201d\n\nFollowing up on that reckless statement, Schultz conducted an online poll asking: \u201cAre conservatives the new Confederates?\u201d\n\nAccording to Mediaite, Schultz\u2019s poll was a follow-up to a comment from Jesse Jackson that, \u201cThe Tea Party is the resurrection of the Confederacy; it\u2019s the Fort Sumter tea party.\u201d\n\nConservatives should not underestimate the damage that MSNBC is doing to the nation and civil political discourse. The extreme and irresponsible claims made by the network do affect public opinion, especially for low-information voters and individuals who have misconceptions about the Tea Party and conservatives in general.\n\nSimilarly, grassroots activists should not mistakenly believe that the falling ratings at MSNBC will force management to make changes in its programming.\n\nComcast CEO Brian Roberts is a billionaire and committed progressive as well as a friend of President Obama. Roberts served on the President\u2019s Council on Jobs and Competiveness; he openly supported ObamaCare and recently held a cocktail reception for the Obama\u2019s in Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\n\nComcast can easily absorb the lost revenue potential at MSNBC for the greater progressive cause.\n\nThat\u2019s why the best way to force change at Comcast is to leverage its Achilles\u2019 heel and primary revenue source \u2013 its cable business. To affect meaningful change, grassroots activists must cease merely complaining about outrageous media bias. Instead, they should take bold action and use market forces against companies like Comcast that undermine conservative policy objectives and values.\n\nWhile executives can easily dismiss letters critical of the media companies they run, they can\u2019t ignore activism that puts a financial price on their irresponsible behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s time to translate frustration into action.\n\nWith this goal of empowering activists in the fight against big corporate media, FreedomWorks launched the \u201cStop Comcast\u201d campaign. At StopComcast.com, grassroots activists can send a letter to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts informing him that they are leaving Comcast because of the excessive leftist propaganda distributed by his media empire.\n\nFor years, members of the progressive left have leveraged their power as consumers to influence media companies opposing the progressive agenda. Now it\u2019s our turn. The media must not be allowed to continue to undermine efforts to elect principled politicians and advance sound policy solutions by offering biased, dishonest coverage that warps public opinion.\n\nAt Comcast\u2019s annual shareholders meeting this year, I warned Roberts that his radical media empire could backfire on his cable business. After all, why would a conservative customer want to pay Al Sharpton\u2019s salary?\n\nHitting Comcast\u2019s cable business is the best way to send a message to Roberts and the liberal media establishment that grassroots activists are not going to pay for media bias. Let\u2019s vote with our wallets, and switch to cable providers that don\u2019t conflict with our values of constitutionally- limited government and individual freedom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, the time has come for grassroots conservatives to aggressively challenge the left-wing media establishment..05/24/2016 6:01:56AM EST.", "author": "Tom Borelli", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "With the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, the time has come for grassroots conservatives to aggressively challenge the left-wing media establishment.", "title": "- Grassroots Coalition Takes On Comcast", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/tomborelli/2013/09/10/grassroots-coalition-takes-on-comcast-n1696649", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/212/3937714b-78f1-48d6-9d25-723302109f73.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "With the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, the time has come for grassroots conservatives to aggressively challenge the left-wing media establishment.", "title": "- Grassroots Coalition Takes On Comcast", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/tomborelli/2013/09/10/grassroots-coalition-takes-on-comcast-n1696649", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/212/3937714b-78f1-48d6-9d25-723302109f73.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Grassroots Coalition Takes On Comcast, Tom Borelli, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd322f\"", "article_summary": "At StopComcast.com, grassroots activists can send a letter to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts informing him that they are leaving Comcast because of the excessive leftist propaganda distributed by his media empire.\nSimilarly, grassroots activists should not mistakenly believe that the falling ratings at MSNBC will force management to make changes in its programming.\nWith the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, the time has come for grassroots conservatives to aggressively challenge the left-wing media establishment.\nTo affect meaningful change, grassroots activists must cease merely complaining about outrageous media bias.\nComcast is a media empire, whose business model includes both media content and delivery."}
