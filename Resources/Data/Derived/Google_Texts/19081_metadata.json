The 24-year-old graduate, Daniela Liverani, experienced a series of nosebleeds she believed were triggered by a burst blood vessel from a motorbike crash aboard. It wasn\u2019t until Liverani was having a shower last Thursday did she realize the cause of her persistent nosebleeds was from a dark-shaped 3-inch leech moving up and down her nostril.\n\n\"On Thursday, I jumped out the shower and I unsteamed the mirror and I had a proper good look, and I could see little ridges on him,\u201d Liverani told BBC Radio Scotland. \"Your initial reaction isn't to start thinking, 'Oh God, there's obviously a leech in my face.'\u201d The graduate and her friend Jenny called NHS 24 to receive emergency treatment to remove the leech she called \u201cMr. Curly.\u201d\n\nDoctors at A&E at Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Infirmary removed the parasite using a torch, forceps, and tweezers. Liverani described the procedure as agonizing while she was pinned down to the hospital bed by a nurse and Jenny. After just half an hour, \u201cthe pain stopped and the doctor had the leech in the tweezers. He was about as long as my forefinger but as fat as my thumb,\u201d Liverani said, the Mirror reported.\n\nBackpacker brings back three-inch LEECH from travels in Vietnam - up her nose http://t.co/kP0gGQ8Mun pic.twitter.com/4H2frlZTnq \u2014 Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) October 12, 2014\n\nThe leech was suspected to have grown bigger and bigger from feeding on the backpacker\u2019s blood. Mark Siddal, curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an expert on leeches, believes Liverani could have picked up the leech from water in Vietnam, possibly by swimming. \u201cOr it could have gone in through her mouth, as she was drinking water,\u201d Siddal told the Daily Record.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first case of leeches mysteriously ending up in human body parts. In 2011, Tao Jiayuan, a Chinese boy who suffered from a sore throat for two months, discovered a 4-inch leech living in his windpipe. Upon removal, the doctors found the leech was still alive and unaffected by the anesthetic the boy received during the operation.\n\nLeeches are typically found in fresh water environments, like creeks, rice fields, and ponds. In both cases, it is suspected both patients got infected with drinking the stream water.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "daniela liverani, bloody nose, blood clots, leeches, nostrils", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Scottish woman found a parasite living up her nose for a month after backpacking through Southeast Asia.", "title": "Woman Finds 3-Inch Leech Living Up Her Nose [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scottish-woman-finds-3-inch-leech-living-her-nostril-month-after-vietnam-trip-306907", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/woman-finds-3-inch-leech-living-nose-month.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Scottish woman found a parasite living up her nose for a month after backpacking through Southeast Asia.", "title": "Woman Finds 3-Inch Leech Living Up Her Nose [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scottish-woman-finds-3-inch-leech-living-her-nostril-month-after-vietnam-trip-306907", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/woman-finds-3-inch-leech-living-nose-month.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/woman-finds-3-inch-leech-living-nose-month.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-10-13T15:52:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-13T15:52:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Scottish woman found a parasite living up her nose for a month after backpacking through Southeast Asia."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca74c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOr it could have gone in through her mouth, as she was drinking water,\u201d Siddal told the Daily Record.\nAfter backpacking through Southeast Asia, a Scottish woman found a creepy crawly remnant of her trip in the most unusual place: up her nose.\n'\u201d The graduate and her friend Jenny called NHS 24 to receive emergency treatment to remove the leech she called \u201cMr.\nAfter just half an hour, \u201cthe pain stopped and the doctor had the leech in the tweezers.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Liverani was having a shower last Thursday did she realize the cause of her persistent nosebleeds was from a dark-shaped 3-inch leech moving up and down her nostril."}
