Democrats have blocked or filibustered every previous attempt.\n\nGOP leaders thought they\u2019d hit on a solution in using a fast-track tool, which allows them to avoid a filibuster if the matter is related to the budget. But the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian has said the changes to Obamacare\u2019s mandates are too incidental to the budget to be allowed under the tool, known on Capitol Hill as \u201creconciliation,\u201d a ruling that Democrats say dooms the repeal effort.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted Republicans will find a way forward, and will vote on a bill that strips money from Planned Parenthood as part of an assault on Obamacare. The bill as sent over from the House repeals the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate for most Americans to hold health insurance or pay a tax penalty, while scrapping unpopular taxes on medical device sales and generous health care plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be moving to that after Thanksgiving,\u201d he said after the Senate\u2019s weekly party luncheons.\n\nThe entire process has left the House GOP flummoxed.\n\nThey thought they\u2019d written a bill that would get through the complex Senate rules, but now have been informed that might not be the case.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any way to know. That\u2019s the problem with the process,\u201d said House Budget Chairman Tom Price, the Georgia Republican who wrote the House\u2019s bill.\n\nHe said the budget rules themselves may have to be changed to make the process more transparent.\n\nUnder the current system the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, rules on what\u2019s in bounds and what\u2019s disallowed under budget reconciliation rules.\n\nSarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies congressional procedure, said it\u2019s important to remember that the parliamentarian gives advice in response to Senate leaders\u2019 questions and not grand rulings.\n\n\u201cI think that adds to the opaqueness here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that requires release of parliamentarian advice or guidance.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats last week did release details of Ms. MacDonough\u2019s early thoughts, saying she had eviscerated GOP plans.\n\nMr. McConnell\u2019s spokesman, Donald Stewart, has said the Senate is working on a substitute bill that preserves the provisions of the House-passed bill while making sure it complies with Senate-specific rules.\n\nMr. McConnell, however, is facing pressure from his right flank too.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, say the bill reneges on vows to pursue full repeal of Obamacare, while at least three GOP members have signaled they\u2019re on the fence about defunding Planned Parenthood. If all six senators vote against the bill, it won\u2019t achieve even the bare majority needed under reconciliation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP's long-sought bid to dismantle Obamacare has hit another snag in the Senate, flustering House Republicans who thought they'd figured out a way to get a bill to President Obama's desk without having to face a Democratic filibuster.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The GOP\u2019s long-sought bid to dismantle Obamacare has hit another snag in the Senate, flustering House Republicans who thought they\u2019d figured out a way to get a bill to President Obama\u2019s desk without having to face a Democratic filibuster.", "title": "Republican efforts to overturn Obamacare stalls in Senate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/17/republican-efforts-to-overturn-obamacare-stalls-in/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/17/11172015_ap-5467212728698201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/17/11172015_ap-5467212728698201.jpg", "description": "The GOP's long-sought bid to dismantle Obamacare has hit another snag in the Senate, flustering House Republicans who thought they'd figured out a way to get a bill to President Obama's desk without h", "card": "summary", "title": "Republican efforts to overturn Obamacare stalls in Senate"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Senate, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "Under the current system the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, rules on what\u2019s in bounds and what\u2019s disallowed under budget reconciliation rules.\nThat\u2019s the problem with the process,\u201d said House Budget Chairman Tom Price, the Georgia Republican who wrote the House\u2019s bill.\nHe said the budget rules themselves may have to be changed to make the process more transparent.\nThey thought they\u2019d written a bill that would get through the complex Senate rules, but now have been informed that might not be the case.\nGOP leaders thought they\u2019d hit on a solution in using a fast-track tool, which allows them to avoid a filibuster if the matter is related to the budget."}
