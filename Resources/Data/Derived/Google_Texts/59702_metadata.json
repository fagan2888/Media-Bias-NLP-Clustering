Headlee is host of Georgia Public Broadcasting\u2019s On Second Thought and previously hosted Public Radio International\u2019s The Takeaway.\n\nIf the arc of the conversation is the trip from the lobby to the penthouse, your questions are the vehicle that carries you there. The quality of questions separates a good host from a great one.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, I follow the advice of legendary coach David Candow: stick with the five W\u2019s (who, what, where, when, why) and how. David said if you put a complicated question in, you\u2019ll get a simple answer coming out and vice versa. I\u2019ve found this to be generally true. If you ask, \u201cDid you feel scared?\u201d, the person will respond to the idea of \u201cscared\" instead of telling you how he felt. If you say, \u201cThe House recently passed its fifth overturn of the Affordable Care Act. Should health care advocates be worried?\u201d, then your guest will respond to \u201cworried\u201d instead of telling you what that means for advocates of universal health care.\n\nThe common pitfall here is to construct a question to demonstrate your knowledge or experience of a subject by including dates, data, numbers, and names. Some anchors like to mention their own history in covering a region or topic. To this, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s not about you.\u201d Neil deGrasse Tyson doesn\u2019t care how much you know about astrophysics and Steven Spielberg couldn\u2019t care less that you dabbled in film direction as a student. Keep the focus on the guest always and in everything. That applies even when you interview another journalist about breaking news. As much as you can, let the reporter report.\n\nA good discipline in solutions-based journalism is to practice the Three Whys \u2014 a technique originally developed by Sakichi Toyota for the automaker. The principle behind this technique is that many problems have more than one root cause, and it may take a series of questions to get to the bottom of what happened.\n\nIt\u2019s quite simple in principle, but more difficult in implementation. You go for the why more than once, but without sounding like you\u2019re pestering.\n\nExample:\n\nWhy have state test scores dropped by 17 percent this year? Answer: The teachers only had a couple weeks to prepare their classes. Why? Answer: The federal NCLB testing was scheduled right before the state test. Why? Answer: We didn\u2019t have any other good dates. There\u2019s too much testing in schools.\n\nThe Three Whys is one of the most efficient problem-solving techniques in business and it\u2019s an objective way for journalists to delve deeply into political, financial or social issues.\n\nHere are more specific guidelines to asking good questions.\n\n1. Ask one question at a time. Avoid this: \u201cWhen did you first start playing soccer and why choose that sport instead of hockey, the sport that your dad played?\u201d When you ask multiple questions, the guest can choose what to answer. Also, you can stress them by forcing them to remember all that you asked. You\u2019re there to make things easy for your guest, and to let them speak.\n\n2. Avoid making statements instead of asking questions. This one is debatable, and as respected a source as NPR\u2019s Jonathan Kern, who created the network\u2019s training program, recommends using statements on a regular basis. I disagree with him on this. While I sometimes use statements to get a response from guests, I think they should be few and far between. Many\u2019s the time I\u2019ve made a statement, only to see the guest looking at me blankly, waiting to respond to a question. But I refer you to Kern\u2019s book, Sound Reporting, for advice on how to use a well-constructed statement to have a natural conversation. One further note: a statement with an upward inflection at the end is not a question. And adding, \u201cCould you talk about that?\u201d doesn\u2019t turn your statement into a question, either.\n\n\u201cOwn your chair. You have to believe you belong there, although that doesn\u2019t mean you should ever pretend to know more than you do.\u201d\n\n3. Don\u2019t ask a question you know the answer to. Your producers will try to make you do this. \u201cActually ask a real question,\u201d NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep says. \u201cHaving asked it, stop. Very often people will ask a question they imagine they already know the answer to, and they ask it in a way that shows they already know the answer. There\u2019s no suspense there. It sounds like the host is in on it with the guest. The host will say, \u2018Tell us about the time you went to Georgia and were arrested.\u2019 Instead, say, \u2018Tell us what happened when you went to Georgia.\u2019\u201d\n\n4. Don\u2019t say \u201csome people.\u201d Ask for yourself.\n\n5. Don\u2019t ask multiple-choice questions. This is common. A host will say, \u201cWere you scared? Calm? Or did you not even notice it was happening?\u201d Instead, just ask them what it was like. You should jump in only if they\u2019re struggling to answer.\n\nWe learn more easily from stories than from statistics and details, so steer your guest away from reciting facts and figures. The interview should sound like you\u2019re saying, \u201cHello, friend in my home, let me introduce you to this other friend. Let me tell you why they\u2019re here and put them in context so you have a sense of who they are and why you should listen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s good to take your guest back to a formative moment and ask what they were thinking or feeling at the time. You can also ask what they saw and heard. That will help put them in the moment. What does the guest know now that would have been good to know at the time? And you can also research whatever it is they\u2019re working on, find out what\u2019s not working, and ask them why.\n\nIf the guest doesn\u2019t answer your question, you can say, \u201cWhat I really wanted to know was \u2026\u201d. Keep control of the interview at all times. Sometimes your guest will get off on a tangent. You should interrupt them. Kojo Nnamdi at WAMU in Washington, D.C., will finish his guest\u2019s thought and then bring him back to the point. He\u2019ll say, \u201cAnd I know you\u2019ve been complaining to the FCC about that, but let\u2019s get back to what happened during the broadcast.\u201d\n\nIf your question is short, sharp, and respectful, the audience will often be relieved you interrupted, instead of thinking you\u2019re rude. We\u2019ll talk more later about how to cut off a guest at the end of your interview. That\u2019s a different challenge.\n\nOne more tip: it\u2019s generally best to end the interview with a question that looks to the future. What happens next? What\u2019s your next project? Anything that gets the guest to talk about the story as ongoing is a good finish.\n\nIn addition to asking questions, you\u2019ll have to jump in from time to time for other reasons. For example, you should acknowledge when a guest mentions a fact you can\u2019t verify, like mentioning that Georgia has more unwed mothers than any other state. You can ask the guest what their source is, where the data come from.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to jump in to provide what Jonathan Kern calls \u201cdrop-in context\u201d. That means you have to recognize terms and references guests use that listeners may not understand immediately. Do they say someone is \u201clike Carrie Bradshaw\u201d? You need to quickly explain she was Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s character in Sex in the City. Do they mention ACORN? You should say that it stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now and give enough context so listeners remember it was the voter registration group that was brought down by a hidden-camera scandal.\n\nYou are at the helm of this ship: keep relaxed control at all times. Set up the topic clearly and bring the audience along with you every step of the way. Keep the conversation moving among the guests, even the bad talkers. If you have three people at the table and you ignore one of them, the audience will notice and they\u2019ll think you\u2019re being rude. Own your chair. You have to believe you belong there, although that doesn\u2019t mean you should ever pretend to know more than you do. Be honest about what you know and what you don\u2019t. You can\u2019t be any smarter than you are.\n\nSometimes, you will have to stop someone who\u2019s talking too long. If you don\u2019t, listeners might think, \u201cWhy is this person droning on?\u201d Interrupt them by saying something like, \u201cI think what you\u2019re saying is \u2026\u201d or \u201cLet me bring this other guest in here \u2026\u201d. The person you\u2019re most concerned with is the audience, not the guest. People don\u2019t like hearing someone being rude, but they also want the conversation to have forward momentum at all times.\n\nAlso, do not allow one guest to attack another. Say something like, \u201cWe\u2019re not having that here\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to stop you there.\u201d Take control. Have courage. Be firm.\n\nYou\u2019re storytelling as a host and constructing a piece just as a reporter does with actualities. The difference is, you\u2019re doing it live. You\u2019re the narrator. If someone says something that doesn\u2019t make sense, you have to jump in and make sense of it. You weave the through line. What\u2019s the next question that arises naturally? Let\u2019s answer that or go to another guest.\n\nIf an interview is boring, that\u2019s often because there\u2019s no suspense or tension. What\u2019s at stake? Something important should always be at stake. It doesn\u2019t have to be life or death. Steve Inskeep tells a story about an interview he heard when he was in Morehead, Kentucky. The anchor brought on a guy who was in charge of encouraging tourism in Morehead. The anchor\u2019s first question was \u201cWho the heck would want to come here?\u201d\n\nLeading the segment off with that question grabbed Steve\u2019s attention, and probably the attention of other listeners as well. Asking a direct, simple, surprising question can turn a boring interview like that into an entertaining segment.\n\nPractice asking great questions.
