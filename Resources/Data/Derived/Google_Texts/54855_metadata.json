Together they made a dynamic team.\n\nMr. Pinto talked of the growing collaboration between NRLC and EWTN and how EWTN\u2019s massive outreach makes it possible for National Right to Life to reach a worldwide audience. He reminded us that pro-lifers should anticipate continued resistance but that \u201cThis is our hour.\u201d\n\nDr. King spoke of her decades-long familiarity with NRLC and particularly with the late Dr. Mildred Jefferson, who was a NRLC president, and how \u201ccivil rights begin in the womb.\u201d Harkening back to her own family\u2019s deep involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King said we shall also overcome abortion.\n\nShe lifted up her audience with her assurance that we are \u201cmoving toward victory.\u201d\n\nBioethicist Wesley J. had a much grimmer message in his mid-morning talk on \u201cBioethics\u2019 War on Humans.\u201d He offered example after example of the fallout of what one anti-human exceptionalist called \u201cUndignified Bioethics.\u201d\n\nA view that rejects inherent human dignity (which is now widespread in bioethics) and elevates the elimination of all human suffering to an ultimate goal quickly morphs into the conclusion that death is an acceptable \u201csolution\u201d for suffering, Smith explained.\n\nSmith briefly but poignantly touched on other phases of Bioethics\u2019 War on Humans and how each, including infanticide and assisted suicide and self-starvation, flows \u201cnaturally\u201d when the bedrock assumption that we are of infinite value because of who we are, not because of what we do, is rejected.\n\nBurke Balch, J.D.., and Jennifer Popik, J.D., both from NRLC\u2019s Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics, updated the overflow audience on the latest challenges presented by proponents of doctor-assisted suicide and ObamaCare\u2019s relentless campaign to ration health care.\n\nFollowing the Prayer Breakfast and the General Session, attendees had their choice of 23 different workshops. The topics ranged from \u201cGrassroots Lobbying\u201d through \u201cLearning from Lincoln and the Civil Rights Movement\u201d to \u201cIdeas to Motivate and active Pro-life Students on Your College Campus.\u201d\n\nSaturday, the third and final day of the convention, gets off to a great start with a General Session titled, \u201cChallenging the Nation to Respect Life,\u201d featuring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell from Kentucky.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/alveda-king-210x300.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc603\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Pinto talked of the growing collaboration between NRLC and EWTN and how EWTN\u2019s massive outreach makes it possible for National Right to Life to reach a worldwide audience.\nFollowing the Prayer Breakfast and the General Session, attendees had their choice of 23 different workshops.\nSmith briefly but poignantly touched on other phases of Bioethics\u2019 War on Humans and how each, including infanticide and assisted suicide and self-starvation, flows \u201cnaturally\u201d when the bedrock assumption that we are of infinite value because of who we are, not because of what we do, is rejected.\nHe reminded us that pro-lifers should anticipate continued resistance but that \u201cThis is our hour.\u201dDr. King spoke of her decades-long familiarity with NRLC and particularly with the late Dr. Mildred Jefferson, who was a NRLC president, and how \u201ccivil rights begin in the womb.\u201d Harkening back to her own family\u2019s deep involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King said we shall also overcome abortion.\nTogether they made a dynamic team."}
