I might have been able to keep it but strategic default made life easier. I owed about $400,000 on a house that short-sold for $150K. The bank lost more than a quarter of a million dollars, and I lost at least $80K in down payment and property improvements. In a short sale the bank agrees to settle debt for the lesser amount and the seller gets nothing but is \u201cpunished\u201d by not being able to finance another house for at least two years (rules vary). My moment of acting rich was when I bought a second house before short-selling the first to skirt around the repercussions of my own bad luck.\n\nWhen the housing market tanked a few years ago, the government rescued every bank and business (even a damned insurance company), while ignoring everyone else. I realized that the game was fatally lopsided, so I didn\u2019t just walk away in middle-class shame, but rather I employed all my (extremely limited) cunning and deviousness to get a similar home before ditching the old one. I was able to cash in on low housing prices from a couple of years ago, coupled with low interest rates, to come out on top. The biggest barrier to getting a great deal was an almost overpowering need to behave like a middle-class sucker.\n\nI was taught growing up to \u201ckeep my word\u201d and that your handshake \u201cmeant something.\u201d Yet businessmen and individual wealthy people make decisions that are far less moral than a short sale. People \u201cincorporate\u201d so they can avoid legal responsibility for individual actions. It works great. You can stiff creditors, declare bankruptcy, pollute daily and raid pensions to enrich individual executives. If it all goes wrong, like it has so often for Donald Trump, you can keep your mansions and individual fortunes. It is no accident that the best-paid CEO in America has never made a dime for the company. If regular Americans acted like corporations and the moneyed class, our country would collapse in a week from systemic theft, corruption and greed.\n\nI always knew business was getting over on me, but I had no idea the extent until I started looking to short-sell. I first learned all I could about private home financing. I called up some shady investment groups around town and questioned them at length. I didn\u2019t end up using them, but they were frank, informative and unashamed.\n\n\u201cWho would pay 11 percent on a home loan?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cRich people,\u201d said \u201cBill\u201d from the legal loan-sharking company. \u201cThe rich have terrible credit.\u201d\n\nRich people = bad credit: Just let that sink in.\n\nBill told me in roundabout ways that rich people never pay a bill if there is any way around it. If something goes wrong in an investment or a business, they always preserve their own assets first. We\u2019ve all heard the generalization that they\u2019re lousy tippers.\n\nMost Americans are clueless about business and finance. Instead, we are a caste of customers. We consume short-term predatory lending, school loans that can never be discharged, inflated mortgages, high-interest credit cards, fast food and overpriced automobiles. We \u201cinvest\u201d in basic IRAs, doomsday prepping or Ponzi schemes. The worst part is that no matter how much money we gain or lose, the investor class always gets paid.\n\nDuring the same five- or six-year period my house value tanked, I also lost tens of thousands of dollars in retirement accounts. At the same time, my \u201cmoney manager\u201d collected a fee day after day, month after month. Since he is the dealer of America\u2019s crack-based stock market, he got paid regardless of performance.\n\nMiddle-class Americans just aren\u2019t the same species of human as the wealthy, but we refuse to even discuss the class issue in America. \u201cClass\u201d is for the British, even though the U.K. now has more upward mobility. There have been many great essays and movies about the parallel but unequal capitalist systems in America. There exists a baffling, byzantine maze of corporate and personal benefits enjoyed by the super-rich and investment class both indecipherable and unavailable to regular people.\n\nWe pay banks for the privilege of fleecing us, a fact made obvious by the growing slice of corporate profits generated by the financial sector. Employment in the financial sector hovers around 5 percent of the American workforce, while they skim a third of all corporate profits off the top. They create nothing and add nothing, so in essence, a massive chunk of American profit is made up of handling fees.\n\nLest I be accused of \u201csour grapes,\u201d because I\u2019m not rich, let me be clear. I live what used to be a middle-class life. We vacation every year without fail, own a home and live in a nice neighborhood. My hands stay clean at work. Of course, it could all crumble tomorrow, but for the moment, I\u2019m a \u201cwinner\u201d of some kind. Because I\u2019ve reached some small level of financial stability, I\u2019ve had the time to look around and see how utterly broken the system has become for most people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "So many of us are clueless about business and finance.
