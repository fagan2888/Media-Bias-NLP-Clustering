An organizer with the union CSEA SEIU Local 2001, Bermudez focused her efforts on union members, many of whom had technological experience, Internet access and the ability to sign up for coverage online or by telephone.\n\nEven so, they came to her for help.\n\n\u201cThey wanted that hand-to-hand contact,\u201d said Bermudez, who helped close to 1,000 people sign up for private insurance or Medicaid through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT.\n\nShe described her experiences to the exchange\u2019s board Thursday, imploring state officials to make the same type of in-person assistance available this fall, when the next round of open enrollment for health care coverage under Obamacare begins.\n\nThe federal funding for the assistance program ran out earlier this year, and there\u2019s no publicly available plan for what will happen during the next enrollment period, which begins Nov. 15.\n\nOthers who helped people sign up for coverage last fall and winter made similar appeals. They spoke of helping people who didn\u2019t initially understand the application questions or who had questions about what insurance was. Some said people have returned with questions about how to use their coverage or get care, even though the assistance program is now over.\n\n\u201cEvery state is struggling to figure out how to keep it going,\u201d Access Health CEO Kevin Counihan said.\n\nConnecticut will have an in-person assister program in the fall, Counihan said. But he said it might differ from the previous version. And how it will be funded remains unclear.\n\nDuring the previous open enrollment period, the program ran on close to $2.6 million in federal funds, with additional grants from foundations.\n\nThis year, Access Health plans to contribute about $456,000 in funds and supplies, and the state Department of Social Services might come up with some money, too, Counihan said. The exchange is also applying for federal money for the program.\n\nAnd Counihan said the program could be more targeted. Two-thirds of those who remain uninsured are concentrated in 10 cities. Most are eligible for Medicaid. And there\u2019s data on which assisters were the most effective at helping people sign up.\n\n\u201cNow we can be a lot more focused,\u201d Counihan said.\n\nFewer uninsured, but harder to reach\n\nRecent research done on behalf of the exchange indicated that more than half of those who signed up for coverage were previously uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe have fewer people to go after in terms of the uninsured population,\u201d Jason Madrak, Access Health\u2019s chief marketing officer told board members Thursday. \u201cBut finding those people can be quite difficult.\u201d\n\nEven though research suggests that most of the uninsured are concentrated geographically, Madrak noted that people who haven\u2019t signed up for coverage are those who didn\u2019t respond to a major marketing and outreach effort last year, suggesting the need to refine messaging and enrollment assistance.\n\nBenjamin Barnes, the state budget director and an exchange board member, said it would make sense to put more emphasis on \u201ctrust-based channels\u201d like in-person assisters to reach people who haven\u2019t responded to mass marketing, who might have other challenges.\n\n\u201cAs we shrink down, we\u2019re probably going to need to have more high-touch, high-trust interactions with our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the next open enrollment period won\u2019t just be about finding the uninsured; it will also require keeping people covered. Customers who signed up for private insurance last year will have to re-enroll, and there will be many new plan options to choose from.\n\nIn addition, more than 50,000 Connecticut residents have individual-market health plans that they won\u2019t be able to keep past this year, meaning many are likely to be searching for new plans.\n\nFrom enrollment to getting care\n\nDuring the previous open enrollment period, which ran from Oct. 1 to March 31, 239 people worked as in-person assisters. About a third spoke Spanish. By the end of March, they reported having worked with 289,072 people and signed up more than 19,000 state residents for health care coverage, according to a report on the program presented to the exchange board earlier this year.\n\nAccess Health officials say one of their goals for the future is to help people understand how to use their coverage, not just get them signed up.\n\nTwo Yale School of Public Health researchers who studied the enrollment experience suggested that could be part of the job of a year-round, in-person assistance program, focused on meeting the needs of underserved communities.\n\n\u201cIf Connecticut is to cover as many people as possible under the [Affordable Care Act], this effort must be preserved and improved,\u201d wrote the researchers, Jeannette Ickovics and Alycia Santilli, of Yale's Community Alliance for Research and Engagement, or CARE.\n\nThey surveyed 164 people who received in-person assistance and 121 uninsured state residents. They also held focus groups and focus groups with people involved in the assistance and outreach work.\n\nSantilli said the in-person assisters stood out.\n\n\u201cThey provided a critical service for consumers who were having a hard time navigating either the helpline or the website,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked about the ability to get needed information, 94 percent of survey participants who sought in-person assistance said they always got the information they needed, compared with 33 percent of telephone helpline users and 28 percent of website users.\n\nThey also found overall high rates of satisfaction with the enrollment process and with Access Health. Latinos, blacks and people with less education reported higher levels of satisfaction, although Santilli said data wasn\u2019t available to explain why.\n\nMichelle Jimenez, an outreach and enrollment specialist at Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, said many people need someone to spend the time to help them through the enrollment process, and said being able to do it in person is key. While helping a 20-year-old woman in Stamford apply for coverage, Jimenez said, she realized the woman didn\u2019t understand the questions she was asking.\n\n\u201cLuckily we were in the same room, so I was able to physically review the paperwork I\u2019d asked her to bring,\u201d she said.\n\nJimenez said some people have questions about what \u201chousehold\u201d -- a key term in the application -- means. Some people have questions about how to proceed if some of their family members are not in the U.S. legally. Others have questions about insurance terms, like \u201cout-of-pocket maximum,\u201d that they need to evaluate which insurance plan to buy, or about the federal tax credits that are available to discount some people\u2019s premiums.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of education,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/21/future-of-obamacare-enrollment-assistance-still-being-determined/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, in-person assisters, Kevin Counihan, Obamacare, uninsured", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/21/future-of-obamacare-enrollment-assistance-still-being-determined/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Officials say the in-person assistance program that helped thousands of state residents sign up for health care coverage last fall and winter will be back this fall for the next round of Obamacare enrollment.
