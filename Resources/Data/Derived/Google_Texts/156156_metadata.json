And yet, three years later, the move appears to have most benefited the Cornhuskers in hoops.\n\nHiring an exciting young coach, Tim Miles, and building a sparkling new facility, Pinnacle Bank Arena, certainly has something to do with the resurgence of Huskers basketball. This past season Nebraska\u2019s average home attendance increased by 5,067 \u2014 the biggest jump in the country \u2014 to 15,418 fans per game.\n\nFans had plenty to cheer about, with Nebraska posting a 19-13 record and earning an NCAA Tournament berth for the first time since 1998.\n\nBut Miles, hired away from Colorado State just more than two years ago, said being in the Big Ten has had perhaps the most profound impact on his program.\n\n\u201cThe venues are fantastic, and it\u2019s been fun for our guys to play against some of the best teams in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery night it\u2019s sold out, excitement level is through the roof, and it\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s also very difficult to play in these places, and that\u2019s what makes this such a great league.\u201d\n\nBig Ten teams averaged 13,534 fans per home game last season \u2014 an NCAA record, according to CBSsports.com.\n\nMiles said an opportunity to coach in the league was a big draw when Nebraska came calling.\n\n\u201cThe first thing was the Big Ten and what it means to be in this league, and the second thing was knowing that Nebraska fans would be behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Big Ten has been a league that I\u2019ve always wanted to be a part of.\u201d\n\nFor the football program, the move to the Big Ten has not seemingly paid big dividends. The Huskers have posted records of 9-4, 10-4 and 9-4 in their three seasons as a Big Ten member, a similar trend line to what they were doing in the Big 12. The biggest issue has been the loss of a major rival in Oklahoma as well as rivalries with Big Eight teams they played for decades, such as Colorado.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it has been an issue for some fans, and I recognize that as a cost,\u201d Nebraska chancellor Harvey Perlman said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we have a lot of alumni in Minneapolis and Chicago and Wisconsin, so there\u2019s trade-offs for sure.\u201d\n\nThe disappearance of longtime rivals has been more than made up for with revenue infusion from being in the Big Ten. Last year, member institutions earned about $25 million under the league\u2019s revenue-sharing model. Nebraska didn\u2019t rake in quite that much because it\u2019s still in a transition period and doesn\u2019t earn a full Big Ten share until 2017. Perlman said the amount Nebraska makes now is confidential.\n\n\u201cCertainly the financial impact will make a big difference when we become a full member,\u201d Perlman said. \u201cThe ability of our programs to be competitive will benefit greatly from that extra revenue.\u201d\n\nBut not all fans have warmed up to the move. Bill Kosch, originally from Columbus, Neb., and a star cornerback on Nebraska\u2019s national championship teams in 1970 and 1971, still finds the Big Ten landscape to be a bit strange.\n\nGone are the days of quick trips to geographical rivals such as Iowa State, Kansas, Missouri and Kansas State, all longtime members of the Big Eight. They have been replaced by treks to Penn State (1,071 miles from Lincoln), Ohio State (813), Michigan (744) and Michigan State (725). Rutgers (1,285) and Maryland (1,202) became the newest Big Ten members Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of familiarity (in the Big Eight and Big 12), and everything was in your backyard,\u201d Kosch said. \u201cWith the conference stretching all the way to the East Coast now, it\u2019s going to take some getting used to.\u201d\n\nAlex Lantz: 303-954-2699, alantz@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alexlantz\n\nLong droughts\n\nNebraska\u2019s move to the Big Ten and the hiring of Tim Miles as head coach has led to a rise in Husker basketball few expected.
