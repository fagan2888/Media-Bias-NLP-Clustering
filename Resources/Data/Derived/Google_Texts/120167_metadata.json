The carries aren\u2019t anything close to the old-fashioned workhorse duty for running backs, with CSU also deploying Treyous Jarrells and Jasen Oden at the position.\n\nWhile it\u2019s arguable the knee injuries have slightly diluted his straight-ahead speed, Hart has been an opportunistic, hard-nosed and usually a straight-ahead runner. He couldn\u2019t pull away from Eagles defenders on what turned out to be his 43-yard run to the BC 12 on CSU\u2019s game-winning drive in the final minutes Saturday and took considerable teasing about that. Yet it all was good-natured in the wake of the victory, and Hart seems to be finding varied ways to be effective, including as a willing and savvy pass blocker for quarterback Garrett Grayson when that\u2019s called for.\n\nHart, the one-time much-touted recruit from Orlando, Fla., arrived in Fort Collins in late July, eager for the opportunity to play for the Rams and for Jim McElwain, the CSU head coach who recruited him for Alabama as the Crimson Tide\u2019s offensive coordinator.\n\nA progress report?\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s been better than I hoped,\u201d Hart said Saturday at Alumni Stadium. \u201cA lot of guys don\u2019t get a second opportunity, and that\u2019s what I look at it as. I feel like I\u2019m blessed. I give all the honor and glory to God, because it\u2019s been a long road. When you keep fighting and you don\u2019t give up, it\u2019s always good.\u201d\n\nHart added: \u201cI grew a lot. Coach McElwain always talks about \u2018your best game is your next game.\u2019 I was on a lot of championship teams and that was good, but right now I\u2019m playing for Colorado State. That\u2019s my main focus, and that\u2019s why I wanted to come out here and give whatever I can to the team. Whatever I can do for the team, that\u2019s what I want.\u201d\n\nWith a barbed sense of humor, Hart already has become one of the most popular players on the team and a leader, still in his first weeks on campus. Hart is 22 years old and already has a college diploma, so he\u2019s a relative graybeard already, with a senior season of eligibility remaining in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe are young,\u201d he said of the Rams, who have gotten off to slow starts in three of their four games and next face Tulsa at home Saturday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tapped our potential yet. We hear a lot about how we\u2019re a second-half team. It\u2019s all a mind-set for us. We have to come out and know we can be a first-half and a second-half team.\u201d\n\nEye on \u2026The Golden Hurricane\n\nTulsa at Colorado State, 1 p.m. Saturday, no TV (CSUrams.com and Mountain West network online)\n\nFor the record: Tulsa is 1-3 after losing 37-34 at home to Texas State in triple overtime Saturday.\n\nStreaking: The Golden Hurricane has lost three straight after beating Tulane in its opener, also losing to Oklahoma and Florida Atlantic before the Saturday heartbreaker.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Sophomore wide receiver Keevan Lucas has 37 catches for 439 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nWho\u2019s not: The Golden Hurricane\u2019s defense has struggled, with Tulsa allowing 170 points in four games.\n\nKey stat: The Golden Hurricane has averaged 429 yards of total offense per game \u2014 but has allowed 505.\n\nFYI: The Golden Hurricane came from behind with 13 unanswered fourth-quarter points to beat the Rams 30-27 in Tulsa last season. That dropped CSU to 0-2 before the Rams got the ship righted.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alabama transfer Dee Hart keys CSU\u2019s early success", "title": "Alabama transfer Dee Hart keys CSU\u2019s early success", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/28/alabama-transfer-dee-hart-keys-csus-early-success/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140928__20140929_B8_SP29FBCCSUp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140928__20140929_B8_SP29FBCCSUp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-28T21:14:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:06:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a01\"", "article_summary": "Hart rushed for 117 yards on 10 carries against the Eagles and has 310 yards on 50 rushes for the season.\nFYI: The Golden Hurricane came from behind with 13 unanswered fourth-quarter points to beat the Rams 30-27 in Tulsa last season.\nWhile it\u2019s arguable the knee injuries have slightly diluted his straight-ahead speed, Hart has been an opportunistic, hard-nosed and usually a straight-ahead runner.\nKey stat: The Golden Hurricane has averaged 429 yards of total offense per game \u2014 but has allowed 505.\nThat\u2019s my main focus, and that\u2019s why I wanted to come out here and give whatever I can to the team."}
