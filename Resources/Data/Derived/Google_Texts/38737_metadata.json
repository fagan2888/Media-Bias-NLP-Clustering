Randy Hultgren and Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley join \u201cChicago Tonight\u201d for a wide-ranging conversation on topics including homeland security, health care and the volatile 2016 presidential race.\n\nQuigley represents Illinois' 5th district, which covers much of Chicago's North Side as well as Schiller Park, Elmhurst and Oak Brook. Hultgren represents the wide-ranging 14th district, from Antioch on the north end to Yorkville on the south end.\n\nBelow, some highlights from our discussion.\n\nOn the Presidential Primaries\n\nHultgren said while he will not vote for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, he is not yet sold on Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI had questions even with Romney. He wasn\u2019t my first choice. I was very supportive of him, but I had some questions. And I think even more so with Trump, and a lot of my constituents are saying the same thing \u2013 that it\u2019s been a lot of platitudes, a lot of big talking, but I want to hear details, I want to hear specifics about what is his plan with the Affordable Care Act \u2026 as far as international defense, international policy, I\u2019ve got a lot of questions,\u201d Hultgren said.\n\nBut Hultgren said he hopes to have his questions answered in order to see the party unite.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been the responsibility of the candidate to bring people back together. Primaries are tough,\u201d Hultgren said.\n\nQuigley said Clinton\u2019s numbers are not as favorable as they could be, but he\u2019s not worried.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [her numbers] as harsh and as questioning as they are with Mr. Trump,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech \u2013 inconsistent, incoherent, glib, superficial and frankly dangerous. So an experienced woman, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will come through far more favorably.\u201d\n\nOn how the tone of the primaries affects Congress\n\nHultgren said it\u2019s possible that House Speaker Paul Ryan may have an agenda that leads in a different direction than Trump, if he were elected.\n\n\u201cWe have to recognize the House has a different responsibility than the president does. We still have to do our job whatever happens, whoever ultimately is the president, we have to continue to do our work,\u201d Hultgren said. \u201cI think what Speaker Ryan is asking similar questions that I have [about Trump]. My hope, my intent is that I will be comforted \u2013 that I\u2019ll be able to hear clear answers, clear, concise statements on foreign policy, which I haven\u2019t heard yet.\u201d\n\nThe fractures in the parties make it harder to get work done, Quigley said.\n\n\u201cI think the polarization that exists makes it harder to be a centrist. I\u2019ve talked to my Republican centrist colleagues. They\u2019re concerned that they\u2019re getting picked off by the Tea Party,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cThat makes it harder for the Republican centrists to move toward the center and find consensus.\u201d\n\nOn the future of the Affordable Care Act\n\nHultgren said he still wants changes to the Affordable Care Act\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many problems. For me, boiling it down when I talk to my constituents, they\u2019re getting less coverage and it\u2019s costing them more. They have less options, and it\u2019s costing them more. So it clearly hasn\u2019t lived up to the promise,\u201d Hultgren said. \u201cWhat we have to have happen is an honest discussion of what can we do. We\u2019re a compassionate nation. Let\u2019s make sure we do have coverage for preexisting conditions. Let\u2019s make sure we do have coverage for people coming out school before they have a job so they can stay on their parents\u2019 [plan]. We can do that, but what we\u2019re seeing now \u2013 huge insurance companies pulling out saying, \u2018we can no longer do this,\u2019 talking about double-digit premium increases coming up on November first. It\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\nQuigley said many of the problems with the law were inherited.\n\n\u201cI understand tweaking of this, but there have been zero efforts to tweak and a ton of efforts \u2013 over 60 \u2013 to defund or repeal the law,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do the things that we\u2019re talking about here in terms of tweaking without finding a funding mechanism. So unless that\u2019s something [like] a new tax the Republicans want to propose, the healthcare law as it exists maintains. And millions more people are covered in a more meaningful way.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories from \u201cChicago Tonight\u201d\n\nHow Donald Trump\u2019s Rise Could Impact Illinois Races\n\nMay 5: Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, the hand-wringing and discord within the party is growing.\n\nIncumbents Safe, Few Surprises in Illinois\u2019 US House Races\n\nMarch 15: As expected, no incumbent congressman in the Chicago metro area appears to have been knocked off the general election ballot by primary challengers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chicago Tonight | WTTW", "description": "Congressmen Mike Quigley and Randy Hultgren join \"Chicago Tonight\" for a conversation about issues facing Congress, including national security, health care and lead levels in water.
