Parent Sommer Bauer told me her son\u2019s teacher gave him a document that portrayed the presidents on Mount Rushmore as being racists.\n\nSchool superintendent E.C. Alexander refuted allegations that the Nation of Islam document had been distributed in class. He told me the document was never meant for public distribution and that the child took the sheet of paper from the teacher\u2019s work station without her permission.\n\n\u201cThe student ( without permission ) took the sheet from a \u201cton\u201d of discarded teacher\u2019s material on that table; then, the student took it home and gave it to the parent,\u201d Alexander wrote in an email to educators after my column was published.\n\nSupt. Alexander also posted a statement on the school district\u2019s website. He hurled all sorts of allegations my way \u2013 words like \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201ctotally incorrect\u201d and \u201csensational.\u201d\n\nYet, he never got around to telling us what was misleading or totally incorrect or sensational. And we still don\u2019t know how that Nation of Islam information found its way into that third grade classroom.\n\n\u201cOur System has been defamed (possibly permanently),\u201d he bemoaned.\n\n\u201cNow, the thought that we as public educators would deliberately distribute such material is absolutely absurd,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also took great umbrage at my characterization of the Nation of Islam document as a \u201chandout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sheet in question was not a hand-out sheet distributed to students,\u201d he wrote on the school district\u2019s website. I should point out that he underlined the word \u201cnot.\u201d\n\nInstead, he referred to it as a \u201csheet.\u201d So for the sake of accuracy, the Nation of Islam \u201chandout\u201d will be known as the Nation of Islam \u201csheet.\u201d\n\nParents were given a letter on Tuesday stressing that the material contained in the Nation of Islam \u201csheet \u201d was not distributed to students, was not shown during or after the lesson and was not used as a reference.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the school district\u2019s explanation \u2013 a second parent has now come forward corroborating Mrs. Bauer\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cYes, they were handed out and yes the students did look at them and read them,\u201d the parent told me.\n\nThe parent asked not to be identified to protect her child. She told me she came forward because of how the school is treating Mrs. Bauer\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this little boy to be looked at as a liar,\u201d the parent said. \u201cAs of right now that\u2019s what all of these adults are making this boy out to be \u2013 and that makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\nSo what happened inside that third grade classroom at Harold McCormick Elementary School?\n\nAccording to the parent, the children were separated into four groups. Each group was given two \u201csheets of paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teacher held up each one and said, \u2018These do not go home. These are just to use here,\u201d the parent told me.\n\nThe Nation of Islam \u201csheet \u201d explained that George Washington hailed from Virginia, a \u201cprime breeder of black people.\u201d Of Theodore Roosevelt, it was alleged he called Africans \u201cape-like.\u201d There were also disparaging comments made about Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe parent told me that the teacher did not teach students from the Nation of Islam \u201csheet.\u201d But she did hand it to the students.\n\nMaybe this was just an innocent mistake. It\u2019s possible the teacher may have printed the first thing she Googled without giving it a second glance. It happens. Teachers are busy folks.\n\nBut what was not an innocent mistake was a school district trying to portray an eight-year-old boy as the bad guy.\n\nAnd what is not acceptable is sending out mass emails accusing the child of pilfering a \u201csheet\u201d from his teacher\u2019s work station.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t know better \u2013 I\u2019d say that little boy is the victim of grownup bullying.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A second parent has now come forward acknowledging their child received a Nation of Islam handout in a third grade class at Harold McCormick Elementary School in Elizabethton, Tennessee  contradicting claims by the school district that the document was not distributed in the classroom..05/26/2016 6:01:00AM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A second parent has now come forward acknowledging their child received a Nation of Islam handout in a third grade class at Harold McCormick Elementary School in Elizabethton, Tennessee  contradicting claims by the school district that the document was not distributed in the classroom.", "title": "- Second Parent: My Child Got Nation of Islam Paper, Too", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/10/29/second-parent-my-child-got-nation-of-islam-paper-too-n1911486", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/287/050ad690-1e28-4bee-a816-70a1de75fd0d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A second parent has now come forward acknowledging their child received a Nation of Islam handout in a third grade class at Harold McCormick Elementary School in Elizabethton, Tennessee  contradicting claims by the school district that the document was not distributed in the classroom.", "title": "- Second Parent: My Child Got Nation of Islam Paper, Too", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/10/29/second-parent-my-child-got-nation-of-islam-paper-too-n1911486", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/287/050ad690-1e28-4bee-a816-70a1de75fd0d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Second Parent: My Child Got Nation of Islam Paper, Too, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd296\"", "article_summary": "Alexander refuted allegations that the Nation of Islam document had been distributed in class.\n\u201cYes, they were handed out and yes the students did look at them and read them,\u201d the parent told me.\nThe parent told me that the teacher did not teach students from the Nation of Islam \u201csheet.\u201d But she did hand it to the students.\nThese are just to use here,\u201d the parent told me.\nAnd we still don\u2019t know how that Nation of Islam information found its way into that third grade classroom."}
