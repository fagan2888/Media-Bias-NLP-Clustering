Michael Rogers said on Monday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHave I lost capability that we had prior to the revelations? Yes,\" he added during a cybersecurity conference held by the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute.\n\nCritics of Snowden in the government have long expressed fears that his leaks helped terrorists avoid detection by the NSA, and have caused blind spots for U.S. spies.\n\nThose fears have been contradicted, however, by various forms of official praise for Snowden\u2019s leaks, which have seemed to legitimize his actions.\n\nThe latest validation came on Sunday night, when the creators of \u201cCitizenfour\u201d \u2014 which depicted intimate moments with Snowden holed up in a Hong Kong hotel room as his documents made headlines around the globe \u2014 were honored at the Academy Awards. In the past, journalists at The Washington Post and the Guardian were given the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for public service, among many other plaudits for both Snowden and the reporters who worked with him.\n\nDebate over the NSA is likely to head back to Capitol Hill in coming weeks, ahead of a June 1 deadline for Congress to reauthorize provisions of the Patriot Act that allow the NSA to collect \u201cmetadata\u201d about Americans\u2019 phone calls.\n\nThat program, which has emerged as the most controversial revealed by Snowden\u2019s leaks, \u201cgenerates value for the nation,\u201d Rogers said, adding, however, that it is not a \u201csilver bullet.\u201d Instead, he called it \u201cone component of a broader strategy\u201d to protect the U.S. against foreign threats.\n\nCritics have disagreed. Last year, the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board said that the program has never produced information that could not have been picked up through other means. The board also said that it is illegal.\n\nIf the program is not reauthorized this year, Rogers seemed to say that the agency could effectively carry out its mission. That prediction is more measured than those of others who have worried about potentially disastrous impacts on national security.\n\n\u201cDo I think that if we lose it, it makes our job harder? Yes,\u201d Rogers said.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, we respond to the legal framework that is created for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Snowden's leaks have made the NSA's job harder, Director Michael Rogers maintained.", "description": "Snowden's leaks have made the NSA's job harder, Director Michael Rogers maintained.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Snowden's leaks have made the NSA's job harder, Director Michael Rogers maintained.", "title": "Oscar for Snowden documentary not stopping criticism", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/233482-oscar-for-snowden-doc-not-stopping-criticism", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/snowdenedward_nsa_042314getty_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-23T12:35:45-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-23T12:35-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/233482-oscar-for-snowden-doc-not-stopping-criticism", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-23T12:18-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-23T12:18:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-23T12:35:45-05:00"}, "keywords": "National Security Agency,Michael Rogers, Edward Snowden,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/233482-oscar-for-snowden-doc-not-stopping-criticism", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Snowden's leaks have made the NSA's job harder, Director Michael Rogers maintained.", "card": "summary", "title": "Oscar for Snowden documentary not stopping criticism"}, "dcterms.title": "Oscar for Snowden documentary not stopping criticism"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c0b\"", "article_summary": "The fact that a film about Edward Snowden won an Oscar for best documentary isn't silencing criticism of the leaker from the head of the National Security Agency (NSA).\nYes,\u201d Rogers said.\nThose fears have been contradicted, however, by various forms of official praise for Snowden\u2019s leaks, which have seemed to legitimize his actions.\nCritics of Snowden in the government have long expressed fears that his leaks helped terrorists avoid detection by the NSA, and have caused blind spots for U.S. spies.\nSnowden\u2019s leaks about the NSA have \u201chad a material impact on our ability to generate insights about what terrorist groups around the world are doing,\u201c NSA Director Adm.
