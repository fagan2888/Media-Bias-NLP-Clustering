Virginia moved to the Maryland 24-yard line in the closing seconds before Alec Vozenilek\u2019s 42-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right with 10 seconds remaining.\n\nThe game featured five lead changes, 973 yards in offense and 157 offensive plays \u2014 including a whopping 93 by the Cavaliers.\n\n\u201cWell, that will make you feel a few years older, but I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Terrapins coach Randy Edsall said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to beat Virginia the last time we\u2019ll see them probably in the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nThe Terrapins and Cavaliers first clashed in 1919 and have played every season since 1957. But Maryland is leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference next year to join the Big Ten, leaving the future of the series in doubt.\n\nAs it stands now, Maryland leads 44-32-2.\n\nRowe made his second career start in place of C.J. Brown, who sustained a concussion in last week\u2019s 63-0 loss at Florida State. Rowe went 18 for 34 and directed an offense that accumulated 468 yards.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt like I was too ready,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cBut once I settled in I made a few good plays here and there. Luckily, our team rallied around me and we came out with a victory.\u201d\n\nBrandon Ross ran for 88 yards and two touchdowns for the Terrapins (5-1, 1-1), who ended a three-game skid at home against the Cavaliers (2-4, 0-2).\n\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s probably the biggest rivalry we have in football here at the University of Maryland,\u201d Edsall said. \u201cSo to be able to beat them the last time, it\u2019s something special.\u201d\n\nDavid Watford went 27 for 44 for 263 yards and a score, and tight end Jake McGee had eight catches for 114 yards and a touchdown for the Cavaliers, who have lost three straight. Kevin Parks ran for 112 yards and a touchdown, and Khalek Shepherd contributed 81 yards rushing to an offense that amassed 505 yards.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019ve got to do better to give us the opportunity to win the game at the end,\u201d coach Mike London said. \u201cAlec should not shoulder the blame or anything like that. That\u2019s his first miss since he\u2019s been kicking. It\u2019s unfortunate, but that\u2019s the way the game goes sometimes. The kids were resilient. I\u2019m really proud of their effort.\u201d\n\nThe Terrapins trailed 23-20 in the fourth quarter when a Virginia punt hit a Maryland player and was recovered by the Cavaliers. That led to Vozenilek\u2019s fourth field goal with 7:11 remaining.\n\nRowe brought the Terrapins back with the help of two exceptional receptions. First, Deon Long leaped between two defenders to grab a floater on a third-and-22 for a 47-yard gain to the Virginia 13.\n\n\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t say this, but Deon ran the wrong route,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cHe just made a great catch. Deon is a great player and I just gave him a jump ball and he came down with it.\u201d\n\nLondon might remember that play more than any other.\n\n\u201cWe talk about the missed field goal at the end, but on third-and-22 like that, you get off the field,\u201d London said. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical difference.\u201d\n\nTwo plays later, Stinebaugh made a diving catch in the middle of the end zone that held up after a replay review.\n\nDown at halftime, Maryland got two field goals from Brad Craddock in the third quarter to take a 20-16 lead. Craddock\u2019s second 3-pointer came after Rowe ran 19 yards on a third-and-13 and followed that with a 21-yard completion to Stefon Diggs.\n\nThe advantage disappeared when Parks scored on a 6-yard run with 13:15 left in the game.\n\nVozenilek kicked three field goals, and the Cavaliers took advantage of two Maryland turnovers in going up 16-14 at halftime.\n\nVirginia\u2019s first possession ended with a punt. William Likely fumbled the kick, Darius Lee recovered for the Cavaliers and Vozenilek made it 3-0.\n\nMinutes later, Watford completed passes of 16 and 38 yards to McGee in a drive that produced another field goal after Parks was twice stuffed at the 1-yard line.\n\n\u201cThat was probably the difference in the game, holding them to field goals,\u201d Edsall said. \u201cWe could have been down 10-0 rather than 6-0.\u201d\n\nThe Terrapins went up 7-6 late in the quarter when Ross turned a screen pass into a 77-yard gain, then ran it in from the 1.\n\nAfter a holding penalty wiped out a Maryland touchdown, Rowe lost a fumble. But the Terrapins got the ball back, and Ross made it 14-6 with a 7-yard touchdown run.\n\nThe Cavaliers then closed to 14-13, using a 44-yard run by Shepherd set up a 4-yard TD pass to McGee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rowe made his second career start in place of C.J.
