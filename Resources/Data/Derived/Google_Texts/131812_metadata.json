Get Covered Illinois picked Chicago-based Onion Labs, in addition to its ad agency Downtown Partners, for its irreverent campaign, which includes a Twitter feed and a website for the faux \u201cLuck Health Plan,\u201d which is actually no plan at all. Slogan: \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. Probably.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wanted to sell this fairly serious topic in a way that would cut through to Millennials, which is an audience that actively rejects advertising,\u201d said Rick Hamann, Onion Labs\u2019 senior vice president of content. \u201cSpeaking down to them or doing dull work is the fastest way to get ignored.\u201d\n\nAs part of the Illinois campaign, Onion Labs created a microsite on The Onion for health care and populated it with original stories and videos starring its health hack character, A.J. Mack.\n\nThe health exchange ads follow a similar sarcastic path forged by Zach Galifianakis and his Funny or Die-produced Between Two Ferns interview with President Barack Obama. The intentionally awkward video became a viral sensation this past spring \u2013 it has snagged nearly 9 million YouTube views to date \u2014 and sent people flocking to healthcare.gov.\n\nWhile that video and its bone dry sense of humor worked for Obamacare, some state campaigns have fallen short of the mark when they tried to be hip or punny.\n\nA musical ad for Cover Oregon, most often described as a twee Wes Anderson ripoff, was widely panned. It spawned a parody on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, with singer Lisa Loeb performing an acoustic ditty in a frame-by-frame smackdown of the quirky spot.\n\nAnd Colorado\u2019s health initiative drew mostly criticism for its \u201cbrosurance\u201d ads that tried to appeal to young adults by using keg parties and one-night stands as selling tools.\n\nBecause late night cable TV keeps its eyes on such things, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart poked fun at the Colorado campaign with a Spring Breakers-themed video. \u201cBikinis, big booties and health care, y\u2019all,\u201d said Aasif Mandvi as the James Franco character from the flick. \u201cThat\u2019s what life is all about.\u201d\n\nHealthcare isn\u2019t the only serious-minded category to lean on satire and offbeat humor lately. Allstate has done so repeatedly for home and car insurance with its Mayhem character, seen in a recent campaign as a social media-savvy burglar selling off residents\u2019 household belongings while they were out at a football game.\n\nAnd high-end Chubb Insurance, in a just-launched television and print ad campaign, focuses on some bad choices \u2013- baking on a tanning bed, eloping in Vegas -\u2013 to drive home the point about being level-headed in protecting your home and investments.\n\nExecutives at ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein wanted to humanize the insurance company and tweak the perception that Chubb is only for the super rich.\n\n\u201cWe kept the casting upscale, but we intended to show that even successful people do dumb things,\u201d said Tom Christmann, chief creative officer. \u201cThat taps into a basic human insight that we can all relate to.\u201d\n\nThe spot, dubbed \u201cInsurance Against Regret,\u201d deadpans its way through parking in a tow-away zone and rocking a bad perm to illustrate a few ideas that seemed good at the time. Later, not so much. The campaign is airing on ESPN and various cable channels and running in the Wall Street Journal and other national business-geared publications.\n\n\u201cInstead of scare tactics, which turn people off, it\u2019s better to use a little bit of humor,\u201d Christmann said. \u201cIt makes a brand more approachable.\u201d\n\nHave something to add to this story?
