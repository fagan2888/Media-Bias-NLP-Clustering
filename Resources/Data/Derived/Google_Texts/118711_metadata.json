The Cook County Animal Abuser Registry would cover all Cook County municipalities, forcing convicted abusers to register on a database hosted on the sheriff's website. Failure to register would result in a fine up to $2,000. Pet shops, shelters and rescues would be required to check the registry prior to selling or adopting out an animal. It also prohibits people from obtaining animals on behalf of a convicted abuser, or if that person shares the same address with a registered abuser.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cook County Commissioner John Fritchey has introduced an ordinance that would make it a crime for convicted animal abusers to buy or adopt another animal for 15 years after their conviction -- or ever, if they are convicted of more than one offense.", "author": "Daily Herald report", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "Cook County Commissioner John Fritchey has introduced an ordinance that would make it a crime for convicted animal abusers to buy or adopt another animal for 15 years after their conviction -- or ever, if they are convicted of more than one offense.", "title": "Animal abuse registry proposed for Cook County", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160417/news/160418886/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/gfx/site/logos/dailyherald_marble_300.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 8960722, "title": "Animal abuse registry proposed for Cook County", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160417/news/160418886/", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "description": "Cook County Commissioner John Fritchey has introduced an ordinance that would make it a crime for convicted animal abusers to buy or adopt another animal for 15 years after their conviction -- or ever, if they are convicted of more than one offense."}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "News, Pets and Animals, Crime, Cook County", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2016-04-17", "modified_time": "2016-04-17T19:21:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2121\"", "article_summary": "The Cook County Animal Abuser Registry would cover all Cook County municipalities, forcing convicted abusers to register on a database hosted on the sheriff's website.\nAnimal abuse registry proposed for Cook CountyhelloCook County Commissioner John Fritchey of Chicago has introduced an ordinance that would make it a crime for convicted animal abusers to buy or adopt another animal for 15 years after their conviction -- or ever, if they are convicted of more than one offense.\nIt also prohibits people from obtaining animals on behalf of a convicted abuser, or if that person shares the same address with a registered abuser.\nPet shops, shelters and rescues would be required to check the registry prior to selling or adopting out an animal.\nFailure to register would result in a fine up to $2,000."}
