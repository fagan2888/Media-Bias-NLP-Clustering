The poll draws on respondents with $10,000 or more in investments in any combination of mutual funds, bonds, stocks, self-directed IRAs and 401(k) accounts.\n\nThe survey has been conducted quarterly since 2011. Before that, it was conducted quarterly from October 1996 through December 1998. It was conducted monthly from February 1999 to October 2009.\n\nThe most current results come from surveys conducted Aug. 15-24 with 1,011 investors. The survey group included 631 non-retirees and 374 retirees.\n\nPersonal Outlooks Are More Positive\n\nGallup\u2019s poll includes a component that measures investors\u2019 confidence in their personal economic standing versus the broad-based U.S. economy. The most recent poll showed investors have a much more positive view of their personal standing and ability to maintain or improve income over the next year than they do of the broad-based economy.\n\nIn regard to personal standing, the number was +47. As far as the overall economy, the number came in around -1. The trend has been similar since 2011.\n\nDisparity Exists\n\nWorking Americans seem to be more optimistic about the economy than their retired investor counterparts, Gallup found.\n\nThe optimism index for working Americans in the August survey was +50 while retirees logged a +35. The disparity, Gallup theorizes, might be due to the overall steady nature of job gains and growth in the GDP since the start of 2014.\n\nRetirees, on the other hand, have witnessed relatively flat stock market growth since the year began.\n\nGet Free Updates!
