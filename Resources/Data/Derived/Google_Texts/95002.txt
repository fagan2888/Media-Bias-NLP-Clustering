Colorado takes a giant step into election season this week as ballots are mailed out to millions of voters to help major parties select nominees in the June 24 primary, including four Republicans who are running for governor.

No Democratic or American Constitution Party candidates for state offices are facing primary challengers.

Most of the attention in the primary, then, is focused on the governor’s race between former U.S. Rep. Bob Beauprez, Secretary of State Scott Gessler, former state Senate Republican leader Mike Kopp and former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo.

The winner will face Democratic incumbent John Hickenlooper, as the GOP tries to regain the governor’s seat after eight years since Gov. Bill Owens left office.

Beauprez was the GOP nominee in 2006 but lost to Bill Ritter.

In 2010, Tancredo was a third-party candidate for governor. Although he represented the American Constitution Party, he drained conservative votes from the controversy-prone GOP nominee, Dan Maes. That benefited Hickenlooper but didn’t affect the outcome. Tancredo received 617,030 votes and Maes got just 187,318 for a total of 804,348 votes. Hickenlooper received 851,886.

Colorado has almost 1.1 million registered Democrats and more than 1.1 million Republicans among the state’s 3.55 million voters. The largest number of Coloradans — about 1.3 million — identify as unaffiliated.

Unaffiliated voters can declare a party preference to the county election office anytime through June 24, but those who are affiliated can no longer switch to another party. The deadline to change affiliation was May 23.

June 16 is the last day to register to vote online in the primary and still receive a ballot in the mail.

Ballots are due back to county election offices before 7 p.m. June 24.
