I slept outside the entire summer of 2012. On no less than six occasions I was approached by Denver police. At no time was I offered any information about a shelter or any other type of service. I was simply told to move along, no matter what time it was.\n\nI grew tired of employers not hiring me because I used 2323 Curtis St. (the St. Francis homeless center) as a mailing address. I also grew tired of the way RTD treats anyone they think is homeless. I was told to leave Civic Center Station even though I had bus fare, and I was refused service on more than one occasion because I appeared to be homeless.\n\nIf we aren\u2019t allowed to sit in public areas, then where are we able to sit?\n\nCriminalizing acts of people experiencing homelessness does nothing good for the homeless individual or the business community.\n\nJohn W. Claybaugh, Denver\n\nThis letter was published in the April 20 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "homeless veterans,homelessness,right to rest act", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/04/19/why-colorado-legislature-should-pass-right-to-rest-act/37282/", "site_name": "eLetters", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Why Colorado legislature should pass Right to Rest Act"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Why Colorado legislature should pass Right to Rest Act", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/04/19/why-colorado-legislature-should-pass-right-to-rest-act/37282/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@denveropinion", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Pass the Right to rest act because criminalizing the acts of people experiencing homelessness does nothing good for the homeless or the business community."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94f2\"", "article_summary": "Re: \u201cColorado \u2018right to rest\u2019 homeless bill gets testimony in House committee,\u201d April 16 news story.\nThe Right to Rest Act is designed to allow people experiencing homelessness in Colorado to exist in public space.\nI grew tired of employers not hiring me because I used 2323 Curtis St. (the St. Francis homeless center) as a mailing address.\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.\nCriminalizing acts of people experiencing homelessness does nothing good for the homeless individual or the business community."}
