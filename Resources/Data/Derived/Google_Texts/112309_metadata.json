Instead, the school is replacing him with another student, which has led to Solanki\u2019s suspension and a request for a psychiatric evaluation. He also will now not be allowed to walk across the stage at graduation, according to NJ.com:\n\nDevan Solanki, the Ivy League-bound valedictorian at Lodi High School, says school officials have plotted against him \u2013 first by stripping him of the opportunity to deliver the graduation speech, then by suspending him, and finally, by requiring that he undergo a psychiatric evaluation before he can return to school.\n\nThe school administration is defending its actions and blames Solanki. They reference his past disciplinary issues and the counselor interpreting Solanki\u2019s statement, \u201cI just want to resolve this peacefully,\u201d as a threat.\n\nStudents, however, are backing Solanki by protesting at the school on Tuesday, June 16.\n\n\u201cThe student body agreed unanimously \u2026 that Devan deserved to give the speech,\u201d said Goraz Kumar, the National Honor Society president, a junior. \u201cWhen we found out that he wouldn\u2019t get a chance to give the speech, that he had to get mentally evaluated to come back to school, we all thought that was enough and we need to voice our opinion.\u201d\n\nSchool administrators and teachers continue to tell us their job is to teach students how to think critically. Solanki, who is obviously a very smart student who thinks for himself and questions the administration\u2019s rules, is subject to abnormally harsh punishment as a result. In essence, as Solanki graduates, his last lesson from his high school will be: \u201cDon\u2019t critically think for yourself about what the education bureaucracy tells you; just obey our rules or you will be punished.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/06/school-refuses-harvard-bound-valedictorian-speech-orders-psychiatric-evaluation/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LodiHighSchool.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "School Refuses Harvard-Bound Valedictorian Speech, Orders Psychiatric Evaluation"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadd2\"", "article_summary": "Devan Solanki was expecting to give a speech at the Lodi High School graduation; after all, he was the school\u2019s valedictorian and is headed to Harvard in the fall.\nInstead, the school is replacing him with another student, which has led to Solanki\u2019s suspension and a request for a psychiatric evaluation.\n\u201cThe student body agreed unanimously \u2026 that Devan deserved to give the speech,\u201d said Goraz Kumar, the National Honor Society president, a junior.\nStudents, however, are backing Solanki by protesting at the school on Tuesday, June 16.\nIn essence, as Solanki graduates, his last lesson from his high school will be: \u201cDon\u2019t critically think for yourself about what the education bureaucracy tells you; just obey our rules or you will be punished.\u201d"}
