In late March, his body was finally found in some underbrush near the hospital. That same day, a groundskeeper found patient Leonard Cunningham who had been missing since February. Cunningham was hanging by a rope on a tree not far from where McKenzie had been found. In response, the authorities initiated a clearing of the underbrush that covered much of the facility.\n\nIn May, that effort resulted in the discovery of a skeleton. It\u2019s wristband revealed it to be a patient who had wandered off from the facility\u2019s nursing home 15 years earlier.\n\nAfter that, measures were taken to improve the search procedures at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salem, but the effectiveness of those measures is open to debate. In December of that year, Roy Phillips, a Korean War veteran who could barely walk, went missing from the hospital. A search was organized but was called off later that night. Two groundskeepers found Phillips the next morning dead from exposure.\n\nWhile that sounds like something that happened recently at the VA, it occurred back in 1992.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the VA has had a long history of such scandals. Ironically, though, I found the above story in Phillip Longman\u2019s book Best Care Anywhere: Why VA Health Care Is Better Than Yours. In a piece that will be out shortly, I show how the idea popularized by Longman\u2019s book is, in part, to blame for the VA waiting list scandal.\n\nOne of Longman\u2019s contentions is that the VA works so well because of its computerized medical record system known as VistA. Supposedly VistA enables physicians and other health care providers to avoid making serious, sometimes deadly, medical errors. That makes this recent story about the VA seem rather curious:\n\nTwo psychiatric patients at a veterans facility in Brockton received no regular evaluations of their condition for years, part of a \u201ctroubling pattern of deficient patient care\u201d that federal investigators say they have confirmed at veterans health care facilities nationwide. One of the neglected patients at the Brockton Community Living Center who had been admitted for \u201csignificant and chronic mental health issues\u201d was living in the 106-bed facility for eight years before he received his first psychiatric evaluation, investigators reported. The other unidentified patient, although he was classified as 100 percent mentally disabled due to his military service, had only a single \u201cpsychiatric note\u201d placed in his medical file between 2005 and 2013.\n\nHow good is a medical record system if it takes eight years for a patient living in a VA facility to receive an evaluation? Granted, errors will happen even in the best record system, but that\u2019s one pretty big error. I suspect that as this scandal unfolds we are going to find out that VistA isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.\n\nTo read more about VA disasters, a report released yesterday by Senator Tom Coburn\u2019s is a good place to start.
