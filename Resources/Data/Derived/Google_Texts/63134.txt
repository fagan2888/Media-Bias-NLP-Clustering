The biggest fundraiser of the year for the American Cancer Society had to be moved after severe weather on Friday damaged hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment for the Cattle Baron's Ball.

The event was supposed to be held at Six Bends Harley-Davidson, just off I-75 in Fort Myers. But after severe weather ripped through Friday, it had to be moved to The Ranch Concert Hall and Saloon on Colonial Boulevard.

The race is on and the clock is ticking as the charity fundraiser hangs in the balance.

"A lot of people in the community depend on what we do," said Julie Harmon of the American Cancer Society.

Last year, the Cattle Baron's Ball raised $250,000 -- money spent on cancer research and treatments for local patients, which would not be possible without this highlighted event.

"Lee County patients that need to get treatment up in Tampa at Moffitt Cancer Center, they have free-of-charge stay at the Hope Lodge with their caregiver," said Stacey Mueller of the American Cancer Society.

When severe weather hit Friday damaging the tents and forcing the organization to switch locations, friends and families came to the rescue.

"Ohh! It feels awesome! I am glad to be here. I would not know how to spend my Saturday otherwise," said volunteer Kristen Niebel-Garza.

They pitched in to set up the decorations - a three and a half day process crammed into just a few hours.

"We really feel very fortunate because The Ranch is the perfect country-western venue," said Harmon.

One of the owners of The Ranch offered to let them use it -- trading in line dancing for fundraising just for the night.

"Anything we can do to help somebody out that needs something then that's what it's about," said Rusty Roepke, an owner of The Ranch.

A total of 400 people wearing their best western attire will have a new place to support a great cause.
