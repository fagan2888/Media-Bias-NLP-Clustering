(Brennan Linsley/Associated Press)\n\nThe Oct. 16 front-page article \u201cSlow growth forecast for Obamacare rolls\u201d pointed out the growth in enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is projected to be minimal for 2016 and half of what was originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons is that it is not so affordable. My son is enrolled in a silver plan, and he just received notice that the overall premium for 2016 will increase by more than 20 percent and the portion he pays will increase by more than 40 percent, assuming his income for 2016 does not increase. Also, many of the co-pays double or quadruple. The current annual inflation rate is zero percent, and the health-care inflation rate is 2.45 percent. If the cost of ACA coverage is increasing at eight times the health-care inflation rate, no wonder enrollment is not growing.\n\nWilliam Johnson, Arlington", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "william johnson, affordable care act, obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Oct. 16 front-page article \u201cSlow growth forecast for Obamacare rolls\u201d pointed out the growth in enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is projected to be minimal for 2016 and half of what was ori...", "title": "Obamacare is not so affordable", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamacare-is-not-so-affordable/2015/10/19/f2a7dff2-7531-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/19/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Health_Insurer_Insolvency-07b85.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamacare-is-not-so-affordable/2015/10/19/f2a7dff2-7531-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "william johnson, affordable care act, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f2a7dff2-7531-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The Oct. 16 front-page article \u201cSlow growth forecast for Obamacare rolls\u201d pointed out the growth in enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is projected to be minimal for 2016 and half of what was ori..."}, "article_summary": "The current annual inflation rate is zero percent, and the health-care inflation rate is 2.45 percent.\n(Brennan Linsley/Associated Press)The Oct. 16 front-page article \u201cSlow growth forecast for Obamacare rolls\u201d pointed out the growth in enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is projected to be minimal for 2016 and half of what was originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\nIf the cost of ACA coverage is increasing at eight times the health-care inflation rate, no wonder enrollment is not growing.\nLauren Farnsworth, left, and April Buell hand out literature and juice while encouraging the public to get health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, during a promotional campaign in Denver last year.\nPerhaps one of the reasons is that it is not so affordable."}
