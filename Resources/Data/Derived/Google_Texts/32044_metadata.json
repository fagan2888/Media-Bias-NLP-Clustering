This surgery followed her preventive double mastectomy in 2013.\n\nAfter losing her mother, grandmother, and aunt to cancer, Jolie underwent genetic testing and learned that she had a mutation in one of her BRCA genes, a tumor-suppressor gene. That means she too has an increased risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cI feel feminine, and grounded in the choices I am making for myself and my family,\u201d Jolie wrote. \u201cI know my children will never have to say, \u2018Mom died of ovarian cancer.'\u201d\n\nThe good news: If you share Jolie\u2019s predisposition to cancer, the same treatment options are probably available to you. Most insurers will cover preventive surgery for women with a BRCA mutation, says Lisa Schlager, vice president for community affairs and public policy at Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE), a nonprofit organization devoted to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. (Generally, Medicare and Medicaid aren\u2019t as generous, Schlager says.)\n\nThat\u2019s been true for a long time\u2014a 2001 study found that 97% of preventive surgeries for women with BRCA mutations were fully covered by insurance (except for deductibles and copays).\n\nThe surgery can be costly. According to HealthSparq, a health care costs transparency firm, the average national cost for the surgical removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes is $12,381.\n\nThat\u2019s the average insurer-negotiated price, based on actual claims data from 67 health plans. In other words, that\u2019s the average price insurers have agreed to pay hospitals and health providers for the procedure. You can expect to pay a smaller portion of that cost, depending on your health plan\u2019s deductible, co-pays and co-insurance.\n\nToday, the average deductible for Americans with single, employer-subsidized health coverage is $1,217, which means most need to pay more than a grand out-of-pocket before insurance begins to cover the bulk of their costs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt really depends on your insurance and your deductible,\u201d Schlager says. \u201cSome people have a very high deductible, and we\u2019re referring them to services that provide financial assistance.\u201d\n\nPrices can also vary significantly by region. According to HealthSparq, the average cost of the procedure is $8,693 in Maryland, but $20,763 in San Francisco, a $12,070 price gap.\n\nMarket Average Cost San Francisco \u2013 San Jose CA $20,763.06 San Diego CA $16,508.06 Miami \u2013 Fort Lauderdale FL $16,441.37 LA \u2013 Orange County CA $16,378.38 Houston TX $14,687.49 Austin \u2013 San Antonio TX $13,617.29 New York City \u2013 White Plains NY $13,591.84 Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth TX $13,404.92 New Orleans LA $12,049.43 Cinncinati \u2013 Dayton OH $11,987.74 Columbus OH $11,335.80 Albany NY $9,559.04 Washington DC \u2013 Arlington VA $8,747.73 Maryland $8,692.77 AVERAGE NATIONAL $12,380.55 PRICE GAP $12,070.29\n\nBut generally, insurers will cover the surgery. After all, \u201cthe surgeries are less expensive to the private insurers than if you were to get cancer,\u201d Schlager says.\n\nHow do you know if you\u2019re at risk? According to guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, you should get screened for genetic abnormalities if any of your family members develop ovarian or fallopian tube cancer, breast cancer in both breasts, breast and ovarian cancer, breast cancer before age 50, male breast cancer, or other signs of hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. You should also get tested if more than one blood relative on the same side of your family has breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, prostate, pancreatic, or melanoma cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which helps implement the Affordable Care Act, made similar recommendations.\n\nSchlager says the cost of genetic testing has \u201cdropped substantially\u201d in recent years, to between $1,500 and $4,000. Most insurers will cover genetic testing if you meet the national guidelines, but if your insurer refuses, some labs have financial assistance programs to limit your out-of-pocket cost to about $100, Schlager says.\n\nThen you should meet with a genetic counselor. The Affordable Care Act mandates that health insurers cover genetic counseling with no cost-sharing if you have an increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer. That is to say, genetic counseling is a women\u2019s preventive service that should be free to you, like birth control.\n\nJolie was quick to note that her choice isn\u2019t the answer for everyone. \u201cA positive BRCA test does not mean a leap to surgery,\u201d Jolie wrote. \u201cI have spoken to many doctors, surgeons and naturopaths. There are other options.\u201d\n\nA genetic counselor should help you understand the implications of preventive surgery and consider other less invasive\u2014but less effective\u2014measures, like increased cancer screenings. \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal decision, and every family is different,\u201d Schlager says. \u201cYour first step is to talk to your doctor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Faced with a genetic predisposition to cancer, Angelina Jolie opted for a preventive surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes.
