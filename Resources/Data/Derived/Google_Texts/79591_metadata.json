Ricardo Lara (D-Huntington Park/Long Beach) and under consideration in the state Legislature. The proposed legislation would make all low-income Californians who are excluded from federal health reform, including undocumented immigrants, eligible for Medi-Cal. More than 1.4 million undocumented Californians \u2013 ineligible for Affordable Care Act coverage programs due to their immigration status \u2013 are uninsured.\n\n\u201cCalifornia would be the first in the nation to make its health-insurance program inclusive of all low-income residents and their families, including those who are undocumented,\u201d said Laurel Lucia, policy analyst at the UC Berkeley Labor Center.\n\nThe proposed policy would complement the state\u2019s recent role in expanding immigrants\u2019 rights in the absence of federal immigration reform; this includes moves to provide driver\u2019s licenses to all residents and to extend financial aid to undocumented college students who arrived in the United States as children, said Lucia.\n\nThe proposed change would move California from a system of disjointed emergency care to more rational and comprehensive care at a relatively low cost per person, according to the study authors. According to the study, some 60 percent of health care costs for California\u2019s low-income, undocumented adults are already paid under long-standing federal policy. Matching dollars are provided by the federal government to the state for emergency and pregnancy-related services available to all low-income Californians, regardless of immigration status. But undocumented immigrants, who make up 9 percent of California\u2019s workforce, often lack access to health-promoting, cost-effective preventive and routine services.\n\n\u201cThe undocumented don\u2019t get sufficient access to preventive care and often wait as long as possible before seeking care,\u201d said Nadereh Pourat, director of research at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. \u201cProviding preventive care helps the undocumented stay healthy and allows them to continue to contribute to California\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nThe new spending would be substantially offset by an increase in state sales-tax revenue from managed-care insurance plans, in addition to savings from reduced county spending on care to the uninsured, according to the report.\n\nThese offsets are included in the estimate that net state spending would increase by between $353 and $369 million in 2015 in order to cover between 690,000 and 730,000 Californians. By 2019, the proposed policy is predicted to increase net state spending by between $424 and $436 million, in order to cover 750,000 to 790,000 Californians.\n\nThe report\u2019s enrollment and cost projections were primarily made using the California Simulation of Insurance Markets (CalSIM) model, a microsimulation developed by researchers at the two UC centers. CalSIM uses a range of official data sources, including the California Health Interview Survey, to estimate the coverage impact of policy changes in California. The analysis also uses and makes comparisons with enrollment and cost data from the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\nRead the report, \u201cA Little Investment Goes a Long Way: Modest Cost to Expand Preventive and Routine Health Services to All Low-Income Californians,\u201d online.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Berkeley News", "description": "Legislation to expand health care coverage for undocumented residents would end disjointed health care at a relatively low cost, says a joint study by two University of California research centers.", "title": "Could a modest investment expand Medi-Cal to state\u2019s undocumented residents?", "url": "http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/05/21/bill-to-extend-medi-cal-to-undocumented-would-end-disjointed-care-study-says/", "image": {"width": 410, "identifier": "http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HealthCareForAll-410.jpg", "height": 275}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T20:57:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6eee\"", "article_summary": "Read the report, \u201cA Little Investment Goes a Long Way: Modest Cost to Expand Preventive and Routine Health Services to All Low-Income Californians,\u201d online.\nThe proposed legislation would make all low-income Californians who are excluded from federal health reform, including undocumented immigrants, eligible for Medi-Cal.\nMore than 1.4 million undocumented Californians \u2013 ineligible for Affordable Care Act coverage programs due to their immigration status \u2013 are uninsured.\nAccording to the study, some 60 percent of health care costs for California\u2019s low-income, undocumented adults are already paid under long-standing federal policy.\nThe analysis also uses and makes comparisons with enrollment and cost data from the state Department of Health Care Services."}
