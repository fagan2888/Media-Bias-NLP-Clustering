Jerad and Amanda Miller, the couple who shot and killed three people as well as themselves in Las Vegas on Sunday, not only spent time at renegade rancher Cliven Bundy’s ranch but were in fact asked to leave because they were “too radical,” reports ABC.

That information comes from Ammon Bundy, Cliven Bundy’s son. “Not very many people were asked to leave,” Bundy said. “I think they may have been the only ones.”

He also claimed the Millers did not “align themselves” with the true purpose of the Bundy protest movement.

During the brief period when the Bundy ranch became the de facto center of the media universe, Jerad Miller was interviewed by an NBC affiliate and made a thinly veiled threat of violence against any law enforcement official who crossed the Bundyites.

“I feel sorry for any federal agents that want to come in here and try to push us around,” Miller said to KRNV-TV.
