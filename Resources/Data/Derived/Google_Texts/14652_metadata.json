We\u2019re raising a generation of mass killers.\u201d\n\nLt. Col. Dave Grossman repeated those lines to a crowd of hundreds at the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting in Nashville on Saturday, telling the gun owners to fear for themselves and their families and that the only solution is to arm all of our citizens.\n\n\u201cCan we take the lessons learned in Columbine and Jonesboro and Virginia Tech? Can we take the lessons learned on 9/11 and in Sandy Hook Elementary School? Or do we have to wait until our kids die?\u201d Grossman asked the audience during a seminar called \u201cSheepdogs! The Bulletproof Mind for the Armed Citizen.\u201d\n\nAfter detailing each mass shooting to occur at a school over the past few decades, tallying up the deaths with red marker in front of the audience, Grossman told the NRA members that \u201cyou\u2019re going to see daycare massacres and school bus massacres.\u201d\n\nThe two-hour long seminar focused on how having armed police officers in schools is just the first step to protecting the country from the inevitable mass violence. Grossman did not touch on the mental health issues that underlie school shootings. The \u201cworst and the most\u201d mass murders have occurred in Europe where there are stricter gun control laws, Grossman told the audience.\n\n\u201cAny politician who tells you we can solve this problem with gun laws is an idiot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe politicians drag a red herring across the path \u2014 it\u2019s all about the evil guns and if we make the evil guns go away, the bad men will go away.\u201d\n\nInstead, Grossman said we have to put tens of thousands of armed cops, or \u201cgood guys with guns\u201d in our schools and encourage all citizens to arm themselves to prepare for imminent disaster.\n\n\u201cFolks, we have raised a vicious, vicious generation of children,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have given us crimes on children like nothing in human history. Sandy Hook is just the beginning. Our founding fathers knew there would be days like this\u2026 And they created the Second Amendment for just a time like this. And in the midst of all that, the politicians want to disarm our citizens. That is flat out treason.\u201d\n\nGrossman is a retired Army sergeant and paratrooper who taught psychology at West Point. He says he has founded a new academic field which he calls \u201ckillology,\u201d the study of killing in war and the \u201cviolent crime that is raging the world,\u201d according to his biography.\n\nWhile Grossman may claim the Second Amendment can help protect people from violent criminals, research shows that being armed does little to prevent shootings. A 2012 Mother Jones analysis of 61 mass murders over the last 30 years found that \u201cin not a single case was the killing stopped by a civilian using a gun.\u201d As one leading expert explained, \u201cgiven that civilian shooters are less likely to hit their targets than police in these circumstances,\u201d arming civilians could often lead to more chaos and deaths.\n\nTen thousand kids are injured or killed by guns each year, according to a recent study. And despite Grossman\u2019s claims, the United State\u2019s rate of mortality from firearms is about ten times higher than the rates in other wealthy nations.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) estimates that firearms are one of the top three causes of death among children, killing twice as many kids as cancer does. In the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, many national gun control groups and others including the AAP stepped up their efforts to lobby for gun violence prevention, including expanded background checks and safe storage to ensure that guns aren\u2019t falling into the wrong hands.\n\nBut members of the NRA used the Sandy Hook massacre to push for arming more civilians. \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\u201d NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre famously said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cWhy is the idea of a gun good when it\u2019s used to protect the president of our country or our police, but bad when it\u2019s used to protect our children in our schools?,\u201d LaPierre said after Sandy Hook. \u201cThey\u2019re our kids. They\u2019re our responsibility. And it\u2019s not just our duty to protect them, it\u2019s our right to protect them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cAny politician who tells you we can solve this problem with gun laws is an idiot,\u201d Dave Grossman told the NRA audience.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cAny politician who tells you we can solve this problem with gun laws is an idiot,\u201d Dave Grossman told the NRA audience.", "title": "\u2018Professor Of Killology\u2019 To NRA Convention: \u2018Sandy Hook Is Just The Beginning\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/04/11/3646013/nra-meeting-fear-mongering/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP700221229284.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cAny politician who tells you we can solve this problem with gun laws is an idiot,\u201d Dave Grossman told the NRA audience.", "creator": "@Kira_Lerner", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP700221229284-321x214.jpg", "title": "\u2018Professor Of Killology\u2019 To NRA Convention: \u2018Sandy Hook Is Just The Beginning\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP700221229284.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AP700221229284.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T20:21:50+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd895c\"", "article_summary": "Justice \u2018Professor Of Killology\u2019 To NRA Convention: \u2018Sandy Hook Is Just The Beginning\u2019 CREDIT:NASHVILLE, TN \u2014 \u201cSandy Hook is just the beginning.\nBut members of the NRA used the Sandy Hook massacre to push for arming more civilians.\nCan we take the lessons learned on 9/11 and in Sandy Hook Elementary School?\nSandy Hook is just the beginning.\n\u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\u201d NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre famously said at a press conference."}
