The Boulder County District Attorney's Office is encouraging residents to be extra vilgilant, as a wave of scam calls, purporting to be from the Internal Revenue Service, has been reported recently.

"These calls are fraudulent attempts to obtain money and personal information," the District Attorney's office warned in a press release. "The scammers threaten arrest, revocation of driver's license, or deportation. They have co-conspirators who pose as police or lawyers."

As a policy, the IRS never makes initial contact with consumers by phone, nor does it ask for payment by phone.

Victims of the scam are being asked to file a complain at FTC.gov, or to call the District Attorney's office at 303-441-3700.
