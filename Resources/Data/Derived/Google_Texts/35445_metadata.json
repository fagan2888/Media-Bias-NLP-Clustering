Turns out, the legendary coach was just enormously emotional about the way his 14th team \u2014 and fourth at DU \u2014 advanced to the national semifinals.\n\n\u201cAmazing, amazing game,\u201d Tierney said at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, host of the first western-based NCAA quarterfinals. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of everybody affiliated with this team.\u201d\n\nTierney\u2019s Pioneers erased the deficit of a decade against Ohio State, refusing to lose in the biggest NCAA lacrosse event in Colorado history.\n\nBehind gritty performances from senior goalie Ryan LaPlante and senior attack Wesley Berg, DU defeated the Buckeyes 15-13 after the Buckeyes jumped out to a 7-1 lead.\n\nA crowd of 13,076 witnessed a remarkable comeback in the finale of an NCAA quarterfinal doubleheader that sends DU to its fourth Final Four in the last five years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get emotional because you don\u2019t want to let anyone down,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cAnd then you get down 7-1 and watch a group of young men refuse to lose.\u201d\n\nDenver (15-2) will take an NCAA-leading 11-game winning streak into the national semifinals in Philadelphia, facing top-seeded Notre Dame (12-2) on Friday at Lincoln Financial Field. The two other Final Four berths will be determined Sunday in Annapolis, Md.\n\n\u201cWe know what we\u2019re up against,\u201d said Tierney, who\u2019s team beat Notre Dame 11-10 in overtime on Feb. 27 in Denver.\n\nBeating Ohio State (12-7) wouldn\u2019t have been possible without LaPlante (13 saves) and Berg (six goals), who were tremendous in the second and third quarters when DU went on a 9-0 run during Ohio State\u2019s scoreless drought of 25 minutes, 55 seconds.\n\nLaPlante couldn\u2019t stop a beach ball in the first quarter, allowing six goals on eight shots, but was 7-of-7 from the 12:25 mark of the second quarter to 1:30 of the third. During that time, Berg scored four goals and Connor Cannizzaro, Zach Miller, Max Planning and Erik Adamson each had one as DU built a 10-7 lead.\n\nFreshman faceoff specialist Trevor Baptiste was a modest 50 percent (15-of-30) after entering with an NCAA-high 70.5 percent.\n\n\u201cYou could see the life go back into us after we got to 7-4, and kept chipping away from there,\u201d Berg said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in that spot, ever, down 7-1 to begin the game. But we knew it could be done and we knew we had the team to do it.\u201d\n\nLate in the third quarter, Ohio State stopped the skid, and then some, scoring with 1:30 and 36.6 seconds left in the quarter to make it a 10-9 game going into the fourth quarter.\n\nBut DU senior Sean Cannizzaro scored consecutive goals to make it 12-9 early in the fourth quarter and brother Connor, a sophomore, struck after Ohio State briefly got within one.\n\nOhio State (12-7) is the last team to beat DU, and the Buckeyes looked like they would end the Pioneers\u2019 season early by scoring seven of the first eight goals. Jesse King had three goals and three assists in OSU\u2019s early attack.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to possessing the ball and that\u2019s what we did a really good job of in the first quarter,\u201d King said. \u201cWe were scoring on probably 50 percent of our possessions. Then you get unlucky and you don\u2019t get a couple of ground balls that you want and Denver starts getting them, and that\u2019s when things turned.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nNcaa r\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\nThe Denver Pioneers are 8-4 in the NCAA Tournament since 2011\u2033\n\n2011\n\nBeat Vilanova 13-10\n\nBeat Johns Hopkins 14-9\n\nLost to Virginia 14-8 (semifinals)\n\n2012\n\nBeat North Carolina 16-14\n\nLost to Loyola 10-9\n\n2013\n\nBeat Albany 19-14\n\nBeat North Carolina 12-11\n\nLost to Syracuse 9-8 (semifinals)\n\n2014\n\nBeat North Carolina 9-5\n\nBeat Drexel 15-6\n\nLost to Duke 15-12 (semifinals)\n\n2015\n\nBeat Brown 15-9", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver advances to men\u2019s lacrosse Final Four with win over Ohio State", "title": "Denver advances to men\u2019s lacrosse Final Four with win over Ohio State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/16/denver-advances-to-mens-lacrosse-final-four-with-win-over-ohio-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516__du-laxp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516__du-laxp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-16T19:32:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T02:56:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8d2\"", "article_summary": "Behind gritty performances from senior goalie Ryan LaPlante and senior attack Wesley Berg, DU defeated the Buckeyes 15-13 after the Buckeyes jumped out to a 7-1 lead.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of everybody affiliated with this team.\u201dTierney\u2019s Pioneers erased the deficit of a decade against Ohio State, refusing to lose in the biggest NCAA lacrosse event in Colorado history.\nTeary-eyed University of Denver lacrosse coach Bill Tierney opened his postgame comments Saturday looking like he had never advanced to the NCAA Final Four.\n\u201cWe know what we\u2019re up against,\u201d said Tierney, who\u2019s team beat Notre Dame 11-10 in overtime on Feb. 27 in Denver.\nBut DU senior Sean Cannizzaro scored consecutive goals to make it 12-9 early in the fourth quarter and brother Connor, a sophomore, struck after Ohio State briefly got within one."}
