Storyline, he said, will distinguish itself through narrative journalism.\n\n\"We are going to tell stories with people, with characters, with human drama, in a way that other policy sites don\u2019t do very often,\" Tankersley said. \"And we\u2019re going to do it every day.\"\n\nWhile the Post's newsroom covers beats such as health care, Storyline's small team will instead tackle a specific question like,\"How is the Affordable Care Act changing us?\u201d The storyline begins with a piece about a woman's Medicaid travails, followed by charts, statistics and related stories. Other storylines will revolve around rural America and the \u201cuneven\u201d economic recovery. The team's work will appear first on washingtonpost.com, and may also appear in the newspaper.\n\nThe Post released a teaser video Friday that described Storyline's mission as \"all about people and policy.\" In just over a minute, the video emphasized telling \"stories\" seven times.\n\nJournalism is rooted in storytelling, with reporters often seeking out an individual's experience to put a human face on a broader issue. So in a way, Storyline follows in a well-worn journalistic tradition.\n\nBut Tankersley emphasized that Storyline will depart from traditional newspaper narrative writing through extensive use of data and by publishing a cluster of stories around topics it will continue to follow for days or weeks at a time.\n\nManaging editor Ryan McCarthy, a former HuffPost editor, wrote in an \u201cOwner\u2019s Manual\u201d for the vertical how \u201ceach day's storyline is like a small meal -- an entree and a whole mess of side dishes.\u201d Those dishes, he said, will include \"visual data journalism, videos, reader response pieces, columns, short-form narratives, as-told-to interviews, oddball versions of oral histories and stuff that\u2019s just plain fun.\"\n\nThe Post announced plans for a new initiative focused on the \u201creal-world impact of public policy\u201d on Jan. 24, which happened to be Ezra Klein\u2019s last day at the paper. Klein, who started the Post\u2019s Wonkblog, left to co-found Vox.com, which joins a burgeoning data-journalism and policy space alongside ESPN\u2019s FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times\u2019 The Upshot, and The New Republic\u2019s Q.E.D.\n\nTankersley, who joined The Post in December 2012, recalled speaking with colleague Eli Saslow last fall about the need for \u201ca great hub\" around the paper's storytelling and policy work. Since billionaire Amazon chief Jeff Bezos purchased The Post last year, managers have sought news ideas from the newsroom, and there are more resources to support them. Tankersley drafted a proposal in December and management signed off the following month.\n\nIt's unlikely The Post would\u2019ve launched a project like Storyline a few years ago. Ravaged by print advertising loses, The Post shrank its newsroom and retrenched nationwide by closing bureaus in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Publisher Katharine Weymouth described the paper's focus a few years ago as \u201cfor and about Washington.\u201d\n\nThe newsroom has grown significantly this year and management's ambitions now stretch far beyond the Beltway. Weymouth recently told staffers the Post was \u201cpivoting\u201d in an attempt to increase its national and international audience, according to the Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nTankersley said reporters will regularly get out of Washington, noting that several urban and rural areas are located within a few hours of the nation's capital. And signaling the Post's national ambitions, Tankersley said that Storyline writers have already trekked to Colorado, Illinois and Missouri.\n\n\"We see our audience as national and we see our audience as Washington,\" Tankersley said. \"We want people in Washington to understand the country better and we want people around the country to better understand Washington.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK -- The Washington Post escalated the wonk wars Tuesday with the latest addition to the", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-07-23 06:00:27 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "NEW YORK -- The Washington Post escalated the wonk wars Tuesday with the latest addition to the", "title": "Washington Post Heightens Wonk Wars With Storyline", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/22/washington-post-storyline_n_5607342.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1922302/images/o-WASHINGTON-POST-STORYLINE-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK -- The Washington Post escalated the wonk wars Tuesday with the latest addition to the", "creator": "mlcalderone", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1922302/images/o-WASHINGTON-POST-STORYLINE-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Washington Post Heightens Wonk Wars With Storyline", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-22 06:00:27 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5607342", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "the backstory,Ezra Klein,vox,washington post storyline,storyline,Washington Post,wapo storyline,washington post policy,wonk wars", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "the backstory,Ezra Klein,vox,washington post storyline,storyline,Washington Post,wapo storyline,washington post policy,wonk wars", "published_time": "2014-07-22 06:00:27 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-07-22 11:59:04 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe56\"", "article_summary": "SAUL LOEB via Getty ImagesNEW YORK -- The Washington Post escalated the wonk wars Tuesday with the latest addition to the growing field of policy journalism.\nThe Post's new online vertical, Storyline, will cover policy topics through articles, videos and charts -- or \"chapters\" -- that follow a particular storyline.\n\"We see our audience as national and we see our audience as Washington,\" Tankersley said.\n\"We want people in Washington to understand the country better and we want people around the country to better understand Washington.\"\nAnd signaling the Post's national ambitions, Tankersley said that Storyline writers have already trekked to Colorado, Illinois and Missouri."}
