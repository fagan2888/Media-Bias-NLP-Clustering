A local organization is spreading the word about a new program to help people with mental health needs.It's a Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center program called Health Connections that was created after the Affordable Care Act passed.It started in August and serves more than 850 people of all ages in the Lawrence and Douglas County area. Officials said there are still many more people the program can help, but many people just don't know about it.On Thursday, the Health Connections mission was shared at the Health Connections Health Fair."We work to prevent care gaps for our members. Our overall goal is to decrease unnecessary emergency department visits and we're seeing a lot of success," said Amy Warren, Health Connections Coordinator at Bert Nash.Warren said it's all achieved through a coordinated effort by local agencies to help people in the community with mental health needs to receive proper treatment.She said statistically, people with mental health needs live 25 years less than the average person, but with the Health Connections program, that number is greatly decreased.However, Warren said that people who qualify for the program may not know this type of help is available.
