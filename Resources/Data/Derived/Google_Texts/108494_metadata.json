You know all about the latest technology that can help you stay\u2014or get\u2014in shape, and you\u2019re pretty sure you know all the names of the biggest startups (and giant companies like Nike) trying to sell you new apps or gadgets.\n\nWell, think again. There\u2019s a Denver-based company named Welltok that quietly has raised more than $75 million with the goal of changing how all those apps and devices connect to each other. But Welltok\u2019s larger ambition is to connect consumers, healthcare providers, health insurance companies, and employers to one another to improve health outcomes\u2014and save everyone huge amounts of money along the way.\n\nThat vision, along with a management team that has built and led billion-dollar healthcare and IT companies, has big-time VC firms like Bessemer Venture Partners and New Enterprise Associates betting on Welltok. They think it is a company poised to capitalize on the revolution taking place in healthcare as new technology empowers consumers and new regulations resulting from Obamacare change the rules for insurers and providers.\n\nWelltok announced today it has raised an additional $25 million in a growth equity round led by Bessemer. The new funds bring the total amount the five-year-old company has raised to more than $75 million. That number is expected to grow soon, as Welltok plans to raise an additional $12 million before the round closes later this year.\n\nWelltok is one of many health and wellness companies trying to shape and profit from \u201cthe industry\u2019s seismic shift to get consumers more involved in optimizing their health,\u201d chairman and CEO Jeff Margolis said. The company starts by focusing on generally healthy people, as opposed to individuals experiencing an acute illness or medical crisis, although Welltok\u2019s software can be used to help manage chronic conditions.\n\nWelltok is developing a product called CafeWell, which it describes as a health optimization platform-as-a-service. Unlike most so-called software platforms, it probably deserves the name. CafeWell is based in the cloud and collects and organizes data from popular health apps like MapMyFitness and wearable activity trackers like FitBit. It has been designed so it will be able to connect with additional apps, devices, and systems as they are developed, Margolis said.\n\nCafeWell takes all that data to help users create a \u201cpersonal health itinerary\u201d with specific goals and recommendations that can maintain or improve their health. But it does more than just make recommendations: the current version has additional features like social networks, games and challenges, educational content, and access to coaches to help users stay on track. The program also can give users rewards like gift cards for actually going through with their plans and hitting their targets.\n\nListing CafeWell\u2019s features makes Welltok sound like any number of startups developing yet more consumer-facing wellness apps. But it\u2019s different, Margolis said, and when he explains Welltok\u2019s business model, you realize he\u2019s right.\n\nThat\u2019s because CafeWell\u2019s end users are not really Welltok\u2019s customers. The company\u2019s business model is to sell software to health insurance plans, providers, and what are known in the healthcare industry as population managers, Margolis said. They will pay for Welltok and make CafeWell and related products available for their clients.\n\nCollectively, Welltok\u2019s potential customers are responsible for administrating health plans, setting rates, and now monitoring the quality of care clients receive. They have a big financial stake in keeping costs low by keeping people healthy, especially now that Obamacare has changed the system so that providers are reimbursed based on results and lose money for negative outcomes like hospital readmittances.\n\nHealth providers, insurers, and managers are also the ones in charge of paying the bills for the $2.7 trillion U.S. healthcare industry. So instead of paying a couple hundred bucks a year like consumers could, they have many thousands or even millions to spend.\n\nStephen Kraus, the Bessemer partner who will join Welltok\u2019s board, said that getting just a sliver of that market could yield \u2026 Next Page \u00bb\n\nTrending on Xconomy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Xconomy", "description": "You\u2019ve got a fitness tracker on your wrist and a phone loaded with health apps in your pocket.
