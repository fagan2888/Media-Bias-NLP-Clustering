Yet it\u2019s something most feel they have to do to remain competitive.\n\nAthletics departments at the NCAA Division I level will leap into uncharted territory Aug. 1 by providing the full cost of attendance to existing scholarships for student-athletes.\n\nA full scholarship covers tuition, room and board, books and fees. Monies tacked on to that for cost of attendance are designed to cover other expenses, such as academic-related supplies, transportation, laundry, cellphones and other day-to-day expenses.\n\nMost schools in the Power 5 conferences \u2014 Atlantic Coast, Big Ten, Big 12, Pacific 12 and Southeastern \u2014 have the resources to cover the addition without doing major restructuring of their athletics budgets.\n\nThe collection of conferences commonly known as the Group of Five \u2013 the Mountain West, American Athletic, Conference USA, Mid-American and Sun Belt \u2013 generally have fewer funds available.\n\nStill, many have had to find ways to pay the cost of attendance to maintain a certain level of competitiveness in recruiting.\n\nLike the University of Wyoming.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do it in certain sports, you\u2019re putting a fork in yourself,\u201d athletics director Tom Burman said. \u201cYou have no chance of winning a recruiting battle if someone else is offering full cost of attendance.\n\n\u201cWe had to do it, and everyone else is figuring it out.\u201d\n\nSchools can\u2019t just pick a dollar figure for cost of attendance.\n\nPhil Wille is UW\u2019s associate athletics director for internal operations. He said schools must go through their respective financial aid offices to help calculate the number and also take into consideration certain federal government guidelines.\n\nWille also said the cost-of-attendance figure applies to the entire student body. For instance, if students are on presidential scholarships at UW that include cost of attendance, that figure applies to them as well.\n\nOther criteria include the actual cost of a scholarship \u2013 full or partial \u2013 at each school, along with things such as cost of living in that community.\n\nAfter all the numbers were crunched, UW came up with $3,240.\n\nThat means that every student-athlete \u2014 male or female \u2014 who is on full scholarship will get an extra $3,240 per year for cost of attendance.\n\nIf a student-athlete is on half scholarship, that number is cut in half.\n\nMatt Whisenant, UW\u2019s deputy athletics director, said it will cost the school between $750,000 and $800,000 annually to fund the cost of attendance stipends.\n\nHe also said the money will be distributed in four increments \u2013 at the beginning and end of the fall semester and the beginning and end of the spring semester.\n\n\u201cThis is a game-changer,\u201d Whisenant told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. \u201cWe\u2019re on board full-speed and moving forward with it. We\u2019ve been in discussions about this for over a year.\u201d\n\nUW\u2019s athletics fundraising arm \u2014 the Cowboy Joe Club \u2014 and the state will fund cost-of-attendance costs for 2015-16.\n\nLegislation recently was passed requiring the state to match dollar for dollar what the Cowboy Joe Club raises.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an enormous step for us,\u201d Burman said. \u201cThe challenge will be if we can figure out a way to work with the leadership to keep that ongoing.\n\n\u201cIf we can, we\u2019ll be able to fund this for the foreseeable future and be able to continue to compete. Not just compete, but get better.\u201d\n\nBut what if that funding stream dries up?\n\n\u201cWe would be in a world of hurt,\u201d Burman said. \u201cWe would have to, probably, make some decisions about reducing other areas of our program. I don\u2019t think you can choose not to fund it.\u201d\n\nOther Mountain West schools have similar and different funding plans for cost-of-attendance.\n\nUtah State athletics director Scott Barnes said via email that his department got $1.5 million from the Utah legislature to support cost of attendance and extra meals for student-athletes.\n\nMax Corbet, Boise State\u2019s associate athletics director for communications, said the funding will come from the athletics department, including fundraising, ticket sales, etc.\n\nOf the schools that responded to questions on how they are handling cost of attendance, UW\u2019s $3,240 is among the lowest in the MW.\n\nCorbet said Boise State won\u2019t know its final figure until the middle of summer, but he added it will be around $5,100 per student-athlete.\n\nThat figure is by far the most in the MW so far.\n\nAnd according to data from the Chronicle of Higher Education, Boise State is one of six Football Bowl Subdivision schools in the country to offer more than $5,000 per student-athlete on full scholarship.\n\nMost MW schools are funding cost of attendance in some form.\n\nSome, like Colorado State, Hawaii and Nevada, said they could not provide dollar amounts. Others who did respond are offering $3,000-$3,800.\n\nBut Air Force is not because it is a service academy. Troy Garnhart, sports information director there, said: \u201cAll 4,000 cadets (at the academy) are the same, and we are technically a non-scholarship school under the NCAA guidelines.\u201d\n\nBut therein lies a major concern for coaches and athletics departments.\n\nLet\u2019s say your school and Boise State are recruiting the same athletes.\n\nThey find out they can get $5,100 from Boise State and $3,200 from your school. It\u2019s only logical to assume that if the student-athletes view two schools as even in recruiting, they\u2019ll pick the one that offers the most cost-of-attendance money.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use it in our recruiting,\u201d UW track and field/cross-country coach Bryan Berryhill said. \u201cIt comes into play a little more when you\u2019re recruiting an athlete who is looking at other schools that might not be able to move forward with cost of attendance.\n\n\u201cAny time you can add more dollars to the scholarship offer, it\u2019s a big factor on where they decide to go.\u201d\n\nUW and most schools are in the process of educating their student-athletes on what will happen with cost of attendance. But right now UW\u2019s athletes don\u2019t know a lot about what\u2019s coming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really sure about all that money stuff, but it sounds good,\u201d redshirt freshman safety Chavez Pownell Jr. said.\n\nAdded junior wide receiver Tanner Gentry: \u201cI\u2019ve heard about it. But at the same time I\u2019m not too worried about it. (UW) pays for my school, but it can\u2019t hurt, for sure.\u201d\n\nSenior quarterback Cameron Coffman transferred to UW from Indiana last year. He said, with a smile, that he\u2019s not complaining that he and other student-athletes will get more money. But he also said he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.\n\n\u201cI feel like we get enough money now if you budget your money right,\u201d he said.\n\nNot all sports at schools provide full scholarships for student-athletes. Most revenue-generating sports \u2013 such as football, men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball and volleyball \u2013 do.\n\nBut non-revenue sports, such as track and field and cross-country, do not. They get a certain amount for scholarships and may split it as the coaches see fit. Some may be in full scholarship, some may be half, some may be one-quarter.\n\n\u201cMost of our kids are paying for something to go to school,\u201d Berryhill said. \u201cA thousand dollars here, $500 there \u2013 that all goes to help pay for college for these athletes. Maybe they get to work a little bit less during the summer or during the school year.\n\n\u201c(Cost of attendance) gives these kids another resource to get better and spend more time not only training but in the classroom.\n\n\u201cGoing to school full time, working and being a full-time athlete can get tough and stressful. Taking that stress away in whatever way we can will only help every athlete.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "University of Wyoming to provide student-athletes $3,200 for expenses", "title": "University of Wyoming to provide student-athletes $3,200 for expenses", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/10/university-of-wyoming-to-provide-student-athletes-3200-for-expenses/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510_015816_wyoming-football.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510_015816_wyoming-football.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T14:00:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:35:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcf7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you don\u2019t do it in certain sports, you\u2019re putting a fork in yourself,\u201d athletics director Tom Burman said.\nMax Corbet, Boise State\u2019s associate athletics director for communications, said the funding will come from the athletics department, including fundraising, ticket sales, etc.\nPhil Wille is UW\u2019s associate athletics director for internal operations.\nMonies tacked on to that for cost of attendance are designed to cover other expenses, such as academic-related supplies, transportation, laundry, cellphones and other day-to-day expenses.\n\u201cWe had to do it, and everyone else is figuring it out.\u201dSchools can\u2019t just pick a dollar figure for cost of attendance."}
