This was the final act in an unforgettable drama that began on Friday with the murder of the 35th president of the United States, continued on Sunday with the murder of his murderer, and came to a close Monday with the kindling of an eternal flame on a wind-swept Virginia hillside.\n\nAs one writer of the time suggested, the funeral was attended by 180 million Americans \u0097 the entire stunned populace. Only 50,300,000 American households had televisions in 1963, and it was estimated that 41,553,000 sets were tuned into the funeral.\n\nThey had been watching for days. Cameras in the Capitol rotunda followed mourners \u0097 a quarter million in all \u0097 as they filed past the casket. Cameras in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters caught Jack Ruby as he thrust a .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver into the gut of Lee Harvey Oswald and fired.\n\nAnd now they watched as an extraordinary pageant unfolded in front of them. At the White House, mourners and dignitaries joined the procession behind Black Jack: the black-veiled widow, the Kennedy family, President Lyndon Johnson. France's Charles De Gaulle, ramrod tall; Haile Selassie, the Ethiopian Lion of Judah, more than a foot shorter, his uniform festooned with medals and gold braiding; all together, 19 chiefs of state and heads of government, assorted royal personages, all of them on foot.\n\nAt the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, they heard Cardinal Richard Cushing depart from the Latin: \"May the angels, dear Jack, lead you into paradise. May the martyrs receive you at your coming.\"\n\nOutside, as the coffin left the church, Jackie Kennedy leaned down and whispered a few words to John Jr., who turned 3 years old on that day. He lifted his right hand to his brow, a child's farewell salute to his father; it would be the most memorable moment in a day full of them.\n\nAt Arlington, 50 jetfighters in a \"missing man formation\" roared overhead, Air Force One flew by and dipped its wings, a 21-gun salute resounded. The honor guard crisply folded the flag from the coffin. A bugler played taps, but cracked the sixth note; it was an error, but many took it as a reflection of the American broken heart.\n\nThen, with the ignition of the eternal flame, it was over. Not the mourning \u0097 that would go on for months. And not the descent into violence \u0097 over the coming years, others would fall victim to assassins, among them the brother-in-law, Robert, who was at Jackie Kennedy's side.\n\nBut the nation awoke from the fevered nightmare that had begun four days before, in Dallas. The funeral served that purpose.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The horse's name was Black Jack.
