Anyway, I can't stop watching this supercut of Cruz at the Values Voter Summit in all of his bellowing, onstage weirdness, which comes to us from the Vine account of Actual GOP. It's a few days old, but it's also just ... transfixing .. .with shades of the old Howard Dean scream but more rhythm. The words "unleash booming Reagan" are shouted in sequenceâ€”which is just an amazing command that I plan to use at some point in my life. A little additional editing and I feel like this could be transformed into an "It's Gonna Rain" type piece of sound art. Please somebody do that? Anyway, turn up the volume. Immerse yourself. Unleash booming Reagan.
