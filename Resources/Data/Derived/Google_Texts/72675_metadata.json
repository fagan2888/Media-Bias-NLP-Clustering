On Wednesday, the 4th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to block the two provisions and ordered that U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Schroeder immediately issue a preliminary injunction.\n\nState attorneys filed a letter asking that the Supreme Court issue an emergency stay of the injunction that Schroeder issued on Friday. Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed a letter late Friday asking that the court deny any emergency stay. Schroeder has scheduled a hearing Tuesday at 3 p.m. to find out how the state will comply with his order.\n\nSchroeder had denied a request in August for a preliminary injunction that had been sought by the state NAACP, the League of Women Voters and others against the state\u2019s voting law. The law not only eliminated same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting but also reduced the number of days for early voting, eliminated preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds and increased the number of observers that political parties assigned at polling sites. The law also took away the discretion of county election officials to keep polling sites open an additional hour on Election Day in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs, who have also filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the law, appealed Schroeder\u2019s decision to the 4th Circuit, which heard oral arguments in Charlotte on Sept. 25. On the same day that the 4th Circuit issued its decision, state attorneys asked the court to stay its order. The court refused, and state attorneys immediately went to the U.S. Supreme Court. The plaintiffs in the case have until Sunday to file a response.\n\nA trial on the lawsuits is scheduled for July 2015.\n\nThe 4th Circuit ruled that Schroeder abused his discretion in denying a preliminary injunction against same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting, that eliminating both would cause irreparable harm to black voters. The court ruled that other provisions, including reduction in the days for early voting, would remain for November\u2019s election.\n\nThe timeline is tight. Early voting starts Oct. 23 and ends on Nov. 1. Election Day is Nov. 4 and features the closely watched U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan and Thom Tillis, the speaker of the House and one of the main architects behind North Carolina\u2019s election law.\n\nEugene Mazo, a Wake Forest law professor and an expert on election law, said he thinks that the U.S. Supreme Court will reverse the 4th Circuit in a 5-4 decision. One of the big questions in the case is whether Republican legislators were discriminating against Democrats or against black voters, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with discriminating against Democrats,\u201d Mazo said. \u201cThere is something wrong with discriminating against African-Americans. In fact, it\u2019s illegal. \u2026 It so happens most African-Americans are Democrats. What they\u2019re targeting is unclear.\u201d\n\nState elections officials said Friday they plan to comply with Schroeder\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cWe will attempt to accommodate the mandate as best we can, pending any relief from the Supreme Court,\u201d Joshua Lawson, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said in a statement.\n\nLawson echoed the concerns expressed by state attorneys in court filings that county election officials will have to use a manual process to handle same-day voter registration. State attorneys have argued that poll workers haven\u2019t been adequately trained on that process, leading to the potential for errors. And, Lawson said, with out-of-precinct voting \u2014 when a ballot is cast in the right county but wrong precinct \u2014 election officials will have to determine which races a voter would have been eligible for and then hand-count the votes for those races only.\n\n\u201cOur counties are not created equal, and what may be manageable in large counties may be more difficult in others,\u201d he said. \u201cA large number of our counties have only one or two full-time workers.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. William Barber, the president of the state NAACP, dismissed that argument during a conference call with reporters Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWithout this injunction, African-Americans will have to bear the burden of losing their constitutional rights,\u201d Barber said. \u201cThe courts have said that constitutional rights trump any other claim, especially a claim that we don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\nBarber said he\u2019s prepared for whatever happens with the U.S. Supreme Court, referring to what civil-rights activists did during the days of segregation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- The same federal judge who denied a preliminary injunction against North Carolina\u2019s new voting law granted Friday, blocking two provisions of the law that prohibited same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "myfox8.com", "description": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. \u2014 The same federal judge who denied a preliminary injunction against North Carolina\u2019s new voting law granted Friday, blocking two provisions of the law that prohibited sam\u2026", "title": "District Court judge issues preliminary injunction against two provisions of NC\u2019s voter law", "url": "http://myfox8.com/2014/10/04/district-court-judge-issues-preliminary-injunction-against-two-provisions-of-ncs-voter-law/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/judge.jpg", "height": 393}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/judge.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@myfox8", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@myfox8"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Sports and more from WGHP Fox 8 Television", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576468704", "fb": {"pages": 66055982622}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://myfox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d6825caa4f715bb372290d2344aae986?s=16", "application-name": "myfox8.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news", "published_time": "2014-10-04T21:14:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-04T21:14:56+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news"}, "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "Yn8rglGvxxL_bChOFSZTPKslhj-7-DDnVf-rpVixhQs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 District Court judge issues preliminary injunction against two provisions of NC\u2019s voter lawWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. \u2014 The same federal judge who denied a preliminary injunction against North Carolina\u2019s new voting law granted Friday, blocking two provisions of the law that prohibited same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.\nState attorneys filed a letter asking that the Supreme Court issue an emergency stay of the injunction that Schroeder issued on Friday.\nThe court refused, and state attorneys immediately went to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nOn Wednesday, the 4th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to block the two provisions and ordered that U.S. District Judge Thomas D.
