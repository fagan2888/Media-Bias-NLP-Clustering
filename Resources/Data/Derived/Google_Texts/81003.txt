SOCHI, Russia—Russia scored an upset victory in the men's 4x7.5km biathlon relay, winning gold in a thrilling final stretch as the favorite Norway simultaneously collapsed and failed to medal.

Anton Shipulin of Russia, which maintained the third-place position through the first three legs of the race, chased down Simon Schempp of the silver medal-winning German team on the last sprint of the fourth and final leg of the relay, giving Russia a margin of victory of 3.5 seconds. The home team posted an overall time of 1 hour, 12 minutes, 15.9 seconds, The Austrian squad took the bronze.

Defending champion Norway had been primed for the win, amassing a lead of 20 seconds after the second handoff, but disastrous marksmanship by Emil Hegle Svendsen on the final leg earned him a penalty lap, costing the team a medal of any color.

Norway finished nearly a minute behind Russia. The loss of the relay gold leaves legendary Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen with 8 career winter Olympic golds, tied for most all time with compatriot Bjorn Daehlie, a cross-country skier. Bjoerndalen, 40, surpassed Daehlie as the all-time winner of the most winter Olympic medals, with 13, during these Sochi Games. He won golds in both the individual sprint and the mixed relay.

Russia's win sent the packed crowd into a frenzy, with spectators waving flags and chanting along to the national anthem played at the subsequent medal ceremony at the Laura Cross-Country Ski & Biathlon Center. Thanks in part to ample television coverage here, biathlon ranks as the second-favorite winter sport among Russians, according to a recent poll.
