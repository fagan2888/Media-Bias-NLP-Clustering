Gilmore III missed the filing deadlines to get on the primary ballots in Alabama and Arkansas, signaling their struggling campaigns may not make it very deep into next year.\n\nBut all 13 other major-name candidates did make Friday\u2019s Alabama GOP deadline and the Arkansas secretary of state\u2019s Monday deadline, assuring that the large and unwieldy field is here to stay, even as some of them have lost their positions on the main debate stage.\n\n\u201cGiven that Pataki and Gilmore are not really major players for the nomination anyway, I think the story might be more about the fact that there are still so many candidates who, at least now, are filing for these races,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor at Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a project of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThe GOP field is in need of a winnowing, and it really isn\u2019t happening yet.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, meanwhile, all three big-name candidates still in the race qualified for the ballots in Arkansas and Alabama. So did Roque \u201cRocky\u201d De La Fuente, a businessman launching an outsider\u2019s bid for the Democrats\u2019 presidential nomination. Several other candidates qualified for one ballot or the other but not both.\n\nGetting on ballots is complex, and the rules vary widely by state. That makes getting on the ballots a litmus test for candidates seeking to prove they have the manpower and money to compete, and failing to make it is an embarrassment.\n\nIt also means a candidate can\u2019t win delegates in those states, making it that much tougher to win the nomination.\n\nMissing the ballot is the latest bit of bad news for Mr. Pataki, who learned last week that his polling has sunk so low that he didn\u2019t make either the main stage or even the undercard debate Tuesday. His campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Gilmore, meanwhile, has never polled well enough to make the debates, but has insisted he\u2019s in the race to stay. He did file Monday for the primary ballot in New Hampshire \u2014 beating a deadline that is still more than a week away. He and Mr. Pataki have both also qualified for the primary ballot in South Carolina, whose deadline was in September and required a $40,000 filing fee.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Mr. Gilmore\u2019s senior political adviser, Boyd Marcus, said they are focusing on New Hampshire, South Carolina, Virginia and Florida.\n\n\u201cGovernor Gilmore has filed in New Hampshire and South Carolina already and will be filing in a number of others in the next 2 months,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur campaign is concentrating on places where we believe our message and organizational activities have the ability to produce the most votes and delegates. Our campaign will compete all the way to the convention.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Sen. Rick Santorum got in just under the deadline Monday in Arkansas.\n\nOther candidates, though, file as early as they can, and use it as a way to convince donors their campaign is serious.\n\nThat\u2019s the case with Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and political neophyte who\u2019s built a strong organization that has already registered in Alaska, whose filing deadline isn\u2019t until the end of January, and even in Washington, D.C., where Mr. Carson filed for the ballot more than a month ago.\n\n\u201cOur campaign intends to compete in all 50 states,\u201d Mr. Carson said in a statement announcing his signup.\n\nVirginia, whose deadline is Dec. 10, has some of the toughest rules, requiring candidates to submit 5,000 valid signatures overall, including 200 from each of the state\u2019s 11 congressional districts. The National Journal reported that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham; and Ted Cruz, businesswoman Carly Fiorina, Mr. Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich all dispatched volunteers to polling places in Virginia during last week\u2019s election to collect signatures.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump, meanwhile, has already submitted 15,000 signatures in Virginia, or three times the total needed.\n\nThe Republicans are hoping to avoid a repeat of 2012, when only two candidates submitted enough signatures to qualify \u2014 eventual GOP nominee Mitt Romney and then-Rep. Ron Paul, father of Rand Paul, who is running in this year\u2019s race.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton filed her paperwork on Monday \u2014 and managed to anger the state GOP after her security detail forced Secretary of State Bill Gardner to go through a metal detector to enter his own office.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton\u2019s treatment of Secretary Gardner is embarrassing and is the latest example of the arrogant campaign that she is running in New Hampshire,\u201d New Hampshire Republican State Committee Chairman Jennifer Horn said, demanding an apology be issued to Mr. Gardner.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not immediately respond.\n\nThe New Hampshire GOP noted that Mr. Gardner did not undergo a physical search when Mrs. Clinton filed for her husband, former President Clinton, in 1991 and 1995, nor did he get searched when Mrs. Clinton filed for herself in 2007.\n\nMrs. Clinton was the ninth Democrat to file in New Hampshire. Sen. Bernard Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, the other two top candidates, filed last week.\n\nOn the GOP side, Mr. Trump was the first to file last week, with Mr. Rubio, Mrs. Fiorina, Mr. Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also filing.\n\n\u2022 S.A. Miller contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Govs. George Pataki and James S.
