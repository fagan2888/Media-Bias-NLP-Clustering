Part of the reason, is that the four-year schools don\u2019t think some community college classes are as rigorous.\n\nSpeaking with WNPR, Senator Murphy said that if that\u2019s the case, then something\u2019s got to change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much excuse for a state college system not to accept credits from within its own system,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nIf state colleges and universities, such as UConn, think that community college classes aren't as strong as their classes, Murphy said that the state should improve offerings at the community colleges.\n\n\u201cThere is really a tremendous waste of money, of taxpayer money, at the state level and at the federal level, if these credits aren\u2019t transferred,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy is trying to tackle this issue with federal legislation that would incentivize colleges to accept more transfer credits from community colleges, and decrease federal aide to schools that accept low rates of transfer credits.\n\nThe proposed legislation would also offer incentives to colleges that create programs to help students graduate in two or three years. A father of two, Murphy said he's still paying back his own college loans.\n\nCommunity college officials are currently working with four-year schools to develop transfer credit agreements. UConn has not been part of these discussions, but a spokesman said they would be happy to discuss possible collaboration.\n\nState Rep. Roberta Willis and State Sen. Dant\u00e9 Bartolomeo joined Murphy in Hartford to unveil the legislation. Bartolomeo and State Rep. Andrew Fleischmann, chairman of the Education Committee, could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy unveiled federal legislation on Friday that would help streamline the college credit transfer process.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/sen-murphy-wants-four-year-colleges-accept-more-community-college-credits", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201310/murphy_1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy unveiled federal legislation on Friday that would help streamline the college credit transfer process.", "title": "Sen.
