This goes far beyond the tax exiles such as G\u00e9rard Depardieu, members of the Peugeot family or Chanel\u2019s owners. Worse, after decades of living in one of the most redistributive systems in western Europe, 54 per cent of the French believe that taxes \u2013 of which there have been 84 new ones in the past two years, rising from 42 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 46.3 per cent this year \u2013 now widen social inequalities instead of reducing them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only that people don\u2019t like to be treated like criminals just because they\u2019re successful,\u201d Moutet said her French banker friend told her after moving to London. \u201cBut this uncertainty in every aspect of the tax system means it is impossible to do business. You don\u2019t know what your future costs are, or your customer\u2019s.
