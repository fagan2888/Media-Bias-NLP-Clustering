With over 14,000 abortions taking place in our state every year, it is critical that Colorado\u2019s U.S. Senator is pro-life.\u201d\n\nDuring his tenure in Congress, Cory Gardner maintained a 100% pro-life voting record in the House. On 14 votes on abortion and pro-life issues, Cory Gardner has voted pro-life every single time.\n\nOn 80 votes on pro-life issues related to abortion and bioethics issues, as scored by the National Right to Life Committee, Mark Udall has a 0% pro-life voting record.\n\n\u201cSen. Mark Udall has consistently shown the people of Colorado where he stands on abortion. From voting in favor of unlimited abortion funding for businesses like Planned Parenthood, to refusing to support parental consent laws for minors, Udall holds an extreme abortion-on-demand view. His recent pro-abortion television ad, \u201cBackwards\u201d which features a little girl and her mother, shows the citizens of Colorado just how far he will go to promote his radical abortion agenda,\u201d Zagorski said.\n\nZagorski continued: \u201cSen. Udall\u2019s votes have not only hurt common-sense protections on human life, but contradict the beliefs of the majority of Americans. In a 2012 Gallop poll, only 41% of people identified themselves as \u2018pro-choice.\u2019 This is because nearly 42 years after Roe, we know much more about the unborn child and abortion. We know that abortion hurts women physically and emotionally; we know that abortion painfully dismembers a human life; and we know that the only difference between an unborn child and you and me, is their size and location.\u201d\n\nShe concluded: \u201cElecting Congressman Gardner will bring Colorado closer to a pro-life future, where all human life is protected under law.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nList of Cory Gardner\u2019s Pro-Life Votes in Congress:\n\n1.
