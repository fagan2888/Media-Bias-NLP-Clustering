Here’s a match made in Anglophile heaven: Prince Harry and Emma Watson!



The rumor was sparked by Australian tabloid Women’s Day, which reported that the “Harry Potter” star, 24, and the royal, 30, have been going on secret dates.



Prince Harry reportedly asked Watson out via a “short email” and she brought friends along for a group date.



"Harry didn't want her to feel like she was put on the spot. A party also shows he’s fun and not stuffy,” a source told Women’s Day (via the Daily Express).



"He’s smitten – and it’s more than Emma's looks."

However, it appears that the rumor is probably too good to be true.



"[It's] fake. It's such a random story,” a source told Us Weekly.



"I can see the Internet is going mad for this one,” another source added.



One thing is true: both stars are (likely) single. Watson split from her boyfriend Matthew Janney in December 2014, while Prince Harry split from his on-again, off-again girlfriend Cressida Bonas in September 2014, though he’s since been linked to model Anastasia Guseva.
