When the Internal Revenue Service rule goes into effect on January 1, 2015, Tribal businesses will have to comply with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cLarge Employer mandate.\u201d\n\nThat provision requires all businesses with more than 50 employees to provide health insurance for their workers. As a result, employees at Tribal businesses would become ineligible to purchase subsidized insurance from companies that list plans on Healthcare.gov, the federal health insurance exchange.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sit well with Northern Arapaho leaders.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Arapaho Business Council fully supports what Congress and the President have accomplished with the Affordable Care Act, but the folks in the agencies have taken a wrong turn in implementing it,\u201d said Councilman Darrell O\u2019Neal in a statement.\n\nThe Northern Arapaho case was filed in federal District Court in Cheyenne on Dec. 8. It argues that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not count tribes as Large Employers, and that Congress didn\u2019t intend for the IRS to view tribes that way because doing so would remove important benefits.\n\n\u201cCongress did not intend to create special benefits for working-class Native Americans, only to have Defendants promulgate regulations that prevent working-class Native Americans who work for Tribes from obtaining those benefits,\u201d the suit states.\n\nApplying the \u201cLarge Employer mandate\u201d to Northern Arapaho businesses would preclude workers from buying the ACA\u2019s subsidized insurance plans \u2014 which are offered to all Americans who make up to 400 percent of poverty level. (Section \u00a71401 of the ACA.)\n\nThe suit further points out that the IRS rule would remove a co-pay exemption provided specifically to American Indians by the ACA. This provision exempts tribal members from making co-pays on treatment if their income does not exceed 300 percent of the poverty level. (Summary of section \u00a71402(d) of the ACA.)\n\n\u201cCongress created these benefits for working-class Native Americans and their families,\u201d said Councilman Richard Brannan in a statement. \u201cThe IRS overlooked their trust obligations and treaty responsibilities in putting forward these rules that undermine benefits for Native Americans.\u201d\n\nSince the passage of the ACA the Northern Arapaho have counseled their employees to seek coverage from companies that offer plans on the federal health care exchange.
