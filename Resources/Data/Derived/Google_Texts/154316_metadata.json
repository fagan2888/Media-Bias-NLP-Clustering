Brian Howard, 36, of Naperville, Ill., was charged with destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, a felony. The FBI said Howard remains hospitalized and no court date has been scheduled.\n\nAs of late Saturday afternoon, Chicago flight cancellations for the day stood at more than 780 \u2014 still a high number, but an improvement. Southwest Airlines, the dominant carrier at Midway, had hoped to resume a full flight schedule Saturday but had to cancel all flights between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. CDT.\n\nLines remained long at O\u2019Hare. Many travelers stranded overnight slept on cots provided by the airport.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration facility in Aurora, about 40 miles west of downtown Chicago, handles planes cruising at high altitudes through the air space as well as those beginning to approach or completing a departure from airports in the Chicago area. It remained shut down Saturday, and its responsibilities have been transferred to centers in Cleveland, Indianapolis, Kansas City and Minneapolis.\n\nThe disruption left some aviation analysts, travelers and politicians calling for a smoother backup plan and wondering how one person could be in a position to wreak so much havoc.\n\nHoward entered the building about 5 a.m. Friday, and about 30 minutes later posted a suicide note on Facebook in which he apologized to loved ones for leaving \u201ca big mess,\u201d according to a federal criminal complaint.\n\n\u201cTake a hard look in the mirror, I have,\u201d the post says, according to the FBI special agent who prepared the complaint. \u201cAnd this is why I am about to take out ZAU and my life.\u201d ZAU is the three-letter designation for the Aurora facility.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "After sabotage in Chicago, air travel system slowly recovers", "title": "After sabotage in Chicago, air travel system slowly recovers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/after-sabotage-in-chicago-air-travel-system-slowly-recovers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_A2_ND28CHICAGOp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_A2_ND28CHICAGOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T19:20:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:30:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CHICAGO \u2014 The nation\u2019s air travel system slowly began to recover Saturday after an alleged act of employee sabotage at a large regional air traffic control center brought Chicago\u2019s two international airports to a halt.\nAt the height of the travel misery Friday, more than 2,000 flights in and out of O\u2019Hare and Midway airports had been canceled, disrupting travel across the country.\n\u201cTake a hard look in the mirror, I have,\u201d the post says, according to the FBI special agent who prepared the complaint.\n\u201cAnd this is why I am about to take out ZAU and my life.\u201d ZAU is the three-letter designation for the Aurora facility.\nAs of late Saturday afternoon, Chicago flight cancellations for the day stood at more than 780 \u2014 still a high number, but an improvement."}
