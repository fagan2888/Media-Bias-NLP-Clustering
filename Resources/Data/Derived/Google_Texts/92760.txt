The jury trial for an Oxnard woman accused in the shooting death of her Olympic-athlete husband has been delayed again, to October.

Jane Laut, 58, appeared Thursday before Ventura County Superior Court Judge David Worley for a motions hearing. Laut is accused of fatally shooting her husband at their Oxnard home on Aug. 27, 2009.

Dave Laut was the athletic director at Hueneme High School and a former shot putter who won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.

The trial was scheduled to start in September, but Judge Worley granted a defense motion to move it back to Oct. 13.

Worley on Thursday also ordered defense attorneys to turn over two phone records they subpoenaed from a forensic psychologist, a prosecution expert who interviewed Laut three times under court order.

Defense attorney Ron Bamieh said he subpoenaed the psychologist’s cellphone records because he was repeatedly texting during his sessions with Laut. The psychologist’s attorney objected, saying the phone records could have personal information not related to the Laut case.

Worley ordered the defense to turn over two phone records for destruction but allowed it to keep a third that could have information relevant to Laut.

When asked about Bamieh’s allegation the psychologist was texting during sessions with Laut, Senior Deputy District Attorney Rameen Minoui said he could not comment on evidence not discussed in open court.

“What a paid defense attorney chooses to say is not evidence,” Minoui said in an email.
