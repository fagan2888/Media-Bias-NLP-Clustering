Ever since he granted protection to as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants through executive action, Republicans have framed President Barack Obama’s bold executive action as a naked power grab that’s all but shredded the Constitution:

And because every good frame deserves a picture, they’ve tried to portray Obama in the minds of voters as a tyrant in the mold of America’s mortal enemy, King George III. Or maybe Napoleon, the littlest dictator with the outsized reputation for treachery.

Then again, perhaps Caesar is a better fit; after all, there is a Senate betrayal involved, even if it isn’t the Roman one he usurped. Or maybe a mafia enforcer works better: President Luca Brasi, perhaps?

The point is, it can be hard to tell which ruthless, iron-fisted, murderous autocrat we should keep in mind during the GOP’s protests over immigration reform, a move which seems closer to humanitarian -- sort of -- than kill-your-own-people villainous, and one that didn’t make all that many immigrants happy.

Fortunately, the New York Times has come to the rescue with a helpful guide to history’s despots and the Republicans who have openly compared them to a sitting U.S. president. Perhaps having a visual guide will help the GOP settle on just the right imagery to describe a chief executive who sent them into apoplexy by doing… something at least two other chief executives have done in recent history.
