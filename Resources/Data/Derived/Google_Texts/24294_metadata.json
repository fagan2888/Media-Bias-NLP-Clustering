That\u2019s the goal behind our new series, starting with these 14 tips:\n\n1. GET JUICING\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s 2014 and you\u2019re desperate to help shake that sluggish feeling you\u2019ve have from drinking too many holiday cocktails and eating countless cookies, pies and cakes. Confession: I ate a pie as a cookie. Bigger confession: I ate it in the car in the grocery store parking lot. But cookie binging was so 2013. You\u2019ve heard a lot about juicing and juice cleanses and like the idea of feeling energized and looking younger, but don\u2019t know where to start.\n\nThe topic can be confusing: Fresh juice can make you feel like a superhero, but a five-day, liquid-only diet along with all the conflicting juice information can make you dizzy.\n\nI\u2019ve been juicing for 13 years, and over the last six, I\u2019ve become a 70/30 raw vegetable (including juice) to nuts-fish-and-beans eater, excepting the parking lot pie incident. Here\u2019s what I know.\n\nThe theory behind juicing raw vegetables and fruit is that by removing the fiber and consuming the liquid, you give your digestive system a break and can quickly absorb the enzymes, vitamins and minerals.\n\nSome of the benefits of drinking fresh juice include weight loss, mental clarity, better sleep, improved immunity and relief from skin conditions like eczema and rosacea. Sounds good. Though before you run out a buy a juicer, try an organic green juice \u2014 not a smoothie with strawberries, ice cream and gummy bears at the bottom, but a raw juice that\u2019s green in colour. The ingredient list should read something like this: celery, cucumber, parsley, kale, lemon, ginger and apple.\n\nIf you\u2019re game to drink more green juice, buying your own juicer will save you money. There are two main types. The old-school centrifugal juicer has a fast-spinning blade-and-filter basket that separates the juice from the pulp. Masticating juicers, also known as cold-press juicers, are a newer breed that chew and grind produce at low speeds. A masticating juicer is quieter than a centrifugal, produces more juice, and is better for grasses and leafy greens like parsley. You can also use them to make nut butters, baby food and even pasta.\n\nAvoid drinking too many fruit and carrot juices.\n\nI won\u2019t be making the switch to a masticating juicer anytime soon. I don\u2019t have 10 minutes to make a glass of juice or the patience to chop and feed individual sticks of celery through the machine.\n\nCelery, incidentally is a vegetable that produces a lot of juice because of its high water content. Other high water content fruits and vegetables include, cucumbers, carrots, apples and pears. You can\u2019t juice a banana or a kiwi. (Sadly, I had five banana casualties before I figured this out).\n\nYou\u2019re going to find some contrary opinions about my next suggestion, but avoid drinking too many fruit and carrot juices. Yes, I know I just told you about the high juice yield of fruit. But when you remove the pulp from fruit or high-glycemic vegetables like carrots and beets, the sugar (along with the nutrients) gets absorbed into your system quickly. An 8-ounce glass of fresh fruit juice can have 15 grams of sugar. It\u2019s not a news flash: sugar is the devil. Of course, you can use a little fruit to sweeten your juice so it doesn\u2019t taste like you\u2019ve mowed the lawn with your mouth.\n\nOn the flip side, you want to avoid making your juice too dark with leafy greens like kale, spinach and dandelion. A good ratio is 25% dark greens to 75% celery, cucumber or carrot. Otherwise, the taste is unbearably bitter; and, you may feel like someone punched you in the stomach. Start with the dark greens and ingredients like ginger or garlic first, and finish with high-water content produce to flush those intense flavors through your juicer.\n\nDrinking green vegetable juice doesn\u2019t mean you should eliminate vegetables from your diet. You need the fiber. If you don\u2019t like eating veggies, another option is to blend them. I know many longtime juice aficionados who\u2019ve become green smoothie converts because of super-blenders like the Vitamix. The convenience of the super-creamy smoothies made from these machines is hard to resist.\n\nAs far as full-throttle juice cleanses go, some people love that feeling of \u201clightness.\u201d Unfortunately, when I\u2019ve tried cleanses for more than a couple days, I miss exits on the highway and dream of my dead childhood cats. But adding just one glass of fresh juice to your day will put a spring in your step. And, because the instant sense of well-being from juice is so addictive, you may get to two or three glasses a day. If you decide to go on a juice cleanse, talk to your doctor and listen to your body. If you start hallucinating about Fluffy and Mr. Whiskers at the office, eat something. Samantha Pynn\n\n2. PAY BY TAP\n\n\n\nThe life-changing moment came, as they rarely do, at a drive-through window.\n\nI handed my Visa to the young woman to pay my $11-and-change total or whatever it was. She took the card and, rather than insert it in the hand-held machine and return it to me, waved it over the screen for a second. It beeped an approval.\n\nI expressed surprise. What just happened? \u201cYour card can be tapped,\u201d she said. \u201cSee?\u201d She pointed to the little graphic on it, which looks like a sideways WiFi logo.\n\nIf I am able to hold my credit card over the machine for a moment and earn the beep of freedom, it is as though a small victory has been won\n\nWell, look at that. Having a tap-able credit card was one of those things to which I vaguely aspired, but I had never managed to contact my bank and apply for that capability. Who has time for such luxuries? But my card had recently been replaced \u2014 my Visa gets \u201ccompromised\u201d a lot, like a certain Mayor who hangs around disreputable sorts \u2014 and the new version was fully tap capable.\n\nHuh, I thought. Nifty.\n\nThree months later, I am drunk on tapping. If I make a purchase, and am able to simply hold my credit card over the machine for a moment and earn the beep of freedom, it is as though a small victory has been won. No signature. No PIN number. Boom, done, have a nice day. I am aware that the act of tapping only saves me \u2014 maybe \u2014 10 seconds. I do not care. The successful tap feels like I have pulled off an daring art heist.\n\nBecause that it is the other thing about tapping: It remains stubbornly elusive. Every shop, every counter has some sort of device that reads credit cards. Not all of them allow me to tap. I curse those that still do not. The lowest form of customer-merchant interaction are those that have devices that say Swipe/Insert/Tap on their LCD screens, but then a sticker pasted on that says DO NOT TAP. A crushing disappointment. You have a tap-capable device, and yet you expect me to insert my card and enter a PIN? Like some kind of CHUMP?\n\nNone of it makes sense to me, frankly. What does the tap thingy know that the embedded chip does not? Why does the machine trust the tap implicitly but force the chip to give up a PIN number to prove it is who it says it is?\n\nNo matter. Soon, we will be tapping everywhere. My productivity is up a solid 0.02%. That\u2019s arbitrage, baby. And it is glorious. Scott Stinson\n\n3. WHITEN YOUR WHITES\n\n\n\nIf Walter White were doing your laundry, you can bet your ass this is what he\u2019d be using. No messing around. Ferric hexacyanoferrate. Uh huh. You heard me. A \u201clittle tweak of chemistry,\u201d just like fulminated mercury. Boom. A few drops of this stuff, and your whites are whiter than white. Your jeans, inkier than ink. Make no mistake.\n\nSo, if you want to up your personal optics, add a bit of this optical whitener to your laundry. On the street they call it Prussian Blue \u2014 blue iron in liquid suspension \u2014 an optical whitener added to your laundry\u2019s rinse water.\n\nMakes your whites arctic. Your denim, dastardly dark. But go easy: just a drop or two. By the way, you won\u2019t need an intermediary.\n\nJust head into your laundry aisle at the local grocery store. Ask for Mrs. Stewart\u2019s Bluing. It\u2019s been around since 1883. Jane Macdougall\n\n4. EAT COTTAGE CHEESE\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll bet you didn\u2019t think cottage cheese was going to be the game-changer of 2014. Well, sport, think again. Do yourself a favour and pick a container for the first time since 1984. Buy 2%, as anything lower tastes weak.\n\nAt first glance it\u2019ll look creamy; almost too much so.\n\nFear not, it\u2019s just 100 calories per half cup yet the rich looks totally deliver. So why are we eating it? Protein, son. That half-cup serving will set you up till lunch. You\u2019ll feel satiated, your bones will strengthen, your skin will radiate health and wellness and you\u2019ll start back up at the gym. That\u2019s the power of cottage cheese, friend. Amy Rosen\n\n5. DIRECT TRAFFIC\n\n\n\nThe bane of every four-way stop are overly polite drivers who absolutely refuse to move forward, even when invited by other motorists. We\u2019ve all encountered these maniacs: You beckon their Volvo station wagon forward, only to see them wave you forward \u2014 thus locking the two of you into an idiotic Mexican standoff of courtesy. Luckily, the solution is to simply adopt a more assertive hand gesture. Point at the driver while looking them sternly in the eyes, and then slowly point in the direction where you want them to go. If they fail to immediately get the message, a slight eyebrow raise can be used for effect. This method, first pioneered by Los Angeles-based podcast host Adam Carolla, has worked 100% of the time for me, even when I\u2019m on a bicycle. Tristin Hopper\n\n6. USE A PENCIL\n\n\n\nI am a low-tech guy. When it comes to keeping my schedule, I write appointments in a leather-bound Sun Graphix. My innovation in agenda-keeping is low-tech, too. Last year I found that my commitments were exploding. Not just exploding, but also frequently changing. I found myself one day cutting pieces of paper and gluing them in my agenda, to cover up days whose schedule had completely changed. So I began to write appointments in my agenda only in pencil. That way, when they change I can erase them. The lowly pencil has changed my life. Now, if only I could find a decent pencil sharpener! Peter Kuitenbrouwer\n\n7. DON\u2019T HIT SNOOZE\n\n\n\nSometimes a life hack can simply involve taking conventional wisdom and turning it on its sleepy head. Other times, though, it can involve waging war against the very design of a common appliance, and how it\u2019s become deeply woven into our everyday existence.\n\nHitting the snooze button a few times on your alarm clock may not seem like a bad, self-sabotaging habit at all (after all, you deserve that extra 10 minutes, right? Or maybe you even set your alarm to account for a few snooze hits every morning?). But even if it may seem innocuous, providing an extra few moments of \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cwarmth\u201d in bed, especially during the cold, dark mornings of Canadian winter, it may actually be making you feel a lot more tired than you would if you simply got up the first time. New research by sleep scientists that surfaced in The New Yorker just this month points to some very real conclusions about how we\u2019re actually the source of our own grogginess when we reach for the button designed to delay the inevitable \u2026 for just five more minutes for supposed bed bliss.\n\nIt might just be the dirtiest trick you\u2019re playing on your own brain to start each and every day\n\n\u201cSleep inertia\u201d \u2014 which to us sounds like The Dark Heart of Anti-Coffee \u2014 is actually that overhang of dopey, groggy feelings that can follow us into mid-morning. It\u2019s that moment (or many moments, lasting up to 3-4 hours following wakeup when it\u2019s at its worst), when our bodies are awake, our eyes are open and we\u2019re moving around, but our minds are still long behind, with cognition and its related rational functioning lagging way behind. It turns out sleep inertia, which can feel a lot like jet lag, affects us a lot more (and for a lot longer into the day) if there\u2019s a lot of lingering melatonin (the sleep hormone) in our blood when we rise, and it also turns out that the body tends to have more melatonin left in it when we awake suddenly, or unnaturally, especially from an early stage of sleep.\n\nNow, alarm clocks will likely continue to be a firm part of daily lives in 2014 and for many years to come. \u201cSocial jet lag\u201d as Till Roenneberg, a professor of chronobiology at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, calls it, isn\u2019t going anywhere as long as there\u2019s places humans need to be at early hours, money that needs to be made, and morning is a fact of life. Coffee futures aren\u2019t in any danger of plummeting just yet. But, a key finding reported in the New Yorker was that we do make things much harder when we hit snooze after the first jolt. Why? Simple. When you awake to an alarm, grogginess inevitably ensues on some level, since your brain isn\u2019t awaking naturally and slowly to increased light from outside, the healthiest (and often most impractical and decadent) way of getting up. But, at least when the alarm goes off the first time, you\u2019re likely already in the later stages of sleep, if you managed a good bedtime the night before. When you hit that tempting (and often huge) snooze button, however, you reset the sleep cycle, sending yourself back to the beginning of sleep\u2019s stages, and releasing more melatonin. That\u2019s why, when you hear the alarm that second, third or fourth time, it can be even HARDER to get up, since your body is being wrenched not just from a later stage of sleep, but from the beginning stages, when it thought it might actually be headed to a few more hours of rest.\n\nSo while a screaming alarm clock on a weekday morning might seem like a curse on circadian rhythms, just keep in mind that the snooze button is no saviour \u2014 and it might just be the dirtiest trick you\u2019re playing on your own brain to start each and every day.

Head to toe, we favour the colour of night for our attire.\n\nBlack: it\u2019s so practical, chic and flattering. We combine that sense of style with a, perhaps, uniquely Canadian sense of entitlement: What is fair, what is right \u2014 and thereby court our own death.\n\nAnd yes, I do mean death. It\u2019s a perfect storm of events on our streets: hybrid vehicles, round the clock commerce, densification, and the kicker? Distraction.\n\nMore than the customer, we have always held that it\u2019s the pedestrian who\u2019s always right. The pedestrian has the right of way; the pedestrian is sovereign on the streets. But what if I don\u2019t see you? What if you don\u2019t see me?\n\nPay attention. Walk defensively. Don\u2019t be a statistic\n\nDon\u2019t want to be fender fodder? Here\u2019s something cheap, fast, and easy that you can do.\n\nBuy a length of reflective ribbon. Double it up so it\u2019s reflective on both sides. Pin that ribbon inside both coat pockets. Pull it out when you walk in the dark. Simply tuck it back in when you get where you\u2019re going.\n\nAnd pay attention. Walk defensively. Don\u2019t be a statistic. Be seen.\n\nAnd here\u2019s my plug: Visit my site, pedviz.com for more tips on staying safe on two feet. J.M.\n\n9. MASTER WINTER\n\n\n\nLast December I was waiting for the cable car at the foot of Japan\u2019s Mount Hakone when four twentysomething Australians stood enraptured by some tiny flakes wafting timidly in the air. Never having seen snow before, they were trying to snap some evidence with their camera phones. Feeling like an expert all of a sudden, I intervened.\n\n\u201cIf the snowflakes look like that here,\u201d I said, \u201cthey\u2019ll be bigger and fluffier once we get to the top.\u201d\n\nWhen this proved to be true, the Aussies looked awestruck. This Canadian guy knows his winter, they said. Canadians must be tough, hardy folk who bear the winter with stoic grace and hard-won knowledge.\n\nWhich is hilariously wrong, of course. Canadians are bad at winter. Aside from the odd ski trip, we spend it in misery. We slip around on the roads; we kvetch constantly; we go on and on about the wind chill factor. We wear salt-stained Uggs (ugh). We\u2019re so busy grouchily cocooning that we forget to greet winter with wonder, as a child, dog or Australian does. This is terrible flaw in the national character, given that our winters last \u2014 what, like, seven months?\n\nI\u2019m not going to bang on predictably about how other nationalities do winter better (oh, I could mention the Finns and their saunas, Norwegians and their Nordic skiing or the Russians and their knack for crushing otherwise unstoppable armies). And Canadians do a few things right. I\u2019m looking at you, Montreal\u2019s pop-up cabanes \u00e0 sucre.\n\nAnd you, St. John\u2019s, with your hair-trigger finger on the snow day alarm.\n\nInstead of huddling at home, why not toboggan or organize a game of shinny? Don\u2019t let kids have all the fun\n\nThat said, we would be much better at winter if we obeyed three simple rules meant to make us hardier and happier in the face of the inevitable. May we become the snow-heroes those Australians imagined. I, for one, promise:\n\n1. To never complain, even about slush.\n\n2. To never mention the wind chill factor (anyway, it can\u2019t \u201cfeel like -30\u201d to you, because if it actually were -30, you\u2019d claim it felt like it was -45. And so on. The whole thing is a logical fallacy. It\u2019s called recursion; look it up).\n\n3. To have fun out there.\n\nInstead of huddling at home, why not toboggan or organize a game of shinny? Don\u2019t let kids have all the fun. And hey, pubs, instead of complaining about slow business, how about throwing pancake parties on the patio? (To say nothing of winterizing your beverage selection \u2014 think stout and mulled wine, not pale lager.)\n\nLast month I took a long, awkward step toward mastering winter when I bought snowshoes. I live directly next to Toronto\u2019s 160-hectare High Park, and I\u2019ve been able to use them half a dozen times already. If you take the Toronto subway and you see a red-cheeked, bearded guy carrying dripping snowshoes during morning rush hour, please do say hello.\n\nI even tried winter hike-in camping last March, in -10 weather at Lion\u2019s Head, Ont. I was a little terrified at the prospect. For one thing, it\u2019s possible to die if you do it wrong. For another, one of my friends suffered from hypothermia on an earlier camping trip that I had missed, on a weekend that was much milder. But in the end it was an invigorating if challenging 30 hours in a snowy wonderland, and my buddies and I mostly had the provincial park to ourselves. Which is my point: We shouldn\u2019t have. Adam McDowell\n\n10. WRITE A THANK-YOU NOTE\n\n\n\nOprah would have us all keeping a daily gratitude journal. I\u2019ve never been able to sustain a personal diary, but I can write a thank-you note to make both Miss Manners and Ms. Winfrey proud.\n\nAt the One of a Kind Show last month I met Carolyn Verkuyl, the graphic designer behind the new letterpress stationery brand Carolyn Draws. Verkuyl\u2019s line includes a set of colourful notecards for kids, because she starting making the cards to instill good manners in her then seven-year-old son, sitting him down to write thank-yous for his birthday gifts.\n\nLeft to my own devices as an adult after years of similarly dutiful childhood scribblings (followed by years of recalcitrant teenage telephone mumblings) of thanks, I had stopped. I don\u2019t remember why, except that I probably thought I had better things to do with my time. In an age where I can dash off \u201cthx!\u201d with a few keystrokes and be done with it, writing a physical note seems willfully archaic.\n\nConsidering the zeitgeist of meditation and slow movements, writing a thank-you note is its own brand of mindfulness. It forces me to not only articulate sentiment but (much more importantly) identify what the sentiment is in the first place.\n\nMaybe the thank-you note is the gateway drug to happiness? Whatever it is, thinking and writing them works a little interior magic, an outward sign of an inward change. Like saying grace before a meal, be it ever so humble.\n\nI sit down with a pen and think, not about what I will write, but about what it is I want to say\n\nI have a lot to be thankful for, and the more I write thank-you notes, the more I discover. (That\u2019d be the Aristotle, who suggests \u2014 as did my Catechism classes \u2014 that moral virtue comes about from the practice of habit.)\n\nIt also offers me a regular reset of perspective. At the end of every week I go over my appointment diary to remind me what\u2019s what and to avoid any excuse to turn procrastination into neglect, I keep blank notecards and postage stamps at hand. Pen, ink and nice stationery make it more enjoyable but they\u2019re just accouterments: It could be torn workbook paper and a Bic. This isn\u2019t a case of the medium being the message \u2013 it\u2019s not the object mailed that\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s the process.\n\nThe first step is: Do nothing at all. Etiquette coaches teach MBA students to fire off a thank-you after every job interview, mailed so promptly it\u2019s practically before they\u2019re out the door. Such perfunctory, formal social courtesies are not what I mean here. (Neither is signing one\u2019s name to the rhyming sentiment of a prefab greeting card.) I sit down with a pen and think, not about what I will write, but about what it is I want to say. For me it\u2019s that moment of pause before setting it down in writing that\u2019s key \u2014 a slice of time to find, let alone gather, my thoughts.\n\nAs for mechanics, a thank-you after a visit is known as a bread-and-butter letter (also called a \u201cCollins,\u201d for Williams Collins, Jane Austen\u2019s obsequiously proper character in Pride and Prejudice), to thank one\u2019s host for hospitality. Whatever it\u2019s for \u2014 to acknowledge appreciation of a gift, a meal, a kindness, friendship \u2014 a thank-you note is simple. Think about what exactly it is you appreciate in the gesture. You might include a remark about something specific to the event/thing/visit/person \u2014 it can be an anecdote, an observation, a compliment. Waiting a day or so helps the occasion distill itself to one or two salient details \u2014 bring one to mind and refer to it directly, whether it\u2019s one of the dishes in the meal or a tangent of the cocktail party chatter.\n\nIt\u2019s a thing that is only really learned by doing, just as you can\u2019t be brave without performing an act of bravery. I am more properly and thoroughly grateful when I take the time to express my thanks in writing. Nathalie Atkinson\n\n11. SHAVE BETTER\n\n\n\nYes, you\u2019re in a great hurry. You shave quickly, cheerlessly, scrape scrape scrape with your fat five-bladed chopper and the squirt-from-a-can smelly gel \u2014 or worse, pre-fab foam. You have to be somewhere and shaving is not something you want to waste another minute on. It\u2019s a bothersome chore.\n\nYou have it all wrong. I messed it up too, and for decades, truth be told. I never liked shaving and avoided it, even on weekdays. I can\u2019t grow a decent beard, so I began wearing several days stubble instead, telling myself that I looked rugged, carefree and cool.\n\n\u201cAre you really going to work looking like that?\u201d my wife asked late last spring, not for the first time.\n\nI opened the bathroom cabinet and there, on my designated shelf, was the same half-used can and that hideous mediocrity, the whisker-tugging plastic disposable from the ubiquitous, duopolistic mega-brand. Thought turned to my cordless electric shaver, the one bought in desperation and which now lives in a closet somewhere. It always leaves my face feeling patchy and burned, and it can\u2019t hold a charge worth a damn. Ugh. Forget it.\n\nSo I went online. Search term: Good shave.\n\nThus began my belated education on proper whisker removal, and what has since become a mild obsession with double-edge wet shaving. Whisker removal, the old school way.\n\nIt seems counter-intuitive, but those pricey multi-bladed disposable razors, their high-tech motorized handles and their allegedly ergonomic designs? They just don\u2019t do a proper job. The canned stuff we\u2019ve been using to lather up? Expensive, hard on the skin, just plain bad. So I learned, reading various authoritative shaving sources. The Internet attracts all kinds, including communities of committed wet shavers, men \u2014 and a few women \u2014 who know how to handle a real razor blade, the kind your grandaddy used.\n\nI was in business within minutes, ordering from a reputable shaving specialist my first chrome-plated double-edge safety razor, and a quality badger hair brush, and a variety pack of platinum-coated blades, made in different factories around the world. I\u2019d just invested close to $100, a fair commitment to something I\u2019d never tried before. Somehow I knew it would work out just fine.\n\nThe equipment arrived a week later; by then, I\u2019d already experimented with a cheap drug store brush and a new shave cream, an Italian-made product called Proraso. It comes in several subtle scents and forms, including a large green and white tube found at Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nA little of this stuff goes a very long way; one pea-sized dollop, 20 seconds of brush work and voila: You\u2019ve got a fluffy, handmade foam that exfoliates the skin as you brush it onto your face.\n\nCombined with a standard cartridge razor, the new product worked better for me than any of the canned for convenience muck I\u2019d previously used.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Double edge shaving takes a bit of practice\n\nWith a double edge shaver, and a top-notch razor blade, it was something else. A revelation. I\u2019d never had such a comfortable, smooth and close shave. What had taken me so long to get here?\n\nShaving is no longer a drag. It\u2019s become a pleasant morning ritual, with choices and options galore. One morning, I might apply a pre-shave cream, to soften and prepare the whiskers. Then I\u2019ll decide what razor blade to use. After some testing, first with a Czech-made Derby Extra, then a super-sharp Feather that\u2019s made in Japan, I settled on a Russian Astra Platinum, now my daily go-to razor blade. Each blade comes wrapped in waxed paper, and over that, a paper envelope. Such style.\n\nBought in bulk \u2014 say, 100 razor blades at a time \u2014 one Astra Platinum costs about 16 cents, a fraction of the cost of a single multi-blade cartridge. I get about three or four quality shaves from each razor blade. Then it\u2019s time to change.\n\nDrop one blade into the disassembled shaver head. Screw the head pieces back together. Lather up and shave. One pass, with the grain. Lather up again, and take another pass, this time cross-grain. Presto: The best shave you\u2019ve ever had.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Double edge shaving takes a bit of practice. You may nick yourself on the first few attempts, before adjusting to the correct shaver angle, learning not to press the device on your skin, allowing the tool to do the work and just letting it glide.\n\nIt will consume more of your time. But not much. Six months into wet shaving, I complete the entire process \u2014 wet towel pre-shave, lather, two passes and a quick mopping up \u2014 in eight minutes. I actually look forward to my shave every day, and I love the result. Best of all, she does, too. Brian Hutchinson\n\n12. UNLOCK YOUR PHONE\n\n\n\nComing home to cellphone-bill sticker shock after international travel is a big enough problem that the CRTC is looking at capping the amount carriers can charge for roaming, but there\u2019s already a surefire way to make sure you don\u2019t rack up big charges for using your mobile abroad: Unlock your phone and use local SIM cards when you travel.\n\nIt may sound shady, but there is no computer hacking required. Carriers lock phones to prevent their use on competitors\u2019 networks, but will set you free legitimately for a nominal fee, usually about $50. Once untethered, and provided you have a GSM phone (which most popular smartphones are), you are free to eject the SIM card, which stores your phone number and account information, and replace it with one from the country you are visiting.\n\nPackages are affordable and the cards, which give you a local telephone number, are widely available at telecom shops and convenience stores. On a recent trip to Vienna I skipped Fido\u2019s international data add-on \u2014 for $50 I could get 40MB of data, or enough for a day\u2019s worth of Google mapping \u2014 in favour of a T-Mobile card picked up at the airport that offered 1,000 minutes of local talk time, 1,000 text messages and 1GB of data (in other words, too much of everything) all for 10 euro, or about $15. Makes for a much better souvenir than that giant phone bill. Jessica Leigh Johnston\n\n13. GET ENGAGED\n\n\n\nCrave begrudged respect, handshakes and unexpectedly perceptive conversations about life with men you normally just drink and grunt with during the game\u2019s commercial breaks? Pretty sure your parents don\u2019t take you seriously despite your ability to go to work every day and wear (relatively) clean pants? Solve all these problems by getting a fianc\u00e9e! Yes, there is a small start-up cost and commitment, but there are numerous side-benefits including, but not limited to: Up to two months worth of \u201ccongratulations\u201d drinks, self-validation, extra heat in the winter, newfound long-term planning skills and possible upgrades in the kitchen. Also, life partner. (Note: this life hack is generally only effective once.) Josh Visser\n\n14. WEAR A CRAPPY WATCH\n\n\n\nBack from vacation, I\u2019m working my way through the pile of late-December copies of The New York Times stacked up in my front hallway. The news therein is two weeks stale. But I never get tired of checking out those beautiful holiday gift-season wristwatch ads.\n\nPulling out a December edition of the Times at random, page 2 invites me to consider a Cartier: \u201cCollection starting at $7,400.\u201d On the next page is the Oris \u201cDepth Gauge\u201d 0 at $3,500. Deeper into the A-section, one finds a Longines model, from \u201cThe Saint-Imier Collection,\u201d at $4,525. More obscure and prestigious brands also are featured, but without any dollar amount indicated \u2014 the implicit message being \u201cIf you have to ask \u2026.\u201d\n\nThough you wouldn\u2019t know it from what I now wear on my wrist, this is a world I recognize. When I graduated from university a quarter century ago, my father gave me an ultra-fancy self-winding Swiss watch that was the envy of my young friends. Over the next two decades, I acquired two more watches of similar value \u2014 one as a gift, and another in barter with my cousin Danny.\n\nThese three specimens \u2014 which I rotated monthly for many years, in the same way that a woman might rotate handbags \u2014 were a big deal for me. It made my day if a stranger complimented my watch. My wife, meanwhile, wore a $7 wristwatch she\u2019d bought on Canal Street before we got married. I told her it was the equivalent of using a plastic shopping bag as a purse.\n\nOne thing I had to admit, though: My wife was punctual. Her battery-operated model, cheap as it was, actually kept perfect time. My fancy Swiss self-winding timepiece, on the other hand, lost 30 seconds per day. If I forgot to reset the time on a regular basis, I could find myself running 15 minutes late by the end of the month.\n\nWhen I brought the watch into the name-branded repair shop \u2014 a suitably impressive place with a guard, lots of glass and attractive young women wearing business suits \u2014 I was surprised to learn that this is actually somewhat normal behavior for this particular brand: The sophisticated self-winding mechanism behaves erratically depending on what you do with your wrist (oh, grow up).\n\nIt made my day if a stranger complimented my watch\n\nStill, it looked great. Same with the second watch I owned, an Omega Speedmaster (which required hand-winding, and lost a mere 15 seconds per day). My next-door neighbour Craig had the same watch, and we sometimes would just sit there examining each other\u2019s timepieces, assuring each other how cool they were.\n\nBut one thing that was uncool was the cost of maintenance. In 2010, I dropped my Omega on a hard tile floor and the bezel fell off. When I brought it in for servicing, I was told that the thing had to be sent to Switzerland, and that it would take six months to get it back.\n\nOh, and the bill (which I have kept) would be $1,519.85. At the time, this was literally more than the value of the car I drove. But I paid it. In the same year, I also paid $600 in \u201cscheduled maintenance\u201d for the ultra-fancy Swiss self-winder \u2014 even after my wife forced me to stop wearing it because I was always late.\n\nThat was just three years ago. But watch-wise, it feels like those experiences, those bills, belong to a different human being.\n\nMy transformation began a few months ago, when I smashed my Omega against the side of a formica tabletop at Wendy\u2019s, as I was (unsuccessfully) lunging to rescue a cup of chili my child had knocked over. The thing stopped working. There was no way my wife was going to let me spend another $1,519.85 on watch repair. So I put the thing in a drawer, next to the self-winder, and went full-time to my one remaining watch.\n\nThat lasted six weeks, until I forgot to take the thing off before getting into the shower. The waterproofing had worn out years ago. It was wrecked, pending another massively expensive repair job.\n\nBy this time, the battery in my wife\u2019s $7 Canal Street watch finally had worn out, after yielding her a decade of service. (That\u2019s 0.2\u00a2 per day of watch use, compared to the $1.09 per day in maintenance alone that, according to my calculations, I paid during the same period for my own watch trio.) But that didn\u2019t bother her because she now uses no watch. \u201cI always have a smartphone on me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so do you. If you haven\u2019t noticed, your BlackBerry has a clock.\u201d\n\nI tried that for a month. But I still found myself reflexively staring down at my left wrist every time I wanted to know the time. I needed a new watch.\n\nThen, two weeks ago, as I was walking with my children through a shabby connecting passage between two downtown shopping malls, my daughter pointed to a shoe-repair kiosk and said \u201cDaddy, that man is selling watches.\u201d I ambled over, and saw a dusty display case full of no-name timepieces and other cheap merchandise. Needless to say, I was unimpressed. But my children \u2014 too young to know quality from crap \u2014 were geared up about the possibility of picking out a new watch for me.\n\n\u201cHow much for \u2026 that one?\u201d I halfheartedly asked, pointing to the one they liked best. One sticker on the watch announced that it was from China, while another said it had been \u201cassembled\u201d in Singapore. It was a plain silver model, with the brand written in tiny, cramped, illegible script on the watch face.\n\nWhen I squinted, it kind of looked like a bastardized spelling of Monte Carlo. Murray Carlo, perhaps. Or maybe Monte Camry? I kept squinting: An old instinct told me that I needed to know the brand in case someone asked. \u201cEvery watch, $11, battery included,\u201d the man said, in a tone that suggested there would be no tax, no receipt and no returns.\n\nAnd you know, the thing didn\u2019t actually look that crappy. OK, maybe not worthy of the Saint-Imier Collection, but presentable enough. The shopkeeper handed me the watch, and took my money. And that was it. The watch didn\u2019t come in a big clamshell box with a glossy manual congratulating me on my purchase. There was no warranty card to fill out. No \u201ccertificate of authenticity.\u201d Just a thing on my wrist that told the time.\n\nNo one noticed that I suddenly had become a guy who wore crap on his wrist \u2014 or, if they did, they didn\u2019t say anything about it\n\nAnd told it accurately, as it turns out, just like my wife\u2019s Canal Street model. I set the time on a Monday, and the thing was off by just a second by the time Friday rolled around. In my entire life, I had never owned a watch this accurate \u2014 even if I was somewhat mortified by the stigma of wearing a Murray Carlo to holiday parties where some of my friends would be sporting Rolexes.\n\nAs it turned out, my shallow social fears were misplaced: No one noticed that I suddenly had become a guy who wore crap on his wrist \u2014 or, if they did, they didn\u2019t say anything about it. As for my wife, she could perceive no real aesthetic difference between my new watch and the old broken ones. Her only interest was how much money I\u2019d \u201cwasted\u201d \u2014 and she was pleased that it was a mere 11 bucks.\n\nOf course, there are all sorts of consumer products that exhibit brand-to-brand price variations spanning several orders of magnitude. A cheap purse can cost $10; a super-expensive one, $10,000. But at least, in that case, there really is some difference in quality between the two items \u2014 even if the scale of the difference bears little relationship to the difference in price. With many watches, though, it is the opposite: My $11 Murray Carlo is delivering a more satisfying consumer experience than the more expensive (and less accurate) watches it replaced.\n\nAnd if it breaks tomorrow, I can buy another. In fact, given the $1.09/day I was paying on watch-servicing until recently, I can buy a new $11 watch every 10 days, and still break even. (So far, I have had my new watch for two weeks. I\u2019m already in the black.)\n\nThere also is something curiously liberating about wearing a crappy watch. At the gym, I once would rush through my shower routine, eager to get back to my locker to ensure no one was trying to steal that great prize I wore on my wrist. No longer. Shampoo or conditioner? These days, I don\u2019t have to choose.\n\nAs for those three fancy watches that once made me so proud, they still have great sentimental value to me, and I will never part with them. All three sit silently in my safety deposit box \u2014 awaiting a time when I have the cash available to repair them. If that happy day ever arrives, you\u2019ll know because of the expensive piece of machinery I\u2019m wearing on my wrist.\n\nThat, and the fact I\u2019m 10 minutes late.
