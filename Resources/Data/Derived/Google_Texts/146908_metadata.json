It took the might of the federal government to make this happen, and left it to the states to make it permanent part of their laws, by 2017. We intended to make that happen this legislative session, with the passage of Senate Bill 309; prohibiting discrimination based on age or disability,\n\nThanks to the ACA, Oregon is one of the states able to expand Medicaid to people without health insurance, providing coverage to more than 1 million people. We\u2019ve done this through the 16 coordinated care organizations contracted to operate in the state and serve Medicaid patients. The CCO\u2019s are given a \u201cglobal budget\u201d with \u201cquality incentives\u201d to provide care for members and cover operating expenses. CCO\u2019s operate under the auspices of the Oregon Health Authority, which administers the Oregon Health Plan, our state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nLate last month, Oregon legislators decided that the rights of the CCO\u2019s were more important than the rights of her citizens on Medicaid. On Monday, April 20th, the Senate Committee on Health Care held a public hearing and workgroup on Senate Bill 309. Despite public testimony in support of the bill, support from organizations working to improve health (including ours) and bipartisan desire to move to a vote, at the discretion of the Chair, the bill was not voted on and is now in Limbo. Limbo, while not an actual place outside of the works of Dante, and the Latin Mass Catholicism of my youth, is also recognized as one of the places where bills go to die.\n\nWhen questioned why the bill did not progress by stakeholders and constituents, we were told numerous things, including that the Chair was acting in response to the desires of the Governor, the Oregon Health Authority, the House Health Care Committee and the State\u2019s Budget (passage of the bill would \u201cbankrupt the state\u201d).\n\nSB 309 is the latest in a number of bills introduced this session designed to protect Insurers and CCO\u2019s by limiting the rights of patients and access to healthcare. So far this year we have seen attempts to limit access to new classes of drugs for six months after the FDA approve them, HB 2638, and a bill, SB 838, that would authorize the Health Evidence Review Commission to create two lists; \u201cOne list shall exclude prescription drugs and one list shall be solely composed of the drugs in the Practitioner Managed Prescription Drug Plan.\u201d\n\nSimply put, if you need a drug on the exclude list, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nIt seems that we may have forgotten the goals of Oregon\u2019s original ideals in healthcare expansion. As a reminder, they are called the Triple Aim and promised better health for everyone in the state, improved patient experience (access to health and improved outcomes) and lower healthcare costs.\n\nIs limiting access to healthcare and removing protections, offered in federal law, to OHA and CCO patients fair and in in keeping with our goals of improving the health and outcomes of our families, our friends and our communities? Or does it create a system where your health outcomes are determined on who pays for your care?\n\nI believe that together we can discover outcomes to improve population health while working to address rising costs and limited budgets, without enshrining potential healthcare discrimination for more than a million Oregonians. I hope that if you feel the same way you will join us.\n\nBJ Cavnor is the founding executive director of One in Four Chronic Health, a collaborative working to improve the needs of people living with chronic health conditions through advocacy, education and policy.
