Even if you got a place to work beyond your home, it was unlikely you would ever receive an academic position, or any sort of wide recognition for laboratory success. It\u2019s this \u201cin-betweenness\u201d that has fascinated artist Emilie Clark and prompted her to develop a series of exhibitions called Sweet Corruption. It\u2019s also involved her saving her family\u2019s food waste for a year and putting it on display.\n\nThe latest in the Sweet Corruption series is opening next month at theNevada Museum of Art, and follows an exhibition at the Lynden Sculpture Garden in Milwaukee earlier this year and one in 2012 at Morgan Lehman Gallery. All have involved not just researching Victorian scientists, but also using this mode of practice as a way to go out into the field on her own and turn her studio into something of a laboratory. The New York-based artist\u2019s exhibitions, while including her detailed swirling watercolors, also involve installations with microscopes, jarred specimens, and hands-on research stations.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that excites me about working in the way that I do is that I think that if done seriously, artists who work in close dialogue with science have the ability to create a kind of third space \u2014 a space that is not strictly science and not strictly art,\u201d she told Hyperallergic. \u201cThe art can teach the viewer how to consider the science from an alternative perspective, while also teaching how art can occupy a place of knowledge and communicate through its particular media.\u201d\n\nFor the Nevada exhibition, she\u2019s focusing on the work of Ellen H. Richards, a 19th century chemist who was the first female student at MIT, and was especially focused on sanitary engineering. She also introduced the term \u2018ecology,\u2019 literally meaning \u201cEarth\u2019s households.\u201d Richards was especially curious about the idea of controlling different \u201cparts\u201d contained in air, water, and food into a whole.\n\n\u201cTransformation and world building is one of the underlying connections across all of my projects,\u201d Clark explained. \u201cThe practices of these women and mine involve careful testing, sustained empirical inquiry, structured interaction with daily life, and ultimately world building.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An exhibition features microscopes, jarred specimens and hands-on research stations from the Victorian era", "title": "Rediscovering a forgotten age of female scientists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An exhibition features microscopes, jarred specimens and hands-on research stations from the Victorian era", "title": "Rediscovering a forgotten age of female scientists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/28/exploring_the_world_of_victorian_female_scientists_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/sweetcorruption011.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An exhibition features microscopes, jarred specimens and hands-on research stations from the Victorian era", "title": "Rediscovering a forgotten age of female scientists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/sweetcorruption011.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Allison Meier", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Art, Emilie Clark, exhibition, Hyperallergic, microscopes, Morgan Lehman Gallery, Nevada Museum of Art, science of art, Victorian female scientists", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Art, Emilie Clark, exhibition, Hyperallergic, microscopes, Morgan Lehman Gallery, Nevada Museum of Art, science of art, Victorian female scientists, Media News, Life News, Entertainment NewsThis article originally appeared on HyperallergicIt wasn\u2019t easy being a female Victorian scientist.\nIt\u2019s this \u201cin-betweenness\u201d that has fascinated artist Emilie Clark and prompted her to develop a series of exhibitions called Sweet Corruption.\n\u201cTransformation and world building is one of the underlying connections across all of my projects,\u201d Clark explained.\n\u201cThe practices of these women and mine involve careful testing, sustained empirical inquiry, structured interaction with daily life, and ultimately world building.\u201d\nThe New York-based artist\u2019s exhibitions, while including her detailed swirling watercolors, also involve installations with microscopes, jarred specimens, and hands-on research stations."}
