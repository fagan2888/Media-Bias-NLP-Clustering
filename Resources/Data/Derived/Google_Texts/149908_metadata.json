A copy of the letter was published online by the Tribune.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of elated that the federal government\u2019s taking a significant interest in this,\u201d Hunt family attorney Robert Sykes told the Tribune on Friday evening.\n\nAuthorities said Hunt lunged at two officers responding to a report of a man walking around with a sword, before he fled and was fatally shot by the policemen.\n\nUtah County Attorney Jeff Buhman declined to press charges against the officers, saying they were justified in using deadly force because they thought he would harm them or others.\n\nA private autopsy on Hunt showed he was shot six times, with no bullets entering his body from the front. He was in costume as a Japanese anime character when he was killed and the sword was a showpiece with a dull, rounded blade, his family told media.\n\nIn a separate civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Salt Lake City last month, Hunt\u2019s parents said he did not threaten the officers and removed the sword from its sheath at their request. The lawsuit contends that neither officer warned Hunt before he was shot.\n\nThe suit seeks an unspecified amount of money, demands that the shooting be deemed unconstitutional, and that the city\u2019s police officers be equipped with body cameras.\n\nSaratoga Springs is home to Mia Love, a former mayor who last year became the first black Republican woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n(Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Nick Macfie)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Darrien-Hunt-Facebook1-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Feds to investigate Utah police shooting of costumed anime fan carrying sword"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf282\"", "article_summary": "Darrien Hunt (Facebook)Federal prosecutors and the FBI are reviewing the fatal police shooting of a 22-year-old black Utah man who was holding a sword when he was killed, the Salt Lake Tribune reported on Friday.\nA private autopsy on Hunt showed he was shot six times, with no bullets entering his body from the front.\nIn a separate civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Salt Lake City last month, Hunt\u2019s parents said he did not threaten the officers and removed the sword from its sheath at their request.\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of elated that the federal government\u2019s taking a significant interest in this,\u201d Hunt family attorney Robert Sykes told the Tribune on Friday evening.\nHe was in costume as a Japanese anime character when he was killed and the sword was a showpiece with a dull, rounded blade, his family told media."}
