MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) – For 10 years, self-employed artists Ken Avidor and his wife lived the gamble without health insurance.

“We were the people who fell through the cracks,” he said.

By enrolling in the state’s MNsure health insurance exchange, they became covered and helped push down the number of Minnesotans living on the edge.

“Being insured has enabled us to have that preventative care, which would prevent that big hit where we get the emergency care,” Avidor said.

A recent University of Minnesota survey of 11,000 households found that the number of uninsured in the state is at an all-time low.

From a high of 9 percent without coverage in 2011, Minnesota’s uninsured rate has fallen to 4.3 percent of the population, or about 234,000 residents.

Ed Ehlinger, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Health, says it means over 200,000 more people have health coverage in the state than did just two years ago.

“All groups of Minnesotans, regardless of income, race or ethnic group or age, reported improvements in health insurance coverage,” Ehlinger said.

Much of the credit is the improved economy and more employers offering coverage. But roughly one in 10 Minnesotans now is getting health insurance through MNsure.

“There is still work to do, the cost of care is rising, so we need to figure out how to manage premium growth and cost of care,” said Stefan Gildemeister, the Minnesota health economist.

Avidor is finally getting the checkups and procedures he’s been putting off for the past decade, making him and his wife part of the picture of a healthier state.

“MNsure and the Affordable Care Act allowed us to get back into the system,” he said.
