All told, more than 400,000 Americans died in the war.\n\nNone of them were Schrader\u2019s friends or comrades, according to his daughter, Susan Howe.\n\n\u201cAll 10 of them (his friends) flew in the B-24 and all 10 of them returned to the United States,\u201d said Howe, who was on hand for Wednesday\u2019s wreath-laying along with four generations of Schrader\u2019s family.\n\nA handful of veterans took part in the ceremony, along with representatives of 14 other countries at the imposing monument that sits on the National Mall between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nA hot and sticky Washington morning did not deter passersby from stopping to watch, along with scores of family members and other attendees, as a U.S. Navy band played and dignitaries spoke.\n\nOne of those was former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, a veteran of the war.\n\n\u201cThere were about 16.5 million of us who served in World War II and now we\u2019re down to about 850,000,\u201d Dole said during remarks about the so-called \u201cgreatest generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are really the disappearing generation,\u201d Dole said.\n\nAfter the speeches, Dole, Schrader and others processed \u2013 some of them pushed in wheelchairs \u2013 to lay wreaths at the memorial, against a backdrop of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nSchrader laid a wreath representing the National Park Service, which maintains the memorial, and the Friends of the National World War II Memorial, which hosted Wednesday\u2019s event.\n\nThe end of the war didn\u2019t mean an immediate return home for Schrader, whose squadron remained in the Philippines for three months after the Japanese surrender. Most of that period is a blur, he said, but recalled with a laugh how he and a radio operator friend bought motorcycles to pass the time and wound up with gravel burns to show for their inexperience with the bikes.\n\nSchrader, whose service began in April 1945, was back home in the U.S. by November. A veteran of the war, but still a teenager, he found work as a sales representative in California before getting married in 1947. He ended up in Arizona decades later.\n\nRoughly 25,000 veterans of the war were living in Arizona as of last year, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nInspired by her father and those other vets living in the state, Howe started the Arizona chapter of Honor Flights in 2008 as a way of giving back to them. The organization flies Arizona veterans of the war to Washington to see the memorial to their service.\n\nBehind the spot that Schrader and the others decorated with wreaths Wednesday are thousands of gold stars, each representing 100 American soldiers who died in the war.\n\n\u201cI got to come home,\u201d Schrader said after the ceremony, acknowledging that many others never got that chance.\n\n- 30 -", "article_metadata": {"DC.rights": "All rights reserved", "twitter": {"description": "From the nose of a B-24 bomber soaring low over the Pacific Ocean 70 years ago, Bill Schrader scanned the horizon for Japanese vessels.
