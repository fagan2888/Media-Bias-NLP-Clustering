Here\u2019s What That Means For How He\u2019ll Decide Cases. CREDIT: AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nThere was an awkward moment Wednesday morning when reporters across DC learned that the hours of time they\u2019d spent researching Judge Sri Srinivasan was all for naught. The nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland (who is older than any Supreme Court nominee since the Nixon administration and, in Fox News\u2019 words, is the \u201cmost conservative nominee by a Dem in the modern era\u201c) surprised many Court-watchers. It also triggered a deep sense of ambivalence among many liberals. As SCOTUSBlog noted shortly after news of the Garland nomination became public:\n\n\n\nProgressive groups will fall in line, and deeply respect Garland and the President\u2019s choice, but their actual disappointment will be deep. \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) March 16, 2016\n\nIt did not take long for this falling in line to begin. In the hours after Garland\u2019s nomination, reporters\u2019 inboxes filled with statements \u2014 many of them using identical language and nearly all of them clearly drafted off the same talking points \u2014 offering their support. In case you haven\u2019t heard already, Garland \u201cdeserves a fair hearing\u201d and it is time for Senate Republicans to \u201cdo their job.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many writers offered sharper observations. Slate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern labeled Garland \u201can extraordinarily disappointing choice.\u201d Political scientist Scott Lemieux warned that concerns over whether the Senate is being unfair to Garland \u201clikely won\u2019t galvanize any specific constituency.\u201d Talking Points Memo\u2019s Tierney Sneed offered that \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s choice of Merrick Garland to succeed justice Scalia on the Supreme Court was not the nominee progressives were dreaming of a month ago, when Scalia\u2019s unexpected death opened up a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIn case there is any doubt, there\u2019s little risk that Garland will become another member of the Court\u2019s conservative bloc. University of Michigan law professor and former Ruth Bader Ginsburg clerk Sam Bagenstos predicted on Twitter that a Justice Garland would prove similar to Justice Stephen Breyer \u2014 an almost entirely reliable member of the Court\u2019s liberal bloc with occasional bouts of heterodoxy. As Lemieux notes, Breyer \u201cvoted with Ruth Bader Ginsburg 93 percent of the time in the most recently completed term.\u201d\n\nGarland\u2019s moderate views are likely to matter a great deal, however, once liberal advocates start bringing cases up to the Supreme Court to see just how far the Court\u2019s new majority is willing to push the law to the left.\n\nLast June, liberals were shocked as they scored victory after victory before the very conservative Court that exited prior to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Most of these victories happened because conservative overreach breeds liberal unity. The cases decided last June included an attack on federal housing discrimination law, an attempt to neuter many efforts to fight gerrymandering, and a lawsuit alleging that much of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s text doesn\u2019t count. These were, to say the least, very ambitious efforts to shift the law rightward, and they never stood any chance of picking up a liberal (or even a moderately conservative) justice\u2019s vote.\n\nShould Garland be confirmed, conservative advocates will quickly figure out that lawsuits seeking to gut major liberal legislation are a waste of time and money.\n\nAnd so the Court\u2019s liberal minority was able to rack up victories by holding itself together while picking off one or two conservative justices in case after case.\n\nShould Garland be confirmed, conservative advocates will quickly figure out that lawsuits seeking to gut major liberal legislation are a waste of time and money. Liberal advocates, by contrast, will be eager to challenge hated precedents and build new progressive doctrines. The Court, in other words, will hear quite a few cases that unite the Court\u2019s conservative members and give them a chance to pick off a liberal justice. And Garland will be a frequent target of these efforts.\n\nSo where would a Justice Garland draw the line? Some of the answers to this question are unclear. Unlike the Supreme Court, which selects the several dozen cases it wants to hear each year from a pool of 7,000 to 8,000 petitions, most of the cases heard by appeals court judges like Garland are assigned randomly to panels of judges with very little control over which issues come before them. Many issues that receive outsized attention in the press, moreover, rarely arise in federal litigation. Most federal circuit judges will go their entire careers without hearing an abortion case, for example. So far, that\u2019s included Judge Garland.\n\nThe swiftest victory for liberals if Judge Garland is confirmed is that he immediately halts the bleeding from lawsuits, such as the seemingly endless attacks on Obamacare, which seek to revive long dead conservative doctrines or selectively rewrite foundational rules of statutory interpretation. Even if Garland adopts Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s current mantle as the Court\u2019s \u201cswing\u201d justice, Garland is unlikely to swing so far that liberals will lie awake in terror, fearing that an historic legislative achievement will be gutted.\n\nThe one area where Garland is most likely to disappoint liberals is criminal justice. In a very comprehensive analysis of Garland\u2019s first 13 years as a judge, SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Tom Goldstein found only eight published decisions where Garland sided with a criminal defendant challenging their conviction, in addition to seven where \u201che voted to reverse the defendant\u2019s sentence in whole or in part, or to permit the defendant to raise a argument relating to sentencing on remand.\u201d Garland, it should be noted, sits on a fairly specialized court that hears an unusually heavy load of regulatory cases and a relatively light load of criminal appeals. So a partial explanation for why he\u2019s sided with so few criminal defendants is probably that he hears fewer criminal cases than other judges. Nevertheless, Garland is a former prosecutor who, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, is likely to be more conservative on criminal justice issues than an average Democratic appointee.\n\nOn campaign finance and voting rights cases, Garland appears to have liberal instincts, according to election law expert Rick Hasen. A Voting Rights Act opinion Garland joined, for example, suggests that he is \u201cone who takes seriously [the need] to protect voting rights.\u201d That said, Hasen also notes that a \u201cbig question\u201d will be whether Garland is willing to overrule or significantly alter precedents. \u201cI have little doubt he would have been in the dissent in the original Citizens United case,\u201d Hasen writes of Garland, but he\u2019s far less sure that the judge would \u201cbe willing to overturn such a case, just a few years after the controversial ruling.\u201d\n\nIf Garland proves unwilling to overrule precedents like Citizens United or the Shelby County decision gutting much of the Voting Rights Act, that\u2019s not death to liberal ambitions. Citizens United retained, at least in theory, a decades old doctrine permitting campaign finance regulation in order to \u201climit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions\u201d \u2014 the decision\u2019s primary attack on campaign finance laws is its definition of the word \u201ccorruption,\u201d which is so narrow as to be virtually meaningless. If confirmed, Garland could help expand this definition without explicitly overruling Citizens United.\n\nSimilarly, the Voting Rights Act contains a \u201cbail-in\u201d provision which, over time, could make the law even more effective than it was prior to Shelby County. Garland could join decisions reading that provision broadly without actually voting to overrule Shelby County.\n\nBecause of the steady diet of regulatory cases Garland hears as an appeals court judge, his views on the appropriate balance of power between executive branch agencies and the judiciary are very well defined. As Goldstein notes, Garland heard \u201ca dozen close cases in which the court divided\u201d on whether his court should defer to an agency\u2019s decision, and \u201che sided with the agency every time.\u201d\n\nGarland is the kind of judge that Obama most admires \u2014 especially after Obama spent most of his presidency being harassed by lawsuits seeking to dismantle his accomplishments.\n\nAgency deference isn\u2019t one of the sexiest issues that comes before the Supreme Court, but it is one of the most important. Especially as Congress falls into deeper and deeper dysfunction, presidents must turn to their existing authority under federal statutes (and the authority held by agencies within the executive branch) in order to be able to govern. Smart and influential conservative groups are very aware of this fact, and they have very well developed plans to effectively shut down much of President Obama\u2019s power by shrinking executive agencies\u2019 authority and limiting judicial deference to agency actions.\n\nGarland\u2019s confirmation would end many of these plans. It would almost certainly cut off the challenge to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan, the administration\u2019s most ambitious effort to fight climate change. And it would most likely add another vote to the Supreme Court who would uphold the administration\u2019s authority to temporarily allow millions of undocumented immigrants to live and work in this country.\n\nOf course, agency deference is a double-edged sword, and a Justice Garland who is likely to defer to agencies run by Democratic appointees is also likely to defer when Republicans are calling the shots. Nevertheless, such an approach shifts power away from the one unelected branch of government and back to the American people, who ultimately decide who controls the executive branch.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s likely that this willingness to get out of the way played a major role in Obama\u2019s selection of Judge Garland. Despite widespread speculation that Obama chose Garland as a political move to embarrass Republicans that refuse to confirm any nominee, there\u2019s also a very simple explanation for why the president picked the justice-in-waiting. Garland is the kind of judge that Obama most admires \u2014 especially after Obama spent most of his presidency being harassed by lawsuits seeking to dismantle his accomplishments.\n\nAs the president wrote a few weeks before choosing Garland, \u201cthe person I appoint will be someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary\u2019s role.\u201d Above all, Judge Garland fits this bill.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "President Obama spent most of his presidency being harassed by lawsuits seeking to dismantle his accomplishments.
