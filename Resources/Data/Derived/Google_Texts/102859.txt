It's a penalty most expect to face when filing taxes this year, however, nonprofit organizations, such as churches, are getting quite the surprise.

The deadline to have health insurance has passed, which means many filing taxes this year can expect to pay a penalty. Tax experts tell Channel 7 News that organizations, such as a church, are not realizing they had 50 or more employees, which means they have to offer affordable coverage.

"Churches nowadays, ever since the ACA or Obamacare has come out, why they've been surprised is because a lot of the churches have daycare, education centers, feeding centers," said Floyd Hickerson, with Heartland Tax.

Hickerson added that some of his clients who are churches and nonprofit organizations are slowly realizing that they do in fact employ 50 full time equivalent employees.

"By having these 50 full time equivalent employees, it puts them into the large employer range of where they have to provide healthcare and they have to provide not only healthcare, they have to provide affordable healthcare," added Hickerson.

Heartland Tax advises churches and other nonprofits to make sure they seek to purchase an affordable healthcare package to offer its employees so the penalties don't continue to accumulate.

Hickerson said some churches in Texas are even closing their daycare as a direct result of this penalty.
