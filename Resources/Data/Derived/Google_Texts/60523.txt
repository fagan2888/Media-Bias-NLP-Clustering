Greg Corombos of Radio America and Jim Geraghty of National Review enjoy watching President Obama squirm as he demands Senate consideration for his eventual Supreme Court nominee but tried to filibuster Samuel Alito back in 2006. They also like a new poll showing Nevada to be a dead heat between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And they discuss the new book from liberal commentator Bill Press that calls President Obama a disappointment and says Obamacare and the stimulus were not successes.
