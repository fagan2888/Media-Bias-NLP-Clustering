Insurers are still learning what sorts of plans will be most popular and what prices will be low enough to attract customers while still covering their medical bills.\n\nThe numbers come from an analysis from the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform, which did the work of examining all the plans and matching 2015 products with 2016 offerings. McKinsey examined the larger market areas that insurance companies use to set their rates, instead of individual counties. That means that our estimate of terminated plans may be an undercount, because there are some additional counties where renewing customers will be out of luck.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOur advice from last year still applies. Even people who aren\u2019t forced back into the marketplace could be well served by examining their options. The McKinsey analysis finds that, in many markets, people willing to switch plans could experience significant savings on their premiums. A government analysis, which looked at all the plans people currently hold, found that more than 80 percent of federal marketplace shoppers could find a better deal if they were willing to switch. And a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation published Wednesday estimated that renewers in the kind of plan we looked at would benefit from switching in 73 percent of counties.\n\nAnd some of the 2016 plans that are considered renewals really aren\u2019t identical to their 2015 counterparts; they may have subtle changes in what customers have to pay for or what services are covered. The government\u2019s website for the marketplaces in most states, HealthCare.gov, is set up to provide more information about the differences between plans this year.\n\nOf course, switching insurance plans may mean even bigger changes. Different plans may have different structures of deductibles and other out-of-pocket payments. They may also mean switching to new doctors or other caregivers. My colleague Abby Goodnough has written about some Obamacare shoppers who are planning to switch plans for the third time this year. Many have found the shifts disorienting, even as they welcome new choices that didn\u2019t exist before the Obamacare market existed.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151118120549, "twitter": {"description": "Widespread cancellations of health plans reflect continuing shifts in a health insurance market that has existed in this form only since 2014.", "title": "In Many Obamacare Markets, Renewal Is Not an Option", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/upshot/in-many-obamacare-markets-renewal-is-not-an-option.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004042828"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/01/upshot/01up-rates-map-1443623781465/01up-rates-map-1443623781465-thumbLarge.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/upshot/in-many-obamacare-markets-renewal-is-not-an-option.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004042828", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/upshot/in-many-obamacare-markets-renewal-is-not-an-option.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 18, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "McKinsey Center for US Health System Reform", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),HealthCare.gov,McKinsey Center for US Health System Reform", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Amanda Cox and Margot Sanger-Katz", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/01/upshot/01up-rates-map-1443623781465/01up-rates-map-1443623781465-thumbLarge.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By AMANDA COX and MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Widespread cancellations of health plans reflect continuing shifts in a health insurance market that has existed in this form only since 2014.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/01/upshot/01up-rates-map-1443623781465/01up-rates-map-1443623781465-thumbStandard.png", "description": "Widespread cancellations of health plans reflect continuing shifts in a health insurance market that has existed in this form only since 2014.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-11-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "McKinsey Center for US Health System Reform", "published": "2015-11-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "19up-switch", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151118120549, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/upshot/in-many-obamacare-markets-renewal-is-not-an-option.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/01/upshot/01up-rates-map-1443623781465/01up-rates-map-1443623781465-facebookJumbo.png", "type": "article", "description": "Widespread cancellations of health plans reflect continuing shifts in a health insurance market that has existed in this form only since 2014.", "title": "In Many Obamacare Markets, Renewal Is Not an Option"}, "pdate": 20151118, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000004042828, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "In Many Obamacare Markets, Renewal Is Not an Option", "col": "Change of Plan", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The McKinsey analysis finds that, in many markets, people willing to switch plans could experience significant savings on their premiums.\nMy colleague Abby Goodnough has written about some Obamacare shoppers who are planning to switch plans for the third time this year.\nOf course, switching insurance plans may mean even bigger changes.\nThe widespread cancellations reflect continuing shifts in the new health insurance markets, which sprang into being in 2014.\nMany have found the shifts disorienting, even as they welcome new choices that didn\u2019t exist before the Obamacare market existed."}
