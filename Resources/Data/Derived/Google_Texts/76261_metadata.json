The Fault in Our Stars (Fox): $48.2 million in 3,193 theaters.\n\nA romantic tear-jerker about two teenage cancer patients who fall in love. An audience that was 82 percent female. A marketing masterstroke mixed with some good acting, some very strong critics reviews, some raving audience feedback. That's how you get to number one on a $12 million budget. Check out our interview with writer John Green for some real insights on the project.\n\n2. Maleficent (Buena Vista): $33.5 million in 3,948 theaters.\n\nMaleficent took a tumble in its sophmore frame, but managed to hold onto the number two spot despite some less-than-encouraging reviews. Nevertheless, the rule should hold: Put Angelina Jolie in the spotlight, add some special effects, and that'll probably be enough to carry you through.\n\n3. Edge of Tomorrow (Warner Brothers): $29.1 million in 3,490 theaters.\n\nPoor Tom Cruise. Despite some pretty rave reviews, Edge of Tomorrow (as we predicted) is proving to be a movie beloved by a limited cinema-going audience. While the sci-fi flick performed well overseas, bringing it within striking distance of its $180 million budget, it failed to garner hype here. Maybe some strong word-of-mouth will keep this one on the list for a few more weeks.\n\n4. X-Men: Days of Future Past (Fox): $14.7 million in 3,639 theaters.\n\nYes, this movie is making a boatload of money overseas, but in just three weeks, the latest in this Marvel franchise has gone from about $91 million to just under $15 million at home. Given the strong reviews, this seems like a symptom of franchise fatigue.\n\n5. A Million Ways to Die in the West (Universal): $7.2 million in 3,160 theaters.\n\nCritics hated it. Audiences luke-warmed it. And after one meek Week One opening, Seth MacFarlane's Western comedy homage stumbled by half to the bottom of the top. This is already looking like a forgettable blip in MacFarlane's career, right next to his turn as Oscar host.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welcome to the Box Office Report where America and Tom Cruise both need a tissue.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "Welcome to the Box Office Report where America and Tom Cruise both need a tissue.", "title": "'The Fault in Our Stars' Rises at Box Office; Tom Cruise Stalls", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/06/08/Screen_Shot_2014_06_08_at_12.34.58_PM/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/06/the-fault-in-our-stars-rises-at-box-office-tom-cruise-stalls/372389/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Welcome to the Box Office Report where America and Tom Cruise both need a tissue.", "creator": "@allmychandler", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/06/08/Screen_Shot_2014_06_08_at_12.34.58_PM/lead_large.png", "title": "'The Fault in Our Stars' Rises at Box Office; Tom Cruise Stalls", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0c1\"", "article_summary": "Welcome to the Box Office Report where America and Tom Cruise both need a tissue.\nGiven the strong reviews, this seems like a symptom of franchise fatigue.\nA marketing masterstroke mixed with some good acting, some very strong critics reviews, some raving audience feedback.\nThe Fault in Our Stars (Fox): $48.2 million in 3,193 theaters.\nThis is already looking like a forgettable blip in MacFarlane's career, right next to his turn as Oscar host."}
