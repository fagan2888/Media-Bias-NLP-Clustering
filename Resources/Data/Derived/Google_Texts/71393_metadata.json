(Published Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2015)\n\nIt's been a wave of stress for some 7,000 Affordable Care Act customers in Connecticut lately, who have found out the hard way that they don't have coverage.\n\n\"If I'm at the doctor \u2013 especially if I'm there for a visit because I'm sick \u2013 and all of a sudden I find out I don't have health care coverage, it's a very stressful time,\" Access Health CT Chief Executive Officer Jim Wadleigh said Wednesday, commiserating with those affected.\n\nThe problem, he says, is many people missed the 90-day window to prove citizenship and income after open enrollment expired at the end of February.\n\n\"So an example could be a pay stub; an example could be a passport, your driver's license,\" Wadleigh explained. \"They are at risk of losing their health care coverage, and that's really the message that we have gone out with over the last few days.\"\n\nWadleigh says the lapses have come despite Access Health sending out as many as five notices to customers.\n\n\"And what we are seeing is, one of the questions we asked are, 'Do you open your mail from Access Health?' and a very large percentage of them do not,\" he said.\n\nDespite months passing since the deadline, Access Health is making automated callouts to tardy customers and hiring extra staff to clear up the backlog. The agency is also working with the Department of Social Services to enhance and streamline communication.\n\nCustomers are being allowed the chance to correct the problem, but for a very limited time, and on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"A customer is not out of luck,\" said Wadleigh. \"They can call us, they can send their information in, and we will work with the carriers to get them reinstated.\"\n\nTo reach Access Health CT for assistance or information, call 855-805-4325.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been a wave of stress for some 7,000 Affordable Care Act customers in Connecticut lately, who have found out the hard way that they don't have coverage.", "title": "7,000 Access Health CT Customers at Risk of Losing Coverage", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Connecticut", "description": "It's been a wave of stress for some 7,000 Affordable Care Act customers in Connecticut lately, who have found out the hard way that they don't have coverage.", "title": "7,000 at Risk of Losing Access Health CT Coverage", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Access-Health-CT-Health-Care-Coverage-Late-7000-322327741.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*675/access+health+ct+sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's been a wave of stress for some 7,000 Affordable Care Act customers in Connecticut lately, who have found out the hard way that they don't have coverage.", "title": "7,000 at Risk of Losing Access Health CT Coverage", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Access-Health-CT-Health-Care-Coverage-Late-7000-322327741.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*675/access+health+ct+sign.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcconnecticut", "site": "@nbcconnecticut", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 81242742459}, "keywords": "local news, connecticut news, ct   news, breaking news, new haven news, hartford news, westport news", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCConnecticut"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf130\"", "article_summary": "Some 7,000 Access Health CT customers are at risk of losing their health care coverage.\nTo reach Access Health CT for assistance or information, call 855-805-4325.\n\"They are at risk of losing their health care coverage, and that's really the message that we have gone out with over the last few days.\"\n\"And what we are seeing is, one of the questions we asked are, 'Do you open your mail from Access Health?'\nWadleigh says the lapses have come despite Access Health sending out as many as five notices to customers."}
