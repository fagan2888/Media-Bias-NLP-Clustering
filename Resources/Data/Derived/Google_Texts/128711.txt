After a several year absence, Boy Scouts of America will be returning to the city of New Brunswick. Youth organizations and nonprofits go through tough cycles and the Central New Jersey Council was struggling,” said Grant Van Eck, senior district executive of Boy Scouts of America. “The city’s scouting program slowly faded away.”

Today, there are three Boy Scout troops in the city: Troops 1212 and 135 for boys aged 11-17 and a Cub Scout Pack for boys aged 6-10. All three have an approximate number of 25 boys each.

“Thanks to St. Peter’s Hospital, through Garrick Stoldt, we met with religious leaders who were interested in starting troops. Monsignor Joseph Kerrigan of Holy Family Parish started Pack and Troop 1212. Deacon Sinclair Bishop of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens started Troop 135.”

The future plans for the Scouts is to “meet regularly and follow the advancement program of scouting, (including) over 130 merit badges where boys learn with an adult mentor about hobbies, sports, crafts, science, trades, business, citizenship and future careers.” Van Eck also mentioned the Liberty Jamboree next Oct. 2-5 at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, where Scouts will help build a home, shoot bow and arrows, and zip line among other activities.

“For over a century, the Boy Scouts of America has helped build the future leaders of this country by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. The BSA believes — and, through over a century of experience, knows — that helping youth is a key to building a more conscientious, responsible and productive society.”
