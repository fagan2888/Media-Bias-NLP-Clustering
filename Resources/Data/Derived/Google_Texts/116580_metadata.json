At this late stage in the year, employers must find what they need soon enough to get ready ASAP. Affordable Care Act compliance is serious business.\n\nIntegrity Data, a payroll and human resources software company that has developed Affordable Care Act (ACA) reporting systems, announces publication of an e-book for U.S. businesses that have yet to prepare for the inaugural filing season of ACA returns.\n\n\u201cThe new forms that some employees must have in their hands at the same time they get their W-2s are the most detailed returns ever required. Yet many employers who must produce these forms and then file copies with the IRS, still don\u2019t know their first deadline is February 1. Nor what to do for it,\u201d says Helen Karakoudas, ACA Education Director at Integrity Data. \"In plain English that's a 4-minute read, we break down the rules and how to avoid missteps.\"\n\nThe publication is titled \"Affordable Care Act: Employer Essentials for IRS Reporting.\"\n\nTo simplify Affordable Care Act compliance, Integrity Data covers in seven quick-to-follow pages what needs to be done, the possible challenges, and how significant the financial consequences can be for not complying with federal requirements to report \u2013 in monthly detail \u2013 what, if any, health insurance a business offers. Information is presented in a range of engaging ways, including links that lead to such extras as a quiz, cartoons and a decision-tree flowchart.\n\nAmong Integrity Data\u2019s affiliates, the presentation \u2013 and its timing \u2013 are much appreciated.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 question we get from our clients now is \u2018Do we have to do anything around the ACA?\u2019 This e-book is a great, easy-to-understand resource for us to turn to. When we have a client who can\u2019t focus on one thing for more than a few seconds, we direct them to the link for the flowchart. Guaranteed to get their attention long enough to answer \u2018What do I need to do to be compliant?\u2019\u201d said Donna Krizik Parsons, Director of Marketing at Crestwood Associates, a firm in Mount Prospect, Ill. that ranks among the top 100 resellers of accounting software in 2015.\n\n\u201cAt this late stage in the year, employers must find what they need soon enough to get ready ASAP.
