Only it\u2019s not in the form of the traditional four-door sedans that have long filled the lanes of the country\u2019s roadways.\n\nFor the first time, new registrations of SUVs and crossovers through the first five months of the year have surpassed those of sedans, by a margin of 36.5 percent to 35.4 percent.\n\nRelated: The 10 Safest Small Cars and SUVs in America\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big surprise,\u201d Consumer Reports\u2019 Senior Automotive Engineer Tom Mutchler said of the IHS findings. \u201cYou\u2019ve had SUVs over the last couple of years becoming more and more car-like. Better to drive, safer. They\u2019ve improved fuel economy. It\u2019s gotten to the point where a small SUV is very much a replacement for a Honda Accord or a Toyota Camry.\u201d\n\nIHS analyst Tom Libby said he expects SUVs and crossovers to own the market in the near term as Honda, Jeep and Chrysler are about to release updated crossover models. In the long term, IHS forecasters say, it\u2019s unclear if SUVs and crossovers will hold their lead because of gas price concerns and challenges in hybrid power train availability for those models.\n\nFive years ago, sedans held a 36.3 percent share of the retail market, while SUVs and crossovers had a 31.4 percent share. Since then, hatchbacks, pickup trucks, coupes, minivans and convertibles have all lost market share as SUVs and crossovers increased in popularity.\n\nRelated: 10 U.S. Cities with the Worst Traffic\n\nMutchler explained that early SUVs were \u201cbasically pickup trucks with a squared off cargo space in the back. They sat up high but were fairly narrow in the back, heavy and more prone to roll over.\u201d Now, their improvements \u2014 including higher seating, ground clearance, interior space, towing capacity and all-wheel drive \u2014 are attractive, especially to certain drivers.\n\n\u201cSmaller, mid-size SUVs are great for an aging population,\u201d Mutchler said. \u201cThey are easy to get in and out of. You\u2019re at a chair height. Well-designed SUVs, like the Subaru Forrester, have terrific visibility. It\u2019s like sitting inside of a fishbowl. They\u2019re easy to maneuver and park.\u201d\n\nLibby said the trend toward SUVs and crossovers shows how important it is for carmakers to have competitive entries in these segments in order to grow sales. \u201cIt also says that in general, the differentiation between cars and light trucks is really going away,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s really not appropriate to speak about cars and trucks because of the crossover concept, which has grown so much and is a combination of the two.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For the first time, new registrations of SUVs and crossovers through the first five months of the year have surpassed those of sedans, by a margin of 36.5 percent to 35.4 percent.", "title": "Americans\u2019 Favorite Cars Are No Longer Sedans", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/21/Americans-Favorite-Cars-Are-No-Longer-Sedans", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/12052012_reliablecars_subaruforester.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/21/Americans-Favorite-Cars-Are-No-Longer-Sedans", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/12052012_reliablecars_subaruforester.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "For the first time, new registrations of SUVs and crossovers through the first five months of the year have surpassed those of sedans, by a margin of 36.5 percent to 35.4 percent.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd803e\"", "article_summary": "Five years ago, sedans held a 36.3 percent share of the retail market, while SUVs and crossovers had a 31.4 percent share.\nSince then, hatchbacks, pickup trucks, coupes, minivans and convertibles have all lost market share as SUVs and crossovers increased in popularity.\n\u201cIt also says that in general, the differentiation between cars and light trucks is really going away,\u201d he added.\nThe American love affair with cars is still going strong, as an analysis of new vehicle registrations by IHS Automotive shows.\nOnly it\u2019s not in the form of the traditional four-door sedans that have long filled the lanes of the country\u2019s roadways."}
