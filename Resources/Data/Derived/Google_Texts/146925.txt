JACKIE Gillies felt like the new girl at school when she joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Melbourne.

The Australian take on the hugely- successful US Real Housewives reality franchise had searched Melbourne for rich and powerful women, established on the city’s social circuit.

REAL HOUSEWIVES OF MELBOURNE CAST GET THEIR CLAWS OUT

POLL: REAL HOUSEWIVES AGAINST FAT TONY AND DOWNTON ABBEY

GINA LIANO ON HER REAL HOUSEWIVES CAST MEMBERS

Gillies, wife of Silverchair drummer Ben Gillies was certainly rich, but new to Melbourne, and nobody on the social scene.

But the brash, opinionated Gillies had a secret weapon. As a professional psychic, there was a chance she’d see the curve balls coming.

Here, Gillies shares what she knew, and learned, about her fellow Real Housewives of Melbourne:

Her big prediction? “This show is off the hook”.

GINA LIANO — BIG-HAIRED BARRISTER

“My first thought was: ‘Wow, Las Vegas s#@t’,” says Gillies of the barrister who boasts she hones her arm muscles backcombing her hair. “She’s very bling, bling. I love bling bling.

“Gina has this great talent for moving on. We have this rocky relationship where we get really cut with each other, but the next day we’re having a laugh.”

ANDREA MOSS — BOTOX IS HER BUSINESS

“My initial feeling was Andrea was conservative and cliquey,” says Gillies of the plastic surgery devotee who ‘lives in Toorak, shops in Toorak and works in Toorak’ — Melbourne’s snobbiest suburb. But Gillies discovered that Moss and her plastic surgeon husband — as well as running a hugely successful beauty and plastic surgery business — are ‘the most generous people you have ever met’.

CHYKA KEEBAUGH — BIG BUSINESS, SERIOUS CLOUT

Gillies’ gut feeling that here was a woman who had it all together was spot on. “Chyka is the mother hen, the peacemaker, you can go to her for advice,” Gillies says. “She started a business from scratch, and she just gets it. There’s nothing to prove. Everyone calls her Switzerland, but she’s not a fence-sitter. She just prefers not to get caught up in all the bulls@#t.”

LYDIA SHIAVELLO — THE (PRIVATE JET) FLYING FLYING MUM

“I felt she would be posh, saucy and a bit snobby,” says Gillies of the interior design student woman who heads up a ‘Brady Bunch’ blended family. But she discovered despite the Porsche Carrera, the snow house in Thredbo, the exotic holidays, fast jet, fast car and fast husband, Lydia is ‘one of the most down-to-earth women you will meet’. “She’s also as very sensitive.”

JACKIE GILLIES — PSYCHIC MRS SILVERCHAIR

“I am able to see people’s past, present and future and read people,” says Gillies. “The universe will always guide you, but so many people will not damn listen. I don’t want to say I’ve been given a gift, because I think every human is a bit psychic, but mine is clearer. There are people that don’t believe and it’s not my job to convince them. I wouldn’t have done a show that was scripted. First, I’m no actor. Second, you have to keep it real.”

JANET ROACH — POWERHOSUE PROPERTY DEVELOPER

“I met her and it was like ‘this is my soul sister from a past life’, I felt a strong connection, says Gillies of Roach, successful property developer, who is newly-single, and never washes her own hair. “I love her to death. It’s almost like Thelma and Louise. I have learned with all these ladies that no matter how much money you have, at the end of the day, we all have the same problems.”
