Instead, Shanahan says, the seasons that both young quarterbacks are having are exactly what should be expected for young quarterbacks who didn\u2019t come out of a pro-style offense in college.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Robert or if you\u2019re talking about a guy like Kaepernick, everybody comes from different [college] systems and when you go to the National Football League and you\u2019re working with a drop-back passing game and you haven\u2019t done a lot of that, it takes some repetition,\u201d Shanahan said in a conference call with Bay Area reporters. \u201cWhoever has been in those shoes realizes that it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It takes practice, it takes repetition, going against different coverages, understanding the strength and weaknesses and just becoming more comfortable in passing situations.\u201d\n\nShanahan said the key to Griffin and Kaepernick getting better is living and breathing football.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the process of the NFL quarterback that it is hard, the amount of hours that you have to spend studying film, going through your progressions, studying defenses,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s 24 hours a day, not only during the season but the offseason, to get to that elite level. Everybody is going to have a year or two that is better than the other, but for that consistency, you need a guy that loves football, loves studying because there\u2019s so many different parts. That\u2019s one of the reasons I think it\u2019s the hardest position in sports to play.\u201d\n\nIf Griffin and Kaepernick hadn\u2019t had such spectacular seasons last year, the way they\u2019re playing this year wouldn\u2019t feel so disappointing. But the reality is neither quarterback is as good now as he was a year ago. Not only have they not become pocket passers overnight, but they even appear to have regressed. That has to be a concern to their coaches, even if Shanahan isn\u2019t ready to sound the alarm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Washington faces San Francisco on Monday night, we'll see the two quarterbacks whose ability to run the read-option offense took the NFL by storm in 2012.
