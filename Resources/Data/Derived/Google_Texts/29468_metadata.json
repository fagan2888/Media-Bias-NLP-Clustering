The debate also addressed how the similarities and difference between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders\u2019 platforms.\n\nAUSFB was represented by Zoey Salsbury, a sophomore in the School of Communication, and AUSFH was represented by Sam Phelan, a freshman also in SOC. The debate was moderated by Kate Magill, Managing Editor of the Eagle and a junior in SOC and SPA.\n\nMagill asked both debaters 10 questions, and for each one, the debaters had two minutes to respond. Then, each debater would have the opportunity to deliver a two minute rebuttal. Later on, the audience had the opportunity to ask questions, and this structure was still used.\n\nDuring the debate, Magill asked questions on topics such as healthcare reform, which showcased the differences between Sanders\u2019 proposal for universal healthcare and Clinton\u2019s enlargement of the Affordable Care Act, Sander\u2019s free public and community college stance versus Clinton\u2019s debt free college initiative and Sander\u2019s pacifist foreign policy ideas versus Clinton\u2019s experience as Secretary of State.\n\nPhelan spoke first, talking about Clinton\u2019s history as Secretary of State and arguing that Clinton held \u201cunprecedented foreign policy experience\u201d compared to other candidates.\n\n\u201cShe traveled almost a million miles and 112 countries as Secretary of State, more than any other secretary, proving her devotion to her country,\u201d Phelan said.\n\nSalsbury followed, emphasizing that she sees Sanders as a strong representative of the American people because he understands the concerns of the nation and built his platform around solving specific social and economic issues.\n\n\u201cAmericans understand that our country faces an unprecedented number of crises, they understand that virtually all new income and wealth have gone to the top percent, they understand the middle class is working for lower wages, they understand we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, they understand a high school diploma is now equivalent of a college diploma, they understand that we have a corrupt campaign finance system and they understand that we need to find ways to move toward sustainable energy. Bernie Sanders understand these crises as well,\u201d Salsbury said.\n\nThe debate highlighted controversial and divisive issues between the two candidates, such as Sanders\u2019s middle-ground views on gun rights. Sanders\u2019 political record indicates that he voted against the Brady Bill, and his view contradicts Clinton\u2019s stance, which calls for stricter control.\n\n\u201cThat, to me, is crucial; gun rights, he has a terrible, terrible record on it, and if we\u2019re going to talk about it... let\u2019s talk about the fact some of his earliest elections were helped by the NRA,\u201d Phelan said.\n\nAnother topic was Clinton\u2019s changing position on gay rights from her previous stance that marriage is between a man and a woman to now supporting the LGBTQ+ community. Sanders, in contrast, has shown long-term support of the group.\n\n\u201cHe has been there for the LGBT community forever,\u201d Salsbury said. \u201cHe has never said marriage is between a man and a woman, like Clinton did and, as someone who is part of the LGBT community, I think he absolutely defends and stands for the community far more than potential president Clinton ever has.\u201d\n\nHowever, the debate also highlighted some of the issues that Sanders and Clinton agree on, such as the need to take steps to stop climate change.\n\nThe debate was held to educate students on the candidates on the issues they stand for, according to Salsbury.\n\n\u201cEspecially on AU\u2019s campus, it\u2019s very popular the idea that everyone\u2019s decided for who they\u2019re voting for five years before the election and so I think it\u2019s important that undecided voters and people who aren\u2019t totally sure have a space to come and learn more about the candidates.\u201d Salsbury said.\n\nPhelan agreed, and said that since AU has so many supporters for Sanders, it\u2019s crucial to shed light on what Clinton stands for.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a lot of Bernie people at the school but I think it\u2019s super important to show people that there\u2019s another progressive out there that\u2019s wanting to fight for them and so whoever the Democratic nominee is, people know what they both stand for and how to get involved.\u201d Phelan said.\n\nThe moderator of the debate, Kate Magill, is the Managing Editor of News at The Eagle.\n\nnews@theeagleonline.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.getsnworks.com/ame-egl/20160325Xyx9d4awdb/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "Representatives of AU Students for Bernie and AU Students for Hillary ironed out their candidate's stances on the issues and educated the audience as a result", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.theeagleonline.com/article/2016/02/au-dems-debate-hillary-vs-bernie", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.egl.ame/6226_dsc_2772f.JPG", "site_name": "The Eagle", "description": "Representatives of AU Students for Bernie and AU Students for Hillary ironed out their candidate's stances on the issues and educated the audience as a result", "title": "AU College Democrats hosts Sanders vs. Clinton debate"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thesnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TheEagle", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.getsnworks.com/ame-egl/20160325Xyx9d4awdb/dist/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "TheEagle", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The debate also addressed how the similarities and difference between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders\u2019 platforms.\nThe AU College Democrats, AU Students for Bernie and AU Students for Hillary hosted a town hall debate on Feb. 23 in an effort to identify the most important issues for students in the 2016 election.\nPhelan agreed, and said that since AU has so many supporters for Sanders, it\u2019s crucial to shed light on what Clinton stands for.\nBernie Sanders understand these crises as well,\u201d Salsbury said.\nThe debate was moderated by Kate Magill, Managing Editor of the Eagle and a junior in SOC and SPA."}
