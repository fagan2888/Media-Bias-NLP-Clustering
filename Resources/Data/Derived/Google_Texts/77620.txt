People were flocking to area lakes to enjoy the last major holiday before autumn and winter set in.

Cheney Lake was busy with boats, jet skies, swimmers and campers.

"Lake season is over. Camping is done," said Michelle Conley.

Conley and her fiance were at the lake enjoying a ride on their jet ski.

Labor day is often considered the unofficial start of fall; many of the people at the lake offered their distaste for wintertime activities, like shoveling snow, warming up their cars and being forced to wear warm clothing.
