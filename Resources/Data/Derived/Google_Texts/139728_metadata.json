(Adriana Fehrs photo) PABLO \u2014 Ryan Zinke, the Republican congressman-elect for Montana\u2019s at-large congressional district, made his first visit to CSKT at the Tribal Council Chambers Tuesday of last week. Zinke says it\u2019s his way of reaching out to the areas where he received low votes. \u201cI have great respect for Indian country and Indian nations. I want to honor my campaign pledge, and I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time in Indian country, and I want to correct that,\u201d says Zinke in his opening statement to the Tribal Council. During his meeting, Zinke says that he is aware of which areas of Montana voted for him, the Flathead Indian Reservation not being one of them, and is taking the time to visit the areas where he did not receive a significant amount of votes. He says it\u2019s his way of letting those people know that he will still represent them during his time in Congress.

Zinke also hopes to build a close relationship with CSKT - one where the tribes can communicate their issues and concerns with him. St. Ignatius Tribal Council Representative Patty Stevens responded by saying, \u201cI hear you say that you don\u2019t know a lot about the native American issues, so we will probably disagree on a lot things, and that\u2019s okay, but allow us to provide you with information and education when you are making decisions.\u201d After Zinke concluded his remarks, the Tribal Council shared their opinions and concerns with the congressman. Tribal Council Vice-President Carole Lankford asked Zinke about his stance on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), A.K.A. Obamacare. Zinke gave a short response. \u201cObamacare is a sinking boat, and we need a lifeboat, something better after Obamacare fails. I think we can develop a better system. At the end of the day, you\u2019re going to subsidize healthcare.\u201d Dixon Tribal Council Representative Terry Pitts (C), thanks Ryan Zinke, Montana\u2019s Republican congressman-elect, for meeting with the Tribal Council on Tuesday, December 2.

(Adriana Fehrs photo) Anna Whiting-Sorrell, Tribal Health and Human Services Director of Operations, Planning and Policy, said to Zinke that the ACA has given many tribal members the opportunity to purchase insurance for the first time in their lives. Next, Arlee Tribal Council Representative Shelly Fyant shared her concerns about eliminating Obamacare and the Keystone XL pipeline. Fyant told Zinke that the average tribal member have Indian Health Service (IHS) as their primary insurance, which is, on a per-capita basis, funded less than state prisoners. Fyant then shared her concerns about the Keystone XL pipeline\u2019s effect on clean water. \u201cThe Keystone pipeline doesn\u2019t directly affect our reservation, but it still affects the Fort Peck reservation, the Rosebud Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, and the Ogallala aquifer which is in the center of the U.S. Clean water is our lifeblood.\u201d She says the tribes recently passed a resolution to oppose the pipeline.

(Adriana Fehrs photo) Zinke responded by saying that he is a proponent of the keystone pipeline, but he agrees with Fyant that Montana\u2019s waters are crucial for life. On a separate note, Zinke informed the Tribal Council of his support of the CSKT water compact. He says he hopes the information in the water compact will persuade people to think rationally about their stance on the settlement, rather than feel with emotion, which he feels that most people are doing. Carolee Wenderoth, CSKT Lands Department, updated the congressman on the Cobell Land Buy Back Program. Wenderoth says in mid-December, the Cobell Land Buy Back Program Manager and his staff will be visiting CSKT to discuss extending the cooperative agreement, which ends at the end of December. She says the Tribes are asking for an extension in order to gain additional funding to make more appraisals and offers on fractionated lands on the reservation.

(Adriana Fehrs photo) Wenderoth says the program allocated $7.3 million to 41 tracts of land, but the land appraisals were about $15 million, and the Polson area was the only section of the reservation to receive appraisals. \u201cIn only one-fourth of the reservation were we able to payout fractionated landowners. If we want to carry out the land buy back for the whole reservation, we need additional funding, which as of right now, we are not sure where that will come from; it might take a policy change to move aside more money.\u201d Zinke concluded the meeting with a few positive words. \u201cThank you. I want to be a friend. At the end of the day, we are Americans and Montanans first, and I believe we can always work out our issues. I look forward to coming back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"targetted-browsers": "NS4.0 NS6 IE4.0 IE5", "window-location": "{ -30 -4 824 1160 }", "description": "Congressman-elect makes first visit to gain support", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "title": "Ryan Zinke visits CSKT Council"}, "article_summary": "Ryan Zinke visits CSKT Council By Adriana Fehrs Ryan Zinke (C), Montana\u2019s Republican congressman-elect, sits with his Campaign Manager Alan Mikkelsen (R), and listens to concerns and comments from the Tribal Council and several CSKT employees.\nRyan Zinke (L), Montana\u2019s Republican congressman-elect, poses for a picture with Tribal Council Chairman Ron Trahan (R), during his meet-and-greet with the Tribal Council last week.\n(Adriana Fehrs photo) Dixon Tribal Council Representative Terry Pitts (C), thanks Ryan Zinke, Montana\u2019s Republican congressman-elect, for meeting with the Tribal Council on Tuesday, December 2.\nRyan Zinke (R), Montana\u2019s Republican congressman-elect, sat before the Tribal Council last week as a part of an outreach effort.\n(Adriana Fehrs photo) Ryan Zinke (L), Montana\u2019s Republican congressman-elect, poses for a picture with Tribal Council Chairman Ron Trahan (R), during his meet-and-greet with the Tribal Council last week."}
