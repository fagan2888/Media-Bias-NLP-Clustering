She starred in productions ranging from William Inge\u2019s 1955 play Bus Stop and No\u00ed\u00abl Coward\u2019s 1961 musical Sail Away to the 1994 revival of the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II musical Show Boat and the 2010 version of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s A Little Night Music. But it was \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a song from another Sondheim play, Follies, that she turned into what some call her personal anthem. Here she is, performing it at the White House a few years ago.\n\nHere are some facts about Stritch and her life.\n\nThe daughter of a B.F. Goodrich executive and his wife, she reportedly was introduced to show business at age 4, when her father took her backstage to meet a comedian from The Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nAfter she graduated from high school, her parents allowed her to move to New York to become an actress \u2013 but only if she agreed to live in a convent while she was there.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut in a 1947 musical revue, Angel in the Wings.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nShe was in the running for the role of Trixie Norton on the classic TV show \u201cThe Honeymooners\u201d but lost out to Joyce Randolph because Jackie Gleason thought her personality was too similar to his.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, she was cast in Allen\u2019s September as a replacement for the ailing Maureen Sullivan, and gave such an impressive performance that she again was in demand in Hollywood.\n\nHer autobiographical stage show, Elaine Stritch at Liberty, in which she talked candidly about her love life and battles with the bottle, was made into a 2004 HBO special that won her another Emmy. Here\u2019s a clip in which she reminisces about her acting school classmate Marlon Brando.\n\nPhoto: Stritch in 2009 by Greg Hernandez via Wikipedia\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Actress-singer Elaine Stritch,\u00a0who died on July 17 at age 89 in Birmingham, Mich., wasn\u2019t the sort who would go gentle into that good night \u2013 or any night, for that matter.
