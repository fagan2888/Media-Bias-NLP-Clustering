Chris Christie\u2019s (R) defense over allegations of political corruption in what came to be known as the \u201cBridgegate\u201d probe.\n\nThe New Jersey state attorney general released the documents on Friday, revealing the fees from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, the firm Gov. Christie retained for his defense against charges of political corruption for the temporary shutting down of the George Washington Bridge near Fort Lee, New Jersey in September of 2013.\n\nThis final tally is less than it might have been. Earlier this year the law firm agreed to lower its fee from $650 per hour to $350.\n\nIn May, Gibson Dunn attorney Alexander Southwell said the fees the firm charged were \u201cbarely half the amount\u201d they would normally have charged.\n\nIn March of this year, though, Christie was cleared of charges of corruption in the scandal.\n\nSome of the $6.5 million paid to the law firm included services rendered in 2013, when the firm represented Christie when he attempted to overturn a federal ban on sports gambling.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter: @warnerthuston.
