I was definitely not planning on having a baby today, but I guess he's making the rules,\" she said.\n\nMaverick Daniel was the first Christmas day baby born at Gulf Coast Medical Center.\n\nParker said, \"We got here at like three and he was born at 5:52. He came really fast; I guess he was in a hurry.\"\n\nBaby Maverick was originally expected to make his debut to the world on New Years Eve.\n\nThe father says Maverick is the best present he could ask for.\n\n\"We were expecting to have dinner with the family and the other kids, but he decided to come on out I guess,\" said Trystan Summers, dad. \"We were expecting a New Years Baby. We weren't expecting him to be on Christmas day. We got us a present for sure.\"\n\nThe healthy baby boy weighs 7 lbs 13 ounces and is 19 inches long.\n\n\"From the sonograms and everything I was expecting him to be chubby, but he's not as big as I thought. He's healthy for sure,\" Summers said.\n\nParker will be discharged from the medical center Thursday morning.\n\nThe hospital's second Christmas baby was born about 5 hours after Maverick.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "While some people were up early Wednesday morning unwrapping gifts under the Christmas tree, a local couple was welcoming a new addition to their family this Christmas morning.", "language": "english", "author": "Morgan Kyrklund", "og": {"description": "While some people were up early Wednesday morning unwrapping gifts under the Christmas tree, a local couple was welcoming a new addition to their family this Christmas morning.", "title": "Gulf Coast Medical Center Welcomes First Christmas Baby", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Gulf-Coast-Medical-Center-Welcomes-First-Christmas-Baby-237260651.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/F66/B55/F66B55EE2BDE49999F9BB5FBBA269435", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/51C/D94/51CD94F59E0D49CDA406A51B24457B1D.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "While some people were up early Wednesday morning unwrapping gifts under the Christmas tree, a local couple was welcoming a new addition to their family this Christmas morning.", "title": "Gulf Coast Medical Center Welcomes First Christmas Baby", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Gulf-Coast-Medical-Center-Welcomes-First-Christmas-Baby-237260651.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/baby104.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Gulf Coast Medical Center Welcomes First Christmas Baby", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gulf Coast Medical Center Welcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc221\"", "article_summary": "Maverick Daniel was the first Christmas day baby born at Gulf Coast Medical Center.\nBaby Maverick was originally expected to make his debut to the world on New Years Eve.\nI was definitely not planning on having a baby today, but I guess he's making the rules,\" she said.\nThe hospital's second Christmas baby was born about 5 hours after Maverick.\nHowever, those plans were put on hold when her baby son decided to make a grand entrance instead."}
