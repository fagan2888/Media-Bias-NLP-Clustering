A 17-year-old Indian teen and his family came from a village to Mumabi's JJ Hospital's dental department to get his teeth extracted, specifically 232 teeth.\n\nAshik Gavai, who suffers from complex composite odontoma, underwent a seven-hour surgery to remove all of the \u201csmall white pearls,\u201d which dentists have acknowledged as \u201ca world record.\u201d Gavai had been suffering for 18 months and traveled to Mumbai after local doctors failed to identify the cause of the problem. It was in Mumbai, where Dr. Sunanda Dhiware, head of Mumabi's JJ Hospital's dental department, where the teen was formally diagnosed. \"Ashik's malaise was diagnosed as a complex composite odontoma where a single gum forms lots of teeth. It's a sort of benign tumor,\" she told BBC.\n\nThe teen\u2019s lesion typically takes place because the dental components are laid down in a disorganized manner, due to failure of normal morphodifferentiation, according to the National Academy of Dentistry in India. The odomntomas, or the malformations of the dental tissues, may interfere with the eruption of the associated tooth. Surgery is necessary to prevent the further growth of teeth deep in the jaw area.\n\nSuresh Gavai, Ashik\u2019s father, told the Mumbai Mirror his son complained of severe pain a month ago. \"I was worried that it may turn out to be cancer so I brought him to Mumbai,\" he said. However, doctors found the tumor found deep in the lower jaw was benign. Dhiware said she had \"not seen anything like this before in [her] 30-year career,\u201d but she was \u201cthrilled to get such an exciting case.\u201d\n\nAshik now has 28 teeth after the surgery conducted on Monday, which involved two surgeons and two assistants.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ashik gavai, indian teen, chew on this, world record, complex composite ondontoma, dental health, dental work, dentist", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ashik Gavai, an Indian teen with a benign tumor in his lower jaw, made the world record for getting 232 teeth extracted in a seven-hour operation.", "title": "Indian Teen Gets 232 Teeth Extracted [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chew-dentists-extract-232-teeth-world-record-indian-teen-odontoma-294634", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/indian-teen-gets-232-teeth-extracted.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ashik Gavai, an Indian teen with a benign tumor in his lower jaw, made the world record for getting 232 teeth extracted in a seven-hour operation.", "title": "Indian Teen Gets 232 Teeth Extracted [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chew-dentists-extract-232-teeth-world-record-indian-teen-odontoma-294634", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/indian-teen-gets-232-teeth-extracted.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/23/indian-teen-gets-232-teeth-extracted.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-23T17:46:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-24T10:20:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ashik Gavai, an Indian teen with a benign tumor in his lower jaw, made the world record for getting 232 teeth extracted in a seven-hour operation."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd2c\"", "article_summary": "A 17-year-old Indian teen and his family came from a village to Mumabi's JJ Hospital's dental department to get his teeth extracted, specifically 232 teeth.\nIt was in Mumbai, where Dr. Sunanda Dhiware, head of Mumabi's JJ Hospital's dental department, where the teen was formally diagnosed.\n\"Ashik's malaise was diagnosed as a complex composite odontoma where a single gum forms lots of teeth.\nSuresh Gavai, Ashik\u2019s father, told the Mumbai Mirror his son complained of severe pain a month ago.\nSurgery is necessary to prevent the further growth of teeth deep in the jaw area."}
