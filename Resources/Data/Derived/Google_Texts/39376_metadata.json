There are several significant objectives of the Open Payments program. One goal is to advance public awareness of the financial relationships existing between the healthcare industry (i.e. pharmaceutical companies) and physicians or teaching hospitals. Payments or value transfers for a variety of purposes, including research, consulting, travel, or gifts, are collected and reported to physicians and teaching hospitals via the healthcare industry. CMS subsequently collects this data on a yearly basis and makes it virtually available to the public.\n\nExamples of the types of payments drug and medical device manufacturers must report to physicians and teaching hospitals include speaker fees, vacations, food and beverage, travel and lodging, charitable contributions, or royalties and licenses.\n\nCMS published information last year about almost four and a half million payments valued at $3.7 billion for the last five months of 2013. Such transparency is vital, says CMS, for stakeholders to richly analyze, monitor, and use the information accordingly.\n\n2014 payments reported to the Open Payments program may be reviewed and disputed regarding alleged inaccuracies by physicians and teaching hospitals within a forty-five day window beginning April 6, reports CMS.\n\nPhysicians and teaching hospitals may register for both the Open Payments system and the CMS Enterprise Portal, review transactions, dispute inaccurate data, and provide rationale for why a reported payment or other transfer of value is deemed inaccurate. Although both parties may initiate disputes after the window of time has formerly closed, resolutions will not be publicly displayed until commencement of the next reporting cycle.\n\nFollowing the forty-five day window, manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) must resolve and submit corrections within a fifteen day period before the data is publically released. Unresolved disputed data within this period will be marked as disputed and publicly reported at the end of June.\n\nAccording to CMS, the aforementioned payment methods often spark conflicts of interest. As CMS confirms within its Open Payments Methodology Overview and Data Dictionary, \u201cFinancial ties between the health care industry and health care providers do not necessarily signal wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nCMS adds it actively urges healthcare providers discuss such relationships with their beneficiaries. Communication is key to avoid preventable hiccups along the way.\n\n\u201cOpen Payments doesn\u2019t identify which financial relationships are beneficial or which may cause conflicts of interest,\u201d CMS adds. \u201cInstead, the program is designed to increase public awareness about these relationships and discourage payments and other transfers of value that might have inappropriate influence on research, education, standard setting, and most importantly, clinical decision making.\u201d\n\nCMS recommends healthcare providers and organizations keep track of their financial interactions and review information submitted by other manufacturers prior to the information being posted to the public. It also emphasizes learning what to do if there is a disagreement with submitted information.\n\nGetting even with odd numbers is a primary objective the healthcare industry should actively focus and openly communicate about on to ensure future revenue cycle success.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Physicians and teaching hospitals review revenue with CMS' Open Payments program to ensure data transparency advances awareness of financial relationships.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-open-payments-advance-revenue-transparency", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Revenue_Cycle_Transparency.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "CMS\u2019 Open Payments Advance Revenue Cycle Transparency"}, "twitter": {"description": "Physicians and teaching hospitals review revenue with CMS' Open Payments program to ensure data transparency advances awareness of financial relationships.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Revenue_Cycle_Transparency.jpg"}, "title": "CMS\u2019 Open Payments Advance Revenue Cycle Transparency", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3eb2\"", "article_summary": "To actively instill such initiatives, CMS subsequently instigated the Open Payments program.\nThere are several significant objectives of the Open Payments program.\n\u201cOpen Payments doesn\u2019t identify which financial relationships are beneficial or which may cause conflicts of interest,\u201d CMS adds.\n2014 payments reported to the Open Payments program may be reviewed and disputed regarding alleged inaccuracies by physicians and teaching hospitals within a forty-five day window beginning April 6, reports CMS.\npharmaceutical companies) and physicians or teaching hospitals."}
