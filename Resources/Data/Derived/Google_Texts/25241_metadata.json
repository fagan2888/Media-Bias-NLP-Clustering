The lone gunman, Man Haron Monis, who had a long rap sheet that included murder and rape, was shot dead by police. Two hostages died and several others were wounded. Later on Tuesday, nearly 7,000 miles away, the Taliban gunned down 132 children and nine staff members at a school in the Pakistani city of Peshawar. The Pakistani military took swift action, launching massive airstrikes against the Taliban in retaliation. And in Iraq\u2019s Fallujah, one member of ISIS singlehandedly killed more than 150 women and girls.\n\nCuba: President Obama\u2019s unilateral move to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba was criticized by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle this week who saw it as a vindication of brutal behavior. Sen. Marco Rubio blasted the new policy, calling it a concession to a tyranny, and slammed fellow Republican Sen. Rand Paul for being 'utterly clueless' on the issue. The Cuban American senator also pointed out that by saying the U.S. was trying to colonize Cuba, Obama was using the same talking point as the Castro regime. Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father escaped the country in 1957 after undergoing beatings and torture, said the move will be remembered as a tragic mistake. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest dismissed threats to defund the move, claiming the administration has all the money it needs to move forward with the plan. Many are also wondering if the new \u201cnormalization\u201d means Cuba will return cop killer Joanne Chesimard.\n\nThe Interview: After hackers released Sony\u2019s films, salary information of top executives, embarrassing emails, social security numbers, employee medical records, and finally, threatened 9/11 style attacks on movie theaters that screen the comedy, Sony caved and pulled the film. The White House called the Sony hack a \u201cserious national security matter\u201d and House Cybersecurity Chairman warned the U.S. power grid and Wall Street could be next. Unsurprisingly, the North Korean government turned out to be behind the \u2018cyber warfare.\u2019 One \u201cjournalist\u201d said having First Amendment rights comes with the responsibility to not offend dictators, which apparently Paramount, in their decision to ban showings of \u201cTeam American,\u201d has taken note of. Meanwhile, we learned this week that the Obama administration tried to open up talks with North Korea last year and failed.\n\nImmigration: A federal judge issued an opinion this week classifying Obama\u2019s executive amnesty as unconstitutional. And a New York Times story shows why an injunction against the program is the only way to stop it. Interestingly, however, the nominee to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it.\n\nElections and campaigns: The 2014 midterm elections have officially come to an end with Rep.-elect Martha McSally winning the recount in Arizona\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. On the presidential front, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren insists she\u2019s not running, although she only responded in the present tense. And Joe Biden still hasn\u2019t made up his mind. On the Republican side, Rand Paul may have to jump through legal hoops if he decides to run. Jeb Bush is actively exploring a shot at the White House, even though policy and history are against the Florida governor. Meanwhile, his Floridian prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Marco Rubio is quietly laying the groundwork for a run. Mittmentum isn\u2019t gone yet, however.\n\nHealth Care: Insurers are extending another Obamacare deadline. Costs will now spike in 2016. Meanwhile, Vermont had to abandon plans to establish a single payer system because it\u2019s too expensive. And the guy who outed Jonathan Gruber came forward to reveal another hidden agenda in Obamacare: It\u2019s actually a $250 billion tax grab per year.\n\nGun Control: The Senate confirmed Dr. Vivek Murthy, President Obama\u2019s anti-Second Amendment nominee for surgeon general this week. And families of the victims of Newtown are suing Bushmaster, whether or not the case will go anywhere is a different story.\n\nEITs: Discussions about the CIA\u2019s Enhanced Interrogation Techniques continued this week, with a former CIA officer saying that Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues raised no objections to the practice in 2002. And former Vice President Dick Cheney went on Meet the Press to defend the CIA and EITs.\n\nYear-End Presser: Townhall editors Guy Benson and Conn Carroll have a few questions for the president before he heads off on his 17-day vacation in Hawaii.\n\nGraphics by Feven Amenu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics..05/25/2016 17:36:29PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Friday Filibuster: The Cuba Libre Edition", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/19/the-friday-filibuster-n1933712", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/19/39.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Friday Filibuster: The Cuba Libre Edition", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/19/the-friday-filibuster-n1933712", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/19/39.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Friday Filibuster: The Cuba Libre Edition , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b5a\"", "article_summary": "Cuba: President Obama\u2019s unilateral move to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba was criticized by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle this week who saw it as a vindication of brutal behavior.\nJeb Bush is actively exploring a shot at the White House, even though policy and history are against the Florida governor.\nSen.
