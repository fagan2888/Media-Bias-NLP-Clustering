Yet, that is the incredible story of Louis \u201cLouie\u201d Zamperini, who died earlier this year. Dan wrote a moving piece about him, sharing how affected he was by Zamperini's stirring book. Academy Award winner-turned-director-and-producer Angelina Jolie decided to make his story into a movie.\n\nNow, ahead of the film\u2019s release, Universal Pictures is asking others to share their own personal survival stories in their new \u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d campaign. By submitting videos about their inspiring tales, participants can share in Zamperini\u2019s legacy. More from the campaign:\n\nWe\u2019re inviting people from all walks of life to share an inspiring story of resilience for the chance to have a professional team create a video segment about it. Selected stories may also be featured on NBC\u2019s Today, and those who submit have the opportunity to receive an invitation to the film\u2019s world premiere. \u201cBy submitting your video, you can show everyone that, like Louie, we are all capable of being extraordinary.\u201d\n\nHere is just one of the extraordinary people who's story is featured on the site: Mankin suffered severe facial injuries after his amphibious assault vehicle drove over an improvised explosive device in Iraq. Yet, he insists, \u201cBeauty is who you are.\u201d You can read more of his story here.\n\nIf anything else, this campaign is a chance for us to better understand why veterans deserve our praise. How often do we reflect on how selflessly soldiers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect the freedoms we enjoy every day and perhaps take for granted?\n\nThose who have their own amazing stories to tell can submit their videos via the campaign website, or using the hashtag #IAmUnbroken.\n\nAfter reading even a few of the \u201cunbroken\u201d submissions, it\u2019s clear that any of these stories are worthy of the silver screen.\n\nThe \u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d campaign begins on November 11 and select stories will be featured on NBC\u2019s Today show.\n\n\u201cUnbroken\u201d comes out in theaters on Christmas Day. You can watch the trailer here (I\u2019ve watched it like five times already.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Theres a little \"Louie\" in all of us..05/26/2016 20:08:51PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Theres a little \"Louie\" in all of us.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - \u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d Campaign Highlights Inspiring Stories in Lead Up to Film About WWII Hero Louis Zamperini", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/10/29/veterans-share-inspiring-stories-for-i-am-unbroken-campaign-in-lead-up-to-film-about-wwii-hero-louis-zamperini-n1911479", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/29/4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Theres a little \"Louie\" in all of us.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - \u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d Campaign Highlights Inspiring Stories in Lead Up to Film About WWII Hero Louis Zamperini", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/10/29/veterans-share-inspiring-stories-for-i-am-unbroken-campaign-in-lead-up-to-film-about-wwii-hero-louis-zamperini-n1911479", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/29/4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d Campaign Highlights Inspiring Stories in Lead Up to Film About WWII Hero Louis Zamperini , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s the message the producers behind the new \u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d campaign want to get across.\nThe \u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d campaign begins on November 11 and select stories will be featured on NBC\u2019s Today show.\nNow, ahead of the film\u2019s release, Universal Pictures is asking others to share their own personal survival stories in their new \u201cI Am Unbroken\u201d campaign.\nThose who have their own amazing stories to tell can submit their videos via the campaign website, or using the hashtag #IAmUnbroken.\nYet, that is the incredible story of Louis \u201cLouie\u201d Zamperini, who died earlier this year."}
