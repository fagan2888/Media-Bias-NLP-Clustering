It saw the opportunity to grow its business in unmanned aerial vehicles \u2013 as long as it asked questions of its numerous business units. Senior leadership raised two vital questions: Did they want to play a role in \u201cbuilding a brand new UAV from the ground up,\u201d and what abilities would they draw on to make it happen? From there, new business opportunities emerged as ideas, people and technologies were brought together for a common purpose.\n\nToday\u2019s leaders must set the example, say the experts. Doing so allows individuals at all levels (as well as the teams they work on) to speak up.\n\n\u201cEvery really great leader is a great teacher, and the best teachers bring out the best in their students by asking questions,\u201d says career counselor Michele Woodward. \u201cIf a leader doesn\u2019t know the answer or wants to foster innovative brainstorming, all he has to do is start asking probing, thoughtful questions.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 7 WAYS TO FIX YOUR BIGGEST MANAGEMENT MISTAKE\n\nThis builds trust within the team \u2013 and a feeling that the team is \u201cdoing something meaningful.\u201d\n\nIn his book, Gregerman emphasizes that it\u2019s \u201cleaders who build cultures of conversation, engagement and possibilities.\u201d\n\nHe suggests a team\u2019s key questions be made public within the organization to emphasize the importance of collaboration. That way, \u201ccoworkers [can] connect and share their best thinking\u2026 They might have a very different view based on the work they do or some other aspect of their lives they\u2019re particularly passionate and knowledgeable about.\u201d\n\nAnd they might just \u201cstretch our thinking\u201d and allow for new answers, fresh ideas and further success \u2013 \u201cif we\u2019re open to it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In today\u2019s hyper-competitive workplace and still-recovering economy, few workers are c", "title": "The One Career Move That Can Get You Into the C-Suite", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/10/One-Career-Move-Can-Get-You-C-Suite", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/10/One-Career-Move-Can-Get-You-C-Suite", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07242013_Raise_Negotiation_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In today\u2019s hyper-competitive workplace and still-recovering economy, few workers are c", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8d7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEvery really great leader is a great teacher, and the best teachers bring out the best in their students by asking questions,\u201d says career counselor Michele Woodward.\nThat\u2019s why asking questions \u2013 just as \u201ca relatively clever and somewhat renowned guy named Socrates\u201d once did, reminds Gregerman \u2013 is the key.\n\u200bYet admitting you don\u2019t know it all \u2013 and more importantly, asking questions to learn more \u2013 is not only the best way to learn, but the only way.\n\u201cHe had a great gift for asking very important questions that sparked equally important conversations,\u201d says Gregerman.\nWith growth and development come greater and more valuable contributions to your organization \u2013 and new potential for success."}
