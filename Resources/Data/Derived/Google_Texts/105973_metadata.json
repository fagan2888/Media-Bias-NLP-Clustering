In addition, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) last year upgraded its HCV screening recommendation for persons at high risk of infection to a B grade and recommended one-time screening for individuals in the 1945-1965 birth cohort, making both recommended services that health care providers should offer. The USPSTF also recently released a B grade recommendation for hepatitis B (HBV) screening for persons at high risk of infection . These new clinical screening recommendations bring guidance from two expert organizations\u2013the CDC and the USPSTF\u2013 into alignment and support expanded screening for HBV and HCV.\n\nPrimary care providers are on the front lines of implementing these viral hepatitis screening recommendations, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD ) has developed ACT-First for them. ACT-First is a free, online CME and CE course that will help physicians and other healthcare professionals improve their knowledge and clinical skills in hepatology. After completing the course, providers will know how to screen for viral hepatitis, what to do in the patient with positive serologies, what to tell the patient, how to decide who is a candidate for therapy, and when to refer patients to a specialist.\n\nTwo units\u2013on HCV and HBV\u2013are available now, with additional units on other liver diseases to be released soon. Each teaching unit includes seven to eight presentations addressing every aspect of the disease state. Topics include:\n\nHepatitis B Unit\n\nHBV: Epidemiology and Screening\n\nPatient with positive Hepatitis B serologies\n\nNatural history of HBV and identification of treatment candidates\n\nManagement of the Chronic HBV patient with co-morbid and other conditions\n\nAntiviral treatment of the Patient with Chronic HBV\n\nPrevention of HBV infection\n\nHepatitis B in the Pediatric Patient\n\nHepatitis C Unit\n\nHCV: Epidemiology and Screening\n\nPatient with new diagnosis of HCV (anti-HCV positive)\n\nAssessing severity of liver disease in HCV\n\nManagement of the Patient with Chronic HCV\n\nManagement of the Chronic HCV Patient with co-morbid and other conditions\n\nAntiviral treatment of the patient with HCV infection\n\nManagement of patients with HCV who have achieved a virological \u201ccure\u201d\n\nThe Pediatric patient with HCV\n\nIf you are a health care provider, take the first step in helping your patients with liver disease and visit ACT-First today.\n\nIf you know a healthcare provider who might be interested in free CME or CE credits, please share this information with them.

We are pleased that ACT-First will contribute to achieving the U.S. Viral Hepatitis Action Plan\u2019s goals of increasing the proportion of persons who are aware of their HBV and HCV status and improving the quality of care for individuals with chronic viral hepatitis.\n\nDr. Garcia-Tsao is past president, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and professor of internal medicine at Yale University School of Medicine and staff physician at the Connecticut Veterans Affairs Healthcare System where she is chief of the Section of Digestive Diseases and program director of the Hepatitis C Resource Center.
