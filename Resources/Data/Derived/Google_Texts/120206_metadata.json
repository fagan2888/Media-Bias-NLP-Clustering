And the makeup of the electorate is vastly different, with Iowa dominated by evangelicals and New Hampshire seasoned with independents who make up 40 percent of voters.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is trying to beat the odds and pull out victories in both states. He hopes his brand of conservatism appeals to Republican voters everywhere.\n\nOn Sunday he started a five-day New Hampshire tour packed with 17 events in all 10 of the state\u2019s counties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption of Washington that is embodied by Hillary Clinton,\u201d Cruz said during a rally at the Country Strong Saloon at the Pasta Loft in Milford, N.H. \u201cIf we stand together as \u2018We the people,\u2019 we will restore this last best hope for mankind, the shining city on the hill that is the United States of America.\u201d\n\n\u2018An outsider\u2019s year\u2019\n\nCruz gave his standard stump speech at the rally, telling the crowd that if elected president, he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, rip up the nuclear deal with Iran, build a wall to stop illegal immigration, abolish the Internal Revenue Service and \u201cutterly and completely destroy ISIS.\u201d\n\nHe also criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy as weak and ineffective.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, American sailors will never be on their knees to a foreign country,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Hampshire, with its first-in-the nation primary, is critical to every major candidate in the race \u2014 and for different reasons.\n\nCruz hopes to roll into the Granite State after a strong showing in the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, where he leads in the polls. Following up a successful Iowa campaign with strength in the New Hampshire primary would set him up nicely for the rest of the nomination process, particularly when the contest heads to his strongholds in the South.\n\nWhile a bad showing in New Hampshire wouldn\u2019t hurt Cruz the way it would his opponents, it could put him behind his main rival, New York businessman Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and Cruz are slugging it out in Iowa, where polls show a tight race. Cruz trails Trump in New Hampshire, a state where several contenders are pinning their hopes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fresh candidate and he\u2019s not in with the Washington crowd,\u201d said Sean Murphy, a 48-year-old software engineer from Milford whose family also likes Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s an outsider\u2019s year. He\u2019ll do well if he stays with the message.\u201d\n\n\u2018It will be tight\u2019\n\nMichael Donovan, a businessman who also attended the Milford rally, said Cruz was a solid conservative who would bring down the budget deficit and create jobs.\n\nBut he said beating Trump in New Hampshire would be difficult for Cruz.\n\n\u201cIt will be tight,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe Cruz can finish a strong second.\u201d\n\nPolitical analysts say Cruz is positioned to make a strong push for New Hampshire voters.\n\n\u201cHe only needs to make his case \u2014 ideally, face to face. And the case he\u2019s made so far has been very effective in New Hampshire,\u201d said Dartmouth College political scientist Russell Muirhead. \u201cMost voters haven\u2019t yet made up their minds, and when you combine people\u2019s first- and second-choice candidates, Cruz has up to 35 percent support in New Hampshire. The only candidate with more support is Trump at 40 percent.\u201d\n\nThere are other reasons Cruz is taking time off from Iowa to tour the lodges, diners and country stores of New Hampshire.\n\nThe primary is expected to winnow down the 11-candidate GOP field. Cruz doesn\u2019t want a rival currently lagging in the polls \u2014 such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2014 to get liftoff from a strong showing in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s keeping everybody honest,\u201d said political consultant Craig Stevens, who lives in New Hampshire. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle royal out there, and he wants to kick as many people as possible out of the long-term race. And if Trump falters in New Hampshire, Cruz would benefit.\u201d\n\nBut Stevens says there\u2019s a risk with trying to go all out in both New Hampshire and Iowa. New Hampshire voters are known for opting for a different candidate than Iowans. And the makeup of the electorate is different, with Iowa dominated by Christian conservatives.\n\n\u201cSometimes when candidates try to go all-in in both states, they come up short in both,\u201d Stevens said.\n\n\n\nFiscal conservatives\n\nThough trailing, Cruz has reason for optimism in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cCruz\u2019s favorability ratings have gone up as Republican voters here have come to know him better,\u201d said Muirhead, the political scientist. \u201cIn fact, more people say they \u2018could see\u2019 themselves supporting Cruz, at 71 percent, than say that about Trump, Rubio, Carson, Christie and Bush.\u201d\n\nStill, Cruz is not as well known in New Hampshire as he is in Iowa. And his strong appeals to evangelicals aren\u2019t as effective here.\n\n\u201cI grew up in New Hampshire, and I always thought of New Hampshire Republicans as more oriented to fiscal conservatism \u2014 small government, low taxes and balanced budgets \u2014 than social conservatism,\u201d Muirhead said. \u201cAnd indeed, likely voters in the New Hampshire Republican primary support same-sex marriage, unlike likely Republican caucusgoers in Iowa. But their convictions on the economy, job creation, taxes and spending \u2014 not to mention immigration and terrorism \u2014 align them with Republicans in the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nSome New Hampshire voters are suspicious of Cruz and the rest of the Republican field.\n\n\n\n\u2018Volatile \u2026 race\u2019\n\nBri Casey, a 31-year-old graphics designer from Bristol, was watching the NFL playoffs when the conversation at a Manchester bar turned to politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not voting for him or any of them,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI\u2019m going to write in the name of my dog, Maizie. She has a better chance of getting stuff done.\u201d\n\nCorey Glaude, a 31-year-old Manchester resident who works at a refrigeration company, said he liked how Cruz stood up to Trump, including his controversial comments criticizing the real estate tycoon for having \u201cNew York values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it that Cruz is not backing down,\u201d Glaude said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m voting for. I\u2019m an independent.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s bus tour could help his biggest area of need, which is getting to know more New Hampshire voters.\n\n\u201cThe main impediment for Cruz is that fewer people have met him than have met other candidates,\u201d Muirhead said. \u201cHe needs to show up, and to make his case in person. If he does, he certainly can do well. I think this is a volatile and competitive race. He might even win.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @gromerjeffers", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMS90ZWQtY3J1ei1iZWdpbnMtbmV3LWhhbXBzaGlyZS1jYW1wYWlnbi1zd2luZy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Gromer Jeffers Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "MILFORD, N.H. \u2014 New Hampshire and Iowa have two things in common: They stage early presidential contests and it\u2019s awfully cold in the winter.
