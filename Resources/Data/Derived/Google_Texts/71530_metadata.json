Promising numbers in the product\u2019s first 90 days since launch. The company debuted last October just as the federal government and states unveiled new health insurance exchanges where consumers can pick and choose plans in compliance with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOscar has since enrolled \u201cthousands\u201d of customers and has \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars in annualized revenue. While the federal government\u2019s exchange had an embarrassingly messy launch, state programs in places like New York and California rolled out more smoothly.\n\nThat\u2019s where Oscar has picked most of its new clientele. Apparently, the numbers were good enough that Founders Fund, which had been a minority investor in the company, decided to increase its stake at a $340 million valuation. Other firms including Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst Partners and Kushner\u2019s firm, Thrive Capital, also participated. Founders Fund put in $25 million, while the other firms added the remaining $5 million.\n\nOscar tries to marry many of the design and user experience lessons from the consumer web and mobile world with health care.\n\nThey have a clean and clear sign-up flow and they offer amenities like telemedicine or the ability to talk to a doctor within one hour of making a request. Generic drugs and primary care visits are also free.\n\nThe company has a notable team behind with it Thrive Capital\u2019s Josh Kushner, Vostu co-founder Mario Schlosser, Kevin Nazemi and Fredrik Nylander, who ran engineering and operations and Tumblr. That\u2019s just on the tech side. They also picked up executives with about 1,000 years of health insurance career experience behind them. On the company\u2019s board is Charlie Baker, who ran insurer Harvard Pilgrim out of Massachusetts, the only state with an insurance exchange before the Affordable Care Act was passed.\n\nOscar\u2019s timing was incredibly lucky. The team looked at the healthcare space before they really understood what the full impact of the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) would be. But the act fortuitously offered them a window to pick up customers just as the U.S. government enacted an individual mandate, or a requirement that people buy insurance or face penalties. That has meant a host of previously uninsured customers have come online the last several months.\n\nIn total, Oscar has raised $75 million, about $29 million of which has gone toward a capital reserve that the state of New York requires for health insurance providers.\n\nThe company only caters to customers in New York and has no immediate plans to expand outside of the state (although that is the goal long-term).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/kim-mai-cutler/\" title=\"Posts by Kim-Mai Cutler\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Kim-Mai Cutler</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kimmaicutler\" rel=\"external\">@kimmaicutler</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "p": {"domain_verify": "6189ff68ce30e30f12b40b3b40873027"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oscar, the New York-based startup in the decidedly unsexy world of health insurance, has just picked up an additional $30 million in funding.
