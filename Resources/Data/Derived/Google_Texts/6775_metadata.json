It is doubtful there are many decent Americans who are not outraged at Ted Cruz for his role in the government shutdown, and it is likely he relishes the increased attention as conservatives\u2019 messiah. Cruz appeared to be the de facto Republican leader who shut down the government and threatened a credit default as leverage to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, but the teabag hero was little more than a figurehead of a much larger conspiracy whose real leaders are teabaggers Charles and David Koch and Jim DeMint.\n\nWhile Cruz-led Republicans are plotting their next fiscal crisis to avenge their failure to tank the economy unless the President and Democrats paid a ransom, the Koch brothers and DeMint have been waging a ferocious battle to take the health law down in the states as well as in Congress. Americans should make no mistake that Republicans and their masters the Kochs and Jim DeMint will go to any lengths to derail the health law, because when all is said and done, they intend to deprive Americans from having access to healthcare regardless the cost to the nation\u2019s economy or the people they lust to dominate.\n\nAmericans have a two-and-a-half month respite until Republicans in Washington enact their next fiscal crisis to eliminate the health law, but Virginia residents are feeling the full effect of the Koch brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity crusade to stop a key feature of the health law, Medicaid expansion, to deny poor Virginians access to healthcare. The primary target of the Koch-funded AFP is a long-time Republican tasked with leading a commission to decide if Virginia will expand Medicaid and provide the poorest residents with basic health care services. The man, Republican state senator Emmett W. Hanger Jr. reports he is coming under heavy fire from Americans for Prosperity and their army of operatives deployed to spread Koch propaganda that expanding Medicaid is tantamount to ceding America to Adolf Hitler.\n\nHanger said the Koch acolytes are waging what he called \u201can attempt to intimidate me in Richmond and at home,\u201d and he reported that AFP operatives have telephoned his constituents, distributed leaflets, and knocked on 2,000 doors in his rural district to warn of the impending disaster if poor Virginians get access to healthcare. Hanger also said when the Republican town committee met Monday night in his home county, Augusta, Americans for Prosperity was there. On Tuesday, AFP field organizers bused in hundreds of volunteers in green shirts and provided Subway sandwiches for lunch as recompense for attending the Hanger-led commission hearing on the benefits of expanding Medicaid.\n\nThe president of Americans for Prosperity, Tim Phillips, said \u201cThis has been one of those trench warfare kind of efforts for a year now, and I think it is one of those hidden stories of the whole fight against Obamacare. It\u2019s not flashy; it\u2019s just in a whole bunch of state capitals and in the districts of a whole lot of state legislators, but it\u2019s such a crucial aspect of the overall long-term effort to destroy Obamacare.\u201d The war plans to go state-by state is a shift from co-conspirator Jim DeMint and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s tactics that drove the shutdown and default effort in Washington DeMint said \u201cwill now be the issue for the next few years,\u201d and the Koch\u2019s Americans for Prosperity concurred that Americans will be lambasted with anti-Obamacare propaganda for years. The Pennsylvania leader of AFP said \u201cthis is going to be an issue all through 2014 for us. I don\u2019t believe this fight is in Washington or ever was. I think this is a street fight. It\u2019s a man to man, so to speak, fight of going door to door.\u201d\n\nIf Americans thought pundits\u2019 assertions that Republicans are waging war for domination to hurt Americans were exaggerations, the language the Koch and Heritage acolytes use are war parlance. Trench warfare, fighting door-to-door, and street fighting are war terms that make the point that picking on hapless Ted Cruz as the be all, end all, target for his role to eliminate the healthcare reform law is erroneous. Without the money, fear-mongering, and electoral pressure from the Koch brothers and DeMint, it is likely more Republicans would abandon the seditious conspiracy to prevent, obstruct, or delay execution of an established law like the ACA. It is true the great majority of Republicans harbor enough hatred for the American people, especially poor American people, to drive their anti-healthcare crusade, but few of them would risk enraging voters with a shut down and credit default without the support, funding, and direction from Koch and DeMint\u2019s anti-American organizations.\n\nThe effort to eliminate the established healthcare insurance reform law is a conspiracy, and not the act of one man or even one faction of the conservative movement. Every Republican in Congress who voted to keep the United States government shut down and crash the economy are just as culpable as Cruz, the Kochs, and DeMint\u2019s Heritage Foundation, and every last one deserves the people\u2019s wrath because they were elected to help Americans, not keep them sick, shut down their government, or tank the economy.\n\nThe media and many pundits are wont to excuse incompetent Speaker John Boehner because he cannot rein in recalcitrant teabagger extremists in the House, but it was Boehner who allowed 40-plus votes to repeal the ACA that he asserted \u201cwas the law of the land\u201d after President Obama\u2019s re-election last November. It is important to remember that seditious conspiracy is two or more persons preventing, hindering, and obstructing execution of a United States law, and as such it means nearly all Republicans in Congress are guilty of a crusade that has no goal other than preventing Americans from having access to health care.\n\nIt is easy to focus on one man like Cruz as the culprit in the fight to eliminate the healthcare law, and he certainly is worthy of Americans\u2019 rage for his role as spokesman and de facto leader of the anti-Obamacare movement, but losing sight of the effort\u2019s real masterminds is why there is no public outcry against the Kochs, Americans for Prosperity, Jim DeMint, or the Heritage Foundation. In fact, in an unscientific survey over the past three weeks, only one person out of 22 had ever heard of the Koch brothers, AFP, Jim DeMint, or the Heritage Foundation and it is why they wield inordinate power over Republicans; they are virtually invisible to the public. There is no doubt whatsoever that if the American people knew who controlled Republicans in Congress and the states, and what their agenda for this country entails, they would abandon the Republican and teabag party en masse and frankly, that is the only scenario that is going to save this country and help all Americans have access to healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz is little more than a figurehead of a much larger conspiracy whose real leaders are teabaggers Charles and David Koch and Jim DeMint", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Ted Cruz is little more than a figurehead of a much larger conspiracy whose real leaders are teabaggers Charles and David Koch and Jim DeMint", "title": "Ted Cruz Is Just the Figurehead of The Koch/DeMint Destroy Government Conspiracy", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/20/ted-cruz-figurehead-kochdemint-destroy-government-conspiracy.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/demint-david-koch11-470x317.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-20T12:15:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,affordable care act,americans for prosperity,Government Shutdown,Healthcare reform in the United States,Heritage Foundation,jim demint,Koch Brothers,kochs,Medicaid Expansion,Obamacare,Republican Party,seditious conspiracy,Shutdown,Tea Party,Ted Cruz,Tim Phillips,Virginia,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-20T10:22:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T12:15:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, americans for prosperity, Government Shutdown, Healthcare reform in the United States, Heritage Foundation, jim demint, Koch Brothers, kochs, Medicaid Expansion, Obamacare, Republican Party, seditious conspiracy, Shutdown, Tea Party, Ted Cruz, Tim Phillips, Virginia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8166\"", "article_summary": "Hanger also said when the Republican town committee met Monday night in his home county, Augusta, Americans for Prosperity was there.\nIt is doubtful there are many decent Americans who are not outraged at Ted Cruz for his role in the government shutdown, and it is likely he relishes the increased attention as conservatives\u2019 messiah.\nTrench warfare, fighting door-to-door, and street fighting are war terms that make the point that picking on hapless Ted Cruz as the be all, end all, target for his role to eliminate the healthcare reform law is erroneous.\nThe Pennsylvania leader of AFP said \u201cthis is going to be an issue all through 2014 for us.\nThe effort to eliminate the established healthcare insurance reform law is a conspiracy, and not the act of one man or even one faction of the conservative movement."}
