[...] For Giles, putting together a presidential bid is the latest venture in an eclectic career that has included stints as a car dealer, chateau baron, and magic-club owner. [...] Giles' wife has dubbed him \"the fireman\" for his crisis management skills, which he has put to work on behalf of a roster of embattled celebrity clients.\n\nThe Ben Carson political machine will be one to watch. There's simply no round edges there\u2014everything about the Carson campaign screams \" I threw this together in my garage from motorcycle parts and half of an old Ikea desk. He also lives in an ornate California castle, because why the hell not. You would too if you could.\n\nBut who does Carson turn to when he's trying to avoid needing a crisis manager? Why, that would be Armstrong Williams. Yes, that Armstrong Williams.\n\n\n\nNow a talk radio host and businessman, Williams serves as Carson's media guru, helping the first-time candidate massage his often unfiltered talking points.\n\nWell now that's just the worst job in the world, right there. Not even Armstrong Williams deserves to be saddled with that.\n\nYou know what? This is really going to be a fun election season. I had my doubts, but the prospect of a Republican primary in which God-knows-how-many candidates, all stacked like cordwood on a debate stage and most of whom can't go three days without comparing somebody to the Nazis, fighting it out has really improved my spirits. Thanks for running, Ben Carson.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Have fun with that.\n\n\nThe Ben Carson political machine will be one to watch.
