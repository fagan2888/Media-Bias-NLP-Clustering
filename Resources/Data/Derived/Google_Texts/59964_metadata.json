And that is what makes it a \u2018community' playground,\u201d said township supervisor Bruce Mazzoni.\n\nA dedication ceremony at 4:30 p.m. Thursday will mark the official opening of the community-designed facility.\n\nThe Cranberry Township Community Chest selected the playground as its 2013 community project of the year. The community chest committed $50,000 toward the nearly $500,000 cost of the Kids Castle playground to be used for playground equipment.\n\nAdditional funding came from a slew of sources, including local businesses, organizations and community members.\n\n\u201cIt's been all hands on deck,\u201d said township Manager Jerry Andree. \u201cEverybody is involved with the playground.\u201d\n\nThe Kids Castle will consist of three distinct parts that reflect Cranberry's history and future, Andree said.\n\nThe Yesterday area will have swings, climbing areas, rolling hills and riding animals, according plans on the community chest website. The Today area will have a custom-built play area and feature a clock tower similar to the one at the municipal building. The Tomorrow area will have the latest in play structures and playground technology.\n\n\u201cIt creates a lot of interplay,\u201d Andree said.\n\nHe said there will also be places for parents and other adults to sit while children play.\n\n\u201cIt's much more than a kid's playground. It's more of a family retreat area,\u201d Andree said.\n\nKids Castle is replacing the old Playtime Palace, which was opened in 1990.\n\nVolunteers from Westinghouse Electric Co. and Alcoa, Inc. helped dismantle the old Playtime Palace in April.\n\nSome of the wood from Playtime Palace was pressure-washed and stained for use in the Yesterday section of the Kids Castle.\n\nConstruction on the new playground began in mid-July, Andree said. Hundreds of people volunteered in shifts to help build the Today section of the playground during a community-build weekend in August.\n\nCranberry officials said the Playtime Palace was too old to maintain and did not comply with current safety standards.\n\nThe new playground is built from materials that will not rot and require less maintenance, Mazzoni said. It will also exceed Public Playground Safety Guidelines standards and Americans With Disabilities Act requirements.\n\n\u201cMany pieces of the equipment are very unique and one of a kind,\u201d Mazzoni said.\n\nRachel Farkas is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
