Romney campaign veterans now say that expenditure was crippling when the former Massachusetts governor faced President Barack Obama in the general election, although the Adelsons backed Romney when he secured the nomination.\n\nTrump has stoked concerns among Republican Jews because of his Israel posture \u2013 he made, and then seemed to walk back, a pledge to stay neutral when it came to negotiating Israeli-Palestinian peace, and he has said he would make Israel pay for U.S. defense assistance.\n\nBut Adelson, a major backer of Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his worries about Iran fueled his decision.\n\n\u201cFor nearly eight years, Republicans have fought tooth and nail against President Obama and his policies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe waged battles over debt, government spending, Obamacare and the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 an issue of paramount importance to me personally and to many others around the world \u2026 If Republicans do not come together in support of Trump, Obama will essentially be granted something the Constitution does not allow \u2014 a third term in the name of Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nAdelson, who likes to keep political pundits guessing, dropped a hint in the Op-Ed that his own earlier indications that he favored two senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, were off the mark. Last year, Adelson\u2019s Israeli paper, Israel Hayom, featured flattering coverage of Rubio and Adelson told friends that he favored Rubio while Miriam favored Cruz. This year, the Adelsons each gave the maximum amount for a direct donation, $2,700, to the Cruz campaign.\n\n\u201cWhile I had some personal preferences because of friendships with some of the 2016 candidates, I kept coming back to the issue of executive experience,\u201d Adelson said. \u201cIn my view, a governor of a state is ideally qualified to be president. A governor is a state\u2019s final decision maker \u2014 its chief executive and steward of the public\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nFormer and current governors who were in the race this year included Jeb Bush of Florida, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Chris Christie of New Jersey.\n\nAdelson said Trump\u2019s experience running a real estate business brought what was needed to the table.\n\n\u201cHe is a candidate with actual CEO experience, shaped and molded by the commitment and risk of his own money rather than the public\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a CEO success story that exemplifies the American spirit of determination, commitment to cause and business stewardship.\u201d\n\nAdelson has for weeks indicated that the GOP establishment should rally around Trump now that he is the presumptive nominee and Israel Hayom has recently shifted to flattering coverage of Trump, but this is Adelson\u2019s boldest statement yet.\n\nIt was not clear why Adelson chose the Washington Post to make his announcement, and not one of the two influential papers he owns, Israel Hayom or the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Nor has Adelson announced whether he would funnel money to Trump\u2019s campaign. After Gingrich dropped out, the Adelsons backed Romney, ultimately spending up to $150 million overall on the campaign to defeat Obama and help Republicans in Congress.\n\nAdelson, while writing that that he has been \u201casked frequently what I would look for in a future presidential contender,\u201d was also defensive about his own qualifications to opine.\n\n\u201cDespite being the grandson of a Welsh coal miner and the son of a Boston cab driver, I\u2019ve had the remarkable experience of being part of almost 50 different businesses in my more than 70-year business career,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, tell me I\u2019m not a conservative enough Republican or I\u2019m too hawkish on Israel or whatever else you may think, but I think I\u2019ve earned the right to talk about success and leadership.\u201d\n\nThe casino magnate finished with a tough warning for the growing number of Republicans who say they will not vote for Trump.\n\n\u201cSome Republicans are sitting on the sidelines, threatening to stay home on Election Day or, worse, suggesting they will vote for Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must realize the stakes are too high for an outcome that will have a damaging impact on our country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/128x79/adelson-article-060614-1423593396.jpg",
