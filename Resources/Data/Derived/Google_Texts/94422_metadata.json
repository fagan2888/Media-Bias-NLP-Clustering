The growth was driven by spending in Central and Eastern Europe, Asia and Oceania, and some states in the Middle East, according to the study.\n\nRelated: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon\u2019s Arsenal\n\nOverall, military expenditures were equal to 2.3 percent of the global gross domestic product.\n\nThe data is culled from various sources, including a questionnaire that is sent out annually to national governments. Some countries, such as China, do not participate and estimates are used. A handful of countries, including Cuba and Uzbekistan, are excluded due to a lack of trustworthy data.\n\nThe report attributes the uptick in spending to a number of complex conflicts currently playing out around the globe, including: the battle against the Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria; Chinese expansion in the South China Sea; the Saudi-led war in Yemen; heightened fears of Iran\u2019s military; and Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and continued support of separatists in Ukraine.\n\nOf the 15 countries detailed in the report, the largest growth was by Australia at 7.8 percent, while the biggest decrease was by Italy at \u20139.9 percent.\n\nRelated: Half a Trillion for the Pentagon? Why Defense Spending Is Only Going Higher\n\nHere are the world\u2019s top military spenders:\n\nThe United States. With $596 billion for defense in 2015, the U.S. was the largest spender by far. However, the huge price tag was actually a drop of 2.4 percent from 2014, though that\u2019s a slower rate of decline than past years. Still, the U.S. spent nearly as much on its military as the next eight biggest militaries combined.\n\nChina. Beijing came in second, as it did in 2014, with an estimated $215 billion in spending. That figure represents an increase of 7.4 percent from the previous year, although the rate of increase is beginning to slow in line with the country\u2019s weakening economic growth.\n\nSaudi Arabia. Coming in at third with spending of $87.2 billion, Saudi Arabia overtook Russia, mainly due to the fall in the value of the ruble. Additionally, Riyadh\u2019s military campaign against Yemen's Shiite rebels and their allies has led to billions of dollars more in purchases.\n\nRussia. The fourth-largest spender at $66 billion, the fall in oil prices meant that the country\u2019s increase of 7.5 percent in 2015 was considerably lower than projected in its budget, according to SPRI.\n\n\u201cThe economic crisis related to falling oil and gas prices, coupled with economic sanctions, dramatically reduced Russian Government revenues,\u201d the analysis states. \u201cActual military expenditure was 3 per cent lower in 2015 than originally planned.\u201d\n\nUnited Kingdom. The drop in the value of the euro was a major factor in France falling into seventh place and the United Kingdom climbing to fifth, with $55.5 billion in spending.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Global military spending increased to $1.7 trillion for 2015, with the U.S. being the biggest spender by a wide margin, according to a new report.", "title": "The Top 15 Military Spenders in the World", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/05/Top-15-Military-Spenders-World", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02192016_Su-30SME_jet_fighter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/05/Top-15-Military-Spenders-World", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02192016_Su-30SME_jet_fighter.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Global military spending increased to $1.7 trillion for 2015, with the U.S. being the biggest spender by a wide margin, according to a new report.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Global military spending increased to $1.7 trillion in 2015, with the U.S. being the biggest spender by a wide margin.\nRelated: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon\u2019s ArsenalOverall, military expenditures were equal to 2.3 percent of the global gross domestic product.\nAdditionally, Riyadh\u2019s military campaign against Yemen's Shiite rebels and their allies has led to billions of dollars more in purchases.\nWhy Defense Spending Is Only Going HigherHere are the world\u2019s top military spenders:The United States.\n\u201cActual military expenditure was 3 per cent lower in 2015 than originally planned.\u201dUnited Kingdom."}
