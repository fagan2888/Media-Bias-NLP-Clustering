Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is courting actress Bo Derek in the hopes that she will choose the commonwealth as the filming location for her upcoming TV series.

The Democrat and his wife, Dorothy, hosted Miss Derek, 57, overnight at their mansion last weekend and threw her a garden reception Sunday, The Washington Post reported.

“Virginia is very sophisticated and they already have so much high-quality production going,” said Miss Derek, who met Monday with state tourism and film officials, The Post reported.
