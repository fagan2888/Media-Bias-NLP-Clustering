Healogics Closes Deal for Revelstoke-backed Accelecare

The deal follows health care acquisitions from Aequor Healthcare and Mednax

Healogics Inc. has purchased Revelstoke Capital Partners-backed Accelecare Wound Centers Inc.

Accelecare, headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, provides wound care services through wound centers that provide services to hospitals and other health care organizations, and professionals that work in skilled nursing facilities. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction was announced March 3.

The company has been backed by Denver private equity firm Revelstoke since December 2013. Revelstoke has made a few deals recently, including an investment in Crossroads Holding LLC, a rehabilitation program, and Career Step LLC, a training company.

Jacksonville, Florida-based Healogics provides wound care services through about 600 care centers. The company is backed by New York private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice through one of that firm's managed funds.

RBC Capital Markets and Fenwick and West LLP advised Accelecare on the deal. Debevoise and Plimpton LLP advised Healogics.

Health care services companies have been merging for a while now. In February, Aequor Healthcare Services bought Therapy Staff LLC, which helps recruit and hire therapists. Before that, Mednax (NYSE: MD) acquired Memac Associates PC, an anesthesiology group.
