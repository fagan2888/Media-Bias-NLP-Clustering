Andrew Cuomo was vocal Sunday about his support of a Congressional measure to close the so-called \u201cterror gap\u201d as the nation again is in a furor over gun control.\n\nCuomo, who has been pointedly calling for federal action on gun control since a former aide was shot and later died in September, said Sunday that \u201cit is clearer now than ever that members of Congress can no longer sit on their hands and shirk their responsibility to protect the American people \u2013 they must close the terror gap.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis loophole does nothing more than help radical people kill innocent Americans, and it must be closed,\u201d said Cuomo, who in October went as far as to say federal Democrats should threaten the GOP with a shutdown if they didn\u2019t take up gun control. \u201cThe fact that reform continues to languish illustrates the stranglehold the NRA has over Washington, and it\u2019s time for our elected leaders to show the political courage to vote for the safety of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe terror gap reference is to federal legislation that would bar those on a federal terrorism watchlist from buying firearms. That measure failed in the U.S. Senate last week. Another proposal for universal background checks also did not pass muster.\n\nOn Sunday, Democratic U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer told the Daily News he would push for a new vote on that bill this week.\n\nThose calling for stricter gun control have been emboldened by the shooting of dozens in San Bernardino, Calif. Fourteen people were killed in the shooting, which Cuomo called an \u201cinexplicable tragedy\u201d as he again pressured Congress to act.\n\nPresident Barack Obama addressed the country with an update on the investigation into the shooting and his administration\u2019s plans to tackle terrorism and the Islamic State. During his speech, Obama called on Congress to approve legislation that would stop gun sales to those on a no-fly list.\n\nCuomo\u2019s full Sunday statement is below:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Confidential", "description": "Gov.
