Many were expected to have serious, untreated medical issues due to being without medical coverage for years.\n\nAs a result, specialists were given state-funded raises to handle the anticipated new workload. But the Medi-Cal eligible population turned out to be not as sick as expected, according to a CalOptima staff report.\n\nThe state has since reduced payments to CalOptima for those \u201cexpansion\u201d patients. CalOptima is a $3 billion health plan for about 740,000 low-income Orange County children, adults and disabled individuals.\n\nThe Sept. 3 board action allocated $640,000 to keep the full specialist rate increases in place through Aug. 31 of this year and gave specialists a 15 percent instead of 35.1 percent raise through the end of June, 2016. Similar reductions were applied to hospitals. Specialists include surgeons and doctors who specialize in treating heart, brain and other conditions.\n\nWithout income from the state to cover the full cost of the raises, it would have cost CalOptima $353 million in 2015-2016 to keep the higher payments in place, according to the staff report.\n\nThe reductions were opposed by two doctor groups, Monarch Healthcare, an Irvine physicians association, and Torrance-based Healthcare Partners.\n\nDr. Nancy Boerner, Monarch\u2019s chief medical officer, complained there was a \u201clack of transparency and cooperation\u201d in the proposed reductions including \u201cno open dialog to solicit off-sets to the cuts.\n\n\u201cCuts of this magnitude can\u2019t be managed over night,\u201d she said.\n\nReplied board member Peter Agarwal, a bank branch vice president: \u201cIf we have to be lean, you have to be lean with us.\u201d\n\nCalOptima has 11 voting members on its board of directors with one vacancy. But there were so many conflicts of interest over the payment plans that nearly half of the board members didn't vote.\n\nThe items passed on 6-0 and 5-1 votes, with the only dissenting vote coming from Dr. Samara Cardenas, a pediatrician. \"If we cut the money that we\u2019re spending, we\u2019re going to cut services,\u201d Cardenas said.\n\nCalOptima Vice Chairman Lee Penrose, CEO of St. Jude Hospital, recused himself on all four items. Ophthalmologist Dr. Viet Van Dang, whose patients include CalOptima members, recused himself on three of the four items. County Supervisor Andrew Do, who raises campaign funds from the medical industry, abstained on all four votes, while Supervisor Lisa Bartlett abstained on three.\n\nYou can contact Tracy Wood at twood@voiceofoc.org and follow her on Twitter: @TracyVOC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state had instituted raises in anticipation of increased workload due to Affordable Care Act.
