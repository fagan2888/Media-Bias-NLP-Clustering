Days ahead of his first campaign rally in Ohio. presidential candidate Donald Trump went after Ohio Gov. John Kasich - on Twitter.

Beginning at a little after 8 p.m. Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter and ranted about fellow candidate, Kasich, for nearly an hour.

"I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money," read one.

By 11 p.m., the Kasich campaign had turned the Twitter frenzy into a fundraising plea, emailing supporters about Trump's "epic twitter rant" and noting: "American simply cannot afford to elect someone who isn't prepared to lead our country."

Kasich's political action committee, New Day for America, had released a new commercial Thursday morning comparing Trump and fellow outsider candidate Dr. Ben Carson to Barack Obama and his "on-the-job training for president."

John Weaver, Kasich's strategist, and Kasich's official Twitter handle fired back with an anti-Trump retweet spree.

Trump, the GOP frontrunner according to most polls, is scheduled to hold a rally in Columbus Monday evening.

Some highlights from Trump's tweets include:
