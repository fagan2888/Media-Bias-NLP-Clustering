Single-family-home rental licenses in the inner-ring suburb have more than doubled since 2008, from 287 to 746 this year.\n\nOther suburban leaders have enacted or tightened rules to manage the surge.\n\nIn Brooklyn Center, where single-family-home rentals account for 12 percent of the homes, Mayor Tim Willson said the neighborhoods in which rental homes become concentrated sometimes suffer.\n\nBrooklyn Center Mayor Tim Willson said the neighborhoods in which rental homes become concentrated sometimes suffer.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s about keeping the right balance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking at keeping that housing stock up and not having homes so deteriorated and blighted that they are no longer suitable for living in.\u201d\n\nThe city started a rigorous rental-licensing program in 2010. Willson said he had hoped that with the economic recovery, many rental homes would return to owner-occupied. That hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nSingle-family-home rentals now account for 12 percent of Brooklyn Center homes, up from 3 percent in 2000.\n\nWillson said there are many good renters, but some create problems. \u201cWorst case \u2026 for some reason the whole place is just trashed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat still happens too frequently. It is part of the whole rental world.\u201d\n\nTeresa Barnes, who lives in Brooklyn Center\u2019s Riverwood neighborhood, applauded the city\u2019s moratorium on new single-family-home rentals. She said she can tell when a home becomes a rental \u2014 in some, blankets are tacked over windows and mini-blinds are broken. She said those and other problem make a neighborhood look shabby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a concern when you start getting a bunch of rentals,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cYou worry about it becoming a rundown area where the landlords don\u2019t take care of the property.\u201d\n\nA national trend\n\nSingle-family-home rentals are on the rise nationally, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.\n\n\u201cWhen rental demand began to climb after the housing bust, conversions of owner-occupied single-family homes to rentals accommodated much of that growth,\u201d according to the center.\n\nThe trend cuts across geographic and economic lines. Minnetonka, Edina and Eden Prairie, all relatively affluent, have seen single-family-home rentals double or more in the past few years. Minneapolis and St. Paul have also seen increases.\n\nIn Eden Prairie, home rentals climbed from 128 in 2000 to 541 in recent years, although the trend has slowed lately according to census data. A rental licensing requirement enacted in 2007 that includes regular property inspections has helped keep problems to a minimum, said Fire Chief George Esbensen, who oversees the program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about keeping up the appearance of neighborhoods and the quality of the housing stock, making sure things don\u2019t slide,\u201d Esbensen said.\n\nThe increase is part of a greater social shift where younger adults, having watched their parents lose in the housing market, are delaying homebuying, he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think owning a home is the same big American dream it used to be.\u201d\n\nEden Prairie Mayor Nancy Tyra-Lukens said the one rental home on her street is well-maintained. She said she understands the desire of many reluctant landlords to hold onto property until prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s better than having that many houses sitting empty,\u201d she said.\n\nBrooklyn Park requires all prospective landlords to attend a daylong crime-prevention seminar before they are granted a rental license.\n\nEden Prairie Mayor Nancy Tyra-Lukens said she understands the desire of many reluctant landlords to hold onto property until prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s better than having that many houses sitting empty,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s a rental doesn\u2019t mean we will tolerate it being a criminal hot spot,\u201d said Curt Raymond, Brooklyn Park\u2019s rental and business licensing manager.\n\nThe city has issued about 2,300 single-family-home licenses, including for townhouses and condos. \u201cWe are adding four to five per week. We are wondering, where is the bubble?\u201d Raymond said.\n\nHe said his city is satisfied with its current rental situation, but that there does appear to be a correlation between higher-rental and higher-crime areas.\n\n\u201cTypically you can overlay the maps,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really glaring that where the crime is happening, there are also a lot of rentals in the area.\u201d\n\nEric Piper is the housing and code enforcement inspector in New Hope, where the number of single-family homes for rent has doubled to about 280 since 2000, according to census data. He said many older inner-ring suburbs like his could be reaching a point where rental homes are compromising neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThey change the dynamics of a neighborhood,\u201d Piper said. \u201cA lot of these investors will turn a three-bedroom house into a four- or five-bedroom house. It changes the number of cars parking on the block. A lot of times renters won\u2019t landscape the same as an owner-occupied.\u201d\n\nPiper said homeowners on a high-rental block often complain about aesthetics beyond the city\u2019s reach \u2014 weedy lawns, tree limbs that sit for months, dirty windows, broken mini-blinds visible from the street.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with an eclectic block with a rental or two, but the problem is when you have five rentals, then it becomes 10,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvantage or eyesore?\n\nIn Brooklyn Center, the temporary ban on single-home rentals has inspired different reactions.\n\nVicki Olson lives a block away from the duplex she and her husband have rented out for decades. She said she wants to keep her Riverwood neighborhood strong, but she also understands the need for good rental housing. Olson often rents to young couples who eventually have children and move on to buy their own home.\n\n\u201cThe renters we\u2019ve had have been lovely people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to have affordable housing. I think most people really want to buy a house, but wages are not what they used to be.\u201d\n\nLori Thayer, who owns a home on the Minneapolis-Brooklyn Center border, said she\u2019s fed up with renters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trashing the neighborhood, is what it\u2019s doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sick of rental property. When you get rental property, they don\u2019t care if the yard looks like crap. They don\u2019t care if they trash the place. \u2026 I am not saying every renter is bad, but they don\u2019t have any ownership. They are going to move on.\u201d\n\nStaff digital producer CJ Sinner contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What makes economic sense for many families can become a problem for cities.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "What makes economic sense for many families can become a problem for cities.", "title": "Single-family home rentals surge in Twin Cities suburbs", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/single-family-home-rentals-surge-in-twin-cities-suburbs/342596422/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1447001341_08+249932+2BUYERPSYCH042714.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1447001341_08+249932+2BUYERPSYCH042714.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What makes economic sense for many families can become a problem for cities.", "title": "Single-family home rentals surge in Twin Cities suburbs", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/single-family-home-rentals-surge-in-twin-cities-suburbs/342596422/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1447001341_08+249932+2BUYERPSYCH042714.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1447001341_08+249932+2BUYERPSYCH042714.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "rise in number of rentals"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "single family home rentals,rise in number of rentals"}, "article_summary": "The single-family home has become the hot new rental property in Twin Cities suburbs.\nMinnetonka, Edina and Eden Prairie, all relatively affluent, have seen single-family-home rentals double or more in the past few years.\nSingle-family-home rentals now account for 12 percent of Brooklyn Center homes, up from 3 percent in 2000.\nThis month, the Brooklyn Center City Council, worried that single-family-home rentals are \u201cdestabilizing\u201d neighborhoods, banned new ones for six months.\nSingle-family-home rental licenses in the inner-ring suburb have more than doubled since 2008, from 287 to 746 this year."}
