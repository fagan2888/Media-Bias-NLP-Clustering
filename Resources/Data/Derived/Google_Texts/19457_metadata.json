Many of those who spoke said they support the program, but some argued its costs will fall to people with private health insurance. Related: NHPR's primer on Medicaid expansion\n\nListen to the broadcast version to this story.\n\nTwo years ago, New Hampshire expanded eligibility for its Medicaid program as part of the federal Affordable Care Act. The expanded program now provides insurance to around 48,000 state residents.\n\nBut this program is set to expire by the end of the year if lawmakers don't vote to continue it. A bill working its way through the State House now would continue that expansion until 2018 - at no cost to the state. But some lawmakers question whether having hospitals and insurance companies foot a big part of the bill will cause private insurance premiums to rise.\n\nSpeakers from the state\u2019s hospitals and insurance providers said they can't guarantee that. But, they argued, without the expanded Medicaid program, the privately insured will almost certainly see premium increases.\n\nMatt Veno of Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare told lawmakers this program saves money by, for instance, expanding primary care access, which prevents costly chronic diseases from developing.\n\n\"It also keeps (low-income people) out of emergency rooms and hospital inpatient units where they are getting much more costly care which falls on the burden of the state and those who pay premiums,\" Veno testified.\n\nAnd Alex Walker, vice president of the Catholic Medical Center, argued if the state doesn\u2019t continue with the program it will lose out on roughly $800 million of federal money.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the hospital and the insurance companies are stepping up to take care of the gap that will exist is fiscally responsible \u2013 failing to approve the reauthorization is not fiscally responsible,\u201d Walker told the committee.\n\nThe N.H. Municipal Association also testified in support of the bill, stressing that the expanded Medicaid program has also saved money at the local level.\n\nLast year, the costs of providing health care to uninsured patients went down more than $100 million statewide. The House Finance Committee plans to work on the bill early next month before it returns to the House floor.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Dozens of people filled the House Finance Committee room Wednesday to hear testimony on whether to continue the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program.
