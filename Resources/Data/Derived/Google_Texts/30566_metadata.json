But in 2007, Randel Johnson, a vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, proclaimed that the business community would wage \u201call-out war\u201d against it.\n\nThe recently proposed federal legislation that aims to provide paid family leave to most American workers would be financed like Social Security, with a small payroll tax (less than half of 1 percent, or average of about $2 a week). It would be administered by the Social Security Administration.\n\n\u201cFamily leave insurance\u201d would be a more accurate description than \u201cpaid family leave,\u201d because employees would be paying much of the cost themselves.\n\nLike state-level programs currently operating in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island, the federal program would extend the existing disability insurance model to help defray the costs of family care for children, elderly and sick family members.\n\n\n\nThe United States is one of the few countries in the world that fails to provide such insurance, and strong opposition to it is still voiced by many influential members of the business community.\n\nAs with the Social Security Act, this opposition seems, in retrospect, misplaced.\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which guarantees unpaid family leave for a significant portion of American workers, initially aroused fears of malingering. These fears proved exaggerated. Relatively few companies reported any adverse consequences. Many enjoyed the benefits of reduced worker turnover.\n\nWhen California\u2019s paid family leave was signed into law in 2002, the state Chamber of Commerce labeled it a \u201cjob-killer.\u201d But there is no evidence that it reduced employment or discouraged companies from locating in the state.\n\nThe California experience holds significant consequences for the national debate. A new book by Ruth Milkman and Eileen Appelbaum, \u201cUnfinished Business: Paid Family Leave in California and the Future of U.S. Work-Family Policy.\u201d summarizes many positive effects on children\u2019s health, fathers\u2019 involvement and maternal earnings.\n\nTheir research also offers strong evidence of minimal impact on businesses \u2013 even on the small companies considered especially vulnerable to regulatory burden.\n\nThe authors\u2019 research incorporated two telephone surveys of a representative sample of California employers before and after the legislation was implemented (each including more than 250 establishments), several surveys of workers between 2003 and 2011, and interviews with human resource managers at about 20 different workplaces to learn how they adjusted to new procedures.\n\nNine of 10 employers reported either positive or no effects on their establishments, perhaps because the majority compensated for paid leaves by temporarily assigning the work to other employees. In other words, workers themselves bore much of the burden.\n\nYet only 10 percent of workers in 2004 and 6 percent in 2010 reported a negative impact, and the biggest positive effect that employers reported was improved employee morale.\n\nPerhaps this is because both women and men know that, over their life on the job, they face a high probability of taking time off from paid employment to care for themselves or their aging parents, even if they don\u2019t have young children. In other words, they appreciate the benefits of social insurance.\n\nAs do most intelligent people. Which is why, as a prescient article in Forbes explained two years ago, even card-carrying capitalists should support paid family leave.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140127000121, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Appelbaum, Eileen;Milkman, Ruth", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "_featured", "published_time": 1390798881, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-02-10T20:33:48-05:00"}, "keywords": "Appelbaum Eileen,Milkman Ruth,Family Leaves,Paid Time Off,Pew Research Center,United States Chamber of Commerce,California,Delaware,New Jersey,Today's Economist,Uncategorized,_featured", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/The Business of Paid Family Leave  ( 20140127 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Nancy Folbre", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Nancy Folbre", "byl": "Nancy Folbre", "twitter": {"description": "Extending the disability-insurance model to help defray the costs of care for children, elderly and sick family members could help employees, with minimal impact on business, an economist writes.", "title": "The Business of Paid Family Leave", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/the-business-of-paid-family-leave/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002672481, "description": "Extending the disability-insurance model to help defray the costs of care for children, elderly and sick family members could help employees, with minimal impact on business, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 27, 2014", "org": "Pew Research Center;United States Chamber of Commerce", "geo": "California;Delaware;New Jersey", "utime": 20140210203348, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140127, "pdate": 20140127, "des": "Family Leaves;Paid Time Off", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Extending the disability-insurance model to help defray the costs of care for children, elderly and sick family members could help employees, with minimal impact on business, an economist writes.", "title": "The Business of Paid Family Leave", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/the-business-of-paid-family-leave/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/the-business-of-paid-family-leave/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Business of Paid Family Leave", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 27, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8b2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFamily leave insurance\u201d would be a more accurate description than \u201cpaid family leave,\u201d because employees would be paying much of the cost themselves.\nWhich is why, as a prescient article in Forbes explained two years ago, even card-carrying capitalists should support paid family leave.\nRhetorical attacks on paid family leave proposals have been less grandiloquent.\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which guarantees unpaid family leave for a significant portion of American workers, initially aroused fears of malingering.\nA new book by Ruth Milkman and Eileen Appelbaum, \u201cUnfinished Business: Paid Family Leave in California and the Future of U.S. Work-Family Policy.\u201d summarizes many positive effects on children\u2019s health, fathers\u2019 involvement and maternal earnings."}
