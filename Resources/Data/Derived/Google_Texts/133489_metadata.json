Paul Ray plans to introduce his proposal to bring back what he says is a more humane form of execution, during Utah\u2019s next legislative session in January, The Associated Press reported Saturday.\n\nThe idea may be catching on in other states as well. Lawmakers in Wyoming and Missouri have suggested similar legislation but both efforts stalled, AP reported.\n\nPHOTOS: Awesome rifles: The best and the baddest\n\nThe idea could come to fruition in Utah, a state with a history of firing squad execution, the most recent of which happened in 2010, when five police officers used .30-caliber Winchester rifles to execute Ronnie Lee Gardner.\n\nRep. Ray says that the idea may seem far-fetched, but argues that a firing squad is more fail-proof than lethal injection for criminals facing the death penalty.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like the Wild West, but it\u2019s probably the most humane way to kill somebody,\u201d Mr. Ray said. \u201cThe prisoner dies instantly. It sounds draconian. It sounds really bad, but the minute the bullet hits your heart, you\u2019re dead. There\u2019s no suffering.\u201d\n\nHowever, critics argue that the inmate could move or the shooter could miss, causing a slower and more painful death.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that it would be very quick and accurate but jut a little movement by the person could change that,\u201d said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nHe added however, \u201cThings can go wrong with any method of execution.\u201d\n\nIn April, the execution of Clayton Lockett, 38, was stopped after 20 minutes when one of his veins ruptured preventing the drugs in the lethal injection from taking full effect.\n\nMr. Clayton died of a heart attack after the execution was halted, CNN reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Utah GOP lawmaker says he plans to push for the state to re-adopt the firing squad for executions following a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Utah GOP lawmaker says he plans to push for the state to re-adopt the firing squad for executions following a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma.", "title": "Bring back firing squad executions, Utah lawmaker says", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/17/bring-back-firing-squad-executions-utah-lawmaker-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/17/wolverine3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/17/wolverine3.jpg", "description": "A Utah GOP lawmaker says he plans to push for the state to re-adopt the firing squad for executions following a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bring back firing squad executions, Utah lawmaker says"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Paul Ray"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6a16\"", "article_summary": "A Utah GOP lawmaker says he plans to push for the state to re-adopt the firing squad for executions following a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma.\nRep.
