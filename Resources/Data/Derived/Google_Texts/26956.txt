To provide the best patient care, and face challenges in the shift to pay-for-performance, the University of Mississippi Medical Center developed a Clinical Documentation Excellence program. The program supports clinicians at the academic department level in the effort to create the most complete, accurate and timely documentation for services.

It also focuses on how documentation can help achieve success with value-based purchasing ICD-10 and other quality imperatives.

John Showalter, chief health information officer at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and Leigh Williams, administrator for business systems for the University of Virginia Health System, discuss these topics and more in the following presentation.
