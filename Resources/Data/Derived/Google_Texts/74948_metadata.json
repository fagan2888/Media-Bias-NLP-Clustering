The union marked the occasion with a \u201cnational town hall\u201d event for adjuncts at Georgetown University here.\n\nIf a million adjuncts sounds like a lofty goal, it is. But adjuncts and organizers in attendance said they\u2019d been encouraged by the fact that SEIU\u2019s Adjunct Action organizing campaign is on the ground in nine cities, and that more than half the adjuncts in Washington, the campaign\u2019s original city, have now either formed or filed for elections for unions affiliated with SEIU.\n\nThat includes Georgetown adjuncts, who won their union bid last year and are now negotiating their first contract. And after working to establish unions at individual campuses, Washington-area adjuncts are now in talks with SEIU about a city-wide union. It\u2019s a model the union and its affiliated adjuncts would like to replicate elsewhere, including Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle and Los Angeles.\n\nMary Kay Henry, president of SEIU, called the website a \u201cnew way to organize in a changing world,\u201d and to eschew some of the traditional problems adjuncts have had with organizing, such as lack of office space and a kind of commuter status. By connecting with adjuncts on their campuses and in other states through the new online forum, she said, there\u2019s potential for adjuncts to \u201clight up the entire country.\u201d\n\nOf the Adjunct Action organizing campaign itself, Henry said it reflects at once the brokenness of \u201cAmerica's promise\u201d \u2013 that is, that education is one\u2019s path to a better life \u2013 and the \u201cinability\u201d of adjuncts to accept that brokenness.\n\nSpeakers at the town hall, including U.S. Rep. George Miller, a California Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce who has been adjuncts\u2019 biggest ally in Congress, said adjuncts can\u2019t passively wait for the changes they want to see in their pay and working conditions and instead must lead the charge.\n\nAnd because organizations have more sway than individuals, unionization is \u201cthe only way this can be done,\u201d Miller said. He noted that there already was growing interest among his Democratic colleagues in the plight of adjuncts, thanks to an \u201caccidental moment in history\u201d with Maria Maisto in November. Maisto, president of the New Faculty Majority, a national adjunct advocacy group, had been invited to testify before the education committee about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on higher education.\n\nBut Maisto soon redirected the conversation to more general concerns about adjuncts \u2013 their relatively low pay and overall poor working conditions, and their impact on student success.\n\nMiller said he and other legislators were \u201cstunned\u201d by the revelations, especially because universities seem to be \u201cforward-thinking\u201d employers who presumably would have sounder employment standards. \u201cIt sent us the signal that there was something very, very wrong here.\u201d\n\nThe testimony sparked a report from Miller\u2019s office on adjuncts, called the \u201cJust-in-Time Professor,\u201d based on existing research and adjuncts\u2019 responses to an online forum about their working conditions.\n\nMiller said the status of adjuncts raises \u201cvery serious ethics and transparency issues.\u201d\n\nParents \u2013 especially those who go into debt to send their children to college \u2013 would do well to know more about the exact conditions under which the majority of professors work, he said. And as a policy maker, he\u2019d like to know the \u201ctradeoffs\u201d institutions have made \u2013 that is, where tuition and public money is going if not into front-line instruction.\n\nBut Congress can do only so much, Miller said, calling organizing \u201ccritical.\u201d\n\nAt one adjunct\u2019s suggestion that Congress ask college and university accreditors to consider adjunct working conditions, for example, Miller said \u201ctitanic fights\u201d ensue when legislators try to intervene in that realm.\n\nHenry said adjuncts themselves can better demand that kind of \u201caccountability\u201d from accreditors. Maisto, who attended the town hall, said the New Faculty Majority and other adjunct advocates already have begun to address the issue with the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.\n\nAdjuncts on the panel agreed. Tiffany Kraft, an adjunct professor of English at Washington State's Clark College, whose faculty union is affiliated with the National Education Association, said adjuncts were \u201cimplicit accomplices\u201d in their own struggle if they failed to take a stand, especially given their potential for organizing power -- estimated at about 75 percent of instructors across higher education. (Note: This paragraph has been updated to reflect that Clark College full-time faculty and adjuncts currently are represented by the NEA.)\n\nKerry Danner-McDonald, an adjunct professor of theology at Georgetown, acknowledged additional barriers to organizing beyond logistics.\n\nShe said that colleagues at scholarly conferences expressed that tell-tale \u201coh\u201d sound upon hearing she was an adjunct, and that she \u201cwasn\u2019t ready to go through that yet with my students,\u201d or \u201cout\u201d herself as an adjunct to them, during the union drive there.\n\nBut she eventually realized she needed to fight for her professional future, a sense heightened by the realization that she has \u201cno college savings\u201d for her daughter, who has expressed an interest in attending Georgetown.\n\nAudience members shared similar accounts of disconnect between their work and their economic realities. One adjunct working at a community college said she\u2019d had to visit a food pantry to feed her children after a divorce.\n\nAnd Jane Harty, a self-proclaimed \u201ccareer adjunct\u201d professor of music at Pacific Lutheran University, said she was still making $11,000 a year, at half-time, after decades at the institution. Harty and her fellow Pacific Lutheran adjuncts have held their union vote but have had their ballots impounded pending the university\u2019s legal argument that it is outside National Labor Relations Board jurisdiction due to its religious status.\n\nJaimie Hoffman, an adjunct professor of communications at California State University-Channel Islands, said she risked losing eligibility for a federal loan-forgiveness program related to public service should her course load dip below the 30-hour-per-week mark at any time in the next 10 years. Given the lack of control over her schedule, that\u2019s entirely possible, she said, noting the irony that in her former job as an administrator at the college, that wasn\u2019t a fear.\n\nMiller attributed part of that problem to the way individual colleges count adjuncts\u2019 hours. That\u2019s been a recent point of contention in relation to the Affordable Care Act. College associations pushed for months for federal guidance, which recently was issued.\n\nDonya Coldwell, adjunct professor of world literature at Saint Joseph\u2019s College, in Philadelphia, said the at-times difficult-to-swallow message that adjuncts must fight for the changes they want to see was \u201ctrue.\u201d At the same time, she said, \"it\u2019s really difficult to act.\u201d\n\nGiven that they lack job security, it\u2019s hard to persuade adjuncts to go out on a limb and organize, she said, and sometimes only small numbers of adjuncts being willing to do so can weaken the cause.\n\nBut she said she hoped the new Adjunct Action website would make it a bit easier to drum up support.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t picket with three people,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/03/25/union-event-focuses-adjuncts-role-changing-their-own-working-conditions", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hoping to reach an estimated 1 million adjuncts, a national union launches new networking site at a Georgetown University town hall.", "title": "Union event focuses on adjuncts' role in changing their own working conditions"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "Hoping to reach an estimated 1 million adjuncts, a national union launches new networking site at a Georgetown University town hall.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf0c\"", "article_summary": "And after working to establish unions at individual campuses, Washington-area adjuncts are now in talks with SEIU about a city-wide union.\nOne adjunct working at a community college said she\u2019d had to visit a food pantry to feed her children after a divorce.\nThe union marked the occasion with a \u201cnational town hall\u201d event for adjuncts at Georgetown University here.\nIt\u2019s a model the union and its affiliated adjuncts would like to replicate elsewhere, including Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle and Los Angeles.\nThat includes Georgetown adjuncts, who won their union bid last year and are now negotiating their first contract."}
