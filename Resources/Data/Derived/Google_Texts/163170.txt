On the final day for state Senators to file bills for the session, Senators Shirley Randleman, Joyce Krawiec, and Warren Daniel teamed up to introduce the Women and Children’s Protection Act of 2015.

Senate Bill 604 would impose new requirements on doctors performing abortions and stipulate that abortion clinics have in place written agreements with area-hospitals to accept the transfer of patients who are in need of emergency care.

The bill also would appropriate $500,000 from the General Fund to establish a perinatal resource care program at UNC Hospitals to serve families with complications.

NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina said SB 604 was nothing more than anti-choice politics. Here’s more from the statement the organization released Thursday afternoon:

‘Today, we ask that our legislators focus their energy on women’s health, not politics. NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina’s top priority is to protect comprehensive reproductive healthcare access. While 7 in 10 Americans believe in protecting a woman’s fundamental rights, the majority of North Carolina counties do not have access to an abortion provider. SB 604 will only further restrict access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina agrees that women should receive reproductive healthcare in the safest possible environment, and that doctors should be free to provide the best medical care for every patient’s individual needs. SB 604 will make it more difficult for patients to receive the quality care they deserve. On the surface these regulations may seem mundane, but in reality, their purpose is to block women’s access to abortion. We agree with previous statements made by legislative leaders that the General Assembly should not be practicing medicine.’
