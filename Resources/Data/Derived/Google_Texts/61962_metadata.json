A majority of Americans think she\u2019s lying about her time as secretary of state and what she\u2019s done since, according to a Fox News poll. As the scandal hounds her, she\u2019s trying to lose the scent by announcing a plan to expand and improve ObamaCare. Trouble is, her health claims are whoppers, too.\n\nPraising ObamaCare, she told a Baton Rouge, La., campaign audience, \u201cfewer people without insurance leads to fewer visits to the emergency room.\u201d That isn\u2019t true \u2014 just another broken ObamaCare promise.\n\nEmergency-room use is rising, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians, because people enrolled in ObamaCare or added to Medicaid rolls still can\u2019t find a doctor.\n\nOr their deductible is so gigantic they can\u2019t afford to actually go to the doctor. For an \u201caffordable\u201d ObamaCare bronze plan, the average deductible is $5,200 for a single person and $10,500 for a family.\n\nA healthy 30-something guy has to shell out $5,200 of his own money after paying premiums before he\u2019s covered. Even higher-priced silver plans have staggering deductibles: $2,900 for individuals and $6,000 for family plans.\n\nPeople who get coverage through an employer are getting clobbered with higher deductibles, too. The health law makes employer-provided health insurance more expensive. It makes preventive services such as mammograms and colonoscopies \u201cfree\u201d (translation: no copays).\n\nAlso, it forces insurers to cover \u201cessential benefits\u201d \u2014 costly items such as substance-abuse treatment and pregnancy coverage that many people don\u2019t need. To pay for these provisions, insurers have raised deductibles a huge 67 percent since 2010.\n\nAll told, ObamaCare has made going to the doctor pricey, even if you\u2019re \u201ccovered.\u201d\n\nEnter Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s got a pie-in-the-sky solution that would actually drive up costs. Clinton proposes forcing plans to cover three doctor visits before your deductible kicks in. Three \u201cfree\u201d visits.\n\nSorry, they\u2019re not free. The cost will get added on to everyone\u2019s premiums. You\u2019ll be paying for those visits whether you need a doctor or not. The more your plan covers, the higher your premium. Clinton assumes we\u2019re too stupid to figure that out.\n\nSame is true of her proposal to limit out-of-pocket prescription-drug costs to $250 a month. The tooth fairy won\u2019t be paying the rest. You will, through a higher premium.\n\nHillary Clinton needs a dose of truth serum before she rolls out her promised plan to expand ObamaCare.\n\nAbout 9.1 million Americans will be enrolled by year\u2019s end. That leaves an estimated 10.5 million uninsured people who are eligible but won\u2019t sign up. They\u2019d rather make a car payment or just see it as a lousy deal.\n\nThe Obama administration is using street fairs, television ads and (of course) financial penalties to coax people into enrolling. But the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 90 percent of the uninsured will weasel out of any penalties thanks to dozens of exemptions the administration offers. The White House is allowing people to say \u201cno\u201d to insurance after all.\n\nDon\u2019t expect that from a Hillary Clinton administration. In 1994, when she proposed her Health Security Act, she said anyone who showed up at a doctor\u2019s office without insurance would be automatically enrolled. People who failed to pay the premium could have their wages garnished.\n\nIn 2007, during the Democratic primary contest, Clinton and President Obama clashed on this issue. She bragged that her plan achieved \u201cuniversal\u201d coverage because it was mandatory and would have \u201can enforcement mechanism.\u201d Then she attacked Obama\u2019s plan for allowing millions to stay uninsured.\n\nCount on Hillary, if she gets elected, to be the health-care commissar. If her past is any indication, she\u2019ll track down and punish anyone who goes without insurance. But don\u2019t expect her to disclose her intentions before Election Day.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is the author of \u201cBeating ObamaCare\u201d and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Last week brought more disturbing revelations about Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s e-mails.
