Sander Levin (Mich.) and Linda Sanchez (Calif.) \u2014 expressed doubts that a compromise could be reached that would gain their support.\n\nLevin, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that he isn\u2019t \"optimistic that this committee will produce a product I can support.\"\n\nLevin said that he is concerned a conference report will retain what he called \u201cvery troubling changes to the negotiating objectives in TPA [trade promotion authority]\u2014 on core issues like climate change, human trafficking and immigration.\u201d\n\nHe said that the climate provisions could prevent a multilateral agreement from being incorporated into the text of trade agreements or from negotiating fuel efficiency standards on a U.S. trade deal with the European Union.\n\nWyden joined Levin in reiterating that environmental protections are a major priority for him and many Democrats.\n\n\"This bill cannot and will not in any way prevent the United States from negotiating climate agreements,\" he said.\n\nLevin also pointed to human trafficking language that would allow for fast-tracking trade agreements through Congress with countries that have major human rights issues as long as that country \u201chas taken concrete actions\u201d to implement sweeping changes regardless of the actual conditions on the ground.\n\nHe also expressed concern that a currency manipulation provision aimed at punishing violators with additional duties on their imports is expected to get the axe.\n\nThat language, offered by Sen. Charles Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Healthcare: House, Senate on collision course over Zika funding Ryan goes all-in on Puerto Rico Cruz's dad: Trump 'would be worse than Hillary Clinton' MORE (D-N.Y.), was never expected to survive a conference because it is opposed by the White House.\n\nLevin said the language addressing currency that is expected to survive \"will do nothing to move the needle on this key issue.\"\n\n\u201cAnd while the conference report will likely include several provisions intended to strengthen the enforcement of U.S. trade agreements, those provisions are being oversold,\" Levin said.\n\nOverall, the measure reauthorizes the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, streamlines trade rules that aim to keep importers from skirting U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties, adds new protections for intellectual property rights and provides more tools to identify and address currency manipulation.\n\n\"Too often, companies sneak counterfeit goods past our borders,\" Wyden said. \"Foreign governments spy on our businesses and enforcers. They bully our firms into relocating jobs and turning over intellectual property,\" he said.\n\n\"They try to undercut American industries so quickly that the U.S. is unable to act before it\u2019s too late.\"\n\nAmong other priorities, Wyden said the legislation \"absolutely must close an egregious loophole that allowed products made with slave and child labor to be imported to the U.S.\"\n\nHe said the final deal also must include the new trust fund for trade enforcement and must make the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center a permanent agency.\n\nHatch said he hopes a final deal also will provide additional trade preferences to help Nepal recover from a devastating earthquake earlier this year.\n\nThe measure also is expected to include a new process to consider a Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, or, at least define a clear path forward.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "House and Senate lawmakers are nearing an agreement on a customs enforcement measure.", "description": "House and Senate lawmakers are nearing an agreement on a customs enforcement measure.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "House and Senate lawmakers are nearing an agreement on a customs enforcement measure.", "title": "Customs bill could reach finish line this week", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/262395-customs-bill-could-reach-finish-line-this-week", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/262395-customs-bill-could-reach-finish-line-this-week", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-07T20:25-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Vicki Needham", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T20:25:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "keywords": "Ron Wyden, Fast track, Senate Finance Committee, Orrin Hatch, Kevin Brady, John Cornyn, Sander Levin, Linda S\u00e1nchez, customs,Charles Schumer, Orrin Hatch, Kevin Brady, John Cornyn, Ron Wyden,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/262395-customs-bill-could-reach-finish-line-this-week", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "House and Senate lawmakers are nearing an agreement on a customs enforcement measure.", "card": "summary", "title": "Customs bill could reach finish line this week"}, "dcterms.title": "Customs bill could reach finish line this week"}, "article_summary": "House and Senate lawmakers are nearing an agreement on a customs enforcement measure, even amid some Democratic dissent, which would wrap up another key piece of President Obama\u2019s legislative trade agenda.\n\"This bill cannot and will not in any way prevent the United States from negotiating climate agreements,\" he said.\n\u201cAnd while the conference report will likely include several provisions intended to strengthen the enforcement of U.S. trade agreements, those provisions are being oversold,\" Levin said.\nThe measure also is expected to include a new process to consider a Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, or, at least define a clear path forward.\n\"This will be the strongest package of enforcement policies Congress has considered in decades,\" Wyden said."}
