A historic factory in downtown Meridian is helping people enjoy the holiday season.

This is the second annual Santa's Christmas Factory at the Soule Steam Works Museum. The historic factory transforms into the North Pole with lots of things to do for the entire family.

"We have Santa Claus for the children and there's snow flurries out in the alleyway and snow for the children to play in and a train that they can ride and all the Christmas lights and decorations for them to look at." Volunteer Lisa Young says.

The Christmas factory will be open again Thursday through Saturday afternoon from 4 until 8.
