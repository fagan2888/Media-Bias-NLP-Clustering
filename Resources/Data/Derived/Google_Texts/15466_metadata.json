Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion: \u201cNo longer may this liberty be denied.\u201d\n\nU.S. Soccer posted to Twitter: \u201cMore than ever, today we are #OneNationOneTeam #LoveWins.\u201d\n\nWambach has been married to her partner, Sarah Huffman, since 2013.\n\n\u201cObviously it impacts my life personally, but everybody on our team was super happy and excited about it. And to cap it off with a win, moving on to the semis at the World Cup, for me it doesn\u2019t get any better,\u201d Wambach said.\n\nThe United States defeated China 1-0 on Carli Lloyd\u2019s goal in the 51st minute. The win sends the second-ranked Americans to a semifinal on Tuesday in Montreal against top-ranked Germany.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling will put an end to same-sex marriage bans in the 14 states that still maintain them.\n\nUNCERTAIN PAYDAY: Australian midfielder Katrina Gorry is far more concerned about facing Japan in the Women\u2019s World Cup quarterfinal than she is about a pay dispute happening back home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to the World Cup to compete with the best teams in the world and show the world what we\u2019re capable of,\u201d Gorry said, Friday. \u201cSo all those other things will take care of themselves, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re really not focused on.\u201d\n\nGorry was responding to a question over how much the Matildas should get paid from Australia\u2019s governing body, Football Federation Australia. The players\u2019 union, Professional Football Australia, has put off discussions on the national women\u2019s team pay to instead deal with the more pressing issue of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement for the country\u2019s pro men\u2019s league.\n\nGorry said the women\u2019s team has tuned out much of the chatter about the talks.\n\n\u201cWe are just kind of in our own little clam,\u201d she said.\n\nMAYBE HE\u2019LL WEAR A COAT: Australian coach Alen Stajcic scoffs at questions about how hot it might get on the field in Edmonton for his team\u2019s quarterfinal match against Japan on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wambach says US win caps historic gay marriage day", "title": "Wambach says US win caps historic gay marriage day", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Wambach says US win caps historic gay marriage day", "title": "Wambach says US win caps historic gay marriage day", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/27/wambach_says_us_win_caps_historic_gay_marriage_day/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/wwcup-us-china-soccer.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wambach says US win caps historic gay marriage day", "title": "Wambach says US win caps historic gay marriage day", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/wwcup-us-china-soccer.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anne M.
