Chris Christie, a Republican presidential hopeful, holds a town hall meeting at Newick's restaurant in Dover with Maine Gov. Paul LePage on Sunday. (DAN TUOHY/Union Leader)\n\nChristie hosts town hall in Dover\n\n\n\n\u2014 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, with Maine Gov. Paul LePage as an ideological wingman at a town hall event in Dover on Sunday, said a no-nonsense, conservative message is key to winning the presidency.\n\n..\n\nThe two promoted limited government and strict adherence to constitutional principles.\n\n\n\n\"Political correctness has run amok,\" Christie said Sunday at his 22nd town hall meeting in New Hampshire at Newick's Lobster House in Dover.\n\n..\n\nLePage, a two-term tea party Republican elected with Christie's support, gave a nod to the presidential hopeful's campaign slogan, \"Telling it like it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nChristie pointed to the Affordable Care Act as an exhibit of the federal government's intrusion into American lives. He called \u201cObamacare\u201d a disaster, one that he would repeal if elected.\n\n..\n\nChristie said \"health care\" is nowhere in the U.S. Constitution, which is why states should implement their own versions.\n\n\n\nOne size does not fit all, LePage said. Health care and education should be state-only issues, and not handled at all on the federal level, according to LePage.\n\n..\n\nChristie voiced support for increased border security, including electronic surveillance, but stopped shy of calling for a wall along the entire border with Mexico. He said the Department of Homeland Security must fully vet every refugee the U.S. accepts from war-torn Syrian.\n\n..\n\nHe also criticized the Iran nuclear deal, saying it would be a boon to a known state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n\n\nHe told his audience to be wary of any presidential candidate who promises to repeal the Iran agreement on the first day they sit in the White House, because the future may pose some complexities unknown at this time.\n\n..\n\nThere is one certainty, Christie said. \u201cIran will cheat on that deal, as sure as the sun will rise in the morning,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Christie visited the Hampton Beach Seafood Festival.\n\n\n\nToday, he is scheduled to visit the Farm & Flower Market and the William B. Cashin Senior Center in Manchester. Mayor Ted Gatsas will accompany him at both stops.\n\n..\n\ndtuohy@unionleader.com\n\n\n\n\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey Gov.
