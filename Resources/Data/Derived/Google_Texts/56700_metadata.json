Hobby Lobby, in which the Supreme Court found that a closely-held, for-profit employer with a religious objection and no possibility of receiving an \u201caccommodation\u201d from the government could challenge the Obamacare mandate as a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. This law prohibits the government from substantially burdening the free exercise of religion unless it can show that the burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.\n\nHundreds of for-profit and non-profit employers have attacked this mandate since it was issued by the Obama administration in 2011. Until now, the for-profit and non-profit cases have received different treatment in the courts. This is due to a so-called \u201caccommodation\u201d from the mandate the administration offers to non-profit religious employers.\n\nTo get the accommodation, employers must notify the Department of Health and Human Services that they have a religious objection to providing or paying for coverage of contraceptives. This initiates the process of the government forcing insurers and third-party administrators to provide the mandated coverage to employees. Notre Dame challenged the accommodation, arguing that the causal link between giving notice to the government and the resulting provision of contraception substantially burdens its religious exercise.\n\nIn the Hobby Lobby decision, Justice Samuel Alito pointed to the existence of this accommodation as evidence that the Obamacare mandate failed the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d prong of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. At the time, some saw this as a sign that the Supreme Court may rule in favor of the administration in a future accommodation case. In fact, in another non-profit case, the administration maintained that the accommodation was the \u201clinchpin of the court\u2019s very specific holding in Hobby Lobby.\u201d\n\nBut now the Court instructed the Seventh Circuit to reconsider its ruling against Notre Dame in light of Hobby Lobby. As Notre Dame has argued:\n\n[W]hile Hobby Lobby squarely held that it is left to plaintiffs to determine whether an act \u201cis connected\u201d to illicit conduct \u201cin a way that is sufficient to make it immoral,\u201d \u2026 the Seventh Circuit confidently assured the University that the accommodation allowed it to \u201cwash[ ] its hands of any involvement in contraceptive coverage\u2026\n\nFurther, the lower court\u2019s decision inappropriately focused on the actions Notre Dame must take (filling out a form to certify its religious objection to the mandate) instead of the consequences of not complying: $250 million per year in fines for failure to comply or $10 million per year if Notre Dame chose to drop its employee health plan altogether.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s action is good news for the challengers\u2014and for religious liberty. You don\u2019t have to agree with Notre Dame, Geneva College, Ave Maria University, the Little Sisters of the Poor or the many other challengers to recognize that the government should not be able to force Americans to choose between their religious beliefs and the law. But that\u2019s exactly what this mandate does.\n\nNow the ball is back in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s court. Whatever happens, this likely won\u2019t be the last we hear from Notre Dame, or the Supreme Court, on the accommodation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court orders circuit court to reconsider case.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Supreme Court orders circuit court to reconsider case.", "title": "Should Notre Dame Have to Provide Contraception?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/notredame.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-10T17:40:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MpsOHu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Supreme Court orders circuit court to reconsider case.", "title": "Should Notre Dame Have to Provide Contraception?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/notredame.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-03-10T16:32:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-10T17:40:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "notre dame, Burwell v.
