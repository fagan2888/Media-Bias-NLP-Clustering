He was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day.\n\nAfter the Rockies\u2019 game Friday night in Denver, Lyles was in a car accident. He was not driving, but he did receive cuts to his face, Weiss said.\n\n\u201cIt was a minor accident. But he doesn\u2019t look real pretty,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nLyles was set to begin a rehab stint with the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox on Friday. And the Rockies thought he could return to the big-league roster by the end of July.\n\nBut, after 43 days already on the disabled list, Lyles will be out at least 17 more days. It\u2019s unclear the setback will affect his rehab schedule.\n\n\u201cHis hand showed he needed more time,\u201d Weiss said of Lyles\u2019s X-Ray results this weekend.\n\nLyles\u2019 move to the DL allowed the Rockies to bring back pitcher Brett Anderson to their 40-man roster to pitch Sunday, when Colorado hosts the Twins at 2:10 p.m. MT.\n\nTo make room on their game-day roster for Anderson, the Rockies dropped infielder Kyle Parker back to Triple-A Colorado Springs.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb66a\"", "article_summary": "But, after 43 days already on the disabled list, Lyles will be out at least 17 more days.\nRight-handed pitcher Jordan Lyles on Sunday was moved to the Rockies\u2018 60-day disabled list after tests revealed his broken hand was not fully healed, manager Walt Weiss said.\nTo make room on their game-day roster for Anderson, the Rockies dropped infielder Kyle Parker back to Triple-A Colorado Springs.\nLyles was set to begin a rehab stint with the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox on Friday.\nHe was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day."}
