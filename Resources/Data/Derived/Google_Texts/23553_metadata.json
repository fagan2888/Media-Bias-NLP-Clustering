(Photo by Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP) Associated Press\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how private equity professionals would welcome the superpowers possessed by the fictional Scott Lang, also known as Ant Man. One of Marvel\u2019s lesser known superheroes, Ant Man is finally getting his spot in the sun, thanks to the eponymous Walt Disney film that debuted at the box office earlier this month.\n\nHowever, at least a few private equity professionals have at one time waxed nostalgic over other superpowers that they would like to possess.\n\nIn the latest installment of our Private Equity Pop Quiz series, we culled responses from The Private Equity Analyst\u2019s popular Private Word column to find out what superpowers private equity professionals would want most.\n\nSee if you can match the private equity professional to his desired superpower. You will find the answers in Monday\u2019s Morning Leverage blog post.\n\nIf you could have one superpower what would you choose and why?\n\n1) The ability to fly \u2013 it has to be the most fun, plus no more airport security.\n\n2) I would like to be able to slow down time to enable me to more fully appreciate all the beautiful people and experiences that I am privileged to have in my life.\n\n3) I would want the ability to spend a single day with various people and at various places in the past \u2013 Agincourt before the battle, my hometown on a regular day in say 1820 \u2013 to see what it was really like. And for people from American history \u2013 say Washington and Joseph Plum Martin, who was a regular soldier in the Revolution and wrote about his experiences \u2013 to spend a day with me and see how the country came along.\n\n4) I wish I didn\u2019t sleep! There are so many things I still want to learn and needing seven hours of sleep a night is an impediment to getting to all of them.\n\n5) Wolverine. As I get older, the years of wear and tear are accumulating. If I could heal anything in only a few seconds, it would be incredible. Of course, I would not want the metal claws \u2013 those are way too dangerous.\n\nPrivate equity professionals:\n\n\n\nA) John Toomey Jr., managing director, HarbourVest Partners (March 2014)\n\nB) John LeClaire, co-chair of the private equity practice at Goodwin Procter (April 2011)\n\nC) Deven Parekh, managing director, Insight Venture Partners (April 2014)\n\nD) Chris Hoehn-Saric, co-founder and senior managing director, Sterling Partners (May 2013)\n\nE) Marc der Kinderen, co-founder and managing partner, 747 Capital (August 2011)", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The latest installment in our summer series of pop quizzes about the personalities and habits of private equity professionals.", "title": "Private Equity Pop Quiz: PE Pros\u2019 Favorite Superpowers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/07/24/private-equity-pop-quiz-pe-pros-favorite-superpowers/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JN881_antman_P_20150724105623.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Private Equity Pop Quiz: PE Pros\u2019 Favorite Superpowers", "description": "The latest installment in our summer series of pop quizzes about the personalities and habits of private equity professionals.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "The latest installment in our summer series of pop quizzes about the personalities and habits of private equity professionals.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-07-24T18:42:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/07/24/private-equity-pop-quiz-pe-pros-favorite-superpowers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18700", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The latest installment in our summer series of pop quizzes about the personalities and habits of private equity professionals.", "title": "Private Equity Pop Quiz: PE Pros\u2019 Favorite Superpowers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/07/24/private-equity-pop-quiz-pe-pros-favorite-superpowers/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JN881_antman_P_20150724105623.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18700", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-07-24T18:43:17-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ed1\"", "article_summary": "In the latest installment of our Private Equity Pop Quiz series, we culled responses from The Private Equity Analyst\u2019s popular Private Word column to find out what superpowers private equity professionals would want most.\nHowever, at least a few private equity professionals have at one time waxed nostalgic over other superpowers that they would like to possess.\nSee if you can match the private equity professional to his desired superpower.\n(Photo by Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP) Associated PressIt\u2019s hard to say how private equity professionals would welcome the superpowers possessed by the fictional Scott Lang, also known as Ant Man.\nPrivate equity professionals:A) John Toomey Jr., managing director, HarbourVest Partners (March 2014)B) John LeClaire, co-chair of the private equity practice at Goodwin Procter (April 2011)C) Deven Parekh, managing director, Insight Venture Partners (April 2014)D) Chris Hoehn-Saric, co-founder and senior managing director, Sterling Partners (May 2013)E) Marc der Kinderen, co-founder and managing partner, 747 Capital (August 2011)"}
