The record was tied last year, when 17 died in boating accidents.\n\nThe body of 44-year-old George \u201cRobby\u201d Loving was recovered from a lake outside the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs on June 27 after witnesses saw someone trying to swim across the lake, according to police.\n\nThe body recovered Sunday is the second found in the South Platte.\n\nJoseph Goodwin, 20, was found June 28, after he fell off his inner tube and into the river in Sheridan on June 20.\n\nCody Pierce, 19, of Albuquerque drowned in the high-running Animas River in late June.\n\nAn intoxicated 55-year-old Federal Heights man died Friday after he fell from his camp chair, hit his head on his RV, tumbled down an embankment and landed facedown in the Big Thompson River.\n\nDavid Lee Howard drowned within minutes in shallow water, according to Greg Fairman, Larimer County deputy coroner and investigator.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Police investigate body in South Platte", "title": "Denver Police investigate body in South Platte", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/05/denver-police-investigate-body-in-south-platte/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150706__i-BgbCMk9-Lp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150706__i-BgbCMk9-Lp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-05T09:52:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T16:28:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Water"}, "article_summary": "The body was pulled from the river near the 900 block of South Platte River Drive, police tweeted at about 9 a.m.\nThe death count on Colorado\u2019s swollen rivers and creeks continued to climb on Sunday as Denver police recovered a body from the South Platte River.\nThe names have not been released for either the South Platte River drowning victim or the Clear Creek victim.\nThe Platte River drowning followed an incident Saturday on Clear Creek where a 20-year-old man on a rafting trip drowned.\nThe body recovered Sunday is the second found in the South Platte."}
