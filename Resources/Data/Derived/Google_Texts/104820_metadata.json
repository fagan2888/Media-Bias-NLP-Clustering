But I believe the administration is just trying to prepare for whatever could happen and make sure that we\u2019re strong.\u201d\n\nClinic officials tell Fox 8 their situation is not unique, as hospitals nationwide are being forced to cut back due to ObamaCare.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney did not comment when asked about the budget cuts to the Cleveland Clinic at a press briefing.\n\nClick for more from Fox 8.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02
