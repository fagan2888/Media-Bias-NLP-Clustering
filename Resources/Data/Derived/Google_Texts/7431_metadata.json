The assistant news editor and trainee reporter were rushed to the hospital recently after taking a bite of Burger Off\u2019s \u201cXXX Hot Chili Burger\u201d. The two, who experienced extreme side effects such as lose of sensation in their limbs, claimed the ordeal made them feel like they were dying.\n\nThis Burger\u2019s No Joke\n\nBurger Off is a fast food restaurant nestled in the English seaside town of Hove, not far from Brighton. The British eatery boasts the usual lunch and dinner menu but it\u2019s the XXX Hot Chili Burger that has everyone talking. After the first bite Hendy decided that the burger was too hot to finish, but initially felt alright physically, The Argus reported. Unfortunately Barratt experienced severe stomach pains only minutes after his first chomp. Eventually Barratt lost feeling in his hands, his legs began to shake, and his eyes rolled back into his head. Two hours later the spice kicked in for Hendy and he began to have similar symptoms. \u201cIt was hard to walk. I needed to drink milk to neutralise the burning, which was hard because I was hyperventilating so much my hands had seized up,\u201d Barratt told The Argus. Both men were taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital where they received treatment for their symptons.\n\n\u201cHot\u201d Is An Understatement\n\nTo call the burger spicy is a vast understatement. The sauce used to create the monstrously hot lunchtime treat uses a concentrated piri piri chili sauce from India. The owner, Nick Gambardella estimated that the sauce is between seven to nine million units on the Scolville scale. To put this into perspective, tabasco sauce in only around 2,500 to 5,000 on the scale and pepper spray, that can bring even the largest person to their knees only reaches a mere 500,000 to five million units.\n\nPatrons Must Sign A Waiver\n\nIt may seem bizarre that an eatery would even sell a food that causes patrons to feel, as Hendy puts it, \u201clike dying.\u201d Gambardella insists that Burger Off does \u201ctry and take a certain level of responsibility.\u201d The burger isn\u2019t available to those under the age of 18, and for those adults brave enough to try a bite, Gambardella has them sign a waiver first. \u201cI spend about as much time convincing people not to try one as I do selling them. I tell people it will ruin their weekend,\u201d Gambardella told The Argus.\n\nSpice Tolerance\n\nTolerance of spicy food has to do with a combination of genes and what you\u2019re used to, Popular Science reported. There is no complete research on the subject yet but scientists speculate that certain individuals are born with pain receptors less sensitive to the capsaicin, the chemical that makes spicy food so hot. Constant exposure to spicy food in childhood is also likely to have increased your ability to handle it as you get older. \u201cWe assume that continued exposure at a young age causes nerve endings to die off,\" Dr. Bruce Bryant from the Monell Chemical Senses Center told Popular Science.\n\nDeath By Chili\n\nStill messing around with food that is too spicy is no joke. \"Theoretically, one could eat enough really hot chiles to kill you,\" Paul Bosland, professor of horticulture at New Mexico State University and director of the Chile Pepper Institute told Live Science. High doses of the hot stuff can lead to increases in the metabolic rate, thermogenesis, and tissue inflammation. Death by chili pepper isn\u2019t likely to happen accidentally, thankfully. Bosland explained how \u201cone's body would react sooner and not allow it to happen.\u201d So unless you consume about three pounds of chilies in one sitting, you\u2019re probably going to make it out alive.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "xxx, hot, chili, burger, sends, uk, journalists, hospital, after, causing, them, lose, feeling", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One British eatery boosts a burger so hot that brave patrons must sign a waiver before eating it, and two adventurous journalists found out why.", "title": "Extra Spicy Burger Sends Journalists To The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/xxx-hot-chili-burger-sends-uk-journalists-hospital-after-causing-them-lose-feeling-hands-292566", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/11/burger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One British eatery boosts a burger so hot that brave patrons must sign a waiver before eating it, and two adventurous journalists found out why.", "title": "Extra Spicy Burger Sends Journalists To The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/xxx-hot-chili-burger-sends-uk-journalists-hospital-after-causing-them-lose-feeling-hands-292566", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/11/burger.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/11/burger.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-07-11T10:39:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-11T10:39:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One British eatery boosts a burger so hot that brave patrons must sign a waiver before eating it, and two adventurous journalists found out why."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cb3\"", "article_summary": "The assistant news editor and trainee reporter were rushed to the hospital recently after taking a bite of Burger Off\u2019s \u201cXXX Hot Chili Burger\u201d.\nThe British eatery boasts the usual lunch and dinner menu but it\u2019s the XXX Hot Chili Burger that has everyone talking.\nThe sauce used to create the monstrously hot lunchtime treat uses a concentrated piri piri chili sauce from India.\nSpice ToleranceTolerance of spicy food has to do with a combination of genes and what you\u2019re used to, Popular Science reported.\nConstant exposure to spicy food in childhood is also likely to have increased your ability to handle it as you get older."}
