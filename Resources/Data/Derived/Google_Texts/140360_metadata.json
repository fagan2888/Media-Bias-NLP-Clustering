The Democratic lawmakers declared opposition to Florida Governor Rick Scott\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid.\n\nIf the Medicaid debate goes unresolved, Brown warns it might fall on local taxpayers to keep hospitals operating.\n\nListen to the version of this story that aired on 89.9 FM\n\nCongresswoman Brown stood outside UF Health Jax with a jar of dollar bills. One by one, she pulled them out to show how the federal government is spending some of it on Floridians through programs like federal housing assistance.\n\n\u201cThis represents Florida tax dollars,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t want $55 billion of tax dollars for over 2 million Floridians that need healthcare.\u201d\n\nUF Health Jacksonville\u2019s CEO says it will close without the additional federal funding. It\u2019s the only Level One Trauma center in Northeast Florida which, as Brown says, makes it crucial.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important part of our fabric,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are going to work to make sure that it does not close.\u201d\n\nBut if Florida doesn\u2019t accept help in the form of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, Brown says hospitals like UF Health will need help from the community.\n\n\u201cLocal taxpayers are going to have to come up to the plate if the state doesn\u2019t do its job,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe state Legislature will start a special session on June 1. The Florida Senate\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid is on the agenda, but the House and Governor Scott continue to oppose it.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Congresswoman Corrine Brown and several state legislators rallied in front of Jacksonville hospital on Monday.
