Connect for Health Colorado has won praise for focusing more on high-volume brokers.

The board of Connect for Health Colorado (C4HCO) is looking for health insurance sales strategy ideas in a commentary that cites the Colorado exchange as a success story.

The C4HCO board is holding a 2017 planning retreat this week as Republicans remain hostile toward the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), the outcome of the fall presidential and congressional elections is unclear, and the level of major health insurers' interest in continuing to sell individual health coverage is hazy.
