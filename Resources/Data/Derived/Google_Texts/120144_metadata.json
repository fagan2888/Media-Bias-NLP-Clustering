That, at any rate, is the fear of a growing number of Israelis. Some European pension funds have withdrawn investments; some large corporations have cancelled contracts; and the American secretary of state, John Kerry, rarely misses a chance to warn Israel that efforts to \u201cdelegitimise\u201d and boycott it will increase if its government spurns his efforts to conclude a two-state settlement of its conflict with the Palestinians. Israel, says Yair Lapid, Israel\u2019s finance minister, is approaching the same \u201ctipping point\u201d where South Africa found itself in opposition to the rest of the world in the dying days of apartheid. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d he told a conference of security boffins recently in Tel Aviv. \u201cThe world listens to us less and less.\u201d\n\nBDS has begun to grab the attention of some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions. PGGM, a big Dutch pension fund, has liquidated its holdings in five Israeli banks (though the Netherlands\u2019 largest has affirmed its investments). Norway\u2019s finance ministry has announced that it is excluding Africa Israel Investments and its subsidiary, Danya Cebus, a big building firm, from a government pension fund.\n\nThe campaign is drawing support from beyond northern Europe. Romania has forbidden its citizens from working for companies in the West Bank. More churches are backing BDS. An American academic association is boycotting Israeli lecturers. The debate turned viral after Scarlett Johansson, a Hollywood actor, quit her role as ambassador for Oxfam, a charity based in Britain, in order to keep her advertising contract with SodaStream, an Israeli drinks firm with a plant on the West Bank.\n\nMr Lapid, who favours a two-state solution, reels out figures to show how sanctions could hit every Israeli pocket. \u201cIf negotiations with the Palestinians stall or blow up and we enter the reality of a European boycott, even a very partial one,\u201d he warned, 10,000 Israelis would \u201cimmediately\u201d lose their jobs. Trade with the European Union, a third of Israel\u2019s total, would slump\u2014he calculates\u2014by $5.7 billion.\n\nAnxious to hold on to their markets, Israel\u2019s businessmen are increasingly backing the peace camp. The names on a recent advertising campaign in its favour included such luminaries as the head of Google in Israel. Hitherto they had usually preferred to stay out of politics.\n\nIsrael\u2019s government is divided over how to react to the BDS campaign. The finance ministry has temporarily shelved a report it said it would publish on the possible consequences of BDS. But Israel\u2019s press and ministerial addresses are increasingly full of worried references to it.\n\nSome Israelis argue that this publicity merely feeds the BDS campaign, others that isolation has benefits. Israel\u2019s position as a hotbed of hi-tech start-ups is due in part to decades of circumventing Arab boycotts. A French arms ban in the 1960s sparked the development of its weapons industry, helping to catapult Israel into fourth place in the world\u2019s league of arms exporters. And if the West turns its back on Israel, there is, they say, the east. Relations with India have warmed of late, and those with China are getting closer. The economy minister, Naftali Bennett, a sceptic of the peace process, recently toured the Far East, saying he was bringing a \u201clight to the gentiles\u201d by way of Israeli business. But Mr Bennett is in a minority on BDS: his colleagues are a lot less sanguine.\n\nCorrection: In the original version of this story we referred to Yair Lapid as Israel's foreign minister, when in fact he is the finance minister.
