When asked how many marketplace policyholders the company had in Kansas, Hutchings said he would have to check.\n\nThe open enrollment runs from November of this year through Jan. 31, 2016, although Dec. 15 is the last day to enroll for coverage starting Jan. 1.\n\nCoventry didn\u2019t inform Kansas Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer of its decision until a few days ago, said Clark Shultz, the department\u2019s director of government affairs.\n\n\u201cWe are so close to open enrollment, this is very last minute,\u201d Shultz said. \u201cIt has really taken us by surprise.\u201d\n\nShultz said that Selzer plans to meet with Coventry officials this week to gain a better understanding of their reasons for withdrawing.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have a good handle on them yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve just said it was for a combination of reasons.\u201d\n\nIn August, Selzer reduced rate increases requested by Coventry and the other companies participating in the marketplace. Coventry sought increases of 20 percent to 35 percent, depending on the plan.\n\nA media release issued by the department didn\u2019t specify how Selzer dealt with Coventry\u2019s requests but said overall that he had reduced the proposed increases by an average of 9.4 percent to 25.4 percent.\n\nHutchings didn\u2019t answer directly when asked if the reductions played a role in the company\u2019s decision. He simply reiterated that it was based on multiple factors, including \u201cmarket conditions and the competitive landscape.\u201d\n\nThe two Coventry companies were among six insurers set to offer plans in the Kansas marketplace. Those remaining are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, BlueCross and BlueShield Kansas Solutions Inc., Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City and United Healthcare of the Midwest Inc.\n\nJim McLean is executive editor of KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A major provider of health insurance in Kansas is pulling out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
