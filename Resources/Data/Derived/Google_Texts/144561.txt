Lupe Ramos Watson’s congressional bid is over before it really began.

Citing a lack of enthusiasm among her fellow Republicans, Ramos Watson, who is Indio’s mayor, will not run against Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Palm Desert, in 2016, The Desert Sun reported.

Ramos Watson told the newspaper there was an “absolute refusal” by some local GOP clubs – she declined to say which ones – to distribute her campaign literature.

She announced her candidacy for California’s 36th Congressional District in April. At the time, she departed from many Republicans by saying Obamacare was “a better system than what we had before” and supporting immigration reform.

Ruiz, an emergency room physician, has represented the district since 2012, when he defeated longtime GOP incumbent Mary Bono. He is being targeted for defeat next year by the National Republican Congressional Committee and is getting extra help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

The district represents The Pass, Hemet, San Jacinto and the Coachella Valley. Republicans hold a slight edge in the district’s voter registration, and Ruiz carefully cultivated a moderate image during his time in Washington.

Ruiz took in more than $3.3 million to win re-election in 2014 and had almost $700,000 in his campaign fund as of late March.
