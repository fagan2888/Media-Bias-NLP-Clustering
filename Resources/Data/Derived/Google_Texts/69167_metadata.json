(I knew what the answer would be, but sometimes you just have to ask\u2026)\n\nIn fact, one of the Avalanche\u2019s \u201cproblems\u201d is that Iginla almost seems reluctant or sheepish about claiming too much leadership responsibility because he\u2019s not the player he once was. But if he\u2019s going to be around next season, even in an additionally diminished role, the Avalanche would be better off with assuring him he can take charge in that department, whether wearing a C, an A or no letter at all.\n\nIn addition to his own future, we touched on some other issues.\n\nShould the Avs blow up this team?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of good pieces, there\u2019s lots of good things. There\u2019s no question it\u2019s been a tough year for us, we\u2019ll all disappointed and we didn\u2019t accomplish the start we wanted to. But you look at Dutchy and Landy and Mac up front, they\u2019re young guys and they\u2019re just getting better. There\u2019s no question sometimes it takes a little more time or whatever to reach the top of their game, but they\u2019re still very good players. They still had good seasons, Dutchy has had a good year. He puts a lot of pressure on himself. He wants to win and be good. The drive is there.\n\n\u201cYou look at Nate, what is he, still only 20 this year? We\u2019d all like to do better, but he\u2019s only getting better. I think there\u2019s going to be a lot more great steps for him.\n\n\u201cLandy plays hard all the time, he\u2019s one of the better power forwards in the game.\n\n\u201cAnd Tyson Barrie back there, he\u2019s still a young D-man and they say young D-men take a little longer as far as getting comfortable. Those guys are all driven and they\u2019re all really good players.\n\n\u201cVarly had a good year for us, we weren\u2019t good enough in front of him.\u201d\n\nIginla went on to mention other teammates, then added: \u201cI know there\u2019s frustration, as there should be, from fans, but as players, we know we underachieved.\u201d\n\nOn the Avalanche\u2019s continuing tendency to be outshot and spend too much time in their own zone, Iginla said: It\u2019s something we have to improve on, there\u2019s no question. I don\u2019t know what the quick fix is, but it\u2019s something that we all realize, that we need to get better at that. But there\u2019s a catch. It can come at the cost of offense, and it doesn\u2019t need to be that way. You look at a lot of the successful teams, they find a way to win. You get better, you play less in your own zone. You have the puck and play more in the other zone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. We realize it\u2019s not all offense or all defense. We have to get better, more sound, all the way around. I think it will come. We don\u2019t want to face that many shots. We know that Varly\u2019s had a good year for us and we\u2019ve had to rely on our goaltending too much. You don\u2019t get to have the puck that much if they\u2019re getting that many shots. Whatever the answer is, you have to keep it down low in their zone or you have to spend less time in our own zone or the neutral zone. But we have to improve in the O-zone.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "In fact, one of the Avalanche's \"problems\" is that Iginla almost seems reluctant or sheepish about claiming too much leadership responsibility because he's not the player he once was.
