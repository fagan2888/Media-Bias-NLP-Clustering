(CBSNewYork/AP) \u2013 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is touting the budgetary benefits of Medicaid expansion under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.\n\nThe potential Republican presidential contender said Tuesday during a town hall event in Somerville that Medicaid expansion has helped save New Jersey significant money.\n\nHis budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal years calls for cutting the state\u2019s charity care aid for hospitals to $502 million from $650 million.\n\nHe said verified charity care cases are down 43 percent because more residents are now insured.\n\nChristie has been a vocal critic of Obama\u2019s signature health care program.\n\nBut he says expanding Medicaid was the right decision for New Jersey.\n\nChristie made the comments at his 130th town hall event at the Van Derveer Elementary School Gymnasium.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
