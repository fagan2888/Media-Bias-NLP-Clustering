More than 160,000 American grandparents lose grandkids each year. Yet their grief is often minimized, even by family members. "Bereaved grandparents are sometimes referred to as forgotten mourners,'' says Polly Moore, regional coordinator for The Compassionate Friends (TCF), a nonprofit that assists bereaved families. "People think it is not 'your' child that died," so the pain must be less intense. And because grandparents have more life experience, they are often assumed to have better skills for coping with tragedy.

Frequently, though, the grandparents' pain matches the powerful bond they have with their grandchildren, who embody a family's legacy and even a kind of immortality. Just like parents who have lost a child, grieving grandparents often feel helpless, angry and frustrated, as well as heartbroken.

Here is some advice from grief experts on making this hard journey easier.
