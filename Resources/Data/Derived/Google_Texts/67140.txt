Genstar’s MW Industries Continues Buying Spree in Metal Manufacturing with Two Deals

After recently purchasing Helical and Maudlin & Son, MW is adding Servometer and BellowsTech

Metal parts distributor MW Industries, backed by Genstar Capital, is acquiring Servometer and BellowsTech. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Both targets make metal bellows and shaft couplings for the aerospace, medical and semiconductor sectors. Servometer, a subsidiary of Precision Manufacturing Group, acquired BellowsTech in 2007. MW makes metal springs, fasteners for the aerospace, automotive and industrial industries.

MW, based in Rosemont, Illinois, made a pair of add-on acquisitions earlier in 2015 when it purchased Helical Products Co. and Maudlin & Son Manufacturing.

“We believe that both Servometer and BellowsTech are better positioned to penetrate and expand in our existing markets, including aerospace and aviation, semiconductor, medical, energy and other industrial markets,” says MW CEO Bill Marcum. Genstar acquired MW in 2011.

Buyer interest has been picking up for metal manufacturers lately. PE-backed Imaginetics LLC is buying Azmark Aerosystems LLC and ITT Corp. (NYSE: ITT) is adding Wolverine Automotive Holdings Inc.
