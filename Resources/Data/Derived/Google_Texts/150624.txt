Every Monday Fox & Friends hosts Donald Trump to free-associate about the news, and this Monday they found a doozy: Page Six has a named(!) source alleging New York Attorney General and Trump nemesis Eric Schneiderman once did coke in the mid-2000s. (Not linking to the story, you can find it.)

The source, a “Democratic activist and comic” who makes the allegation in “the manuscript of a book he hopes to have published,” presented no evidence for the claim.

That’s good enough for Page Six, and more than good enough for Trump. “They’re saying he took coke. As far as I’m concerned, he probably still does,” Trump said, using the same evidentiary standards as when he spoke about ebola and Obamacare earlier in the segment.

If you’re rich enough you can go on television and call your enemies cokeheads and no one will question you.
