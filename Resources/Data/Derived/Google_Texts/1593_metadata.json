(Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON - Insurers will seek significant premium hikes under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law this summer \u2014 stiff medicine for consumers and voters ahead of the national political conventions.\n\nExpect the state-by-state premium requests to reflect what insurers see as the bottom line: The health law has been a financial drain for many companies. They\u2019re setting the stage for 2017 hikes that could reach well into the double digits, in some cases.\n\nFor example, in Virginia, a state that reports early, nine insurers returning to the HealthCare.gov marketplace are seeking average premium increases that range from 9.4 percent to 37.1 percent. Those initial estimates filed with the state might change.\n\nMore than 12 million people nationwide get coverage though the health law\u2019s markets, which offer subsidized private insurance. But the increases could also affect several million who purchase individual policies outside the government system.\n\nGoing into their fourth year, the health law\u2019s markets are still searching for stability. That\u2019s in contrast to more established government programs like Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, in which private insurers profitably cover tens of millions of people.\n\nThe health law\u2019s nagging problems center on lower-than-hoped-for enrollment, sicker-than-expected customers and a balky internal stabilization system that didn\u2019t deliver as advertised and was already scheduled to be pared back next year.\n\nThis year, premiums for a benchmark silver plan rose by a little more than 7 percent on average, according to administration figures. A spike for 2017 would fire up the long-running political debate about the divisive law, which persists despite two Supreme Court decisions upholding Obama\u2019s signature program, as well as the president\u2019s veto of a Republican repeal bill.\n\nOf the presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton is the only one promising to build on the Affordable Care Act. She\u2019s proposed an aggressive effort to increase enrollment along with measures to reduce consumer costs. The Republican candidates all want to repeal \u201cObamacare.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would incorporate it into a bigger government-run system covering everyone.\n\nThe health law is \u201clikely in for a significant market correction over the next year or two,\u201d said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThere have been a lot of signals from insurers that premiums are headed up.\u201d\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s health insurance analyst Deep Banerjee said he expects premium hikes to be higher for 2017 than in the larger, more stable market for employer coverage. Insurers are facing higher medical costs from health law customers, and some companies priced their initial coverage too low in an attempt to grab new business.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing now is trying to catch up,\u201d Banerjee said.\n\nAetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini said Thursday that the nation\u2019s third-largest health insurer still sees a good business opportunity, but Congress needs to provide leeway for companies to design lower-cost plans tailored to young, healthy people.\n\n\u201cWe will see the dynamics of the market get tougher as we go forward if we don\u2019t get those kinds of structural changes,\u201d he said. How that would happen in a politically polarized atmosphere, Bertolini did not explain.\n\nThe administration says talk of premium increases is premature and overblown. Initial requests from insurers will get knocked back in some states, officials say, aided by a rate-review process strengthened under the health law.\n\nMost significantly, more than 8 out of 10 customers in the health law\u2019s markets get subsidies to help pay their premiums, and that financial assistance will increase as premiums rise. Many have also shown they\u2019re willing to shop around for lower-priced coverage.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
