Going door to door, the local chapter Americans for Prosperity hit the streets asking Wichitans where they stand on local and national politics. Today, nationwide, group activists took part in this effort to education Americans on some of the political items they might find on the November ballot.

One of the top questions they asked Wichitans was their thoughts on the possible one percent sales tax increase.

Susan Estes, organization member said, "we can help them find a solution and we know when to go back and talk to a city council or the capital in Topeka and make recommendations for policy changes that impact people's lives in a positive way."

Members of the local AFP said today alone, across the country, activists knocked on more than 28,000 doors and made more than 110,000 phone calls.
