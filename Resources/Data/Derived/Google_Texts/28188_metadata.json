In response, the hospital revised procedures, reorganized rooms to make sure beds could never go empty, and implemented the Flex-Flow system, under which staff could quickly move from one role to another based on need.\n\nSince the program's launch in January 2012, door-to-doctor time dropped to less than 30 minutes and the percentage of patients who left without getting treatment was cut in half, according to Know. Patient satisfaction scores are also on the upswing, with 48 percent of patients rating their service as \"excellent,\" an increase of 15 points. In addition, Brackenridge now scores in the 50th percentile of hospitals, according to the article.\n\nEventually, the hospital hopes to score in the 75th percentile and have less than 1 percent of patients leave without treatment. \"Flex-Flow cut through a lot of traditional lines and focused on what was really important,\" Loescher said. \"It's making sure people get the care they need and focusing resources on the people who need it the most. And in the end, it's also more cost-effective.\"\n\nA similar project involving a partnership between New Jersey hospitals cut wait times and stays, and is expected to reduce costs and increase revenues in New Jersey EDs, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNJ hospitals' efficiency changes reduce wait times, stays\n\nInnovation, brainstorming reduce ER wait times\n\nMajority of frequent ER users have chronic conditions, not mental illness\n\nDigital wait-time counters could reduce ER tensions", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Austin, Texas hospital improved the efficiency of its emergency department by taking inspiration from an unlikely model: the assembly line.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "An Austin, Texas hospital improved the efficiency of its emergency department by taking inspiration from an unlikely model: the assembly line.", "title": "Assembly line model helps hospital improve its ER", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/assembly-line-model-helps-hospital-improve-its-er/2013-12-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "emergency department,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction scores,Readmission Penalties", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb535\"", "article_summary": "An Austin, Texas hospital improved the efficiency of its emergency department (ED) by taking inspiration from an unlikely model: the assembly line.\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:NJ hospitals' efficiency changes reduce wait times, staysInnovation, brainstorming reduce ER wait timesMajority of frequent ER users have chronic conditions, not mental illnessDigital wait-time counters could reduce ER tensions\n\"When you're looking at efficiency in a system, you don't care about the efficiency of each part of the system,\" Loescher said.\nImplementing suggestions from Loescher, the hospital applied critical chain theory, which promotes making assembly lines as efficient as possible by identifying the \"tightest bottleneck in the chain.\"\nEventually, the hospital hopes to score in the 75th percentile and have less than 1 percent of patients leave without treatment."}
