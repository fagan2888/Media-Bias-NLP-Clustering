With temperatures in the single digits on Saturday morning, forecasters are predicting a cool day with slick roads.

The low at Denver International Airport early Saturday dipped to 5 degrees, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Mostly sunny skies are likely to warm things up slightly for a high of 40 degrees , although what is left of Fridayâ€™s snow could turn to ice and create slippery roads, forecasters said.

After cancelling a few accident alerts around the Denver region early Saturday morning, Denver police reinstated the alerts for District 3, south of 6th Avenue and east of the Platte River.

Police warned motorists to drive safely.

In the foothills and mountains, gusty winds are likely to keep temperatures chilly.

The early part of next week should warm up slightly in the metro area until Thanksgiving when colder temperatures and a chance of snow are forecasted.

Sunday should be sunny with a high of 54 degrees.

Monday could be even warmer, with a forecast high of 59 degrees and blue skies.

While Tuesday follows suit with temperatures hovering in the mid-50s, Wednesday looks to be cooler with a chance for rain and snow.
