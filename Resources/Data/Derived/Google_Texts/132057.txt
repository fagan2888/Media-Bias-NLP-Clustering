The House late Thursday passed H.J. Res. 88, the bill introduced by GOP lawmakers under the Congressional Review Act that would block the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said after the 234-183 vote in favor of the Protecting Access to Affordable Retirement Advice, that “bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. have no business getting between you and your financial planner. But that’s what the Obama administration’s fiduciary rule does.”
