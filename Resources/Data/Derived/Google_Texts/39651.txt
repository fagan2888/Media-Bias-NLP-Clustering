Denver Police are investigating after a man was shot and killed Saturday in a shopping center parking lot near the Montbello park-n-Ride, 12300 Albrook Drive.

Police spokesman Sonny Jackson said an alteration between two groups broke out on the south end of the shopping center and moved north toward the RTD park-n-Ride.

Nate Currey, RTD spokesman, said a 25-year-old man got off an RTD bus at the park-n-Ride and was shot about 20 feet from the bus around 5:30 p.m. The man, who was alone, tried to crawl back toward the bus after he was shot.

The man died from his injuries, Currey said.

Jackson said police do not believe the man killed was actually a passenger on the bus, but may have gotten on the bus briefly and then off again.

Jackson said he didn’t know how many shooters were involved.

Isaac Freyta, who was working the drive-thru window at the Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard in the shopping center, said he heard four shots through the drive-thru speaker.

A Chrysler 200 and a green Ford SUV were stopped by police, who arrived on the scene quickly, Freyta said. The SUV had both front doors open. The RTD bus was also part of the crime scene, its interior lights on and a “not in service” message displayed.

Police took several witness to the shooting downtown to be questioned, Jackson said. They also expanded the crime scene after a disturbance broke out at the Shell gas station nearby.

Denver Police tweeted Sunday that the investigation is continuing. No arrests have been made, and police released no suspect information.
