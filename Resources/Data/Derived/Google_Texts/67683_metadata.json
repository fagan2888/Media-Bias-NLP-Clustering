They studied the effect of both vaccination programs and public health initiatives, using different time points during the first 12 months of a simulated severe pandemic in a densely populated metropolitan area.\n\nIn 2009, a vaccine was developed and became available 9 months into the pandemic. Researchers found that a shorter time to vaccination \u2014 6 months instead of 9 \u2014 would avert nearly 6,000 deaths and save $1.9 billion in treatment costs. The study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine this week.\n\nInfluenza is a virus that changes its structure frequently. These subtle changes allow the virus to evade the human immune system and result in repetitive flu outbreaks. This is why each year we have to get a new flu shot.\n\nOccasionally, the flu virus undergoes a major shift in its structure, allowing a strain that normally infects only animals to make the jump to humans. These major changes make the virus so unique that our immune systems cannot recognize and fight the virus \u2014 meaning higher rates of infection and potentially causing a large regional or global pandemic.\n\nThe backbone of the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s response to an influenza pandemic is to develop and distribute an appropriate vaccine. Currently, flu vaccines are egg-based and require months for manufacturers to optimize growth conditions and produce vaccines.\n\n\u201cBest-case scenario: egg-based vaccine delivery is completed in 5 months\u201d, said Dr. Nayer Khazeni, lead author and assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Moving toward new technologies \u201ccan decrease this time by 2-3 months.\u201d\n\nPublic Health Measures Can Save Lives in Pandemic\n\nStill, regardless of the method of vaccine development, there will be a delay from the time a virus appears to delivery of a vaccine. During this time period, public health officials can limit the spread of the virus, the researchers said, possibly through school and childcare closures or even voluntary isolation. But, isolating the population until vaccines are delivered may not be practical or safe. The economic fallout alone could be detrimental.\n\nThe study found that a 33 percent decrease in contacts with infected individuals would save as many lives and reduce cost similar to vaccinating the population at 4 months into a pandemic. This could result in saving over 11,400 deaths and about $3.8 billion in health care costs compared to vaccinating at 9 months as in the 2009 flu pandemic.\n\nBrian Lau is a freelance writer and an orthopedic surgery resident at UCSF medical center.
