Click the link and see.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., April 28, 2016 \u2014 Are you trying to decide, \u201cWho am I? Which candidate should I support? What are my issues? If I were president for a day, what would I do?\u201d\n\nA recent GOP survey of the issues might give you a running start in determining how closely you are aligned with conservative issues and the various candidate positions. The \u201cExit Poll Ballot,\u201d issued by Jesse Kamzol, national data director for the Republican National Committee, asks respondents to begin by clicking on a candidate.\n\nThe survey issues are presented here without the candidate decision. It\u2019s assumed that respondents will lean right. Crossover voters, of course, may also find this list useful as they consider switching teams.\n\nCruz chose Fiorina over far better options\n\nThe survey concentrates only on issues, a refreshing slice of reality in a record-breakingly odd campaign year. Nowhere in this list will you find mention of color or style of hair, relative attractiveness of candidates\u2019 spouses, ability to get along with the mainstream media, or track records or affiliations with the Establishment, inside-the-Beltway political savants or wizards. Also, the GOP has declined to include a box to check if you plan on leaving the country should Hillary win the general election; those subjects are left for respondents to sort out on their own.\n\nThe survey:\n\n(reprinted, with thanks to Kamzol with minor adjustments):\n\nAre you Tea Party Conservative, Moderate, Conservative, Libertarian, Other?\n\nIf a Democrat gains office, what would worry you most: A rise in Islamic terrorism; illegal immigration; picking Justice Scalia\u2019s successor; curbing religious liberties; neglecting veterans\u2019 rights; job-killing legislation; failing to protect the unborn; extreme versions of ObamaCare; higher taxes on everyone; or hatred of the Second Amendment.\n\nAssuming you\u2019ve made your preliminary selection, what are your top reasons for wanting your candidate to be the Republican nominee? Will beat the Democrat; will enforce legal immigration position; will repeal ObamaCare; will defend religious liberties; will be a strong job creator; will protect the unborn; is trusted to pick Scalia\u2019s successor; not only will correctly name it, but also will fight radical Islamic terrorism; and/or will defend the Second Amendment.\n\nWhat are your main concerns? Job security, mortgage payments, Social Security, saving for your children\u2019s education, saving for your retirement, social issues, terrorist threats, the cost of living, veterans\u2019 aid or other.\n\nThe survey also asks respondents to evaluate statements by the criteria: Strongly agree, Agree, No opinion, Disagree, or Strongly disagree. Here are the statements:\n\nNeither Hillary nor Bernie can be trusted to nominate a constitutionalist to the Supreme Court.\n\nOrganizations like Planned Parenthood that perform abortions should not receive federal funds.\n\nThe Second Amendment rights are under threat.\n\nPolitical correctness is poisoning American universities.\n\nIt is appalling that a socialist is a serious contender for president of the United States.\n\nNeither Hillary nor Bernie can be trusted to secure the border.\n\nThanks to Obama and Hillary, Israel and our allies have been abandoned while Iran and our enemies have been empowered.\n\nUnder Obama, the office of the presidency has become too powerful.\n\nOur country has strayed from what the founders outlined in the Constitution.\n\nObama\u2019s executive orders must be rolled back on the Republican candidate\u2019s first day in office.\n\nTraditional American values including the nuclear family are under attack.\n\nA new Republican president should immediately sign into law the ObamaCare repeal bill passed by Senate Republicans.\n\nThe EPA, IRS, and VA have exposed how corrupt the bureaucracy can become.\n\nRepublicans should continue to hold the IRS accountable for targeting of conservatives.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, illegal immigrants are treated better than our veterans.\n\nThe next president must put an end to Obama\u2019s military spending cuts.\n\nClimate change deals that cut American energy consumption and allow China to continue to pollute are wildly unfair.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s promise to \u201cput a lot of coal miners out of business\u201d is disgraceful.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s decision to raise the minimum wage to $15 will crush small businesses and serve as a bad economic example.\n\nObamaCare must be repealed and replaced by a market-driven program fueled by competition.\n\nVeterans should be able to choose their own health care providers.\n\nThe federal government has usurped too much power from the states.\n\nSupreme Court justices should only interpret existing law, not create new law.\n\nObama has left you utterly voiceless for the last seven years.\n\nWhat sort of running mate should the final candidate pick?\n\nDonald Trump: From candidate to presumptive nominee in 24 hours\n\nThis list by no means covers all the issues, nor does it accommodate the various political slants one might hold on the issues that are covered here. It is, however, a starting point prepared by the GOP for serious thinkers and voters who are truly concerned about the direction of their country in the next four to eight years.\n\nHats off to all Americans for whom all elections, local and national, are sacred privileges shared by few other countries. The people are supreme here under our constitution. That supremacy comes attendant with gravity and serious responsibility.\n\nMay all Americans\u2019 dissents be peaceful, serious and constructive, entering the final stretch of our national election.\n\nLink to the actual survey here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Exit Poll Ballot\" issued by Jesse Kamzol, national data director for the Republican National Committee, will help some conflicted voters sort out their", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Karen Cacy", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "The \u201cExit Poll Ballot\u201d issued by Jesse Kamzol, national data director for the Republican National Committee, will help some conflicted voters sort out their feelings.", "title": "Are you a \u201cTrumpet\u201d or a \u201cCruzer\u201d?", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/are-you-a-trumpet-or-a-cruzer-62588/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/donkey-hotey-kasich-cruz-trump.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Exit Poll Ballot\" issued by Jesse Kamzol, national data director for the Republican National Committee, will help some conflicted voters sort out their feelings.", "title": "Are you a \u201cTrumpet\u201d or  \u201cCruzer\u201d?", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/donkey-hotey-kasich-cruz-trump.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "election 2016,donald trump,ted cruz,gop,hillary clinton,jesse kamzol,political survey,republicans", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-28T23:52:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T23:52:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Jesse Kamzol, Political Survey, Republicans, Ted Cruz"}, "article_summary": "A new Republican president should immediately sign into law the ObamaCare repeal bill passed by Senate Republicans.\nThe \u201cExit Poll Ballot,\u201d issued by Jesse Kamzol, national data director for the Republican National Committee, asks respondents to begin by clicking on a candidate.\nThe survey issues are presented here without the candidate decision.\nThe survey also asks respondents to evaluate statements by the criteria: Strongly agree, Agree, No opinion, Disagree, or Strongly disagree.\nAssuming you\u2019ve made your preliminary selection, what are your top reasons for wanting your candidate to be the Republican nominee?"}
