In the previous year, it targeted $325 million in commitments and wound up pledging up to $380 million.\n\nOhio Police & Fire is tapping the brakes on its investment pace as its portfolio has grown smaller amid a rout in the broader equity and commodity markets. The pension fund\u2019s total assets fell to $13.1 billion as of Feb. 23, from $14.65 billion as of Feb. 24, 2015.\n\nPrivate equity now makes up a slightly larger share-about 6%-of the portfolio, bringing the pension fund closer to its goal of allocating 8% to the asset class by 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are conscious of the denominator effect in our plans going forward,\u201d said David Graham, a pension spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to make commitments to meet a target.\u201d\n\nThe pension fund\u2019s move come as some investors, sensing the market hit its peak last year, are deploying capital into private equity at a more measured pace. That is a reversal of the heady days of 2014, when pensions got rich from cash distributions and the stock market surge, fueling a record fundraising year. The market has since cooled while fears of slower global growth are mounting.\n\nPrivate capital funds amassed $551 billion in 2015, down from $589 billon in 2014, the last fundraising peak after the 2008 financial crisis, according to research provider Preqin Ltd.\n\nFor more on how the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund and other limited partners are committing their capital, check out LBO Wire.
