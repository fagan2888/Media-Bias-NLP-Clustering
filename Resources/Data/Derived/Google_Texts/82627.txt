10) Blue Snaggletooth â€“ $500-$700

Like many collectables, the value of this one is based on a mistake. According to the Star Wars Wiki, the figure was designed using only a monochrome photograph as a point of reference. This led to the character's uniform being painted blue, and for his arms and legs to be somewhat disproportionate. These mistakes were quickly fixed.
