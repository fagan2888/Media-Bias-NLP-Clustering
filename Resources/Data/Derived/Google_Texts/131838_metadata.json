Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the investigatory panel on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nDemocrats originally promoted the co-ops, or \u201cConsumer Operated and Oriented Plans,\u201d during the Obamacare debate of 2009 as a fallback to attempt to win passage of a \u201cpublic option,\u201d or government-run plan to be offered alongside private plans in the new web-based health exchanges to be set up in the states.\n\nDesigned to give consumers more bargaining power in the marketplace, the co-op program instead has turned into a major headache for President Obama, who is trying to place his signature law on firm footing before leaving office.\n\nOne of the co-op plans, CoOportunity Health of Nebraska and Iowa, abruptly shut down in early 2015, foreshadowing the ill fates of co-ops in Louisiana, Nevada, New York, Kentucky, Tennessee, Colorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Arizona and Michigan.\n\nAndy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testified that CoOportunity should have been shut down even before the 2015 plan year, though he argued his agency didn\u2019t have enough claims data to size up and shutter more co-ops until the middle of last year.\n\nAs it stands, he said the Justice Department is doing what it can to wrest back some of the government\u2019s money from the failed co-ops.\n\nThe department has frozen \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars in payments that the plans expected from Obamacare programs designed to spread out risk in the marketplace, and it is eyeing funds that co-ops might recoup from their vendors.\n\nIn the end, taxpayers will only get back an unknowable fraction of the $1.2 billion, Mr. Slavitt said.\n\n\u201cThere will be funds recovered for the taxpayers,\u201d he told senators, though he refused to offer a dollar amount. \u201cI can\u2019t guess. It would be irresponsible for me to guess.\u201d\n\nNo bets on recovery\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican and a leading critic of the co-ops, asked if a \u201cfair bet\u201d on the over-under for recovery would be around $100.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to take that bait,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said, explaining he didn\u2019t want to hamper the Justice Department\u2019s negotiations and leverage.\n\nCongressional Democrats say the GOP hastened the co-ops\u2019 demise by slashing start-up loans from $6 billion to $2.4 billion and prohibiting the co-ops from spending the money on marketing. Their GOP rivals contend the co-ops did themselves in by miscalculating enrollment or underpricing their products in a tough market.\n\nMr. Portman, who faces re-election in November, said while states enjoy wide discretion over their insurance markets, the Department of Health and Human Services had sole discretion over federal loans and should have stepped in sooner.\n\n\u201cDespite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS took no corrective action for over a year,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said the HHS threw good money after bad to bolster its \u201cunfortunate adventure\u201d into the health care start-up business. Three of the failed co-ops \u2014 plans in New York, Kentucky and the joint venture in Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 received tens of millions of dollars in additional solvency loans despite their struggles.\n\nMr. Slavitt said the administration must accept responsibility for the co-op failures, though he noted that most of the loans were obligated before he got to the agency.\n\nHe also said insurers can set their prices just once per year, and it takes a while for claims data and fiscal patterns to emerge. That is why the administration and states did not shut down many plans until the cusp of the third open enrollment period this past fall.\n\nIndeed, state regulators shut down co-ops in quick succession last year so that customers could quickly switch to other options during the 2016 enrollment period from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31.\n\nThe rapid closures breathed new life into an issue that burst into view in July, when the HHS inspector general said the co-ops lost hundreds of millions of dollars in their first year and didn\u2019t attract anywhere near the number of customers they had been banking on, raising the prospect of default.\n\nMr. Sasse, in particular, highlighted Mr. Slavitt\u2019s admission that the CoOportunity program \u201cshould never have been allowed to go into the 2015 year \u2014 either by the co-op or by ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a significant admission,\u201d the senator said, \u201cso I appreciate your honesty on that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare's failed co-ops have not repaid a single dollar of the combined $1.2 billion they received in federal startup loans, Senate Republicans said Thursday in a report that argues taxpayers will never be made whole.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Obamacare\u2019s failed co-ops have not repaid a single dollar of the combined $1.2 billion they received in federal startup loans, Senate Republicans said Thursday in a report that argues taxpayers will never be made whole.", "title": "Obamacare failed co-ops haven\u2019t repaid any of $1.2B in taxpayer loans: GOP", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/10/obamacare-co-ops-havent-repaid-12b-tax-dollars/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/10/AP_6866053540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/10/AP_6866053540.jpg", "title": "Obamacare failed co-ops haven\u2019t repaid any of $1.2B in taxpayer", "description": "Obamacare's failed co-ops have not repaid a single dollar of the combined $1.2 billion they received in federal startup loans, Senate Republicans said Thursday in a report that argues taxpayers will n", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Business Finance, Social Issues, Andy Slavitt"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare\u2019s failed health co-ops could be leaving taxpayers with a massive, unpayable IOU.\nAs it stands, he said the Justice Department is doing what it can to wrest back some of the government\u2019s money from the failed co-ops.\nThree of the failed co-ops \u2014 plans in New York, Kentucky and the joint venture in Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 received tens of millions of dollars in additional solvency loans despite their struggles.\nCongressional Democrats say the GOP hastened the co-ops\u2019 demise by slashing start-up loans from $6 billion to $2.4 billion and prohibiting the co-ops from spending the money on marketing.\nTheir GOP rivals contend the co-ops did themselves in by miscalculating enrollment or underpricing their products in a tough market."}
