Sioux Falls, SD

The snow and wind earlier this week created holiday travel problems for some in KELOLAND, especially in western South Dakota where winds gusted to over 60 miles per hour. The Hills received the highest amounts this time around, good news for the ski resorts, snow mobile trails, and oh yes, my prediction.

Through Christmas Eve, Sioux Falls is still at just over ten inches. Aberdeen comes in at just under nine. Pierre and Rapid City have jumped to the teens, while the Hills made a leap to just over 46 inches.

Christmas Day and the day after will help add to the totals. After the new snow falls, cold air will settle in with much colder air expected next week.
