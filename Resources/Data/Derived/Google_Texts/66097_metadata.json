He is Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Decision Science; and former Chief of Cardiology (Pediatric). Dr. Deane serves on the Board of Directors of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX). Opinions offered here are Dr. Deane's alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the NMHIX Board.\n\nBernie Sanders is promising a single payer healthcare system he calls Medicare-for-All . Some people are falling for this false promise. We must avoid ending up like the Greek sailors in mythology who listened to the Sirens\u2019 song, crashed on the rocks and died.\n\nSanders\u2019 Idea of Medicare-for-All\n\nSanders would create his Medicare-for-All by first dumping all 70 million \u201cfree coverage\u201d Medicaid recipients into the Medicare program that covers 49 million seniors who paid into the Medicare Trust for 40 working years.\n\nHow is that fair?\n\nThen, Sanders would add the remaining 200 million Americans, including millions of illegals \u2026 I think. He isn\u2019t clear on this. His plan won\u2019t work for a number of reasons.\n\nMedicare Is Quickly Going Broke\n\nThe Medicare Trust is a huge health savings account into which working Americans were required to pay during their employment. The Trust is supposed to pay all medical expenses of the 49 million enrollees. The Obama administration admits that the Trust will be insolvent within 10 years.\n\nWhy would Sanders want to hasten the collapse of Medicare by adding 270 million other Americans to the rolls?\n\nWant Your Tax Bill to Go Up, Even Higher?\n\nSanders\u2019 answer is simple: he will raise taxes on everyone. What will this do to our sluggish economy? How will an already strapped, barely-making-ends-meet over-taxed, over-regulated, middle class respond to more money taken by the government?\n\nAt least Sanders is honest \u2014 he says our tax bills will go up. President Barack Obama outright lied. He called his healthcare reform \u201caffordable,\u201d and promised we would save $2,500 per family, per year. What we got from Obamacare was sticker shock, with family health insurance premiums rising to $20,000 per year or more.\n\nCost of Medicare-for-All\n\nWhat about the cost of Sander\u2019s Medicare-for-All? And where does all that money go?\n\nAdding 70 million Medicaid recipients plus 200 million other Americans to 49 million Medicare enrollees will require several trillion (yes, with a \u201cT\u201d) dollars in bureaucratic costs. Just think of the new eligibility requirements, authorization codes, verification standards, billing processes, etc. And I haven\u2019t mentioned the tens of thousands of new accountants, administrators, billers and coders, bureaucrats, consultants (always remember the contemptuous and contemptible Jonathan Gruber), and of course, lawyers to defend the new rules, regulations and executive orders against the inevitable challenges.\n\nLest you think I exaggerate, Obamacare spent $2.6 trillion in bureaucratic costs just to expand Medicaid by 10 million and create 17 Healthcare Exchanges plus healthcare.gov.\n\nSanders\u2019 expansion of Medicare by 270 million Americans would assuredly sink an already unsupportable federal deficit.\n\nMoney For Bureaucracy, Not For Care\n\nSanders boasts about all the costs we wouldn\u2019t have to pay when Medicare-for-All eliminates health insurance. Apparently, he doesn\u2019t understand that Medicare works through insurance companies. So, there will be no savings there.\n\nThere will, however, be new costs related to additional BARRC: bureaucracy, administration, rules, regulations, and compliance necessary to implement his Medicare-for-All. This \u201cmandatory\u201d spending on bureaucracy will leave less and less money for your care. More dollars to bureaucrats means fewer dollars for nurses, doctors, and hospitals.\n\nWhen the government controls your healthcare spending, they allocate first to themselves. We the Patients get what is left over.\n\nDo You Want \u201cDoctor\u201d Sanders?\n\nThe most unacceptable aspect of Medicare-for-All is this: like all government-controlled healthcare systems, the central government takes over as your medical decision maker.\n\nWashington, D.C. decides what care you get or don\u2019t get, and when you might get it. In Medicare-for-All, the doctor is a government employee. He or she works for Washington; not you. In Medicare-for-All, neither you nor your doctor has any real say in your care.\n\nJust ask a veteran, one who hasn\u2019t died on a waiting list. Our veterans have the Department of Veterans Affairs system, a form of Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-All. As a result of the government allocation process that diverts care dollars to healthcare bureaucracy, \u201c307,000 veterans may have died waiting for their medical care.\u201d That is a direct quote from an Inspector General\u2019s 2015 Report on the VA healthcare system.\n\nAccess to timely care and the good health of all Americans are what really matter, or what should matter, in healthcare. Even so, we seem focused almost exclusively on the money.\n\nSo, let me end quoting a world-renowned economist.\n\nFriedrich Hayek won both the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991.\n\nHe wrote it is, \u201cAn optimistic delusion that [central; government] planners can manage economic growth by substituting their expertise for the information generated by the billions of daily interactions of a complex market society.\u201d\n\nA fitting epitaph for Medicare-for-All would be a paraphrase of Hayek: It is conceit FATAL to patients when government thinks it can make better life-and-death decisions for us than we can make for ourselves.\n\n\u201cDr. Deane\u201d Waldman MD MBA is the author of the FREE Healthcare Decoder; The Cancer in the American Healthcare System; and the new e-book series, Restoring Care to American Healthcare.
