But the government argued that single-coverage plans as suggested by the Little Sisters wouldn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\n\u201cReliance on such policies would not work,\u201d wrote Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the Washington Times reported Wednesday. He said some states have rejected single-benefit policies and some insurers refuse to offer them.\n\nThe fight centers on a federal mandate that requires religious nonprofit organizations to provide coverage for contraceptives and abortions even when doing so would violate their faith-based principles. The case is regarded as a challenge to elements of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe high court asked lawyers for both the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order, and the federal government to provide additional arguments after an initial hearing in March.\n\nThe question revolves around whether employees of religious organizations can get contraceptive care from the federal government and not through employer-provided health insurance. In its original briefs, the government contested this possibility as not a good option.\n\nBut lawyers for the Little Sisters on Wednesday pointed to a section in the government\u2019s latest brief that says the government plans can be modified.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation for employers with insured plans could be modified to operate in the manner posited in the court\u2019s order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage,\u201d the government\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful that the court asked to hear more about our case,\u201d Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, mother provincial for the Little Sisters, said in a statement provided by the Becket Fund, which represents the Sisters. \u201cWe just want to focus on our mission of serving the elderly poor as we have for the last 175 years while being faithful to the teachings of our church.\u201d\n\nThe organization operates nursing homes mainly for the poor, including one in Somerville. Maguire said Thursday in a Wall Street Journal article that the order faces a $70 million fine each year if it fails to comply with government mandates.\n\n\u201cThe federal government already works with state governments to provide contraceptive-only plans through Medicaid, Rienzi told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the plans can\u2019t and don\u2019t exist. They exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a win-win,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really easy: The government can go do what it needs to do and leave the nuns out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, everyone wins because the truth is we are all better off if we live in a world where people like the Little Sisters of the Poor can, inspired by their faith, devote their lives to caring for the elderly poor,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/22/little-sisters-sees-ray-of-hope-in-obamacare-court-battle/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/25-Little-Sisters-of-the-Poor.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "abortion, Affordable Care Act., birth control, Catholic, Catholic orders, colntraceptives, faith principles, health care, health insurance, Little Sisters, Medicaid, nuns, Obamacare, Supreme Court"}, "description": "A statement from government lawyers that health plans could be modified to provide contraceptive care for women under special circumstances may bring an end to", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/25-Little-Sisters-of-the-Poor.jpg"}, "keywords": "little sisters,supreme court,obamacare,colntraceptives,abortion,affordable care act.,birth control,catholic,catholic orders,faith principles,health care,health insurance,medicaid,nuns", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Little Sisters sees ray of hope in Obamacare court battlePrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/22/little-sisters-sees-ray-of-hope-in-obamacare-court-battle/A member of the Little Sister of the Poor, right, attends to a resident in one of the order's nursing homes.\nBut the government argued that single-coverage plans as suggested by the Little Sisters wouldn\u2019t solve the problem.\nBut lawyers for the Little Sisters on Wednesday pointed to a section in the government\u2019s latest brief that says the government plans can be modified.\n\u201cWe are so grateful that the court asked to hear more about our case,\u201d Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, mother provincial for the Little Sisters, said in a statement provided by the Becket Fund, which represents the Sisters.\nThe high court asked lawyers for both the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order, and the federal government to provide additional arguments after an initial hearing in March."}
