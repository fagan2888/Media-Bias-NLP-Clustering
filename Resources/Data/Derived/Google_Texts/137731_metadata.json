Obama spent a long passage of his speech extolling Democratic nominee John Kerry, but he wasn\u2019t the one whose presidential prospects most people left the Fleet Center buzzing about. Caught by surprise by a convention keynote that was actually worth watching, the crowd went wild. Even Hillary Clinton and Jesse Jackson were spotted clapping for him.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA decade later, the speech remains a road map to the Obama agenda \u2014 and the many places where he\u2019s fallen short in his term and a half so far.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: How Obama's court strategy may save Obamacare)\n\nThe parts that hold up well: transitioning from a manufacturing base, the pursuit of enemies (like Osama bin Laden), a cooperative economy, voting rights, solving the \u201chealth care crisis,\u201d \u201ca road to opportunity\u201d for the middle class.\n\nBut parts come across as the oratorical equivalent of an embarrassing hairdo in a high school yearbook.\n\nThe line most associated with the speech \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America, there\u2019s the United States of America\u201d \u2014 is the part that\u2019s probably held up the least well over time.\n\n\u201cThe most memorable passage in that speech that he\u2019s not been able to break through on is the real polarized division in the country,\u201d said Robert Gibbs, then Obama\u2019s Senate campaign communications director and later his first White House press secretary. That passage was there from the first draft and stuck around through every round of 3 a.m. emails Obama sent to his small Senate campaign staff.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: First lady: 2014 election key)\n\nBut nothing prepared Obama\u2019s staff for what happened next.\n\n\u201cWe all read the speech, but none of us was prepared for the reaction it got,\u201d recalls Tommy Vietor, a Senate campaign spokesman who also went on to the White House. \u201cIt was powerful on paper, but it was nowhere close to the way he delivered it. \u2026 The delivery was pitch perfect, and it was just the right speech for the time.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s look back at key lines from the speech that defined Obama and how they\u2019ve held up in the 10 years since:\n\n\u201cWell, I say to them tonight, there\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d\n\nTurns out there actually is. And the divisions have gotten so much worse, particularly since the beginning of Obama\u2019s presidency, with the rise of the tea party and the hopelessly gridlocked Congress, that it\u2019s the most famous Obama line you never hear anymore.\n\n\u201cI think he feels deeply frustrated and disappointed by it,\u201d Vietor says. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to be constrained by partisanship, but there\u2019s only so much he can do.\u201d\n\nBut Obama hasn\u2019t exactly backed away from the divide, spending over $700 million after opting out of the campaign finance system in 2008 and then over $1 billion in 2012 in a relentless us-vs.-them push against Mitt Romney.\n\nTry to find a Republican in Washington who thinks he hasn\u2019t been partisan. But to Obama\u2019s team, it\u2019s mostly the GOP that has built the wall of opposition, to the point where they\u2019re convinced many Republicans reflexively turn against anything he supports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than a loyal and rational opposition,\u201d Obama put it to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fundraising luncheon last week in Los Altos Hills, California. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we have right now, and as a consequence we\u2019re going to need change.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we participate in a politics of cynicism, or do we participate in a politics of hope?\u201d\n\nThat was three years before the Shepard Fairey poster, but these days Obama has returned to the idea repeatedly, telling people, as he did in Los Angeles on Thursday, \u201cCynicism is a choice, and hope is a better choice.\u201d\n\nNow, though, Obama has to contend with the reality of a hostile, dysfunctional Congress and the limits of falling back on executive actions to get his agenda through. He does it by adding a darker message to his speeches: Washington wants to discourage you, so don\u2019t let them do it.\n\nBack then, though, the pitch was just starting to take shape. He was aspirational. Now he\u2019s weathered. Then, the crowd called \u201cHope!\u201d back at him when he asked the question in the speech. Now he\u2019s hoping he can still get Democrats inspired for the midterms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a quintessentially forward-looking, hopeful vision for America,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a reminder, five and a half years into his presidency, of how much of that vision Obama hasn\u2019t gotten accomplished.\n\n\u201cThe wonderful thing about that speech is that you could give it today,\u201d Gibbs said, though adding, \u201cAnybody and everybody would admit that there are things that are unfinished in that agenda and won\u2019t be finished in his term.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don\u2019t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states.\u201d\n\nOh, right \u2014 the whole surveillance thing. Turns out people hate that.\n\nObama delivered that line in a very different context \u2014 when the issue on everyone\u2019s minds was the Patriot Act and all the other kinds of post-Sept. 11 surveillance being practiced by the Bush administration. Libraries were especially concerned about national security letters, which allow the FBI to issue top-secret demands for records about Americans\u2019 private communications.\n\nIn the Oval Office five years later, Obama surprised supporters and allies by maintaining, and in some cases expanding, the Bush-era intelligence apparatus and doing more with drone strikes and kill lists than that man on stage in Boston probably could have ever envisioned.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A decade later, his 2004 DNC speech remains a road map to where he\u2019s fallen short.", "title": "10 years later: Obama's hits, blunders", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/barack-obama-dnc-speech-2004-109419.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/27/140727_barack_obama_dnc_boston_2004_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,John Kerry,Democratic National Convention,2004 Election,2004 Presidential Campaign,DNC", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "A decade later, his 2004 DNC speech remains a road map to where he\u2019s fallen short.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "10 years later: Obama's hits, blundersBarack Obama\u2019s Democratic National Convention keynote delivered 10 years ago Sunday evening started his journey to the White House.\nThe line most associated with the speech \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America, there\u2019s the United States of America\u201d \u2014 is the part that\u2019s probably held up the least well over time.\n( Also on POLITICO: First lady: 2014 election key)But nothing prepared Obama\u2019s staff for what happened next.\nStory Continued BelowA decade later, the speech remains a road map to the Obama agenda \u2014 and the many places where he\u2019s fallen short in his term and a half so far.\nIn the Oval Office five years later, Obama surprised supporters and allies by maintaining, and in some cases expanding, the Bush-era intelligence apparatus and doing more with drone strikes and kill lists than that man on stage in Boston probably could have ever envisioned."}
