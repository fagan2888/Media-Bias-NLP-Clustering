EDITOR: Garrett Ryan! The voters in Stevens Point City Council District 2 have a wonderful opportunity to elect an extremely well-qualified young man to represent them. Garrett is committed to maintaining the historic character and integrity of the Old Main neighborhood, to enhancing opportunities in the city and to facilitating appropriate development. Garrett works well with people. He has the ability to listen and to consider all sides of an issue. He has great ideas and follows through with them. Garrett Ryan is exactly the kind of person we need on the Council.
