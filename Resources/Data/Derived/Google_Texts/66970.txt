A Wichita man is regrouping after being tied up and robbed in his west Wichita home Sunday morning.

Wichita police say the call came it at just after 9:35 a.m. from the 1000 block of W Munnell.

The 65-year old victim told police two men entered his home. One pointed a handgun at him, telling him to "sit down."

The victim said he was tied up before the robbers searched through his home. He told officers the men took two small safes and approximately $100 before leaving in an unknown direction.

The victim described the suspect with the gun as a 25 to 30-year-old white man, 6-foot-1, 200 pounds. He wore a black jacket and a ski mask. The second suspect is described as 25 to 30-year-old white man, 5-foot-8, 150 pounds, also wearing dark clothes and a ski mask.

The victim was not hurt. The incident is still under investigation.
