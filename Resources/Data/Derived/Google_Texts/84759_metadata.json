Jeb was still pretending to be undecided on whether he would run for president at that point, but he wanted to head off any suggestion that he\u2019d go down the same foreign policy path as his brother, who left office broadly despised for having launched a costly and unnecessary war in Iraq. \u201cI am my own man,\u201d Jeb promised in that speech, \u201cand my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences.\u201d\n\nSince then he\u2019s done just about everything he can to prove that statement false. The foreign policy doctrine he laid out in August was a reimagining of his brother\u2019s worldview: send more U.S. troops to Iraq, send U.S. troops to Syria to help topple Assad and help set up \u201ca stable, moderate government,\u201d and bend the world to America\u2019s will with copious demonstrations of \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cleadership.\u201d Jeb has spent the past two weeks stridently defending his brother\u2019s national security record from Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter trolling.\n\nAnd, as the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza writes, Jeb\u2019s foreign policy retinue is comprised mainly of the same cranks and charlatans who populated Brother George\u2019s national security team. Once-notorious Bush administration veterans you probably haven\u2019t heard about or thought of in years \u2013 Paul Wolfowitz, Stephen Hadley, Porter Goss \u2013 are all signed on to Jeb\u2019s campaign and guiding his thinking on foreign policy. If you thought the Iraq disaster had chased these guys from public life and left the Bush Doctrine on history\u2019s ash heap, you were unfortunately mistaken.\n\nAnd these guys are still true believers. Lizza spotlights one Jeb advisor in particular: Otto Reich, a veteran of both Bush administrations and the Reagan White House (he oversaw the latter administration\u2019s pro-Contra propaganda efforts). Speaking to Lizza, Reich offered up one of the most morally repugnant and intellectually dishonest \u201cdefenses\u201d of the Iraq war I\u2019ve ever seen:\n\n\u201cI can defend the invasion of Iraq,\u201d Reich told me. \u201cWhat did the invasion of Iraq do? It caused all of the people who would\u2019ve otherwise come and attacked us and killed Americans on our soil\u2014it caused them to go to Iraq and die there. That may sound very brutal, or whatever, but we have seen what has happened when you have an Administration like the current one, that did not realize what Bush had done; sent the troops home from Iraq; created a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. And they\u2019re killing Americans and everyone else\u2014they\u2019re mostly killing Muslims. I lay that at the feet of the Obama Administration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb's foreign policy team shows how GOP foreign policy thinking hasn't been changed by George W.
