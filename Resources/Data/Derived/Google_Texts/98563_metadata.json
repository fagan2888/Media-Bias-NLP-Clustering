The amnesty will merely keep them safe from deportation; it won\u2019t make them legal. And Obamacare can only go to citizens and legal noncitizens living in the U.S.\n\n\n\nBut the employer mandate in Obamacare requires large companies to offer insurance to each of their full-time workers or pay a hefty fine to the government for failing to do so.\n\n\n\nCombine these two programs and you have a huge incentive for employers to dismiss any blue-collar workers on their payroll and replace them with illegal immigrants covered by amnesty. These folks are allowed to work but not to get Obamacare. An employer can\u2019t be fined for failing to offer Obamacare to employees who are ineligible to receive it. It\u2019s an employer\u2019s dream!\n\n\n\nSome argue that the anti-discrimination provisions of Obamacare will bar employers from offering insurance to some of their workers (citizens and legal immigrants) and not to others (illegal immigrants). But that argument seems far-fetched, because the illegal immigrants cannot enroll in Obamacare.\n\n\n\nEven if the argument holds water, what is to prevent an employer from simply refusing to insure any of his workers at all? He couldn\u2019t be fined for not insuring a workforce that cannot accept the insurance!\n\n\n\nBy creating a pool of work-legal/Obamacare-illegal workers, the president will make the incentive to replace citizens with illegal immigrants practically irresistible.\n\n\n\n(My thanks to Dennis M. Lynch, documentary filmmaker, for alerting me to this situation).\n\n\n\nIf you think Democrats are bemoaning the loss of the blue-collar whites who voted with Republicans in the midterm elections now, wait 'til the amnesty/Obamacare mandate combo kicks in. You ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet!\n\n\n\nAs the 2016 elections approach, this conflict between amnesty and the employer mandate will likely become a major campaign issue. It calls into question the two hallmarks of the Obama presidency and puts them on a collision course. Even the strongest defenders of either policy have to concede the problem and come up with solutions. But they could be hard to come by.\n\n\n\nObama cannot solve the problem by giving illegal immigrants legal status by executive order. If he felt he could, he would have done so already in his huge executive power overreach. And Congress is not likely to cooperate in changing the employer mandate or in making the newly amnestied immigrants eligible for Obamacare. Republicans will be more inclined to let the Democrats stew in the brew they have concocted.\n\n\n\nThe dimensions of this problem are enormous. One wonders if any of Obama\u2019s crew spotted it during the run-up to his executive order. It is hard to imagine former President Clinton failing to notice such a conflict between his two major programs.\n\n\n\nAlready, the Center for Immigration Studies points out that the Census Bureau figures indicate three out of four new jobs created under Obama\u2019s tenure have gone to nonnative-born Americans (a category the Census says covers legal immigrants, illegal ones and naturalized US citizens). Out of 8 million new jobs created since 2008, 6 million have gone to people who are not native-born American citizens. Now, the desire of employers to find a way out from under the expensive mandate in Obamacare will accelerate the process.\n\n\n\nIt will be a great line to feature on your resume that you came here illegally and are not eligible for Obamacare. It will go a long way toward guaranteeing a job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 Newsmax.
