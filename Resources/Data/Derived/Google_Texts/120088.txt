Chris Burleton, the grandmother of eight-year-old Natasha Fuller, thought she was being called into the child’s classroom because Natasha had been misbehaving. This couldn’t have been farther from the truth.

Jodi Schmidt, Natasha’s first-grade teacher, had invited Burleton to the school last week. Natasha has been living with Burleton for the past two years to take advantage of the specialized care at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin nearby. Schmidt handed Burleton a pink, gift-wrapped box when she arrived. Inside was a present, and a note saying Schmidt would donate a kidney to Natasha.

Burleton immediately put the happy news on Facebook, writing, “This wonderful lady named Jodi Schmidt is a teacher at Natasha’s school… and she gave the best ever present to Tasha. Jodi is a match for Tasha to get a new kidney … so very, very thankful to Jodi and her family.”

Natasha has been sick since birth with prune belly syndrome, a group of birth defects that can cause urinary tract infections and poor abdominal muscle development. Natasha now requires kidney dialysis — Burleton accompanies the girl to the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee three times a week. Natasha has renal failure and has been on the list for a transplant kidney for years.

“I just lost it,” Burleton told HNGN. “You could never tell this little girl has three tubes in her, she doesn’t let it faze her. She is happy and sassy, and she just wants to lead a normal life, and do things like swimming.”

Schmidt felt she was the right person to help Natasha.

“I figured, I’m O-negative blood and … I think we’re all brought to a certain place and time for a reason.”
