And when we have something to talk about, we'll show you,\" said Boehner in response to a reporter's question about the GOP replacement for the president's health legislation.\n\nNow that people are signed up, Boehner says people won't be upset when they see the plan the Republicans do form to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- they will welcome it. He didn't say when such a plan may be formed or any details about what it would include, but says people will like it because it will protect them and, \"not harm them as the president's bill is doing.\"\n\nThe GOP has faced criticism over their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while providing no alternative policy. They have also been slammed by Democrats for launching efforts to repeal the healthcare law dozens of times.\n\n[HuffPost Politics]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, promised in a press conference that the GOP will think of an alternative to the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, promised in a press conference that the GOP will think of an alternative to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Boehner promises GOP healthcare plan", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/04/02/Boehner-promises-GOP-healthcare-plan/3471396472562/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3471396472562/2014/upi/2a96314569ee70a2b2e45293f87ab7a2/v1.5/Boehner-promises-GOP-healthcare-plan.jpg?lg=2", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., John Boehner", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., John Boehner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae47\"", "article_summary": "Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, promised in a press conference that the GOP will think of an alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe GOP has faced criticism over their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while providing no alternative policy.\nAnd when we have something to talk about, we'll show you,\" said Boehner in response to a reporter's question about the GOP replacement for the president's health legislation.\nThey have also been slammed by Democrats for launching efforts to repeal the healthcare law dozens of times.\nNow that people are signed up, Boehner says people won't be upset when they see the plan the Republicans do form to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- they will welcome it."}
