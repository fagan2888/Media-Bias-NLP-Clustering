How much leeway do we allow people who refuse to follow the law on the grounds of moral complicity, based on appeals to conscience?\n\nIn Wisconsin, a pharmacist who denies a woman's request for a morning-after pill neither refers her to another pharmacist nor returns her prescription. The owner of Denver's Masterpiece Cakes refuses to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding reception. Owners of for-profit Hobby Lobby object to the Affordable Care Act's mandate that employers provide health insurance through which employees can access contraceptive services, which the owners believe act as abortifacients. The Little Sisters of the Poor, nuns who run a nonprofit support for poor elderly, will not formally sign their objection to the above mandate, arguing that this still initiates coverage for contraception to which they are morally opposed.\n\nEach case is appreciably different. Yet such conscience-based complicity claims share two features: objectors refuse to be morally complicit in conduct they deem immoral, and their objections are grounded in appeals to conscience.\n\nWhen does a complicity claim warrant exemption? Murky territory here. Is mere perception of culpability reasonable enough cause? Feeling complicit is not the same as being complicit, just as we can be responsible and not feel responsible. Moreover, though links on the causal chain of responsibility involve intent, knowledge of the facts, timing, and scale of involvement, what about one's personal discretion and degree of conscientiousness?\n\nConscience is even murkier. More than simply a feeling, conscience ultimately summons our inner core of moral values, our key to personal integrity. Violating conscience is violating integrity, not something to be taken lightly. As Hamlet reminds, \"conscience doth make cowards of us all.\"\n\nAll this, plus the fact that none of us, including the courts, have a window into another's heart and soul, compels us to at least owe respectful deference to conscience-based complicity claims while admitting that, since no one owns a monopoly on conscience, a complicity claim is not infallible. Amy Sepinwall, a professor of law and business ethics at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, affirms this in a December 2015 University of Chicago Law Review article \"Conscience and Complicity.\"\n\nIn weighing whether conscientious refusals merit exemption, let us examine a further feature, one generally given short shrift as the spotlight has been more on objectors and their claims. This concerns the impact of exemptions on third parties, those whose anticipated conduct is judged immoral. Attending equally to any exemption's impact on \"wrongdoers\" is particularly crucial in view of certain factors.\n\nFirst, we often associate matters of conscience with refusal to do something considered objectionable. However, conscience works both ways: through conscientious refusal to act or duty to act. While physician-assisted suicide is not legal in New York, for example, this does not preclude a physician acting in conscience upon a patient's request.Second, objectors often belong to a mainstream religion and assert its teachings, or at least their understanding of them, in their objection. And, as law professors Douglas NeJaime of the University of California-Irvine and Reva Siegel of Yale highlight (http://tinyurl.com/znaytsg), this musters added force in a climate of increasing politicized mobilization to restore \"traditional\" values. All this thinly casts shadows of suspicion on those whose conduct is viewed as wrong and add up to make the potential for harm for singled-out third parties more acute.\n\nWhen we legally exempt conscientious refusals, we can only ethically do so in ways that minimize any harm and potential for harm to those whose conduct is in question. For example, when it comes to health care refusals, we must ensure fair access to relevant information, proper health care, and reasonable alternatives, particularly when serious health risks are at stake. Furthermore, we must work to deter the potential for offensive discrimination and stigmatizing. Earnestly minimizing and preventing these unjust burdens thereby becomes the litmus test regarding exemptions for conscience-based complicity claims.\n\nMichael Brannigan is the Pfaff Endowed Chair in Ethics and Moral Values at The College of Saint Rose.
