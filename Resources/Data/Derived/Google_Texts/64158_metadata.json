Mary Landrieu (D-La.) debated Monday like an underdog, suggesting her challenger could be jailed for stealing taxpayer money as a result of his $20,000-a-year side job at Louisiana State University. But the three-term incumbent, who trails Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy in the polls less than a week before the vote, also found herself on the defensive for wrongly billing taxpayers more than $33,000 to take chartered jets to campaign events.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the only debate ahead of Saturday\u2019s runoff, Cassidy made no game-changing mistakes. He benefited from the moderators\u2019 focus on issues that play to the Republican strength in the Deep South: guns, abortion, Obamacare, taxes and Landrieu\u2019s failure to pass the Keystone XL pipeline through the Senate.\n\nThe Republican congressman acted like a quarterback trying to run out the clock, but he was at times awkward and hard to follow. He copped at one point to reading his opponent\u2019s notes and told an odd story about speaking at a vaccine conference.\n\nHere are the 10 most memorable exchanges from the hour-long matchup, hosted by Baton Rouge CBS affiliate WAFB-TV:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be fighting more than President Obama. \u2026 He will be fighting subpoenas because this is going to be under investigation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly a week since a blog called American Zombie posted what it acknowledged was an \u201copposition research\u201d dump. It was a series of emails and time sheets, obtained by public records requests, about Cassidy\u2019s work as a teacher and practicing physician for Louisiana State University. Landrieu\u2019s campaign has pushed the item relentlessly over the last six days, with limited success, including a conference call with the senator the day after Thanksgiving and a subsequent press conference.\n\nIn a state with a long history of shady public corruption, Cassidy is often mocked for being so sober-minded and boring. But Landrieu, who trails by double digits in some polls, has little to lose.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only doctor in the Congress that has this sweetheart deal, the only one,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not a doctor for the poor. He\u2019s a doctor for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love treating patients. I love teaching. And I\u2019m the only liver specialist in the LSU system. So I bring value.\u201d\n\nHours before the debate, Louisiana State gave Landrieu an opening to attack by announcing in an otherwise-bland statement that it would look into the situation based on \u201cconcerns\u201d in the media \u2014 \u201cjust as we would any other employee.\u201d\n\nCassidy said Landrieu\u2019s charges are \u201cabsolutely false\u201d and said he\u2019s proud of the work he\u2019s done, putting in time at the hospital in the morning and flying to Washington for evening votes. He said he\u2019s filled out paperwork to reflect his work.\n\nMost defiantly, he said he would like to continue the $20,000-a-year arrangement if he\u2019s elected to the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t allow props.\u201d\n\nThe moderator knew Landrieu would hit hard on the LSU issue, so he started the debate by asking her about private charter flights for which she has reimbursed the federal government $33,727, admitting that she had made a mistake.\n\nCassidy has pushed Landrieu for the past three months to release her private travel records from her first term \u2014 the initial disclosures covered from 2002 to 2014 \u2014 to show she didn\u2019t do anything improper during that period.\n\nWhen the moderator asked why she wouldn\u2019t release them, Landrieu held up a sheaf of papers and placed them on her podium. The moderator chastised her.\n\n\u201cAre records props?\u201d she responded.\n\nLandrieu insisted that \u201cnothing was illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, it was,\u201d Cassidy responded.\n\n\u201cJust because you disagree with the president doesn\u2019t make you a racist.\u201d\n\nCassidy attacked Landrieu for telling NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd that racism contributes to President Barack Obama\u2019s unpopularity in Louisiana.\n\nBut the Democrat shot back, defending her comments, which came just before the November primary.\n\n\u201cI said the South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cI will make no apologies for something that is a historical fact.\u201d\n\nLandrieu treaded carefully when it came to Obama. She needs record turnout among African-Americans to survive, after having won fewer than one in five white votes in last month\u2019s jungle primary.\n\nWhile she talked up her independence generally, Landrieu took several subtle digs at Cassidy which were clearly aimed at black voters. Her campaign is running a series of ads on urban radio stations that also say Republicans \u201cdisrespect\u201d Obama and will impeach him if Cassidy wins.\n\n\u201cHe has been very disrespectful to the president and the office of the president,\u201d said Landrieu.\n\n\u201cI was able to get the Cassidy bill through the House.\u201d\n\nLandrieu had made her clout as chair of the Senate Energy Committee a central rationale for her reelection, but that argument carries less weight given the new Republican majority next year.\n\nCassidy seized on Landrieu\u2019s failure to get the votes she needed in the lame duck session to pass the Keystone XL pipeline. He noted that the House passed what he repeatedly referred to as \u201cthe Cassidy bill.\u201d\n\nLandrieu said she hasn\u2019t given up. \u201cI wish it would have passed, but we got it up for a vote in the Senate,\u201d she responded. \u201cThat\u2019s the leadership I bring. When I get back to the Senate, we will pass the Keystone Pipeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could see from your notes.\u201d\n\nLater in the debate, the candidates got a chance to question one another. As Landrieu got her turn, Cassidy interjected: \u201cI think this is \u2018Dr. Double Dip,\u2019 or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d said Landrieu.\n\nThen Cassidy announced from behind his podium that he had peeked across the stage at Landrieu\u2019s notes.\n\n\u201cI believe that the government should not make the choice; that\u2019s why I fall more under the label of pro-choice than pro-life. These labels are not very accurate.\u201d\n\nLandrieu reiterated her opposition to a 20-week abortion ban but added that \u201cabortion in almost every case is immoral.\u201d Pro-abortion-rights women\u2019s groups don\u2019t see her as an ally, and the anti-abortion community views her as an enemy.\n\nTo have a chance Saturday, she needs to win over a chunk of socially-conservative Catholics who oppose abortion but believe that government has an important role to help the less fortunate.\n\nCassidy said he supports the ban because, as a doctor, \u201cThe child who is born at Week 20 can survive outside the womb.\u201d He said he opposes abortion, except when the mother\u2019s life is at risk.\n\n\u201cI have voted \u2013 I think, I have to go back and look \u2013 for drug testing for welfare beneficiaries. But\u2026\u201d\n\nLandrieu went on to explain, more forcefully as her answer went on, that she thinks it\u2019s unfair to require parents on welfare to get drug tested. She said there\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d that people on public assistance use drugs disproportionately to the rest of the population and argued that rich people who get special tax breaks should get tested too if the needy do.\n\n\u201cBeating up on the poor is not going to solve the problems of our country,\u201d she said, again invoking her \u201cCatholic faith\u201d to say \u201cthat just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nCassidy, again noting that he is a doctor, argued that it\u2019s unfair to the people who get welfare benefits not to test them for drugs.\n\n\u201cIf you give a measure of accountability \u2026 you save their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not generous to a person to allow them to continue in a self-destructive lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is working.\u201d\n\nPlaying offense on an issue that just contributed to the defeat of a few colleagues, Landrieu defended her support for Obamacare. Then she attacked Cassidy for opposing Medicaid expansion and said the health care law is working better in Arkansas, Connecticut and New York \u2014 states that expanded the program \u2014 than in Louisiana.\n\nLandrieu said moms are no longer being forced to choose between getting a mammogram and feeding their kids. Costs are coming down, the senator argued, and 88 percent of Louisiana\u2019s population qualifies for the insurance subsidy.\n\n\u201cSandy Hook would not have been prevented by Manchin-Toomey.\u201d\n\nLandrieu said polling shows that more than 90 percent of voters support background checks. \u201cWhat I have voted for \u2026. is to close the loophole so people with mental illness or criminals cannot get easy access to those guns,\u201d she said.\n\nCassidy shot back that the failed amendment, sponsored by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), would not have stopped the 2012 tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cI have an \u2018A+\u2019 from the NRA,\u201d he said. \u201cSen. Landrieu has a \u2018D.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "In the only debate ahead of Saturday\u2019s runoff.", "title": "Louisiana Senate debate: 10 quotes that mattered", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/louisiana-senate-debate-10-quotes-that-mattered-113252.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/01/141201_landrieu_cassidy_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Mary Landrieu,congress,senate,2014 elections,Bill Cassidy,louisiana,elections", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "In the only debate ahead of Saturday\u2019s runoff.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3d7\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Louisiana Senate debate: 10 quotes that mattered Landrieu debated like the underdog( Also on POLITICO: Mary Landrieu stands with Obama \u2014 or hardly knows him)Sen.
