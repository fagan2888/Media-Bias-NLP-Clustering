The cycling community is remembering two of their own, who were killed last Thursday.



Clare Rhoades,72, and Kenneth Vieira, 68, were killed at the intersection of La Canada and Hardy March 3.



They were riding with a group of about 15 cyclists from New Mexico when they were hit.



Kenâ€™s Monday Ride will be held March 7 at Beyond Bread on Ina and Oracle at 10 a.m.



They will stop by the intersection where Rhoades and Vieira were hit and take a moment of silence.



Ken's Monday Ride was named after Kenneth Vieira before he was killed.



Cyclist said he was very influential in the cycling community; some even says Vieira is the person that got them started cycling.
