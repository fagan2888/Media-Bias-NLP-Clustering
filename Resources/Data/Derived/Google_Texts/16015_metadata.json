(REUTERS/Larry Downing)\n\n4357004\n\nPersonal taxpayer information given to state-run Obamacare exchanges could be at risk, according to a federal audit released Thursday.\n\nThe Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said that the IRS is failing to ensure that the security of state-run Obamacare exchanges is up to snuff. The federal agency gave state websites private taxpayer information without checking independent security assessments.\n\n\u201cThe IRS must do more to ensure that federal tax information submitted to the ACA Exchanges is protected and prevent its unauthorized disclosure,\u201d inspector general J. Russell George wrote in the audit.\n\nIn order to determine whether customers are eligible for premium tax credits for Obamacare coverage, the IRS gives out limited tax information to state exchanges through a federal data hub, which routes data across a long list of federal and state agencies.\n\nBut the IRS didn\u2019t require state exchanges or other agencies that receive tax information to submit independent security assessments before handing out sensitive information. Although it requires the states to perform security assessments, in some cases, security authorizations didn\u2019t always meet federal standards, TIGTA found.\n\n\u201cIRS procedures did not require the Exchanges or other agencies to submit an initial independent security assessment report that could help to evaluate risk levels and the status of required security controls,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cTIGTA also found deficiencies in procedures related to obtaining signed system security authorizations and ensuring that on-site reviews of agencies that have deployed new systems occur in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nThe office visited two state exchanges, California and Connecticut, and found that neither had signed security authorizations, in which states formally accept the risks and responsibility of securing tax information.\n\nIn response, the IRS agreed that it should have state exchanges submit security assessments and signed authorizations before giving states taxpayer data \u2014 but repeated the Obama administration\u2019s mantra that no taxpayer data has been breached this far.\n\nSome security risks have already caused problems: Vermont\u2019s state-run Obamacare exchange has been shut down since mid-September at the Obama administration\u2019s request due to security fears.

National Review reported earlier this year that the exchange\u2019s development server was hacked 15 times by a Romanian attacker last December, but the breaches went unnoticed for over a month.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'IRS must do more'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Personal taxpayer information given to state-run Obamacare exchanges could be at risk, according to a federal audit released Thursday.
