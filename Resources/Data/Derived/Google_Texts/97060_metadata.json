With the Jan. 31 deadline fast approaching, the pressure to recruit eligible residents, particularly in Newark, has led to a large volunteer effort, bolstered by college students like Krystel Velez.\n\nVelez, a sophomore at Rutgers University \u2013 Newark, said she\u2019s spent the last few weeks canvassing the streets of Newark where there are about 70,000 residents without health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for a good cause, it\u2019s for helping another, a person, almost like saving a life,\u201d says Velez. \u201cAnd health insurance is kinda like that.\u201d\n\nShe was recruited by a non-profit group called Be Jersey Strong, founded by Aakash Shah, a fourth-year medical student at Harvard and New Jersey native. Shah said he was inspired by his own volunteer efforts three years ago in Alabama when he helped train scores of students who then went on to have over 100,000 conversations with people who needed health insurance.\n\n\u201cI think it was at that point that I realized, well, we might be on to something here,\u201d said Shah. \u201cAnd I made a mental note to myself to come back home where the need was just as great and do it all over again.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy spreading the word among Newark\u2019s uninsured. People are busy. There are language barriers. The weather certainly hasn\u2019t helped. But even on a day when Velez spoke to just a handful of people whizzing by, or huddled at a bus stop on Broad Street, she felt she made a difference, mentioning one man, a native Spanish speaker, who had questions about insurance Velez could answer.\n\n\u201cI saw it on his face,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was like \u2018Wow, where did this girl come from.\u2019 It was priceless.\u201d\n\nMany will face a penalty fee of about $700 if they do not find coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Volunteers fanned out around Newark, to find some of the 70,000 residents who are still without
