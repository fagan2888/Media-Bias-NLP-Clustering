Rousey, a bronze medalist at the 2008 Olympic Games in Judo, was defending her bantamweight (135-lb.) title.\n\n\"Boxers will say she was done with the punches but she wasn't. It was the entire series,\" says David Schrock, a longtime judoka from Sarasota, Fla.\n\nRousey connected on an overhand right to initially stun Davis, and then kneed her in the face when Davis resorted to a single leg attempt. But Rousey went back to her judo, like she always does, to finish the fight.\n\nThe throw was Harai Makikomi, which means sweeping wraparound.\n\n\"It really is a devastating throw,\" said Schrock. \"I can guarantee you, having had it done many times, it knocks all the wind out of you. It collapses the diaphragm.\"\n\nSchrock, who received his black belt 18 years ago, said his coach would not let him or his teammates practice makikomi in training.\n\n\"Rene (Duchesne) would not allow it in our club because when you turn over you land with your shoulder blade in their ribs most of the time. Ronda didn't only pressure with the throw but she continued to put pressure when she drove her hips in.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/ronda-rousey.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Mixed martial arts star and judoka Ronda Rousey demolished Alexis Davis in just 16 seconds Saturday night at UFC 175.\nRousey, a bronze medalist at the 2008 Olympic Games in Judo, was defending her bantamweight (135-lb.)\nBut Rousey went back to her judo, like she always does, to finish the fight.\nRonda didn't only pressure with the throw but she continued to put pressure when she drove her hips in.\"\nSchrock, who received his black belt 18 years ago, said his coach would not let him or his teammates practice makikomi in training."}
