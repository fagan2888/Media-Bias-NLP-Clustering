The court found that negative internet reviews posted by the shadowy \u201cChris W\u201d \u2013 who is allegedly a front for a competitor \u2013 can suffice to state a claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act.\n\nHomeland (the maker of Magic Bullet and Nutribullet) brought a blend of Lanham Act false advertising, trade dress and trade libel claims against Euro-Pro (manufacturer of the competing Nutri Ninja blender line) in the Central District of California based on product packaging, infomercials and \u201cChris W\u2019s\u201d allegedly false internet reviews . Earlier this month, the court dismissed the false advertising claims related to Euro-Pro\u2019s infomercials and product packaging; the claims for \u201cfalse internet reviews,\u201d however, had more juice.\n\nThough the court had dismissed an earlier Homeland complaint based on false internet reviews as conclusory, Homeland\u2019s second amended complaint survived because it \u201cpoint[ed] to a specific review of its product on the internet as well as a comment on that review. The review and the comment allegedly make particular factual statements about Plaintiffs\u2019 products. Plaintiffs allege that these statements are false, and that they are \u2018false reviews\u2019 planted by Defendant.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cfalse review\u201d at issue was on a blender review website containing a \u201cconsumer\u201d review by \u201cChris W\u201d stating that the Nutribullet is loud, prone to spill, and dangerous because lubricant from the motor assembly leaks into the blender jar. Upon information and belief, Homeland alleged that the Chris W review was \u201cclearly contrived\u201d by Euro-Pro because of the extreme technical detail provided in describing the mechanical features of the blender. On these facts, and the assumption that reviews on the Internet are in the stream of interstate commerce, the court found that Homeland\u2019s allegations regarding \u201cChris W\u2019s\u201d comment sufficed to state a claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act.\n\nThe case continues and important questions remain: primarily, is Chris W real or is he a corporate specter? [Hopefully, either way, deposition by s\u00e9ance will not be necessary!] In any event, this case should provide some comfort for advertisers beset by the phantom Internet reviewers conjured by competitors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The court found that negative internet reviews posted by the shadowy Chris W who is allegedly a front for a competitor can suffice to state a claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/nutritious-and-judicious-nutribullet-blender-false-ad-claim-survives-attack-ninjas-a", "type": "article", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "While courts may not officially be in the business of ghostbusting,&amp;nbsp;a district court in California recently offered some support&amp;nbsp;to a blender manufacturer apparently haunted by a phantom rev", "title": "Nutritious and Judicious: Nutribullet Blender False Ad Claim Survives Attack from Ninjas and Phantom Reviewers"}, "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "keywords": "Legal, Business, Internet, Negative Reviews, Communication, False Advertising, Lanham Act, blender, ninja", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Internet, Negative Reviews, Communication, False Advertising, Lanham Act, blender, ninja"}, "article_summary": "The case continues and important questions remain: primarily, is Chris W real or is he a corporate specter?\nEarlier this month, the court dismissed the false advertising claims related to Euro-Pro\u2019s infomercials and product packaging; the claims for \u201cfalse internet reviews,\u201d however, had more juice.\nUpon information and belief, Homeland alleged that the Chris W review was \u201cclearly contrived\u201d by Euro-Pro because of the extreme technical detail provided in describing the mechanical features of the blender.\nIn any event, this case should provide some comfort for advertisers beset by the phantom Internet reviewers conjured by competitors.\nThe court found that negative internet reviews posted by the shadowy \u201cChris W\u201d \u2013 who is allegedly a front for a competitor \u2013 can suffice to state a claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act."}
