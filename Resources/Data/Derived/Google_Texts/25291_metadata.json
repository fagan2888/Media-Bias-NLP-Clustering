Out of 5 million U.S. hospital readmissions, approximately 76% are considered preventable and potentially worth $26 billion in savings.\n\nKhetarpal added that GTC is going above and beyond what is typically seen in transitional care and that one of their utmost goals is to set the standard for care in this new realm.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re really looking to do is to define transitional care,\u201d Khetarpal said. While there are many definitions and models of care, it comes down to providing live, on-site oversight in the patient\u2019s home as of day one, she said, and providing moderate to high complexity medical decision-making\u2014which is what differentiates transitional care from other forms of post-acute home service.\n\nKhetarpal added that it is also about education for the patient, their family members, the provider, and the involved healthcare organizations. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do at GTC is really to educate as well as provide that service,\u201d she said.\n\nGiven the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate to reduce preventable hospital readmissions, GTC is likely to be joined by other organizations looking to exclusively operate in this niche service.\n\n\u201cI think this is the first of many programs we will see in California and across the nation,\u201d Dr. Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told The Orange County Register. \u201cThis kind of program is exactly what Medicare needs to be doing.\u201d\n\nGTC\u2019s vision, however, extends beyond Medicare.\n\nGiven that non-Medicare patients can have just as many complexities and as much need for this type of service, GTC does offer patients a private pay option and is looking to partner with commercial payers, Khetarpal said.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, it would be amazing if every patient that\u2019s discharged from a hospital, whether it\u2019s a commercial patient or some other care, or even a cash-paying patient, could be discharged with a transitional care provider that could oversee that post-acute care period and provide care coordination,\u201d she said.\n\nGTC is currently providing services in southern California. It aims to expand into northern California by the end of the year and into different parts of the country for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heather Caspi", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/39/53/39534bdf11fe873628522a2e7ad2a0b9.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Payer", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "Transitional care poised to increase impact on health insurance", "pub_date": "aug 12, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-12T13:00:00", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, August 12, 2015, 01:00 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-07-30T13:00:00", "teaser": "<p>Entrepreneurs are rising up to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;dedicated service in this evolving healthcare space.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-08-12", "sailthru.description": "Entrepreneurs are rising up to\u00a0provide\u00a0dedicated service in this evolving healthcare space.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Entrepreneurs are rising up to\u00a0provide\u00a0dedicated service in this evolving healthcare space.", "title": "Transitional care poised to increase impact on health insurance", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/transitional-care-poised-to-increase-impact-on-health-insurance/403767/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/inhome12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/fe/25/fe25a32cc71d4f620cc9b3e13eb1f641.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2aa\"", "article_summary": "Transitional care poised to increase impact on health insuranceTransitional care, a new Medicare billing category as of 2013, is about to see a new form of action thanks to California-based Global Transitional Care, the country\u2019s first Medicare-approved, third-party transitional care provider dedicated exclusively to this service.\n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re really looking to do is to define transitional care,\u201d Khetarpal said.\nThe business oversees vulnerable, post-acute care patients as they transition back to a home setting, with the goals of improving patient care and reducing hospital readmissions, and thereby containing healthcare costs.\n\u201cFrom a Medicare or really any care standpoint, the cost of a readmission versus the cost of transitional care \u2013 there\u2019s no comparison,\u201d GTC CEO Rani Khetarpal told Healthcare Dive.\nKhetarpal added that GTC is going above and beyond what is typically seen in transitional care and that one of their utmost goals is to set the standard for care in this new realm."}
