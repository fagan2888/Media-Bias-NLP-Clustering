Last year, that money paid for 15,000 visits of uninsured patients who received primary care, mental health care and dental services at federally qualified health centers across the state.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re uninsured adults largely, throughout the state of Oklahoma, and there\u2019s no other resource to pay for their care,\u201d said Julie Cox-Kain, senior deputy commissioner at the Health Department. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, and I think people will forgo primary care needs, and that is likely to cause people to be more sick and have to seek care in emergency departments.\u201d\n\nThe agency also will:\n\n\u2022 Eliminate $500,000 that helps pay for the cord blood bank at the Oklahoma Blood Institute, a service that helps people who need stem cell transplants.\n\n\u2022 Eliminate dental health education services, including programming at schools that educates children about oral health.\n\n\u2022 Cut $200,000 from the colorectal cancer screening program, half of the program\u2019s budget. Under the colorectal cancer screening program, uninsured residents who can\u2019t afford the typical $1,200 that a colonoscopy costs get a free screening. And in some cases, these residents are already symptomatic, Cox-Kain said.\n\n\u201cPeople who are uninsured \u2014 they have absolutely no source to pay for this,\u201d Cox-Kain said. \u201cSome of them are symptomatic for colon cancer and need to be screened, and when they\u2019re in there, they do what they always do with colonoscopies \u2014 they remove polyps and precancerous lesions, and if you can identify these things early, you can prevent color cancer from occurring. \u2026 Think about how many of those people may actually come down with colon cancer and think about what the costs will be for having to treat someone. \u2026 That\u2019s going to be a tragedy for their families.\u201d\n\nCox-Kain said she wasn\u2019t sure whether the state accepting federal money for Medicaid expansion \u2014 a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that opens Medicaid eligibility to thousands more low-income adults \u2014 would help with the state Health Department\u2019s budget crisis, but that state leaders must find a way to provide preventive services to low-income residents.\n\n\u201cI think us looking at ways to invest in prevention and to make sure that people can at least get the preventive services they need is something we have to continue \u2026 to talk about, even in bad times like these,\u201d Cox-Kain said.\n\nState leaders also project a revenue shortfall of at least $1.3 billion for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nCounty Agencies\n\nHealth Department leaders are preparing to have a smaller budget in the next fiscal year, with the recommendation to close five to seven county health departments.\n\nCox-Kain said they haven\u2019t determined which county health departments they will close. Considerations do not include Oklahoma City-County Health Department or Tulsa Health Department, which are managed by independent boards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to lead to counties more rural in nature, but again, they still provide thousands of services in these (county) health departments we\u2019re looking at closing. And that\u2019s most likely going to mean thousands of people who aren\u2019t going to get access to services,\u201d Cox-Kain said.\n\nThe agency will also cut funding for contractors of the Oklahoma Child Abuse Prevention program, which provides support and training for high-risk families.\n\nAnd the agency has offered an incentive to retirement-eligible employees to retire this year, which will result in the elimination of about 90 positions.\n\nCox-Kain said, overall, she worries that the cuts will mean Oklahoma, a state that has some of the worst health outcomes in the nation, will lose some of the progress it has made over the years in public health.\n\n\u201cI just hope that these cuts don\u2019t result in those negative downstream effects, but we\u2019re at the point now where we\u2019re cut to the bone, and we\u2019re having to eliminate these services, and I fear there will be serious consequences,\u201d Cox-Kain said.\n\nThe Oklahoman.
