It’s winter again, which means it’s the time of year that water starts taking on all kinds of rogue forms. This year, as others, it does not disappoint. We’ve seen rolling snow logs, heard tinkling ice crystals and watched it solidify and whirl around.

Now it is stacking up onshore in mound after mound of what looks like shattered glass panes.

“Driven by the wind, sheets of ice between a quarter-inch to 3-inches thick began pushing against the shoreline at Brighton Beach, a popular wayside with a rugged shoreline near Duluth,” explained MLive.com, describing the phenomenon caught on video by the nature photography duo known as Radiant Spirit Gallery. “The gyrating ice forms a jagged beachscape as the sheets, like panes of glass, break apart and stack haphazardly atop one another.”

More wondrous photography and videos are available on Radiant Spirit Gallery’s Facebook page, along with detailed descriptions of what it was like to witness the phenomenon.

“The seemingly endless ice sheets broke into large plates and stacked on shore, sounding much like breaking glass,” wrote Dawn LaPointe, one of the two partners in Radiant Spirit. “The ice thickness ranged from about 1/4" to about 3" thick. The sights and sounds were incredible!”

Don’t fail to notice the sparkles generated by “the sun gilding the frost flowers that had formed on top of the new ice overnight—icing on the cake!”
