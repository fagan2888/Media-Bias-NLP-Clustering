That\u2019s the message state lawmakers representing Duval County are planning to send to Gov. Rick Scott and legislative leadership in a letter next week.\n\nThe Duval delegation resolved to write the letter at their meeting in Jacksonville Wednesday after hearing from the public, including hospital executives and a hospital association president.\n\nThe discussion will be fresh in their minds when they return to Tallahassee next week to wrestle with a state budget that has a more than $1 billion hole left by the loss of federal money for uninsured patient care called the low-income pool, or LIP. After much wrangling, the feds recently agreed to continue funding Florida\u2019s LIP at about half the rate it\u2019s been getting.\n\nDepending on how the Legislature votes, the UF Health Jacksonville hospital, formerly known as Shands, could close. At the meeting, Denise Hunt told lawmakers her son owes his life to the hospital after being hit by a car.\n\n\u201cMy son, who has Down syndrome\u2014I want to tell this story\u2014he was hit on Main Street,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cHe was suffering from a traumatic brain injury. He should have been dead. Shands hospital saved my son\u2019s life because they have meticulous care, they have the best doctors and they have people who really care.\u201d\n\nUF Health Jacksonville CEO Russ Armistead told lawmakers the hospital would benefit most from a mixture of state, federal and local funding. Right now it receives about $95 million in federal LIP funds and $26 million per year from the county.\n\nArmistead says he\u2019d like the Legislature to authorize Duval County to ask residents if they would approve a special taxing district. That way, he says, a local sales tax could replace the county\u2019s annual appropriation to the hospital. But that could be a long shot, considering it requires approval from the Legislature, City Council, mayor and Jacksonville residents. And Mayor-elect Lenny Curry said several times during his campaign he doesn\u2019t support new taxes.\n\nCurry attended the meeting Wednesday and spoke briefly, saying he wants to be \u201cpart of the solution\u201d to the hospital\u2019s woes.\n\nThat solution should look similar to what the Florida Senate is proposing, says Baptist Health CEO Hugh Greene. He told lawmakers, as CEO of Jacksonville\u2019s largest private employer, he advocates expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to fill the billion-dollar gap that\u2019s only expected to widen as the federal government phases out LIP altogether. But the Florida House leadership and Gov. Scott have said they oppose the Senate plan, even after the Senate recently added a work requirement for Medicaid recipients.\n\nTony Carvahlo, president of the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, says UF Health Jacksonville is one of the most efficiently run in the state. It serves a much higher-than-average percentage of uninsured patients, yet does not benefit from a local tax, as most other urban public hospitals do.\n\nLawmakers will iron out the budget in a special session starting Monday.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "The UF Health Jacksonville hospital is too important to lose.
