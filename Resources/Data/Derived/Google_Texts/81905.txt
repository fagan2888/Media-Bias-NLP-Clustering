The Pace of Middle-Market M&A Held Steady in the First Quarter

Kindreds takeover of Gentiva in the health care sector and Adobes purchase of Fotolia in the tech sector were among the many deals to close in Q1

Middle-market dealmaking in the first quarter performed on par with the same period in the previous year, suggesting that the course for M&A may be as well-groomed in 2015 as it was in 2014, the best year since 2007. (See related graphic.)

The first three months of 2015 yielded 542 completed middle-market transactions worth a total of $70.8 billion, according to preliminary data from Thomson Reuters. The numbers are likely to go higher, as companies continue to report their transactions to the data provider.

Dealmakers remain bullish on Mergers & Acquisitions' monthly surveys. Respondents cite several factors for their on-going optimism, including consumer confidence, which reached a 10-year high in the first quarter and is driven, in part, by a boost to discretionary spending as families paid less for fuel. Many transaction pros reported an uptick in actionable deal leads seen in February and March. They also expressed a sense of urgency to close deals early in the year, before an expected hike in interest rates later in the year.

The sector that dealmakers say they expect will generate the most M&A activity over the next 12 months is health care, which continues to benefit from consolidation opportunities triggered by the Affordable Care Act. The biggest deal in the sector to close in the first quarter was the hostile takeover of Gentiva Health Services Inc. by Kindred Healthcare Inc. (NYSE: KND). The purchase for about $720 million in cash and stock, in a deal valued at $1.8 billion, is one of many deals we're seeing among home-based health care services.

Middle-market pros also expect M&A in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sector to continue expanding in 2015. Among the tech deals to close in the first quarter was the $800 million purchase of stock-photography provider Fotolia LLC by Adobe Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: ADBE) in January. The transaction was fueled by revenues from Adobe's Creative Cloud, a suite of production tools used by content producers. Forbes Inc. also took a page out of the digital media playbook with its acquisition of photo-sharing application Camerama. In both cases, the acquirer used M&A as a way to engage consumers through new products that complement their core operations.

The retail sector, however, had a rough quarter, with many companies reporting financial difficulties in a world increasingly dominated by e-commerce. Struggling denim purveyor Joe's Jeans Inc. (Nasdaq: JOEZ), for example, entered refinancing negotiations with lenders and is working with a restructuring adviser to consider strategic alternatives. Several others, including Wet Seal, Cache and Delia's, ended up in bankruptcy protection and were delisted from their respective stock exchanges in March.

Despite weakness in some sectors, one sure sign of widespread confidence was the proposed $46 billion megamerger of H.J. Heinz -- backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) and Jorge Paulo Lemann's Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital -- with Kraft Foods Group (Nasdaq: KRFT). Announced in late March and expected to close in the second half of the year, the deal will create the third-largest food-and-beverage company in North America and the fifth-largest in the world. Kraft is expected to benefit from Heinz's international presence. Brazil's 3G is known for leading aggressive cost cuts and other efficiency improvements at portfolio companies, including Heinz. In a development dear to the middle market, Heinz hired Lazard Ltd., and Kraft picked Centerview Partners to handle the deal, as both companies chose boutique investment banks over bulge-bracket firms. The combined company, which will be publicly traded under the name Kraft Heinz Co., expects to save $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017.

Editor's note: To measure activity in the middle market, Mergers & Acquisitions looks at transactions that fulfill several requirements: Deals must have a value of roughly $1 billion or less; they must be completed (not just announced) within the timeframe designated; and they must include at least one U.S. company in the role of buyer and/or seller. Excluded from our charts are: recapitalizations; self-tenders; exchange offers; repurchases; stake purchases; and transactions with undisclosed values, buyers or sellers. Our data provider is Thomson Reuters, which updates its databases continuously. We use the data available at press time.
