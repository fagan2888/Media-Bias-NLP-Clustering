After years in hibernation, it returns today: the 1934 neon Pegasus, which, at this very moment, is being reassembled atop its new perch in front of the downtown Dallas Omni Hotel. But another \u201cicon\u201d on Peeler\u2019s list is almost hidden in plain sight: the 54-year-old, 38-foot-tall neon Big Tex along Stemmons Freeway at Walnut Hill Lane, which advertises a bankrupt business beneath a tangle of concrete and construction.\n\nThe sign advertises a Centennial Liquor Beer & Wine, which drank its last drop in December 2012 after filing for bankruptcy. The empty building at the intersection is still branded a Centennial, its red canopy now a sad shade of faded and abandoned. Many of the other Centennials wear other brand names now; several have become Spec\u2019s. But this location still belongs to the bank, BBVA Compass.\n\nAfter making a few calls this week, we discovered that the property\u2019s about to go up for grabs. Realtor Bill Senkel got the listing only days ago. He and the man at the bank say the next owner might not want the sign. They say they\u2019re willing to sell it separately. Make an offer. Better do it soon.\n\nIt certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time Neon Big Tex has been sold and moved. He was built for David Krauss\u2018 \u201csprawling\u201d 140,000-square-foot Big D Value Mart, which opened on N. Central Expressway just north of Forest Lane on December 1, 1961 (not 1958, the oft-cited opening date). According to our archives, Mayor Earle Cabell was in attendance for the ribbon-cutting; so too the Light Crust Doughboys, Miss Texas, Miss Arizona and Miss Iceland (for real), who rode a float down Central for the extravaganza. The department store was so much more: Churches held services there; the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith Girls held dances there.\n\nThe place didn\u2019t even last a year: A radio operator took over the lease, and after a two-day going-out-of-business sale, the Big D Value Mart shuttered on November 18, 1962.\n\nCentennial, founded in 1936, bought the sign at the end of 1962 and moved it five miles south, to its Lovers Lane location, from which he waved to motorists for decades \u2014 save for a brief time in 1984, when he was damaged by a windstorm that involved major repairs and something of a facelift. In 1993 Centennial sold the location to make way for the Central expansion project, and moved Biggish Tex to Stemmons and Walnut Hill, at the time a prominent location.\n\nBut save for a fleeting glimpse of the lighted (and refurbished!) big man in the pilot episode of AMCs\u2019 Halt and Catch Fire, he\u2019s been all but forgotten (like the Sigel\u2019s sign that moved from Lemmon to Addison in 2009; it\u2019s profoundly missed). The bank and realtors say they\u2019ve been spending weeks trying to figure out who actually owns him. But he can now be yours, they say. It\u2019s cool with Tex. He\u2019s used to a change in scenery every decade or so.\n\nBelow: a brief history of Neon Big Tex.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA0L3dpdGgtdGhlLW9sZC1jZW50ZW5uaWFsLW9uLXN0ZW1tb25zLWZvci1zYWxlLXdoby13aWxsLWdldC1jdXN0b2R5LW9mLXRoZS1pY29uaWMtbmVvbi1iaWctdGV4Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "\"We need to keep a better eye on our icons,\" Tom Peeler wrote in the July 1997 issue of D before counting down the famous, the familiar and the kinda,\u2026", "title": "With the old Centennial on Stemmons for sale, who will get custody of the iconic neon Big Tex?", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/04/with-the-old-centennial-on-stemmons-for-sale-who-will-get-custody-of-the-iconic-neon-big-tex.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/04/HaltandCatchFireSign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-25T12:43:46Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb434\"", "article_summary": "Below: a brief history of Neon Big Tex.\nIt certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time Neon Big Tex has been sold and moved.\nBut another \u201cicon\u201d on Peeler\u2019s list is almost hidden in plain sight: the 54-year-old, 38-foot-tall neon Big Tex along Stemmons Freeway at Walnut Hill Lane, which advertises a bankrupt business beneath a tangle of concrete and construction.\nThe place didn\u2019t even last a year: A radio operator took over the lease, and after a two-day going-out-of-business sale, the Big D Value Mart shuttered on November 18, 1962.\nThe sign advertises a Centennial Liquor Beer & Wine, which drank its last drop in December 2012 after filing for bankruptcy."}
