Although those funds are being treated as a \u201ccontingency\u201d for accounting purposes, in fact there is no doubt that they will migrate into the Pentagon\u2019s base budget for readiness and general operations.\n\nRelated: 5 Gimmicks in the GOP\u2019s \u2018Gimmick-Free\u2019 Budget\n\nAnd because the additional funding is being funneled through the special OCO account, Congress will not be obliged to find offsetting cuts in other programs. It will simply add it to the budget deficit next year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying this is a contingency, we\u2019re just putting it there on the off chance [we will need it],\u201d Ams said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no off chance. It\u2019s close to 100 percent they\u2019re going to use it. Congress just doesn\u2019t want to make the hard decisions. If we put it directly into the defense budget then we have to have some offsets or tax increases, heaven forbid. This way you subvert the definition of a contingency and you create a loophole. And certainly in the private sector this wouldn\u2019t stand scrutiny.\u201d\n\nAms isn\u2019t the only one displeased with this latest accounting gimmick embedded in the Republican\u2019s fiscal 2016 budget, which cleared the House and Senate earlier this year. Democrats and budget watchdogs have howled over the budgetary sleight of hand that allowed the GOP to circumvent a $523 billion defense cap imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act, while President Obama has vowed to veto the defense appropriations bill unless the provision is removed.\n\nThe Overseas Contingency Operations fund was meant to exclusively cover the cost of personnel, weaponry, supplies and logistical support to the roughly 2.5 million troops sent to war beginning shortly after the 9/11 attacks. But gradually, OCO evolved into an all-purpose slush fund for the military, members of Congress and the Bush and Obama administrations. Policy makers found it convenient to use the account not only for fighting overseas but to fund routine costs of Department of Defense personnel and benefits or to purchase weapons system still in the production stage.\n\nRelated: House GOP\u2019s Creative Accounting Lifts Defense Budget\n\nIn the latest skirmish over OCO, Senate Republicans yesterday beat back a Democratic effort led by Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island to freeze the extra $38 billion in the OCO account until the two parties can strike a budget compromise later this year to breach the caps and increase spending for both defense and domestic programs.\n\nReed offered his plan as an amendment to a new defense authorization bill pending on the Senate floor. Reed argued that the Republicans\u2019 back-door funding of the Pentagon could become a precedent for future attempts to shatter budget discipline.\n\n\u201cIf this were a one-year, temporary fix you might justify it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing is a pathway that [Congress is] going to take every year \u2013 more OCO, more OCO, more OCO \u2013 and more remote use of OCO funds. That\u2019s the way, unfortunately, it tends to be around here. You go where the money is, and right now the money is in OCO.\u201d\n\nSenate Armed Services Chair John McCain (R-AZ) conceded that funding national defense through the OCO account is not ideal, \u201cbut it\u2019s far better than the alternative, which is to deny the men and women in uniform $38 billion that they desperately need now.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s amendment went down, 51 to 46, on a straight party line vote.\n\nRelated: Obama Would Violate Budget Control Act with $34B More for Defense\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government watchdog, says that OCO is a \u201cslush fund,\u201d pure and simple.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extra place to stuff cash to evade the budget caps\u2026,\u201d Ellis said yesterday.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "John Ams, vice president of the National Society of Accountants, says the games Congre", "title": "How Post-9/11 Spending on Troops Became a Pentagon Slush Fund", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/10/How-Post-911-Spending-Troops-Became-Pentagon-Slush-Fund", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/10/How-Post-911-Spending-Troops-Became-Pentagon-Slush-Fund", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "John Ams, vice president of the National Society of Accountants, says the games Congre", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9437\"", "article_summary": "If we put it directly into the defense budget then we have to have some offsets or tax increases, heaven forbid.\nRelated: 5 Gimmicks in the GOP\u2019s \u2018Gimmick-Free\u2019 BudgetAnd because the additional funding is being funneled through the special OCO account, Congress will not be obliged to find offsetting cuts in other programs.\nBut gradually, OCO evolved into an all-purpose slush fund for the military, members of Congress and the Bush and Obama administrations.\nReed argued that the Republicans\u2019 back-door funding of the Pentagon could become a precedent for future attempts to shatter budget discipline.\n\u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing is a pathway that [Congress is] going to take every year \u2013 more OCO, more OCO, more OCO \u2013 and more remote use of OCO funds."}
