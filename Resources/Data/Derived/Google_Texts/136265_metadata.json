His work, however, shows up every week on the stat sheet. The second-round draft pick from Indiana stars on the Broncos\u2019 scout team. He already has played the role of T.Y. Hilton, Dwayne Bowe and Percy Harvin \u2014 and this past week, he played the role of the man Broncos fans hope he can become, Eric Decker.\n\n\u201cI am doing what I can to help team win. I want my work to translate for the defense on game day,\u201d Latimer said. \u201cIn my predicament now, I don\u2019t really worry about whether I will play or not. I know my time will come.\u201d\n\nThe transition to the NFL has been jarring. Latimer had always been a star, excelling in basketball before picking up football during his junior year of high school. Watching from the Denver sideline \u2014 a healthy scratch in three consecutive games \u2014 has been humbling but educational. Latimer\u2019s practices serve as graduate school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I will be talking to our defense on the sideline, and I will tell them, \u2018This is about to be a touchdown.\u2019 They are like, \u2018You were right,\u2019 \u201d said Latimer, who dropped only one pass in his senior season at Indiana and caught the Broncos\u2019 attention with his blocking. \u201cI see the formations, picture what will happen and picture myself out there. It\u2019s helping me. My football knowledge is growing every day.\u201d\n\nHis role will grow too, whether it\u2019s this season or next year. Before the Broncos headed to the Meadowlands to play the New York Jets on Sunday, Latimer talked about his hoop dreams, movies and the challenge of learning the Denver playbook.\n\nQ: As a former college star, how have you dealt with not playing?\n\nA: It\u2019s tough. I have been getting a lot of support. I didn\u2019t know a lot of the offense when I got here. I would get down on myself. My teammates helped me build my confidence. Now each day I smile, practice hard and make plays. I know I can do this. I am confident. It\u2019s just whenever the time comes, be ready. You don\u2019t want to be one of those players that when somebody goes down, you are unprepared.\n\nQ: Denver\u2019s playbook isn\u2019t easy to master. What makes it difficult for a wide receiver?\n\nA: It\u2019s totally different than college. We had audibles, but we looked to the sideline for signals. A couple of routes converted. Here, all of the routes convert. Here, you don\u2019t play a certain position. You could play either slot, outside, or maybe even the tight end position. You have to learn everything. In college, I might know two outside roles. Here, I know all of the roles, routes and the blitzes. And each position has something different. It has helped a lot. I am learning so much, soaking it in.\n\nQ: In arguably the deepest wide receiver draft ever \u2014 33 were selected, including 12 in the first two rounds \u2014 you went 56th overall. Were you worried you might be overlooked because you played at Indiana, which isn\u2019t a power program?\n\nA: I wasn\u2019t worried about that. I was just trying to do my job. My first couple of years there, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about playing in the NFL. I was just trying to help turn around the program because everybody knows it\u2019s a basketball school. We were trying to get to a bowl game.\n\nQ: You excelled at hoops, winning a high school state title for Jefferson Township in Dayton, Ohio, with former Michigan State star Adreian Payne. Who is your favorite basketball player?\n\nA: I am a Kobe Bryant fan. I love the way he plays, how hard he works, the way he wins. You can\u2019t go wrong with that. I was going to try to play basketball at Indiana my freshman year, but I tore my groin. I had to sit the second half of my freshman year in football, so my hoops dreams ended.\n\nQ: Dealing with a broken bone in your right foot, you ran 4.38 in the 40 at your pro day before the draft. How did you pull that off?\n\nA: It was just about pain tolerance, knowing you have to go if you want to make it to the pros. I had a goal to reach. I had put in the work to do it, so it was now or never. I was ready to get out there. As long as I could run, I was doing it.\n\nQ: What do you like most about pro football, and how are you spending your downtime?\n\nA: The fans knowing who we are is the coolest part. And having great teammates. Everybody wants to win, has the same goal. I like to relax by going to movies, whatever is new. I like Denzel Washington. You have to say Denzel wins when talking about movies. Yes, I have seen \u201cRemember the Titans.\u201d Hasn\u2019t everybody seen it?\n\nCody Latimer file\n\n\u2013Starred as a high school basketball player at Jefferson Township in Dayton, Ohio.\n\n\u2013Won state hoops title in his junior season, scoring 24 points with 12 rebounds in championship game.\n\n\u2013Started playing football his junior year of high school.\n\n\u2013Before going to Indiana University, had offers from Michigan State and Ball State to play defense.\n\n\u2013The 10th of 33 receivers selected in last year\u2019s NFL draft.\n\n\u2013Bench pressed 225 pounds 23 times at his pro day.\n\n\u2013Orange one of his favorite colors.
