The Moth Mainstage show returns to Boston on Friday, April 11, and we’re thrilled to welcome the Moth to its new larger venue, the historic Shubert Theatre on Tremont Street.

The show’s theme is “Coming Home: The Moth in Boston” – and what could be better than to come home to Boston’s legendary theater district? Introduced by Radio Boston’s Anthony Brooks and Meghna Chakrabarti, the delightful Ophira Eisenberg once again joins us as emcee.

VIP tickets are available, which includes premium orchestra seating at The Shubert and a reception following the show in the Grand Lobby of The Wang. Appetizers and desserts will be served along with an open bar.
