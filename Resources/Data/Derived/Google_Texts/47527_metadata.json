Over and over, even Obama\u2019s own two appointees to the court \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 have held that the president has exceeded his authority and violated the separation of powers. This coming week, we could see the second-highest court in the land rule that the administration broke the law in enforcing a key provision of Obamacare, calling into question once again Obama\u2019s fidelity to the Constitution \u2014 and further endangering his signature program.\n\nThe case of Halbig v. Sebelius (since renamed Halbig v. Burwell, for the current HHS secretary) was argued before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court in March. It attacks the central nervous system of Obamacare \u2014 the government exchanges that were set up to subsidize health insurance for low-income consumers. If the Supreme Court ultimately finds that the Obama administration violated the law in doling out those subsidies, it could force a wholesale revision of Obamacare. In January, The Hill quoted a key Obamacare supporter as saying that Halbig was \u201cprobably the most significant existential threat to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Jonathan Turley, a noted liberal constitutional-law expert at George Washington Law School, recently agreed, writing in the Los Angeles Times that Halbig \u201ccould leave Obamacare on life support.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has increasingly exasperated both judges and constitutional scholars with his boasts about going around Congress when it doesn\u2019t give him what he wants. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone,\u201d he told reporters before his first Cabinet meeting of 2014, in January. That attitude has prompted his decision to rewrite Obamacare at least 23 times without any involvement of Congress. If Obama\u2019s actions in Halbig are found unconstitutional, in which he imposed taxes no Congress ever authorized, then other parts of Obamacare will become more vulnerable to legal challenge, and Congress will probably have a much bigger say in rewriting or reversing aspects of the law.\n\nAfter all, even Obama has conceded that Obamacare is, to put it politely, rough-hewn. \u201cObviously we didn\u2019t do a good enough job in terms of how we crafted the law,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in November 2013. A prime example? Obamacare established an insurance exchange for each state and authorized the federal government to operate the exchanges in states that chose not to set up their own. But Obamacare\u2019s authors wanted to create strong incentives for states to set up their own health-insurance exchanges \u2014 they mandated penalties for states that opted out. In addition, because Obamacare needed the support of every single Democratic senator (plus the two independents in the 2009 Senate), the law\u2019s supporters were forced to accommodate the demands of key fence-sitters. One such was Ben Nelson, then a Democratic senator from Nebraska, who was concerned about excessive federal control of the exchanges. To gain Nelson\u2019s support, the law specified that subsidies for Obamacare could only go through \u201can Exchange established by the State.\u201d To the surprise of most, over two-thirds of the states declined to establish their own exchanges.\n\nThe Halbig plaintiffs \u2014 individuals and small businesses in six states that didn\u2019t establish state exchanges \u2014 argue that the Obama administration is breaking the law by offering those tax subsidies in all 50 states. The plaintiffs argue that if the subsidies hadn\u2019t been offered in their states, they would have been exempted from the individual-mandate penalties of Obamacare because they couldn\u2019t have afforded to pay for health coverage.\n\nThe Justice Department has responded that the argument is all about a drafting error and insists that Congress actually intended the subsidies to be available to all. The Internal Revenue Service issued a single-paragraph explanation of its decision to ignore the \u201cestablished by a State\u201d language of Obamacare, though this restrictive language appears nine times in the law\u2019s text. Nonetheless, Judge Paul Friedman of the district court in Washington, D.C., upheld the administration\u2019s interpretation in January, allowing the subsidies to continue in all states. But Turley predicts that \u201cthe D.C. Circuit Court may see things quite differently,\u201d given the now-established Obama record of executive overreach that the Supreme Court has documented and repeatedly rebuked.\n\nJonathan Adler, a professor of law at Case Western University who has argued on behalf of the Halbig plaintiffs, has also compiled several recent examples of the Supreme Court\u2019s impatience with poorly drafted legislation. In Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, for example, Justice Elena Kagan noted: \u201cThis court does not revise legislation . . . just because the text as written creates an apparent anomaly as to some subject it does not address.\u201d In Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, stressed that \u201can agency has no power to tailor legislation to bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous statutory terms.\u201d\n\nWhat would happen if, in 34 states, the subsidies that are flowing through the insurance exchanges set up by the federal government were suddenly declared unconstitutional by the courts? Mass chaos, as predicted by Obamacare defenders? Not likely. Instead, some states would move to set up their own exchanges, perhaps benefiting from the lessons of Obamacare\u2019s shaky rollout. But more important, the Obama administration would have no choice but to work with Congress as it revisited the exchange issue and rewrote the law. With that kind of leverage, we could see a Republican House \u2014 possibly joined by a Republican Senate after January 2015 \u2014 that is at last able to force substantial changes in Obamacare despite the president\u2019s obstinancy. A favorable ruling in Halbig by the Supreme Court might be just the two-by-four needed to get President Obama\u2019s attention and make him realize that his pen has run out of enforcement ink.\n\n\u2014 John Fund is national-affairs correspondent for NRO.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Obamacare\u2019s Biggest Legal Threat", "sailthru.author": "John Fund", "description": "The legal positions of President Obama\u2019s Justice Department have been slapped down unanimously a remarkable 13 times in the Supreme Court in the last two years.
