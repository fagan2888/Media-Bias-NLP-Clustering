It\u2019s quickly easy to see why his political star is ascending \u2014 he\u2019s certainly polished and non-bloviating in his demeanor. Compared to his competitors in the GOP race little of what he has to say is notably scary \u2014 unless you dig a little deeper below the surface.\n\nRubio focused his remarks on the on-demand economy \u2014 Uber, Airbnb, Handy.com, and others that use online platforms to connect consumers to freelance workers. Rubio said such companies represent the kind of cutting-edge innovation that \u201conly American free enterprise could produce.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Rubio was big on platitudes he was lighter on specifics. He railed against \u201cburdensome regulations\u201d but provided little insight into which regulations were so burdensome. Much of what he had to say was standard Republican fare \u2014 presenting big, impersonal government as an impediment to economic tranformation and calling Americans \u201cthe most innovative, creative, and productive people on earth.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s what Rubio didn\u2019t talk about that was so striking \u2014 actual workers. Now, to be sure, this was a mostly tech-heavy, entrepreneur crowd, but nonetheless in Rubio\u2019s description, the on-demand economy workers appear to be something of an afterthought. Sure, on the one hand they can use services like Handy or Lyft to be independent entrepreneurs, which is all well and good, unless you\u2019re concerned about things like health care and retirement benefits and workplace protections.\n\nConsider, for example, that Obamacare\u2019s greatest impact is in reforming the individual health insurance market and making it possible for freelance workers to buy affordable health insurance. Rubio wants to repeal Obamacare. His criticism of regulation included things like the minimum wage, which he doesn\u2019t want to see raised, and the federal social safety net, which he wants to see scaled back.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s impossible to talk about the benefits of an on-demand economy without talking about the potential downsides for workers who have almost no job security and no certainty over how much money they will make from year-to-year. Economic innovation is great but without a strengthened safety net, workers are going to see transitory benefits.\n\nIndeed, Rubio claims on his website that he is seeking the presidency because he wants \u201cto make it easier for working families to achieve the American dream,\u201d but based on his comments on Tuesday the only ones who are going to find life easier in a Rubio economy are the mavens of economic innovation \u2014 not the people whose labor they\u2019re profiting from.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.634937431", "eomportal-id": 345197, "description": "Based on his comments Tuesday, a Rubio economy won\u2019t bring the American Dream to everyone.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Based on his comments Tuesday, a Rubio economy won\u2019t bring the American Dream to everyone.", "title": "Marco Rubio talks economic innovation but forgets workers - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/10/07/marco-rubio-talks-economic-innovation-but-forgets-workers/Kg9pYu2QhHYpixzBhHG2VK/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/10/06/BostonGlobe.com/EditorialOpinion/Images/rubio.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Michael A Cohen, Marco  Rubio,Twitter", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 08:12:23 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Michael A Cohen, Marco  Rubio,Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "0232006e-6c5f-11e5-88ca-5b3bb12696aa"}, "article_summary": "Economic innovation is great but without a strengthened safety net, workers are going to see transitory benefits.\nNow, to be sure, this was a mostly tech-heavy, entrepreneur crowd, but nonetheless in Rubio\u2019s description, the on-demand economy workers appear to be something of an afterthought.\nRubio focused his remarks on the on-demand economy \u2014 Uber, Airbnb, Handy.com, and others that use online platforms to connect consumers to freelance workers.\nI went to hear Marco Rubio speak in New York Tuesday about his economic plans for America.\nRubio wants to repeal Obamacare."}
