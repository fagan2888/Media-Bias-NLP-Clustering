Models\u2019 hair, makeup and nail looks offered plenty more to gush about \u2014 and to try to re-create at home.\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of some of the beauty highlights from the fall 2015 shows last month. And although the apparel won\u2019t appear in stores for several more months, who says you can\u2019t incorporate these trends into your hair and makeup routine now?\n\nA strong eye: Break out the smoky shadows and the liners! Eye makeup that\u2019s, well, eye-catching was everywhere on runways for fall 2015. There was the more traditional bold look that relied heavily on charcoals, browns and grays, which designers like Diane von Furstenberg used to tap into models\u2019 sultry sides. Others opted for a sweep of a metallic across the eyelids for a dose of drama. In the David Tlale show, heavy liner applied at an angle was meant to convey the \u201cvision of a strong girl in the aftermath,\u201d said Louise Zizzo for MAC Cosmetics, recommending a good angled brush to achieve the look.\n\nOn the Rodarte runway, a row of tiny Swarovski crystals lined models\u2019 lower lashes for an unexpected way to highlight their eyes. The extra eclectic can take a lesson from Jeremy Scott, who brought his sense of humor and whimsy as a designer to life with bright rainbows of color, such as lime green and hot pink, that encompassed eyelids in their entirety \u2014 and even included the eyebrow.\n\nFlowing free: Designers drew a lot of inspiration from the 1970s for fall, so it was only fitting that models had hairstyles from the decade, too. Several stuck with the freshly-shampooed-and-blow-dried look, with locks loose and bouncing thanks to their natural wave. Parts were down the center, or softly separated on the side. (Backstage beauty tip: Slip a sock diffuser over a hair dryer nozzle when drying hair. The stretchy, lightweight fabric will help prevent heat damage and keep hair from frizzing.)\n\nBare to bold nails: Manicures came in two camps: Sheer nails barely looked polished or they were so stylized you couldn\u2019t help but notice their artistry. For the former \u2014 which some backstage dubbed the \u201cnude\u201d or \u201cnaked\u201d manicure \u2014 nail technicians worked with flesh-toned polishes, neutrals and the occasional luminescent white. Other interpretations included a French manicure with a fine white tip.\n\nIn other cases, creativity \u2014 literally \u2014 came to life on models\u2019 fingertips through nail art with a more organic sensibility. Instead of stenciling designs onto nails with great precision, nail techs often worked free-handed when applying multiple colors or layered hues (a triangle shape done in a gold-flecked polish on top of an emerald base, for instance) by blotting one atop another with a wedged makeup sponge.\n\nA fresh twist: A simple French twist or top knot is so blase, so stylists gave these dos a modern twist. There were buns with fabric or other embellished materials woven throughout for a regal effect. Behind the scenes at the Tlale show, a Rene Furterer stylist used a hair product can to create a perfect curl for a refreshed French twist. For tighter curls, stylists wrapped small sections of hair around long sticks and then heated the hair to set it. Once the stick was removed voila! \u2014 instant curls.\n\nPucker up: Neutrals dominated runways, but for those designers who did dabble in color, rich jewel tones were their go-to hues. Lip looks mimicked the trend with lots of shows featuring models with pouts that popped in deep berries, wine tones and even marsala, the Pantone color of the year.\n\nBanded together: There was a significant resurgence of hair accessories on the runway, the likes of which has not been seen to this degree in quite some time. Chief among them was the hair wrap, in all its varieties \u2014 thick headbands, thin headbands, metallic ponytail wraps, leather pony holders, etc.\n\nSara Bauknecht: sbauknecht@post-gazette.com or on Twitter and Instagram @SaraB_PG.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here\u2019s a recap of some of the beauty highlights from the fall 2015 shows.
