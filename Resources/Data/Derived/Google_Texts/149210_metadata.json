Larry Hogan holds a news conference in front of the State House on the last day of the legislative session on April 13 in Annapolis. (Brian Witte/AP)\n\nThe Republican Party in this mostly blue state wants more than a Republican in the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nParty leaders who gathered here Saturday for their semiannual convention say they are trying to harness momentum from Larry Hogan\u2019s underdog victory in hopes of winning other statewide races, growing the number of Republicans in the General Assembly \u2014 and reelecting Hogan in 2018.\n\nIn the months since the November election, the state party hired its first financial director to maximize fundraising and has focused on recruiting and training Republicans to run for local offices in hopes that they will one day run statewide, said Diana D. Waterman, the party\u2019s chairwoman.\n\nShe said the party will soon launch voter registration initiatives to increase the number of registered Republicans in Maryland, especially in the three counties where Democrats hold only a slight edge and Hogan won by huge margins: Dorchester, Kent and Somerset.\n\n\u201cWith a concerted effort, we can flip it,\u201d Waterman said. \u201cTarget that and flip it.\u201d\n\n[Which counties did Hogan win, and by how much?]\n\nA first test for the party will come in 2016, when longtime U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) plans to retire, unexpectedly opening the Senate seat she has held since the 1980s.\n\nAlthough statewide races are \u201cstill tough for us,\u201d Waterman said, she expects Republican candidates to step forward for the Senate seat this summer \u2014 and potentially to compete for any congressional seats vacated by Democratic lawmakers who also run to succeed Mikulski.\n\nAnd in 2018, there will be another governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u201c2016 is important, but all roads lead to 2018 for us,\u201d Waterman said. \u201cThe governor is very, very interested in growing the party, helping us to be successful, because he needs a strong Republican Party to help him win reelection.\u201d\n\nHogan says he has yet to take an active role in party politics since taking office in late January. On Saturday, he offered a rallying speech that started with this question: \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be a Maryland Republican, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe party has adopted the slogan \u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d and the convention program featured a drawing of an elephant crushing a donkey with bulging eyes and its tongue extended.\n\nHogan directly connected the resurgence of the party to his candidacy, starting four years ago when he founded \u201cChange Maryland,\u201d a grass-roots organization that advocated for lower taxes and more transparency from the Democrats in charge.\n\nHis election, Hogan argued, was part of a statewide movement \u2014 not a fluke or a result of low Democratic turnout. He said there are more Republicans elected to local offices than Democrats statewide, and he pointed out that the party also picked up several seats in the Maryland General Assembly in November, although Democrats still hold strong majorities in both chambers.\n\n\u201cThey said the Maryland Republican Party was dead. They said we would never elect another Republican statewide. They thought we were extinct,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWell, they were wrong! We\u2019re better. We\u2019re stronger. And we\u2019re more unified than we have ever been in the history of our state.\u201d\n\nThe governor took credit for having \u201cchanged the focus\u201d in Annapolis during the three-month legislative session that concluded on Monday by slowing budget growth, shrinking a structural deficit and pushing through a small amount of tax relief.\n\n[Hogan, Democratic lawmakers end session with tug-of-war]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue the efforts that we\u2019ve been doing over the past four years or so,\u201d Hogan said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re headed in the right direction. . . . We\u2019ve never been this strong.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris \u2014 Maryland\u2019s lone Republican in Congress \u2014 also spoke, urging Republicans to offer \u201cfresh, new ideas\u201d that can gain traction in minority communities, such as pushing for parents having more choice in their children\u2019s schools and revamping health-care options for veterans.\n\nIn the afternoon, there were workshops on connecting with millennial voters who are often moderate on social issues, breaking into the Democrats\u2019 \u201cstronghold on the black community,\u201d talking to the news media without getting into trouble, grass-roots campaigning skills, fundraising and \u201cdealing with Obamacare,\u201d according to a program.\n\nJoe Crawford, a longtime party activist from Charles County, said attracting more young people and minorities to the party is key to its future success. He boasted that his county\u2019s central committee includes an African American woman, Sandra Reissig.\n\n\u201cWho knew? If you actually go and ask someone to participate, they will,\u201d Crawford said. He said he and other old-timers \u201cstill have a good bit of energy . . . but how long is that going to last?\u201d\n\nCharles, a fast-growing area about 35 miles south of Washington, went for Democrat Anthony G. Brown in the governor\u2019s race, but only by a few percentage points.\n\nCrawford said attendance at GOP meetings in the county spiked before the election and then continued to grow, even though the county \u2014 like the state overall \u2014 has more than twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans. Other Republicans reported similar bursts of energy and interest in their counties.\n\n\u201cI see people who are starting to pay attention who never paid attention,\u201d said Maria Pycha, first vice chairwoman for the Baltimore County GOP. \u201cWe have to stay out there and keep the momentum.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At party convention in Ocean City, Hogan says: \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be a Maryland Republican, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "At party convention in Ocean City, Hogan says: \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be a Maryland Republican, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "title": "With Hogan as governor, Md.
