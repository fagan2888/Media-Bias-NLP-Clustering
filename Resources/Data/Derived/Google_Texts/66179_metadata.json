Koch, Donald J. Trump had a message for his rivals.\n\n\u201cI wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers,\u201d Mr. Trump, who leads in many national polls, wrote in a Sunday morning Twitter post. \u201cPuppets?\u201d\n\nThe answer to his question, of course, is a matter of perspective.\n\nThe candidates who made the pilgrimage to Dana Point, Calif., this weekend to address the gathering of wealthy donors were either pandering to the brothers at one of their twice-yearly seminars (beg-a-thons, in Trump parlance) or simply hoping to woo an influential network of Republicans who could help finance their campaigns through what is shaping up to be a grueling nominating process.\n\nRich donors have emerged as more crucial than ever this election cycle, with the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision allowing a tsunami of big money into politics, especially through \u201csuper PACs\u201d \u2014 political organizations that are outside the campaigns but often act as de facto extensions of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA New York Times analysis found that fewer than 400 families had contributed nearly half the money raised in the 2016 presidential campaign so far, with roughly 130 families and their businesses providing more than half the money that Republican candidates and their super PACs had raised through June.\n\nAnd so, as Mr. Trump assailed his rivals for behaving like \u201cpuppets\u201d of the Koch brothers, many of the leading Republican candidates \u2014 including former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida; Senator Ted Cruz of Texas; Senator Marco Rubio of Florida; and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin \u2014 found themselves trying to walk the fine line between courting the brothers\u2019 vast wealth and not coming across as their marionettes.\n\n(Mr. Trump, who is heavily financing his own campaign, was not invited to the conference, where the coveted speaking slots were assigned by members of the Koch network. And a political data company set up by the Koch brothers has reportedly declined to do business with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.)\n\nOn Saturday, Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, and Mr. Walker addressed the gathering of about 450 people in back-to-back question-and-answer sessions, praising the Koch network and dismissing concerns about the outside money flooding into presidential politics. They were not shy about flattering the donors, some of whom are already financing their campaigns or super PACs. Mike Allen of Politico moderated all of the sessions.\n\n\u201cThese are people who care deeply about our nation, and who are willing to put their time and their energy and their resources and their minds to the challenge of making a better nation,\u201d Ms. Fiorina said, referring to the Koch network.\n\nShe added that the news media seemed to worry about the influx of outside money on the Republican side, but not similar donations from liberal hedge-fund billionaires like George Soros, a philanthropist, and Tom Steyer, an environmentalist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for Democrats to complain about corporations getting engaged in politics, and yet they never have a problem with unions getting engaged in politics,\u201d Ms. Fiorina said. \u201cWe have a right \u2014 everyone has a right \u2014 to speech in this country. And as we all know, any kind of speech costs money in this country.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker was similarly laudatory, saying he wished \u201cthe whole world could see what goes on here.\u201d\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\n\u201cSo many of you here aren\u2019t here because of any interest on behalf of your personal finances or your industries, you\u2019re here because you love America,\u201d Mr. Walker said, before likening those in the Koch network to the everyday Americans he had met at Tea Party rallies across the country. Those people, he said, \u201cmay not have a lot of net worth, but they\u2019re out fighting Obamacare, they\u2019re fighting for their country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think David and Charles have kind of harnessed that frustration,\u201d Mr. Walker added, \u201cand said, \u2018Instead of just being angry about it, let\u2019s do something about it.\u2019 \u201d On Sunday, Mr. Rubio was asked if he thought the nonprofit 501(c) (4) organization supporting his campaign should have to disclose its donors \u2014 a question he largely skirted, but one that seemed relevant to the crowd, as the Koch network takes steps to avoid disclosing many of its donors.\n\n\u201cI just ask every group out there to comply with the law,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cUltimately, people have a First Amendment right to participate in the American political process, and as I\u2019ve said before, as long as newspapers and television stations keep charging people to speak out on politics, we\u2019re going to have to keep raising money.\u201d\n\nOf the six invited candidates, only Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky skipped the gathering, instead spending the weekend meeting with voters in Iowa and Illinois. \u201cPacked house in Niles, Illinois!\u201d Mr. Paul said on Twitter over the weekend. \u201cLet\u2019s turn Illinois from blue to red in 2016!\u201d\n\nIn the final session of the conference, Mr. Allen dubbed Mr. Bush \u201cthe $120 million man\u201d \u2014 a reference to how much his campaign and super PAC have raised so far \u2014 before asking how much money is too much.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think you might as well front-load if you can,\u201d Mr. Bush said, to laughter.\n\nTurning more serious, he added that he was \u201crunning hard\u201d and that money would help that effort. \u201cI\u2019m playing by the rules of the game, the way it was laid out, and if people don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s just tough luck,\u201d Mr. Bush concluded, as the crowd erupted in applause.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150802202755, "twitter": {"description": "The billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H.
