Rand Paul (R) of Kentucky seems to be struggling. He lags most other GOP candidates in fundraising. His poll numbers, never very high to begin with, have dropped to low single digits. To get media attention, he\u2019s resorted to doing bad impressions of Donald Trump.\n\nAside from whatever personal or organizational shortcomings the senator may have, the Paul campaign has one fundamental problem. Its strategy hinges on rallying libertarian Republicans, a group that scarcely exists in the GOP primary electorate.\n\nLibertarianism is a political philosophy that believes in minimal government across the board. It is both coherent and intellectually consistent. Libertarians would slash the welfare state, drastically limit intervention overseas, and maximize personal liberty in matters such as drug possession. (See here for a more complete definition.) This school of thought has deep intellectual roots, drawing on the work of Nobel Prize winners Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, among many others.\n\nRecommended: 14 Republicans running in 2016\n\nA while back, some commentators speculated that the 2016 campaign might be \u201cthe libertarian moment.\u201d The Affordable Care Act had triggered a backlash against bureaucracy, attitudes toward social issues were rapidly becoming more tolerant, and Senator Paul got applause for his famous filibuster against the administration\u2019s drone program.\n\nIt was a false dawn. In 2014, the Pew Research Center found that 11 percent of Americans (and 12 percent of Republicans) called themselves libertarian and knew what the term means. But the survey also found few of them held consistent libertarian views on the role of government, national security, and social issues. For example, 41 percent of self-described libertarians said that government regulation of business is necessary for the public interest, and 43 percent said that \u201cit is best for the future of our country to be active in world affairs.\u201d\n\nIn hindsight, it seems that the Paul camp was misreading the tea leaves. Although the general public is shifting on social issues, Republicans remain more conservative than other groups. For instance, while majorities of independents (58 percent) and Democrats (59 percent) favor legalizing marijuana, an equally large majority of Republicans (59 percent) opposes it. A number of Republicans have faulted President Obama\u2019s policies on terrorism, but in these polarized times, much of this opposition merely reflects partisan animus. The next time a Republican is in the White House, most of the criticism will come from the Democratic side.\n\nThe experience of Senator Paul\u2019s father shows that libertarianism has a low ceiling in the GOP. Then-Rep. Ron Paul (R) of Texas sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012, but in spite of very strong fundraising totals, he did not win a single primary in either year.\n\nSenator Paul is trying to gain ground by stressing his economic conservatism. That message will hardly distinguish him from the rest of the field. Every other candidate claims to be an economic conservative \u2013 even former New York Gov. George Pataki, who notoriously made deals with his state\u2019s powerful unions.\n\nPerhaps a future \u201clibertarian moment\u201d will give Rand Paul a chance \u2013 but it won\u2019t happen in 2016.\n\nJack Pitney writes his Looking for Trouble blog exclusively for the Monitor.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "9f5aabb5e95e0dbdfc1a49fbcb6e6683", "sailthru.author": "Jack Pitney", "description": "The Paul campaign has a big problem: Its strategy hinges on rallying libertarian Republicans, a group that scarcely exists in the GOP primary electorate.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/08/928603_3_0814-RAND-PAUL-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "The Paul campaign has a big problem: Its strategy hinges on rallying libertarian Republicans, a group that scarcely exists in the GOP primary electorate.", "title": "Why Rand Paul is doing bad impressions of Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2015/0814/Why-Rand-Paul-is-doing-bad-impressions-of-Donald-Trump", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/08/928603_3_0814-RAND-PAUL-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/08/928603_3_0814-RAND-PAUL-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "The Paul campaign has a big problem: Its strategy hinges on rallying libertarian Republicans, a group that scarcely exists in the GOP primary electorate.", "site": "@csmonitor", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Rand Paul is doing bad impressions of Donald Trump"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-14", "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-14T11:47:06-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2015/0814/Why-Rand-Paul-is-doing-bad-impressions-of-Donald-Trump", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics-voices,section-politics,section-usa,class-blog-post,storysource-guest-blogger", "article": {"section": "Politics Voices", "published_time": "2015-08-14T11:47-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Charles Krup/AP"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97fb\"", "article_summary": "Although the general public is shifting on social issues, Republicans remain more conservative than other groups.\nAside from whatever personal or organizational shortcomings the senator may have, the Paul campaign has one fundamental problem.\nTo get media attention, he\u2019s resorted to doing bad impressions of Donald Trump.\nThe Paul campaign has a big problem: Its strategy hinges on rallying libertarian Republicans, a group that scarcely exists in the GOP primary electorate.\nSenator Paul is trying to gain ground by stressing his economic conservatism."}
