GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — A Parachute man is expected to plead not guilty to murder in the death of his one-month-old daughter.

The Daily Sentinel reports (http://bit.ly/1pT0p8V ) that 30-year-old Matthew Ogden is scheduled to enter not guilty pleas in May to murder and child abuse in the June 20 death of Sarah Ogden, who had a bruised liver and a fractured skull. A judge has set his trial for September.

Sarah’s mother, Phyllis “Amy” Wyatt, pleaded not guilty to child abuse that caused the child’s death and was sentenced to eight years in prison.

Police say Wyatt told them Ogden violently shook the baby overnight, but Wyatt did not get out of bed. The two skipped town before arrest warrants were issued but were arrested a short time later in Minnesota.
