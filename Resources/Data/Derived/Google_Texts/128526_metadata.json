H.B. 1047, which would bar abortions after viability, passed the Senate by a party line 24-15 vote. State Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, told the Miami Herald if a woman wishes to abort, she should \u201cmake that choice before the baby is able to live on its own outside of the womb.\u201d The bill previously passed the House 70-45 and is now on the desk of Gov. Rick Scott, a pro-life Republican. He is expected to sign the measure, which would penalize abortionists who abort a child after that point unless they certify, in writing, that an abortion is necessary to save the mother's life or physical health. The move comes as the Florida Planned Parenthood PAC has launched a voter campaign designed, in the words of CEO Lillian Tamayo, to focus on \u201cthe wave of anti-women\u2019s health legislation.\u201d\n\nState Attorney General Pam Bondi has asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit challenging the state's constitutional marriage protection amendment, saying redefining marriage would \"impose significant public harm\" on society. More than 61 percent of Florida voters approved Florida's Amendment 2 in 2008, with surveys finding the state's black population among those most likely to approve. The ACLU is suing to overturn the measure, which was intended to protect an ancient institution that fosters child-rearing. \"Florida's marriage laws, she said in her court brief, \u201chave a close, direct, and rational relationship to society's legitimate interest in increasing the likelihood that children will be born to and raised by the mothers and fathers who produced them in stable and enduring family units.\u201d\n\nOhio\n\nAn Ohio bill would bar all insurance companies statewide from covering abortion except in the case of ectopic or tubal pregnancies. The legislature had the first hearing on H.B. 351, introduced by Cincinnati Rep. John Becker, on Tuesday. It would also prevent taxpayers from subsidizing abortifacient contraception such as the IUD for state employees through their insurance plans. Democratic Rep. John Carney said it is \"just a fact\" that the IUD is not an abortifacient; however, health agencies and the device's manufacturer agree the IUD may prevent the implantation of a newly conceived child. The insurance provision follows the lead of neighboring Michigan, which is traditionally more liberal on abortion. The Ohio bill does not allow anyone who receives state funds to purchase the separate \u201cabortion rider.\u201d\n\nNew York\n\nSenate Democrats have reintroduced the Women's Equality Act, Gov. Andrew Cuomo's 10-point bill that contains a plank allowing a massive expansion of abortion statewide. Just weeks earlier, the Senate Health Committee voted down the abortion provision as a stand-alone measure dubbed the \u201cReproductive Health Act,\u201d by a 9-7 party line vote. The WEA would formally extend legal sanction to late-term abortion and open the door to non-physicians performing abortions. Cuomo first introduced the omnibus bill allegedly advancing women's rights in June 2013, likening it to the Bill of Rights. Although it passed the Assembly that month, it was defeated in the Senate. Some see Cuomo as a potential 2016 presidential hopeful, challenging Hillary Clinton from the left. According to People's World, the official publication of the Communist Party USA, Cuomo was recently endorsed for re-election as governor by the Working Families Party, a coalition of former ACORN affiliates and labor unions.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois right to life supporters have expressed concern that the Republican candidate for governor, Bruce Rauner, skipped the 45th anniversary dinner of Illinois Right to Life but two days later showed up at a pro-abortion event hosted by the ACLU. The ACLU Bill of Rights event, hosted in part by Democratic congresswoman and Democratic Socialists of America member Jan Schakowsky, celebrated the \u201cright to choose.\u201d Illinois Right to Life Committee Executive Director Emily Zender told Illinois Review, a state conservative publication, \u201cIt is disgusting that Mr. Rauner would give money to, and celebrate with, an organization that brags about its support of partial birth abortion, a gruesome procedure involving the severing of the spinal cords of fully developed unborn children.\u201d David E. Smith of the Illinois Family Institute asked, \"When is Mr. Rauner going to reach out to conservatives in Illinois?\u201d According to the Huffington Post, Rauner has said that \u201cthe right for a woman to choose is a national law. That\u2019s not going to change in Illinois.\u201d However, he said he supports parental notification laws and bans on late-term abortion.\n\nRauner is also experiencing trouble for his position on redefining marriage. Rauner said that the state's voters should have decided whether the state would legalize gay \u201cmarriage,\u201d rather than having a bill pass the legislature. But he told CBS in Chicago that he is not opposed to redefining marriage, and now that the law has changed, \u201cI don\u2019t have any agenda to change it.\u201d The law, signed by Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who is running for re-election, took effect on Sunday, June 1. On Monday, Quinn attended a homosexual \u201cwedding,\u201d where he called the new law \u201ca great civil rights measure.\" According to the Northwest Herald, Quinn added, \"I didn't need a referendum to tell me what was the right thing to do.\"\n\nIllinois voters will be consulted on whether insurance plans should have to offer contraception \u2013 but their decision will not have any effect on the law. The state Senate and House voted to place a non-binding question on the fall ballot asking, \u201cShall any health insurance plan in Illinois that provides prescription drug coverage be required to include prescription birth control as part of that coverage?\u201d However, state law has mandated such coverage since 2003. Republicans say the initiative is an attempt to increase Democratic turnout during the election. \"It's a stunt. It's a game, and everybody down here knows it,\" said State Sen. Matt Murphy, R-Palatine.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nThe senior policy advisor of Planned Parenthood of New England, Jennifer Frizzell, is considering running for the New Hampshire state Senate. WMUR reports that the abortion industry tactician is one of five potential candidates for the seat being vacated by long-serving Concord Democrat Sylvia Larsen.\n\nMaryland\n\nGov. Martin O'Malley signed a bill barring \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against transgender people, a bill that would require public facilities to allow biological males to use the women's restroom. Businesses also believe they open the door to costly but baseless discrimination lawsuits. O'Malley, a Democrat who is a member of the Roman Catholic Church, signed the Fairness for All Marylanders Act of 2014 in mid-May. Maryland became the 18th state to enact such a law.\n\nMichigan\n\nMichigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, says he supports a law banning what he terms \"discrimination\" against homosexuals and transgender people, similar to the one signed by Maryland Gov. O'Malley. The bill is largely supported by the Chamber of Commerce. The city of Saginaw unanimously rejected such a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d around the time Gov. Snyder made his remarks. The self-described \"nerd,\" who was swept into office in the Tea Party landslide year of 2010, is up for re-election this November. The GOP-controlled House may move forward on his suggestion. \"If we can find a way to do that, he's ready to move on this,\u201d according to Ari Adler, a spokesman for Republican House Speaker Jase Bolger of Marshall.\n\nMeanwhile, a new poll shows that support for marriage redefinition is falling in Michigan. The EPIC-MRA poll finds the public evenly divided on the issue. In a hypothetical vote to legalize gay \"marriage,\" voters split 47-46 in favor, with seven percent undecided. That's down from last year, when voters supported gay \"marriage\" by a 10-point margin of 51-41.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "A state round-up of pro-life and pro-family news.", "title": "Florida would ban abortion post-viability, Ohio moves to ban abortion insurance, and more", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/news/PamBondi-250px.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/florida-would-ban-abortion-after-viability-ohio-moves-to-ban-insurance-for", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "A state round-up of pro-life and pro-family news."}, "description": "A state round-up of pro-life and pro-family news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93a7\"", "article_summary": "In a hypothetical vote to legalize gay \"marriage,\" voters split 47-46 in favor, with seven percent undecided.\nNew HampshireThe senior policy advisor of Planned Parenthood of New England, Jennifer Frizzell, is considering running for the New Hampshire state Senate.\nIllinois voters will be consulted on whether insurance plans should have to offer contraception \u2013 but their decision will not have any effect on the law.\nJust weeks earlier, the Senate Health Committee voted down the abortion provision as a stand-alone measure dubbed the \u201cReproductive Health Act,\u201d by a 9-7 party line vote.\nFloridaThe state of Florida is poised to protect children from abortion if they have the capacity to survive outside the womb."}
