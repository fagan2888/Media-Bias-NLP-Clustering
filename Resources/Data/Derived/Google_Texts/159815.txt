It's been one month since a McPherson teacher was critically injured in a car accident on her way to school. She is still unconscious.

Thirty-eight-year-old Mija Stockman is in a Nebraska rehabilitation hospital after suffering a traumatic brain injury on December 20th.

The McPherson County Sheriff's department said Mija Stockman was on her way to school when a pickup truck went left of the center line and hit Stockman's car head-on.

Mija's daughter Eryn is a freshman in college. She hopes to see her mom's smile soon.

"Seeing her now, she has made such an improvement," said Eryn. "Like she just needs to wake up."

Eryn says her mom will rub her hand, or tap her finger to music, so they are hopeful she will wake up soon.
