Thorne defended his title in the event and added the 100 butterfly crown to his resume. ( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 For a guy who talks about how much he likes to race, Jack Thorne sure knows how to take the excitement out of one.\n\nEven in the state finals.\n\nThen again, maybe the Thompson Valley junior deserved a cakewalk considering when it came time to steal a title from a favorite, he was more than up to his word.\n\nThorne was one of three swimmers at the 4A State Swimming and Diving Championships to double up with titles, taking his signature event of the 100-yard backstroke after winning the 100 butterfly for the first time, helping the Eagles finish second in the team race to Air Academy, 280-244.\n\n\"I had a lot more fun doing the fly, because it was a really fun race,\" said Thorne, who now has three state titles on his resume. \"It kind of went like the back last year \u2014 you didn't know what really was going to happen until the final 25, so I had a lot of fun. It was just a great race.\"\n\nHe trailed Caleb Hicks of Air Academy for the first 75, then made his move to the front, passing Hicks down the stretch and getting the touch-out, 50.29-50.69, an All-American consideration time and taking down a school record that Seth Orozco set in winning the event at state in 1996.\n\nThere was a reason he wasn't nervous in the slightest when he stood behind the blocks for the championship heat of the backstroke. He was the defending state champion and the current record holder in the classification, and nobody at the meet had showed the slightest bit of interest in challenging him.\n\nNo one ever did. He blew away the field in an All-American time of 48.82, lowering his classification and city records. It was one of only two automatic All-American times on the day, the other being Air Academy's 400 free relay.\n\nThompson Valley's Collin Williams performs a dive on Saturday. He placed fourth, leading three Eagles to score points in the event as the team took second in the team race. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"I was pretty happy with that,\" said Thorne, who beat runner-up Blake Logan of Broomfield by 3.67 seconds. \"I was shooting for a 47, but I'm pretty happy with that. Next year is going to be even better. I'm really excited for next year.\"\n\nHe's not the only Eagle excited for next year, as the brunt of their scoring came from a group of underclassmen. Liam Gately was second in both the 200 and 500 freestyles, while classmate Chris Eddy was ninth and fourth, respectively in the races. All three divers who scored \u2014 led by Collin Williams' fourth-place showing \u2014 are back next year, along with Jack Kisch, who helped two relays place in the top eight.\n\n\"I think we did great as a team,\" Eddy said. \"We're pumped for next year. It's going to be great for next year. I think Liam just pumped us up (Friday), and that got us excited for finals. I just want to beat Liam.\"\n\nGately isn't making that easy. Even though he went into both events seeded first, he still dropped time in both races, setting the school record in the 500 at 4:36.70. It's the type of crew a coach loves seeing return to the fold. Better yet, it was the way the Eagles went about the day.\n\n\"They attacked,\" coach Dale Leonhart said. \"Right from the get-go. They stayed on it the whole time. They showed heart. Liam kind of ran with it (Friday), and then he improved on it again today.\"\n\nThe divers again played their role (coach Amon McCrary was named diving coach of the year), and did it without leader Sage D'Ambrosia, who sat on the side after breaking his leg Wednesday in a training accident and having surgery on Friday. Williams said that served as a bit of inspiration for them all.\n\n\"I think what we did today was probably for Sage, because we know how much diving means to him,\" Williams said. \"We know how much it means to all of us, and we all just wanted to dedicate it to Sage.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with it. I probably could have done a little better, but I don't think I could have done much better.\"\n\nThe team will say good-bye to some strong seniors who made their point. Jake von der Lippe was ecstatic after posting a personal best 1:59.48 to jump two spots and place sixth in the 200 individual medley, then came back and jumped two spots in the 100 breaststroke with a 1:00.54. Tory Hass won the consolation heat of the 500 free, also setting a personal best.\n\nMountain View's Nick Rubba closed strong, winning the consolation heat of the 100 freestyle (49.14) and taking eighth in the 100 back (55.30). He also anchored the 400 free relay that took 16th.\n\nEstes Park's Forrest Beesley, who defended his titles in the 50 and 100 frees to earn swimmer of the year, and Daniel Graber of D'Evelyn (200 IM and 100 breast) were the others to win two titles.\n\nContact Sports Editor Mike Brohard at 970-635-3633 or mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and at twitter.com/RHpreps\n\n4A Boys State Swim Meet\n\nAt EPIC, Fort Collins\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Air Academy 280, Thompson Valley 244, D'Evelyn 204, Discovery Canyon 196, Cheyenne Mountain 193, Estes Park 142, Silver Creek 136, Coronado 135, Broomfield 130, Montrose 127, Mullen 85, Valor Christian 72, Greeley Central 61, Wheat Ridge 61, Glenwood Springs 57, Green Mountain 56, Conifer 45, Mountain View 22, Pueblo East 17, Longmont 16, Moffat County 13, Northridge 9, Pueblo South 9, Pueblo West 9, Pueblo County 3, Thomas Jefferson 2.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1. 1.
