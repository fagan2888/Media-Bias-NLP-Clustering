Keith Bedford for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNew York\u2019s famed \u201ccronut\u201d bakery, shut down by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene due to a \u201cmouse infestation\u201d Friday, reopened its doors Tuesday morning\u2013and undeterred customers waited in long lines for the signature pastry.\n\nSeveral hundred customers, including first-timers and a number of returning fans, descended onto the Dominique Ansel Bakery in SoHo to purchase the cronut, which had been put on hiatus over the weekend by the closure.\n\nThe bakery was closed Friday afternoon by inspectors from the health department, which said in a statement that an infestation was discovered that required pest control services. The store was cleared Monday after a second walk-through by the inspectors.\n\nWith a security guard posted on its doorstep, customers were brought inside the shop in groups as its owner, Dominique Ansel, greeted supporters and thanked them for returning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re back stronger than ever,\u201d Mr. Ansel said during a lap of the line outside the shop, which extended to the corner of Spring Street and Thompson Street.\n\nCustomers were forgiving of the apparent rodent problems, saying such issues were common in big cities.\n\nLester Sykes, 26 years old, from Brooklyn, lined up at 6:50 a.m. and became one of the first to emerge from the shop with one of its acclaimed cronuts \u2013 described as a cross between a doughnut and a croissant.\n\nHe agreed to sample the snack in front of the waiting media, describing it as \u201cchurro-like.\u201d But he said it probably was not worth missing his bus, which left without him minutes earlier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Mr. Sykes said, pointing out that most shops in the area have difficulties with mice. \u201cThe mice didn\u2019t worry me. There\u2019s mice there, and there, and there,\u201d he said, pointing indiscriminately at nearby shops.\n\nJennifer Funk, 27 years old, from Utah, said she was not concerned by the mouse controversy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little sketchy but\u2026 I have a strong stomach.\u201d\n\nOthers came down just to be part of the moment. Jay Randolph, a web video producer, was one of them, arriving at 6 a.m. to be at the front of the line. \u201cI just wanted to see what the scene would be like.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York's famed \"cronut\" bakery, shut down by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene due to a \"mouse infestation\" Friday, reopened its doors Tuesday morning--and undeterred customers waited in long lines for the signature pastry.", "title": "Cronut Shop Reopens to Long Line of Customers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/04/08/cronut-shop-reopens-to-long-line-of-customers/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CG797_nycron_P_20140408095455.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Cronut Shop Reopens to Long Line of Customers", "description": "New York's famed \"cronut\" bakery, shut down by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene due to a \"mouse infestation\" Friday, reopened its doors Tuesday morning--and undeterred customers waited in long lines for the signature pastry.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Yoni Bashan", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "New York's famed \"cronut\" bakery, shut down by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene due to a \"mouse infestation\" Friday, reopened its doors Tuesday morning--and undeterred customers waited in long lines for the signature pastry.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-04-08T15:08:17-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/04/08/cronut-shop-reopens-to-long-line-of-customers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-20270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New York's famed \"cronut\" bakery, shut down by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene due to a \"mouse infestation\" Friday, reopened its doors Tuesday morning--and undeterred customers waited in long lines for the signature pastry.", "title": "Cronut Shop Reopens to Long Line of Customers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/04/08/cronut-shop-reopens-to-long-line-of-customers/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CG797_nycron_P_20140408095455.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-20270", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-08T17:19:35-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a07\"", "article_summary": "Customers line up to wait for Pastry chef Dominique Ansel\u2019s bakery to open in the Manhattan after being shut down by the city.\nSeveral hundred customers, including first-timers and a number of returning fans, descended onto the Dominique Ansel Bakery in SoHo to purchase the cronut, which had been put on hiatus over the weekend by the closure.\nWith a security guard posted on its doorstep, customers were brought inside the shop in groups as its owner, Dominique Ansel, greeted supporters and thanked them for returning.\n\u201cWe\u2019re back stronger than ever,\u201d Mr. Ansel said during a lap of the line outside the shop, which extended to the corner of Spring Street and Thompson Street.\nJay Randolph, a web video producer, was one of them, arriving at 6 a.m. to be at the front of the line."}
