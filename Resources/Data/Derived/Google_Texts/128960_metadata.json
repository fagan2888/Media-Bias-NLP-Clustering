It goes something like this:\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s school going? Have you started to think about college, Mary Pat? Where are you thinking about applying? What are your top schools? What are your backup colleges?\u201d\n\nNow, I get it. The range of topics an adult can discuss with a high school student is limited \u2014 so some of these adults are just trying to make small talk. However, it\u2019s amazing to me how many adults seem to hold their breath as they wait for my answer. It\u2019s as if the outcome of their night depends on my college choice.\n\nI must admit, I\u2019ve gotten my response down to a science. I gracefully weave my way out of the question by saying a lot without actually giving any real information. And after I give my generic yet seemingly detailed answer, I watch as these nosy adults swig their wine as if the weight of the world has been lifted off their shoulders. I always imagine them thinking, \u201cThank God, one less person my precious child will have to beat out for that place at Harvard.\u201d\n\nIn my experience with this type of adult, I learned quickly to avoid giving too much information on the schools I am considering. On too many occasions, I found myself feeling self-\u00adconscious and embarrassed as these adults looked at me with disgust or pity upon hearing my college options. I imagined them thinking \u201cYou don\u2019t have aspirations to go to an Ivy? Where did your parents go wrong?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve come to recognize some flaws in the way people in our society think about college admissions. In my opinion, it truly doesn\u2019t matter where someone goes to college. I think the college craze and the desire to be accepted at a highly selective school represents a simple yearning for a false sense of security.\n\nPerhaps I came to this radical conclusion because of my parents. My parents, first-generation college graduates, paid their way through undergraduate and then graduate school. Their attitude toward the college admission process encouraged me to find a school that (1) I can afford; (2) I actually like, and (3) will give me the tools and the knowledge to help achieve my professional goals. I have been raised to understand that my college choice is a match to be made, not a prize to be won.\n\nNow I\u2019m not denying that schools like Harvard provide students with a fabulous education and an impressive list of connections upon graduation. But even without a $240,000 degree from Harvard, it makes logical sense that the most intelligent, ambitious and richest 2,000 students in the nation would go on to be successful. The drive to make important connections and to earn good grades comes from students\u2019 own ambition \u2014 not from the school they chose at age 17.\n\nIn the last month, I have watched as many of my older friends receive acceptance letters, or in some cases rejections, from their \u201cdream schools.\u201d And through all of the congratulations and consolations that I have offered, I\u2019ve realized this pressure to find the perfect college doesn\u2019t just come from students\u2019 desire to impress the adults in their lives; it comes from students\u2019 desire to impress their peers as well.\n\nTo me, this reason for picking a college appears pretty dumb. Think about it, what happens to students after they are accepted at a highly selective school? They are able to wear a sweatshirt from their highly respected, $60,000-a-year college to school on decision day in May. People will congratulate and applaud them at their graduation party. And that\u2019s it. Everyone will go on and live their life, and they will be forced to live theirs. People should go to a school where they will be happy and where they can thrive academically.\n\nSo as this holiday season comes around, I\u2019m prepared for the typical college interrogation at family gatherings. But as always, I\u2019ll smile, give a long-winded, yet generic answer and remind myself that where I choose to go will be the best choice for me.\n\nMary Patricia Ross is a junior at Benilde-St. Margaret\u2019s School.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adults seem to have an incredible stake in which school I might attend.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Adults seem to have an incredible stake in which school I might attend.", "title": "The college question is coming, and she's ready", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/the-college-question-is-coming-and-she-s-ready/237084551/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138784061199225.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138784061199225.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adults seem to have an incredible stake in which school I might attend.", "title": "The college question is coming, and she's ready", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/the-college-question-is-coming-and-she-s-ready/237084551/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138784061199225.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138784061199225.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "Harvard University"}, "news_keywords": "Benilde-St. Margaret's,Harvard University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6a7\"", "article_summary": "They are able to wear a sweatshirt from their highly respected, $60,000-a-year college to school on decision day in May.\nWhere did your parents go wrong?\u201dI\u2019ve come to recognize some flaws in the way people in our society think about college admissions.\nMy parents, first-generation college graduates, paid their way through undergraduate and then graduate school.\nI gracefully weave my way out of the question by saying a lot without actually giving any real information.\nI think the college craze and the desire to be accepted at a highly selective school represents a simple yearning for a false sense of security."}
