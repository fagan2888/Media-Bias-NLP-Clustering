That's Minnesota's version of Medicaid. The Department of Human Services estimates 82,000 people are on M.A., including Claudia Foussard of St. Paul, \"as of today, it's $20,000 that I owe the state when I die.\"\n\nBut Representative Matt Dean is pushing House Bills 3467, 3615, 3555, 3556 to make big debts like Foussard's disappear.\n\nThat's by limiting the practice to folks in long-term care only like nursing homes, erase claims against estates for the past two years, better notify folks of potential liens when they sign-up and allow recipients to repay any benefits on their behalf, before they die.\n\nThousands of Minnesotans got caught in the quandary that started when the Affordable Care Act was expanded. Nearly twice as many people became qualified for medical assistance, who weren't before and according to Rep. Tina Liebling of Rochester, \"it has made a lot of people a lot better off.\"\n\nHowever for people like Foussard, there's a catch. While there isn't a monthly premium, the coverage isn't free, \"had I been aware of this lien I would never ever in my life sing on against my home.\"\n\nThe Department of Human Services imposes the estate lien after someone dies and families are stuck paying it back, \"you've heard of the Hotel California? This is the Hotel Minnesota, you can check out anytime you want but you can never leave,\" according to Rep. Matt Dean.\n\nThe goal is to modify the policy by the end of this legislative session.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KSTP.com", "description": "Four bills aimed at revoking or reforming the estate claim law involving medical assistance recipients was introduced in the House Tuesday.", "title": "Bills to Put End to Estate Claims Involving Medical Assistance Recipients Introduced in State Capitol", "url": "http://kstp.com/news/bills-end-estate-claims-medical-assistance-state-capitol-department-of-human-services-medicaid/4089189/", "image": "http://kstp.com/kstpImages/repository/2016-03/medical.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 205815426131136}, "description": "Four bills aimed at revoking or reforming the estate claim law involving medical assistance recipients was introduced in the House Tuesday.", "thumbnail": "http://kstp.com/kstpImages/repository/2016-03/medical.jpg", "robots": "FOLLOW,INDEX"}, "article_summary": "This is the Hotel Minnesota, you can check out anytime you want but you can never leave,\" according to Rep.
