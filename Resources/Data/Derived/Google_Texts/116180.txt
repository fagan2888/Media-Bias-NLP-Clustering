It’s December in the year 2100, and you know what that means: Salon’s annual holiday gift guide is back! This list has everything you need for a world ravaged by the unmitigated effects of climate change and environmental degradation; things to keep you disease-free, dry and distracted from a dystopian hell of our own making. Happy holidays!

Kraft-McDonald’s Corp. Signature Flavor Droppers: Sure, we don’t eat natural food anymore (ever since the population ballooned to 11 billion in the Great Birthing of the early ’80s — the 2080s, that is — agriculture isn’t much more than a historic curiosity), but that doesn’t mean your Soylent can’t taste like a bacon cheeseburger! These droppers come in packs of five, available in three different flavor families: Meat, Vegetable and Ethnic. 12 bitcoin.

Google Gas Masque: The latest trend in wearable tech is a must-have this holiday season. (All the better to avoid toxic particulates on your way to the bodega.) Available in a variety of colors including rust and nuclear sludge. 299 bitcoin.

Apple Ambient Noise Machine 103S: When the Euro-Asiatic Union quarantined all remaining non-insect species to the mega-reserves (one in each climate), the absence of the sound of chirping birds and other animal life proved to be unsettling. Apple began developing various ambient sound machines, using citizen-gathered audio files from before the E-A’s mandate. Our favorite playlist is “Temperate Forest,” but “Amazonian* Adventure” is also exciting if you’re in the mood of a lot of monkey screeching. 119 bitcoin.
