North Carolina lost 32,300, Pennsylvania 29,487, and Texas 23,194.\n\nAnother reason for the reduction, Haislmaier continued, is because the administration \u201cpresumes\u201d people are eligible in initial projections and then later discovers a number of people who are not qualified. Immigration status is among the main causes of this.\n\nThe analysis found that more than 400,000 people had their insurance canceled because of immigration and citizenship issues.\n\nHaislmaier said it is \u201cquite likely\u201d that the enrollment numbers will drop by 20 percent at the end of the year, resulting in a similar attrition rate to last year\u2019s 21 percent.\n\nAny projections about enrollment, he said, \u201cprobably need to be discounted\u201d because of the pattern emerging confirming that real enrollment is actually lower than the initial figures accounting for people who have just selected plans but have not yet purchased them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare exchanges took a hit over the course of three months earlier this year as enrollment dropped in 29 states, plus Washington, D.C.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obamacare exchanges took a hit over the course of three months earlier this year as enrollment dropped in 29 states, plus Washington, D.C.", "title": "Obamacare Enrollment Dropped in 29 States", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_ACAEnrollment_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-18T21:38:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1iKrnvI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obamacare exchanges took a hit over the course of three months earlier this year as enrollment dropped in 29 states, plus Washington, D.C.", "title": "Obamacare Enrollment Dropped in 29 States", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_ACAEnrollment_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-09-18T16:12:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T21:38:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, health care, Americans for Tax Reform, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Health and Human Services"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare exchanges took a hit over the course of three months earlier this year as enrollment dropped in 29 states, plus Washington, D.C., resulting in a net loss of 238,119 enrollees, according to a report released Monday.\nThe figure marks a 14-percent drop-off from the administration\u2019s initial projection that about 11.7 million people had selected a plan at the end of this year\u2019s enrollment season.\nAnother reason for the reduction, Haislmaier continued, is because the administration \u201cpresumes\u201d people are eligible in initial projections and then later discovers a number of people who are not qualified.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the difference between putting something in your shopping cart when you\u2019re on Amazon versus actually buying it,\u201d he said.\nHaislmaier said it is \u201cquite likely\u201d that the enrollment numbers will drop by 20 percent at the end of the year, resulting in a similar attrition rate to last year\u2019s 21 percent."}
