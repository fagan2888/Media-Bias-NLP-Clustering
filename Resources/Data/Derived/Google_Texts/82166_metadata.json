Fiorina joked she was \u201c17th of 16 candidates\u201d in polls.\n\n\u201cHere I am 10 days away from the caucuses tied with governors who\u2019ve been in politics all of their lives and spent tens of millions of dollars on the air and we haven\u2019t spent a dime yet and we\u2019ve built a great ground game here in Iowa,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGuess what folks, we can win this. I can go all the way,\u201d Fiorina said, asking the Iowans to \u201csend me out of here with the wind at my back.\u201d\n\nFrank and Pat Conrad of Marion were impressed by the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, but aren\u2019t sure they share Fiorina\u2019s optimism.\n\n\u201cBy a country mile, she\u2019s the sharpest knife in the drawer,\u201d Frank Conrad said. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t win the nomination it\u2019s a real loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople vote the way the buy cars,\u201d Pat Conrad said. \u201cThey like the color but they don\u2019t look under the hood. They don\u2019t mind the status quo.\u201d\n\nJoyce MacDougall of Cedar Rapids agreed Fiorina certainly is the most articulate and well-prepared candidate, but she Fiorina has the name recognition necessary to win the nomination.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem, Fiorina said. Americans don\u2019t think of the United States as a nation of unlimited possibilities.\n\n\u201cWhen we stop realizing that we have possibilities, then we\u2019re losing the core of who we are,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead, the professional political class tells Americans to settle, to \u201csit down and be quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being told to be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry \u2026 to settle for a nation where record numbers of men are out of work, record numbers of women are living in poverty, that young people don\u2019t even know the American dream applies to them anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nFor about an hour, Fiorina spoke to about 125 people and answered questions ranging from immigration to defunding Planned Parenthood to the United Nations\u2019 role in determining American foreign policy and repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe peppered her remarks with zingers, most aimed at Democrat Hillary Clinton and GOP rival Donald Trump.\n\nClinton, she said, \u201chas escaped prosecution more times than El Chappo,\u201d and referred to Trump as the \u201cKim Kardashian of politics \u2014 famous for being famous.\u201d\n\nFiorina will return to the area Jan. 26 for a 12:30 p.m. town-hall meeting at the University Club in Iowa City and another at noon Jan. 29 at Lowe Park Community Center in Marion.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | MOUNT VERNON - Coming down the homestretch of the Iowa caucus campaign, Carly Fiorina took time to reflect on how far she has come since entering the race for t", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "MOUNT VERNON - Coming down the homestretch of the Iowa caucus campaign, Carly Fiorina took time to reflect on how far she has come since entering the race for the Republican presidential nomination eight months ago.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/republican-presidential/fiorina-tells-iowans-not-to-settle-not-to-be-quiet-20160120", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160120/ARTICLE/160129965/EP/1/7/EP-160129965.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/republican-presidential/fiorina-tells-iowans-not-to-settle-not-to-be-quiet-20160120", "title": "Fiorina tells Iowans not to settle, not to be quiet", "description": "MOUNT VERNON - Coming down the homestretch of the Iowa caucus campaign, Carly Fiorina took time to reflect on how far she has come since entering the race for the Republican presidential nomination eight months ago.", "site": "@gazettedotcom"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"title": "Fiorina tells Iowans not to settle, not to be quiet", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2016-01-20T18:45:30-05:00", "modDate": "2016-01-20T18:45:00-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNobody had heard of me,\u201d she said at a town-hall meeting at Cornell College in Mount Vernon Wednesday.\nThey don\u2019t mind the status quo.\u201dJoyce MacDougall of Cedar Rapids agreed Fiorina certainly is the most articulate and well-prepared candidate, but she Fiorina has the name recognition necessary to win the nomination.\n\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t win the nomination it\u2019s a real loss.\u201d\u201cPeople vote the way the buy cars,\u201d Pat Conrad said.\nI can go all the way,\u201d Fiorina said, asking the Iowans to \u201csend me out of here with the wind at my back.\u201dFrank and Pat Conrad of Marion were impressed by the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, but aren\u2019t sure they share Fiorina\u2019s optimism.\nFiorina joked she was \u201c17th of 16 candidates\u201d in polls."}
