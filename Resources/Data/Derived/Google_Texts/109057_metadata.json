For example, a medic from a Green Beret team is not allowed to gather intelligence but can get information from a village chief about an area that might not be safe to go to, he said.\n\nSuch side benefits of providing assistance, he said, are not lost on the Chinese, who have launched their own hospital ship, called the \u201cPeace Ark.\u201d The ship not only provides medical care but also gives the Chinese access to waters in which its warships might be challenged. Two years ago, the Peace Ark visited Cuba.\n\n\u201cIf you are packing up a hospital ship and moving 6,000 or 8,000 miles, you are mobilizing an expeditionary capability of a field hospital without going to war,\u201d Anderson said during a session break. \u201cThat\u2019s a great training exercise.\u201d\n\nAnderson recently returned from Saudi Arabia, where he attended an International Committee on Military Medicine conference. An increased Chinese presence there, along with the Peace Ark trip to Cuba, \u201clooks to me like worldwide engagement,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the military, the intersection of security and stability, of which health care plays a major role, has a long history, said Craig Llewellyn, a retired Special Forces colonel who became founding director of the Center for Disaster and Humanitarian Assistance Medicine. Green Berets, he said, helped villagers in Vietnam and Laos with their health and medical issues.\n\nNavy Capt. David A. Tarantino Jr. said the health and relief efforts are \u201ctrue\u201d Pentagon missions. They are \u201ca real and current mission \u2013 governed by a number of existing and forthcoming policies,\u201d Tarantino said. He said miltary leaders incorporate medical stability operations into many levels of planning.\n\nAnderson noted there is an inherent tension in such endeavors for medical professionals.\n\nWhile they are supposed to remain neutral and humanitarian as medical professionals, military requirements often conflict.\n\nMilitary medical professionals \u201chave to be very, very careful about these things,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do intentional harm and now we are finding that we have to guard against doing unintentional harm. Health care is a way to get people\u2019s attention, to present ourselves in a positive light. We have to do positive things and be careful of unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nhaltman@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7629\n\n@haltman", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 15 Dec 2013 19:49:20 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 From large-scale aid missions like the response to Typhoon Haiyan to an isolated team of Green Berets helping others, providing disaster relief and medical assistance has benefits for", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 From large-scale aid missions like the response to Typhoon Haiyan to an isolated team of Green Berets helping others, providing disaster relief and medical assistance has benefits for", "title": "Humanitarian aid has strategic benefits, too, military leaders say", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/humanitarian-aid-has-strategic-benefits-too-military-leaders-say-20131215/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2013-12-15T19:49:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Humanitarian aid has strategic benefits, too, military leaders say"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-15T19:49:20Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T19:49:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3dfb\"", "article_summary": "Military medical professionals \u201chave to be very, very careful about these things,\u201d Anderson said.\nDavid A.
