According to a study in the British Medical Journal, births in the Catalan region of Spain, where Barcelona fans reside, shot up by 16 percent nine months after this sporting achievement. The detetction of this trend isn't exactly news to locals in the region, where an informal survey of five hospitals at the time led many to believe that the increase in the number of births actually reached 45 percent. This local boom was called \u201cthe Iniesta generation,\u201d which is based on a Barcelona player, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, who scored a last-minute goal against an English team, Chelsea, resulting in the team reaching \u2014 and winning \u2014 the final of one of soccer's biggest tournaments in 2009.\n\nIn an effort to officially confirm the extent of this jump in the number of births, health and statistical researchers took a close look at local birth data from 2007 to 2011. They found a 16 percent increase in births in February 2010 as well as an 11 percent increase the following month compared with the other years surrounding that time. \u201c[O]ur results may have several different interpretations,\u201d the authors write. \u201cOne is that human emotions on a large scale can profoundly affect demographic swings in populations, that national or regional events can reduce the weight of reason and increase the weight of passion.\u201d\n\nJesus Montesinos, of Xarxa Assistencial Universit\u00e0ria de Manresa, in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues added that despite being observational, the findings still provide \u201ca better understanding of human behavior, improve health care planning, and even aid government policy makers in stimulating or reducing birth rates.\u201d With toungue-in-cheek, the authors suggested that in order to \"bridge the gap between observational and trial data, it would help greatly if Iniesta were willing to replicate his intervention, although the cost of such a study could be prohibitive, not to mention harmful, to the reference group (Chelsea),\" the study authors conclude.\n\nIn 2003, The Telegraph reported that England and Wales experienced a \u201cslight rise\u201d in birth rate (0.25 percent) due to England\u2019s success in reaching the World Cup\u2019s quarterfinal the year before. This was comparable to England\u2019s timely increase in birth rate after winning the World Cup in 1966 as well as reaching the quarterfinals in 1970 in the same competition. But studies have also looked into the dark side of sports' emotional charge. An American study in 2011 found a 10 percent increase in the rate of at-home violence by men against their wives and girlfriends when the abuser\u2019s team in the National Football League suffered an unexpected loss.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sports, soccer, birth rate, fc barcelona, champions league, fans, number of births, football", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers confirmed a higher birth rate occurred in a region of Spain after their local soccer club won numerous championships in 2009.", "title": "Birth Rate Increased After Spanish Soccer Club's Triumph", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/birth-rate-increased-after-spanish-soccer-clubs-triumph-regional-events-can-affect-weight-passion", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/17/flickr-photo-fc-barcelona-ad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers confirmed a higher birth rate occurred in a region of Spain after their local soccer club won numerous championships in 2009.", "title": "Birth Rate Increased After Spanish Soccer Club's Triumph", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/birth-rate-increased-after-spanish-soccer-clubs-triumph-regional-events-can-affect-weight-passion", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/17/flickr-photo-fc-barcelona-ad.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/17/flickr-photo-fc-barcelona-ad.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-17T18:37:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-17T18:37:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers confirmed a higher birth rate occurred in a region of Spain after their local soccer club won numerous championships in 2009."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0457\"", "article_summary": "This was comparable to England\u2019s timely increase in birth rate after winning the World Cup in 1966 as well as reaching the quarterfinals in 1970 in the same competition.\nIn 2003, The Telegraph reported that England and Wales experienced a \u201cslight rise\u201d in birth rate (0.25 percent) due to England\u2019s success in reaching the World Cup\u2019s quarterfinal the year before.\nIn May 2009, FC Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United, earning its third major soccer (or \u201cfootball\u201d for the non-American) trophy of the year.\nThey found a 16 percent increase in births in February 2010 as well as an 11 percent increase the following month compared with the other years surrounding that time.\nBut studies have also looked into the dark side of sports' emotional charge."}
