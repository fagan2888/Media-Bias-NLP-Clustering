Tom Brady's daughter was watching him play football Sunday. (via @GiseleOfficial)

Tom Brady played some good football on Sunday, beating the Lions 34-9 -- which is a really spooky number! -- in the Patriots latest easy victory.

Maybe Brady, like Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton, was inspired by fatherhood? Surely before he left for the stadium he saw his daughter dressed up in a Brady jersey getting set for a day of football.

If not, he probably saw the picture after the game, since Gisele posted it on social media during the game.

Just an adorable scene. Tough life for that Brady fella.
