The one thing that mothers have done since the beginning of time is they have civilized this world. They have made sure that young people grow up to be contributing adults. And that has been the role of women no matter what.\u201d\n\nHarp talked about a candidate who is committed to good jobs, particularly for young people, and a candidate who ignited the national discussion on health care that culminated in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was in the [state] General Assembly and we started, under the Clinton administration, through her initiatives, to add young people into the Medicaid program and make sure that our youngsters had access to health care,\u201d Harp said.\n\nHarp said Clinton is the only candidate who will take on the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers to hold them accountable when it comes to gun violence.\n\n\u201cOne of the most disturbing things I have to do as mayor and have done is to go to the funerals of young people whose lives have been cut short by gun violence,\u201d Harp said. \u201cShe [Clinton] understands that the gun violence that plagues our inner cities, as well as our suburbs now, is intolerable. No mother should have to worry that when her child goes out to play, that that child may be hit by an intended bullet or a stray bullet.\n\n\u201cHillary understands what it means to have a strong community; what it means to have confidence that for our children, for our grandchildren, that the United States of America will still be ... the only place, where anyone can come from any other place and make a life for themselves and their children. That\u2019s why I am endorsing Hillary today. That\u2019s why I support her. I know that we will still rise as a nation when she is our president.\u201d\n\nValencia Goodrich of Westville said it\u2019s time for a woman president, but not because she\u2019s a woman, but because she is more qualified than any other candidate running, including Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s ready,\u201d Goodrich said. \u201cShe\u2019s more than qualified. If you look at the pool of candidates that are out there, including Bernie and the Republicans, she is the most competent, in my mind, in terms of ready.\u201d\n\nGoodrich said having a woman head of state would be great for women, particularly young women and girls who aspire to occupations where women are few or nonexistent, but that\u2019s not why people should vote for Clinton and that\u2019s not why women are going to vote for her.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just giving her that role because of her gender,\u201d Goodrich said. \u201cShe in my mind is very, very competent, and she is ready on day one to step into the shoes of the outgoing president.\u201d\n\nFormer Downtown Alder Esther Armand said she doesn\u2019t discount the historic significance and the future benefits, particularly for girls and women, of having a woman in the oval office.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about the ability of women to endure in their toughness, in their ability to deal with issues, no matter if it is a family issue, kid issue, husband issue, community issue, political issue, policy issue,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you\u2019ve got a mom excited, and a woman excited, there\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t do, they\u2019re unstoppable.\u201d\n\nArmand, who also is a part of a Connecticut-based political action committee called the Sojourner Network of Democratic Women, spoke of what women leaders like New Haven\u2019s mayor have accomplished not just for women but their entire communities when they get involved in the political process. Now, Armand said, it\u2019s time to elect a woman president.\n\n\u201cWomen in this country vote and participate in the political process,\u201d Armand said \u201cThere should not be an office or area off limits for our full involvement and participation. For me, it\u2019s like women claiming their rightful role in society, and by us and young girls and women seeing a woman president in our life time, it make a tremendous difference. It\u2019s inspiring.\u201d\n\nNew Havener Lisa Bassani, a mother of two girls ages 2 and 6, said that Clinton has been a leader on issues that matter to women and the welfare of their children. She said she\u2019ll support whichever candidate emerges as the Democratic nominee in November.\n\n\u201cFor the primary, it\u2019s Hillary certainly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a Democrat. Obviously, I\u2019ll be disappointed if she loses, but I think Democrats need to stick together, no matter what.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Paul Bass, New Haven, Connecticut, New Haven Connecticut, CT, New Haven news, news about New Haven, Toni Harp", "og": {"site_name": "New Haven Independent", "description": "Their ranks small but diverse, but \u201cConnecticut Moms 4 Hillary\u201d braved the cold Saturday morning to raise a mighty and united voice for the candidate they want to see make...", "title": "Moms Rally For Clinton  |  New Haven Independent", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/upload/2016/04/Markeshia/Hillary1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/moms_rally_for_clinton/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index,nofollow,archive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-10T00:07:18-0400", "modified_time": "2016-04-10T01:09:19-0400"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt is Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cShe [Clinton] understands that the gun violence that plagues our inner cities, as well as our suburbs now, is intolerable.\nHarp said Clinton is the only candidate who will take on the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers to hold them accountable when it comes to gun violence.\nThe one thing that mothers have done since the beginning of time is they have civilized this world.\nIt\u2019s inspiring.\u201dNew Havener Lisa Bassani, a mother of two girls ages 2 and 6, said that Clinton has been a leader on issues that matter to women and the welfare of their children."}
