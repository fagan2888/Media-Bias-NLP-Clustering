Rob Bishop, R-Utah, began stitching together support in rural Utah between disparate user groups.\n\nThe congressman began his news conference on his public lands initiative by poking at critics who\u2019ve maligned the seven-county management plan in advertisements. But then he promised to transform an outline that he said Utahns crafted in more than a thousand meetings into federal legislation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in this for everyone to like, and there\u2019s something in this for everyone to hate,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cAnd if you really want to hate things, talk to us. We\u2019ll show it to you. It\u2019s in there. We\u2019ve gone through this ourselves. But I think if you look at the totality of what we\u2019re doing, it is so positive. It is moving us so far forward.\u201d\n\nThe proposal expands Arches National Park, conserves 4.3 million acres and creates a 90-mile ATV trail. It sets aside permanent energy development areas and swaps state acreage for prime federal land to maximize school trust revenues.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, will cosponsor the bill that\u2019s ultimately drafted, and Utah Senator Mike Lee will carry legislation in the Senate.\n\nGov. Gary Herbert (R) praised the proposal for seeking an end to the lands controversy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a bigger, better good-faith effort than by our congressmen and our senator in trying to find resolution of this,\u201d he said at the news conference.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups say Bishop\u2019s initiative undermines clean air and wildland protections, while allowing state road claims across thousands of miles of wilderness.\n\n\u201cIt, I think, could be better described as a fossil-fuel development bill that actually takes us back a step in wilderness management in the state,\u201d said David Garbett, an attorney with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. \u201cAnd it furthers the state\u2019s land-grab efforts.\u201d\n\nProponents want to solidify support and get the bill before Congress in time to block the Obama administration from creating the Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah. A national coalition of Native Americans has lobbied for it, but Bishop says local tribal members support his proposal.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Energy & Environment", "description": "A comprehensive land-use proposal for eastern Utah made its public debut Wednesday -- three years after Rep.
