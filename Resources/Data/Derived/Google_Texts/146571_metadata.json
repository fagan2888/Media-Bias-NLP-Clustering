The Medicare Shared Savings Program currently includes over 430 ACOs serving more than 7 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nCMS's proposal also aims to strengthen overall ACO framework. CMS confirms that ACOs continue to deliver economical, high quality care to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS says the proposal improves long-term ACO incentives.\n\nCMS plans to make some changes and essentially rearrange the benchmarks that determine how well ACOs perform.\n\n\"Medicare payments are an important catalyst to improving care delivery, spending our resources smarter and keeping people healthy,\" said Andy Slavitt, Acting Administrator for CMS.\n\n\"This proposal allows ACOs in all parts of the country to be successful by recognizing both their achievements and improvements in how they provide care.\"\n\n\"This should have the effect of growing the number of ACOs, and making ACOs and the coordinated care they provide to patients, more of a standard in all parts of the country.\"\n\nWeaknesses in quality metrics demand change\n\nMost Medicare Pioneer ACOs that ended up leaving the program went into the Medicare Shared Savings Program or signed up for the Next Generation ACO program, stated Johnathan Niloff, MD, McKesson\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, to RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\nThere are many gaps when it comes to quality metrics, he said. Healthcare organizations are struggling to manage conflicting ACO incentives. A reasonable benchmark methodology, he added, leads to net-risk program success.\n\n\u201cYou need a good quality program, specifically to manage your quality metrics and close your gaps in care. Virtually all of the value-based programs have a component of achieving quality metrics as a part of them,\" Niloff asserted.\n\n\u201cA number of them include achieving certain quality metrics. Managing quality and the appropriate systems and programs in place to meet your quality metrics are always a high priority.\u201d\n\nCMS aims to reset benchmarks\n\nCMS says under the proposed rule, a series of changes will be made to how benchmarks are reset. These benchmarks are used to assess levels of ACO performance for those ACOs renewing their participation agreements.\n\n\u201cThe proposed methodology would incorporate factors based on regional fee-for-service expenditures, into establishing and updating the ACO\u2019s rebased historical benchmark, including an adjustment to the benchmark based on regional spending that is phased-in over several agreement periods,\u201d CMS writes.\n\nCMS says there is 60-day comment period available until March 18, 2016.\n\nCMS presents its 4 key proposals:\n\n\u00b7 Recognizing that health cost trends vary in communities across the country by using regional, rather than national, spending growth trends when establishing and updating an ACO\u2019s rebased benchmark. \u00b7 Adjusting an ACO\u2019s rebased benchmark when it enters a second or subsequent agreement period by a percentage (increased over time) of the difference between fee-for-service. \u00b7 Spending in the ACO\u2019s regional service area and the ACO\u2019s historical spending, which will provide a greater incentive for continued ACO participation and improvement. \u00b7 Giving ACOs time to prepare for benchmarks that incorporate regional expenditures by using a phased-in approach to implementation.\n\nCMS also proposes a series of additional changes. One is to implement a \u201cparticipation option\u201d to help ease an ACO\u2019s transition from the traditional, fee-for-service realm to a performance-based risk arrangement.\n\nCMS says eligible ACOs under the proposed rule will be able to elect a fourth year under their current initial agreement. They will also hopefully have the option to defer the agreement by one year and enter a second agreement period under the umbrella of a performance-based risk track.\n\nCMS presents another change regarding methodology streamlining when an ACO\u2019s composition changes. CMS additionally says it will make a future effort to more clearly explain the ACO shared savings timeline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CMS has released a proposed rule to improve performance incentives for accountable care organizations under the Medicare Shared Savings Program.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-proposes-changes-to-aco-medicare-shared-savings-program", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2016-01-14-CMS-green.png", "type": "article", "title": "CMS Proposes Changes to ACO Medicare Shared Savings Program"}, "twitter": {"description": "CMS has released a proposed rule to improve performance incentives for accountable care organizations under the Medicare Shared Savings Program.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2016-01-14-CMS-green.png"}, "title": "CMS Proposes Changes to ACO Medicare Shared Savings Program", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Medicare Shared Savings Program currently includes over 430 ACOs serving more than 7 million Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has released a proposed rule to improve performance incentives for accountable care organizations (ACOs) under the Medicare Shared Savings Program.\nThis proposal builds upon the growth of the Shared Savings Program, says CMS within a press release.\nCMS additionally says it will make a future effort to more clearly explain the ACO shared savings timeline.\nWeaknesses in quality metrics demand changeMost Medicare Pioneer ACOs that ended up leaving the program went into the Medicare Shared Savings Program or signed up for the Next Generation ACO program, stated Johnathan Niloff, MD, McKesson\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, to RevCycleIntelligence.com."}
