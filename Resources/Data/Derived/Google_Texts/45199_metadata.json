He began his coaching career as a defensive coordinator at Douglas County from 1978-83. He also was defensive coordinator at Ponderosa from 1983-92.\n\nIn 1993, he began a head-coaching run that kep the Mustangs relevant for years. Into the 2005 season, Ponderosa enjoyed three 10-0 regular seasons, was named league coach of the year eight times and won the Class 5A state title in 2003, when he also was coach of the year by The Denver Post.\n\nOut of coaching from 2006-08, Woodruff returned to Ponderosa as its defensive coordinator, then served as its head coach for two more years.\n\nThe award, named after the late Ben Gregory who had terrific teams at Montbello before moving on to the University of Colorado as an assistant, is presented to a retired coach who was a great facilitator of sportsmanship toward opponents, as well as officials.\n\nHere are past recipients of the award as provided by the organization\u2019s Ted Swan:\n\n1998 \u2014 Ben Gregory family (Montbello)\n\n1999 \u2014 Herman Motz (Thomas Jefferson )\n\n2000 \u2014 Dick Yates (South, John F.
