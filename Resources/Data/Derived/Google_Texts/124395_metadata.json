The law passed in 2012 by a margin of 55 to 43 percent.\n\n>>> Why You Should Be Alarms About Marijuana Legalization, According to Former Obama Drug Adviser\n\nWhen asked by POLITICO\u2019s debate moderator Manu Raju whether Coloradans were \u201creckless\u201d to vote Amendment 64 into law, Hickenlooper said yes, citing concerns about the unknown effects of marijuana legalization.\n\nI think for us to do that without having all the data, there is not enough data, and to a certain extent you could say it was reckless. I\u2019m not saying it was reckless because I\u2019ll get quoted everywhere, but if it was up to me, I wouldn\u2019t have done it, right? I opposed it from the very beginning.\n\nDrawing laughs from the audience, Hickenlooper added: \u201cIn matter of fact, all right, what the hell \u2014 I\u2019ll say it was reckless.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s Republican opponent, Bob Beauprez, agreed with his stance against the substance, although both candidates acknowledged their duty to enforce the voter\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWhen you take an oath to enforce the laws of the state of Colorado, you have to recognize this is one of them, too,\u201d said Beauprez.\n\n>>> Traffic Fatalities of Marijuana-Positive Drivers On Rise In Colorado\n\nMason Tvert, a key backer of marijuana legalization in Colorado, called Hickenlooper\u2019s comment \u201cpolitically reckless\u201d in a statement to The Huffington Post:\n\n\u201cGov. Hickenlooper was elected by 51 percent of the state\u2019s voters, whereas 55 percent approved the marijuana initiative in 2012. Some of them might now be thinking they made a pretty reckless decision when they voted him into office.\u201d\n\nIndependent candidate Mike Dunafon is running on a pro-legalization platform in the Rocky Mountain State, but polls show him trailing the two frontrunners with a mere 2 percent.\n\nHickenlooper and Beauprez remain neck-and-neck, with the Republican holding onto a slight lead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic Gov.
