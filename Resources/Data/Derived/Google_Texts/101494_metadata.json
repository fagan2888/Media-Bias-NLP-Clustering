REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (UNITED STATES - Tags: SOCIETY) - RTX153GE\n\n4112597\n\nProgressive billionaire George Soros and the Obama administration help fund the Chicago nonprofit that set up Obamacare enrollment programs for prison inmates.\n\nChicago-based Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC) helped establish Obamacare enrollment programs for prisoners at Chicago\u2019s Cook County Jail. Cook County is one of at least six states and counties enrolling prisoners to help shift inmate medical costs to federal taxpayers.\n\n\u201cA lot of states will come to this, because state corrections budgets are huge and county jail budgets are huge,\u201d said TASC spokesperson Maureen McDonnell.\n\nTASC, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, is funded by Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), records reveal.\n\nSoros\u2019 foundation and HHS\u2019 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration are part of a small group of TASC donors that includes Cook County, the city of Chicago, and the state of Illinois\u2019 Department of Corrections, Department of Human Services, and Department of Children and Family Services.\n\nOpen Society Foundations provided TASC a $49,417 grant to TASC in 2012 \u201cto conduct an inventory and analysis of community-based alternative approaches to punitive drug policies and law enforcement at the \u201cfront-end\u201d of the criminal adjudication process.\u201d\n\nTASC representatives joined officials from the Obama administration\u2019s HHS and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Open Society Foundation\u2019s Closing the Addiction Treatment Gap grantees gathering in Washington, D.C. in February 2011.\n\nFormer TASC director of research and policy Lisa Feldman Braude, who now works as an Obamacare implementation consultant, managed an Open Society Foundation inventory of clinical sentencing diversion programs in 2012.\n\nTASC led the research for a 2011 Illinois state commission that found that blacks are more likely to be sentenced to prison for drug offenses than whites.\n\n\u201cTASC does not provide treatment, but instead we are independent advocates who place clients into community-based treatment programs and other services that will help them succeed,\u201d read a statement on the group\u2019s website.\n\nThe Illinois Corrections Department is also trying to get Medicaid coverage for prisoners hospitalized for at least 24 hours (which would create more incentive for prison hospitals to keep inmates in the infirmary longer, increasing costs) and for all prisoners who are close to release.\n\nTASC did not return a request for comment for this report.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Counties trying to shift prisoner care costs to federal taxpayers", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Progressive billionaire George Soros and the Obama administration help fund the Chicago nonprofit that set up Obamacare enrollment programs for prison inmates.
