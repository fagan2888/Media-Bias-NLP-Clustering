LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Not everyone is praising a new federal guideline that will soon require many restaurants nationwide to post calorie counts on wine lists.

The menu labeling rule by the FDA is part of the Affordable Care Act aimed at making people more aware of the calories they are not only eating, but drinking.

“I think that it could actually be like a buzz-kill,” said one patron, while another said: “It can suck the fun out of it a little bit but it’s about being healthy and that’s what’s important.”

The regulations will apply to all chain restaurants and bars with at least 20 locations.

“If people are looking for calorie count and they want to know what they are consuming, then it should be something they should know about,” said Don Adams, the owner of the Eclectic Fine Food & Spirits in North Hollywood.

Though the regulations won’t apply to Eclectic, Adams says the impact on the restaurant industry will be minor since typically customers who order drinks know they’re indulging.

The rule goes into effect Dec. 1 and won’t apply to drinks ordered at the bar nor those not listed on the main menu.
