Hinderaker), \u201cHillary to run against\u2026Obama?\u201d (re: Obama\u2019s economy, S. Hayward), \u201cWhite House struggles to explain weak economy as Obama boasts of job growth\u201d (Dave Boyer), \u201cAs GDP Flatlines, Obama Brags About His Economic Record\u201d (Investors.com), and \u201cSimply the worst\u2014Obama is first president ever to not see single year of 3% GDP growth\u201d (Jim Hoft).\n\nHoft: \u201cThe rate of real economic growth is the single greatest determinate of both America\u2019s strength as a nation and the well-being of the American people. On Thursday, the Commerce Department announced that the US economy expanded at the slowest pace in two years. GDP growth rose at an anemic 0.5% rate after a paltry 1.4% fourth quarter advance.\n\n\u201cRonald Reagan brought forth an annual real GDP growth of 3.5%. Barack Obama will be lucky to average a 1.55% GDP growth rate. Barack Obama will be the only U.S. president in history who did not deliver a single year of 3.0%+ economic growth.\n\n\u201cAccording to Louis Woodhill, \u2018Assuming 2.67% RGDP growth for 2016, Obama will leave office having produced an average of 1.55% growth. This would place his presidency fourth from the bottom of the list\u2026above only Herbert Hoover (-5.65%), Andrew Johnson (-0.70%) and Theodore Roosevelt (1.41%).\u2019\u201d\n\nAccompanying two of the articles is a chart by The Center for Economic and Policy Research: \u201cIndex of Real GDP Since Start of the Recession for the Last Four Recessions.\u201d The Reagan economy, 8 years after the 1981 recession, was over 35% larger, meaning more jobs, higher wages, greater tax revenue, etc.\n\nThe Clinton economy was almost 30% larger after 8 years; but Clinton did nothing to grow the economy beyond accepting Republican mandates that no taxes be raised and spending be constrained. The George Bush economy grew similar to the Clinton economy for almost 7 years following the 2001 dot-com crash and terrorist attacks, becoming about 20% larger.\n\nCEPR comments: \u201cThe weak growth for the quarter puts this recovery even further behind any prior recovery at the same stage. After eight and a quarter years, the economy is only 10.1% larger than its pre-recession level of output. A typical recovery would have seen at least twice as much growth.\u201d\n\nSanders, Trump (or any Republican candidate) can run against said weak economic performance, while Hillary tries to skate past providing corrective policies\u2014she has no new ideas. Sanders\u2019 prescription is essentially to double down on the same type of centralized control and micromanagement that produced our current \u201cmalaise.\u201d F.D. Roosevelt\u2019s similar policies extended the Great Depression from a bad recession into an additional 7 years of misery, a pathetic record rescued only by WWII (per UCLA economist Lee Ohanian).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn general, Obama and most Democrats are treating bad economic numbers, as well as expectations by some that another recession approaches, as illustrated by Michael Ramirez. He drew a cartoon that showed Obama standing high on the stern of a sinking Titanic-like ship labeled \u201cU.S. Economy,\u201d proclaiming, \u201cSee, it\u2019s never been higher.\u201d\n\nHinderaker offers some reflections on what actually occurred and what, if any, credit Obama can claim: \u201cDemocrats love to cherry pick statistics to make the case that Barack Obama\u2019s stewardship of our economy has been successful. Obama himself often claims to have saved the world economy from disaster, but how? If anything averted collapse, it was the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was executed by the Bush administration, for better or worse. If any government measure saved the economy, it was TARP.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018stimulus\u2019 bill that didn\u2019t stimulate anything was enacted in Obama\u2019s first year (DP: remember the recession officially ended in June of 2009, before any Obama/Democrat policies went into effect); that had only a fraction of the predicted impact and no one claims it somehow rescued the world economy. Nor did Dodd-Frank, which was passed in 2010, after the financial crisis had passed. Dodd-Frank\u2019s principal effects were to devastate community banks and starve small businesses of capital.\u201d\n\nD. Boyer wrote, \u201cWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that congressional Republicans were in part to blame for the weak growth, saying the economy would be stronger if Congress had agreed to Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals for higher spending on infrastructure projects three or four years ago\u2014their \u2018stubborn refusal to consider any of President Obama\u2019s priorities.\u2019\u201d Irony abounds over such arguments after Democrats got their stimulus wish list, together with trillions of dollars of deficit spending; Obama admitted, \u201cthere are no shovel-ready projects.\u201d\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily observed that, \u201cwhile Obama claimed to have saved \u2018the banks\u2019 and \u2018the auto industry,\u2019 he didn\u2019t save either industry. Obama\u2019s only contribution to GM and Chrysler\u2019s bankruptcy process was to protect union interests at taxpayer\u2019s expense. Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t save banks\u2026His stimulus was a massively expensive bust\u2026Obama talks about 14.4 million new jobs since 2010, without noting that working age population grew by 15.8 million over those same months. He touts the 5% unemployment rate, but fails to mention that it would be more like 10% if millions of Americans hadn\u2019t given up looking for work altogether.\u201d\n\nFrom the waste of government green energy subsidies, to Obamacare, to deficits, taxes and regulations\u2014100% Obama\u2019s responsibilities\u2014this weak economy is Obama\u2019s alone to bear.\n\nDon Polson has called Red Bluff home since 1988.
