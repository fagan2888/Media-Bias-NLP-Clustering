Every year, the Hiland Park Baptist Vacation Bible School launches a campaign to raise money to help needy children through the "backpack for kids" program.

Organizers encourage the kids to donate pennies to the cause by doing chores or helping around the house, or even searching in the sofa for change.

This year more than 560 children attended the five-day bible school.

A competition between the boys and girls is expected to exceed their $4,000 goal.

As a result one of the youth ministers will get a pie in the face on Sunday at the family fellowship gathering.

"I earned it and I had pennies in my wallet and I tried to look for some and I asked my mom and step dad if they had any and they did and so I got some of their pennies and I used it," said Hannah Fleming.

" So this year as of yesterday they had raised forty seven hundred dollars and I believe as of today we've probably got over eight thousand dollars, which means that forty children will get food all school year long this next year," said Tammy Kirkland, Director of Children's Ministries.

Friday was the last day for VBS at Hiland Park, but several churches will have theirs later in the summer.
