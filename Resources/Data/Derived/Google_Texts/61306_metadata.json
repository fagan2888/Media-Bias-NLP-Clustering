We don\u2019t want people to be cancelling appointments left and right,\u2019 \u201d said Michael Bell, director of laboratory safety at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRelated: 11 Ways to Fight Ebola and Other Diseases\n\nThe reticence, although perhaps not surprising, complicates government efforts to ensure that the country can effectively treat people with Ebola and contain possible outbreaks. Just a few facilities in the United States have special biocontainment units, which are ideal for treating Ebola, and they can handle only two or three patients at a time. And the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who was initially misdiagnosed at a Dallas hospital and died, shows how easily a community hospital can stumble.\n\nOf the 5,000 hospitals in the United States, dozens have volunteered to treat Ebola patients. As of mid-November, CDC infection-control experts had visited 41 facilities in 12 states and the District of Columbia, according to agency Director Thomas Frieden.\n\nBut it is not clear how many medical centers will pass muster and whether the number will be enough for the administration to meet its goal of establishing an adequate network of Ebola-ready facilities. Bell said the government would initially like to have \u201ca couple dozen\u201d facilities in the network.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s $6 billion emergency funding request for Ebola, which includes $154 million for hospital preparedness and support, envisions at least one designated facility in every state, and additional ones in New York City; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Los Angeles; and Puerto Rico. The White House wants Congress to approve the request by Dec. 11, when current government funding runs out.\n\nRelated: The Virus That's More Likely to Kill You Than Ebola\n\nIn trying to set up the network, federal officials, working with state health departments and local hospitals, are taking a three-step approach. The first priority is to find hospitals near five international airports \u2014 John F. Kennedy in New York; Newark Liberty; Washington Dulles; O\u2019Hare in Chicago and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta \u2014 that travelers from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali are required to use when arriving in the U.S.\n\nAmong the hospitals designated in that category are Johns Hopkins, Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and Bellevue in Manhattan.\n\nThe next priority would be to designate hospitals in communities that are home to large numbers of West African immigrants. The last group would be hospitals in states that do not have other Ebola-capable facilities.\n\nTen people have been treated for Ebola in the United States, and federal officials say the number of future cases is likely to be extremely small \u2014 in large part because airport screening and follow-up monitoring allows health authorities to spot possible cases and refer them to hospitals for treatment.\n\nRelated: How to Protect Yourself from Ebola\n\nHospital experts note that academic medical centers may be the best prepared to take on the task of caring for Ebola patients because they already treat the most complex cases. California, New York, Maryland, Virginia and Illinois are among the states that have designated regional trauma centers affiliated with medical schools to provide specialized Ebola care. New York has designated 10 hospitals. Health officials in the District and Georgia have identified hospitals but declined to name them.\n\nThe handful of U.S. hospitals that have treated Ebola patients have discovered that doing so can be costly, requiring around-the-clock care involving scores of nurses and other health workers. That would be a big challenge for many hospitals, where staffing is often stretched thin.\n\nAdding to the burden is the widespread media attention that accompanies treating an Ebola patient and the potential loss of revenue if other patients steer clear of the facility. There is also the constant worry that a mistake could result in employees\u2019 becoming infected.\n\n\u201cRight now, there honestly isn\u2019t any incentive, and that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d said Jeffrey Engel, executive director of the Atlanta-based Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. \u201cWhy would I get in line for that if I were a private-sector business?\u201d\n\nRelated: No, Budget Cuts Didn't Prevent an Ebola Vaccine\n\nThe need to shore up U.S. hospital preparedness became clear after Duncan\u2019s illness was not correctly diagnosed when he first went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. Duncan died Oct. 8, and two nurses who cared for him were infected but recovered.\n\nMore than 100 hospital health-care workers and other contacts were monitored for 21 days for possible exposure. In one case, the U.S. Coast Guard used a helicopter to deliver a blood test kit and protective gowns to a worker on a cruise ship so she could be tested.\n\nThe crisis affected the Dallas hospital\u2019s bottom line. From Oct. 1 through Oct. 20, a period in which the emergency room was closed for nine days, emergency-room visits plunged and net revenue dropped, according to financial disclosure documents filed by the hospital\u2019s parent company.\n\nA spokeswoman for Texas Health Presbyterian said that patient volumes for most services have returned to average levels for this time of year but that emergency department volume remains below previous levels. Most of the 10 Ebola cases in the United States were treated at three hospitals with biocontainment units \u2014 Nebraska Medical Center, Emory University Hospital and the clinical center at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland.\n\nThose hospitals would be \u201coverwhelmed by even a modest surge of 10 to 20 patients,\u201d Bryce Gartland, vice president of operations for Emory University Hospital, said in a Nov. 7 letter to Congress in support of more federal funds.\n\nEmory, which treated four patients, spent close to $1 million in direct costs to care for \u201ca single high-intensity patient,\u201d Gartland said. Nebraska Medical Center, which cared for three patients, said its direct costs from its first two patients surpassed $1 million. The \u201copportunity cost\u201d of taking 10 beds out of service \u2014 part of infection control \u2014 was another $148,000, hospital officials have said.\n\nUnder the Obama administration\u2019s budget request, there are no additional funds to reimburse the hospitals that have already treated Ebola patients. \u201cI don\u2019t know that every hospital out there would want to get into this business, to be honest with you,\u201d Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) told Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell during a congressional hearing.\n\nSo far, the costs have been handled by the hospitals and private insurers. \u201cTo date, it has not been an issue that has come to us,\u201d Burwell said. \u201cIf this is something that [Congress] wants to discuss as part of this funding, we\u2019re happy to entertain that.\u201d\n\nShe added that the goal is for an Ebola patient to be within eight hours of treatment anywhere in the United States.\n\nLast week, Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) introduced a bill that would use $125 million to fund regionally designated \u201cEbola treatment hubs\u201d to care for patients and cover unpaid expenses.\n\nSome of the biggest challenges for hospitals involve logistics. Where should patients be isolated to prevent infection? How should staffs be trained in wearing full-body protective gear? How should Ebola-related waste, which requires special disposal, be handled?\n\nBeyond logistics, hospital executives are worried about the stigma of being known as Ebola treatment centers, said James Blumenstock, who oversees health security for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nHospitals and the public need to \u201cget beyond that initial fear factor,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should not be fearful that a good, strong medical center is willing to accept an Ebola patient as well as meet other community needs.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:\n\nU.S. seeks ways to speed up blood samples from remote areas\n\nCost to treat Ebola in the U.S.: $1.16 million for 2 patients\n\nGovernments, groups strive to become as agile as virus", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S.", "title": "The High Cost of Having Ebola-Ready Hospitals", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/29/High-Cost-Having-Ebola-Ready-Hospitals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04302013_ER_hospital_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/29/High-Cost-Having-Ebola-Ready-Hospitals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04302013_ER_hospital_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Under the Obama administration\u2019s budget request, there are no additional funds to reimburse the hospitals that have already treated Ebola patients.\nOf the 5,000 hospitals in the United States, dozens have volunteered to treat Ebola patients.\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Look, we might be willing to do this, but we don\u2019t want to be called an Ebola hospital.\nThe handful of U.S. hospitals that have treated Ebola patients have discovered that doing so can be costly, requiring around-the-clock care involving scores of nurses and other health workers.\nAmong the hospitals designated in that category are Johns Hopkins, Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and Bellevue in Manhattan."}
