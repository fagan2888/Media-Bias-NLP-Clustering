Are state education officials finally finished fiddling with the standarized testing regimen? Let’s hope so, because the policy shifts never seem to cease.

The past few years have seen a dizzying series of changes in testing, first with the piling on of extra tests, then the swapping out of one set of tests for another, then the legislature reducing the number of mandated tests in response to public pushback. At which point the ordeal appeared over.

But wait. No sooner had everyone adjusted to the new normal than the state Department of Education this week announced that the ACT test for juniors and pre-ACT for sophomores was being replaced by the SAT and PSAT.

The SAT and PSAT are perfectly fine tests, but the reasons for the selection committee’s decision are somewhat elusive, whereas the benefits of comparative data going back years with the ACT would seem to be quite compelling.
