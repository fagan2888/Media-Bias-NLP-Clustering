So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that, to hear Rauner tell it, the fair share fee is the only thing keeping the state\u2019s unemployment rate above 6 percent.\n\n\u201cForced union dues are a critical cog in the corrupt bargain that is crushing taxpayers,\u201d Rauner said. \u201cAn employee who is forced to pay unfair share dues is being forced to fund political activity with which they disagree. That is a clear violation of First Amendment rights\u2014and something that, as governor, I am duty bound to correct.\u201d\n\nRauner\u2019s executive order is unprecedented and possibly illegal: It essentially overrides the state\u2019s Labor Relations Act, a law passed in 1984.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre\u2014lawless and bizarre,\u201d said Martin Malin, the director of the Institute for Law and the Workplace at the Illinois Institute of Technology Kent College of Law. \u201cBut you need to view it in a broader context. It fits in with what\u2019s going on nationally.\u201d\n\nIn Kentucky, several counties passed their own right-to-work legislation, giving the state a patchwork of laws governing union dues. In Pennsylvania, Republican state legislators last year tried to stop unions from automatically deducting dues from people\u2019s paychecks. In California, there\u2019s a lawsuit headed to the Supreme Court, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which could turn it into a right-to-work state. This year, legislators in Wisconsin, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Missouri will all be considering right-to-work laws that would bar unions from charging fair share dues to non-members.\n\nThese pushes to quash unions could be seen as individual acts of anti-unionism. But with the 2016 elections looming, it\u2019s worth considering what coordinated strategies might be at play: Attacking unions and the way they take in money isn\u2019t just a great way to weaken them, but it also encourages corporate interests to donate money, which in turn might undermine the financial and political support of the Democratic Party. If Scott Walker\u2019s successful 2011 push to gut collective bargaining in Wisconsin was any indication, rabid anti-unionism is a great way to gin up conservative anger and reel in cash.\n\nIn 2011, Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker introduced legislation aimed at eliminating the right of unions to collectively bargain. The move set off massive protests and a recall election, but Walker was able to raise $22.6 million from outside groups\u2014including $10 million from Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity\u2014and spend five times more than his opponents to win the election. Taking a lesson from Walker, Michigan\u2019s legislature pushed through Koch-backed anti-union legislation in 2012. With the help of the Koch brothers, the American Legislative Exchange Council has drafted boilerplate anti-union legislation used by many states. ALEC drafted Michigan\u2019s right-to-work bill, and similar ALEC-backed pushes have occurred in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina\u2014though Michigan is the only one where ALEC was totally successful.\n\nWhile anti-unionism has been spreading across the country for a few years, Gov. Rauner\u2019s executive order took labor organizers by surprise. Rauner rode to victory in a Democratic-leaning state by promising the usual conservative solution to economic woes: tax cuts, tax breaks for corporations, and a promise to hold unions\u2014especially ones that represent teachers\u2014accountable. But with both houses of Illinois\u2019s government still solidly Democratic, Rauner had no choice but to use an executive order based on the theory that compulsory union dues violate the First Amendment.\n\nThe governor\u2019s attempt to skirt the state\u2019s legislature to gut a bill will almost certainly be challenged in court. And that\u2019s led some, like Martin Malin, to speculate that Rauner is gunning to get the Supreme Court to weigh in on compulsory dues. As it turns out, other lawmakers have gotten there before him.\n\nLast June in the case Harris v. Quinn, Justice Samuel Alito led a 5-4 majority in the Supreme Court in deciding that home health care aids and other caregivers in Illinois paid via Medicaid didn\u2019t have to pay. The ruling was relatively narrow, and didn\u2019t apply to full-fledged municipal employees like teachers. But as The Century Foundation points out, Alito has been laying the groundwork to dismantle compulsory union dues for years. His Harris opinion was filled with language that questions the legitimacy of the 1977 case Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that upheld a union\u2019s rights to collect dues.\n\nAt the end of last month, the Supreme Court announced that it would take up the California case, whose ruling will probably force the court to make a call on mandatory fees. So why would Rauner push a legally dubious law if a much stronger case is already heading to the Supreme Court?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all to do serious damage to the Democratic Party,\u201d said Bob Bruno, a labor law professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cEven with falling numbers, labor is still punching above its weight class. If you could do damage to that constituency group, you can do damage to Democrats.\u201d\n\nIf Republicans really cared about the economy, gutting unions should be the last place to look\u2014not only because unions have been proven time and time again to increase middle class wealth, but also because they are so weak. Participation\u2019s at the lowest it\u2019s been in a century; even if you believe unions are an economic drain, they\u2019re not one worth exerting serious political effort over.\n\nIn Illinois, Rauner\u2019s executive order wouldn\u2019t have a large effect\u2014there are only 6,500 current Illinois employees who have decided to opt out of their unions but still pay dues. Union busting, though, is great politics. Slightly more than half of Americans approve of unions, according to a Gallup survey, though that number has increased since the financial crisis. Gallup found that a majority of Americans would like to see unions\u2019 power limited further, and that an increasing number of people think unions do more harm than good\u2014and conservatives have capitalized on that waning public opinion, and have started to blame unions for the U.S.\u2019s economic stagnation.\n\nAll that said: gutting unions isn\u2019t only about finding financial and political support. In large part, it\u2019s also about hobbling the Democratic Party. Even though unions are a decreasing force in the labor market, they still carry considerable political clout and have deep pockets. Unions spent $1.7 billion in the run up to the 2012 midterms. Even if unions survive the fight in states like Illinois, the multi-pronged attacks drain money and the political will to focus on other things\u2014namely, electing Democrats. \u201cEven if they lose, they win,\u201d Malin said. \u201cThe union has to spend money fighting them. It\u2019s all about resources.\u201d\n\nBut anti-unionism\u2019s largest advantage is its ability to galvanize Americans. Like the Tea Party coalesced around Obamacare, in 2016 unions could come to represent everything wrong with Democratic politics, bringing conservatives to the polls.\n\nThat could explain why next year\u2019s likely front-runners are going out of their way to criticize them. Jeb Bush recently used a speech in Washington D.C. to demonize teacher unions. Governor Walker was similarly applauded at the Freedom Summit when he mentioned his anti-union stance.\n\nBoth Bush and Walker are now front-runners for the Republican presidential nomination. (Though it\u2019s still very early, of course.) But it\u2019s Walker\u2014the poster-child for anti-unionism thanks to his Koch-backed efforts in Wisconsin\u2014who this week became the first possible 2016 presidential candidate to open an office in Iowa. He\u2019s already established a big lead over the rest of the Republican field. Walker\u2019s likely candidacy means that the rhetoric surrounding unions will soon matter more than ever.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Remember unions?
