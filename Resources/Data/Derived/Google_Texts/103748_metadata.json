There has been a lot of publicity about the federal health insurance exchange not working but almost nothing said about the Massachusetts Health Connector. I have had a policy through the Connector since 2011. It worked great. Now I have received notice that I have to sign up again. My old login no longer works. Setting up a new one doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly. Going to the call center is torture. No one answers and the same message on hold plays over and over again, telling people to go on line while the online site tells people to call the help line. Worst of all, it looks like my policy is discontinued. Calling my insurer, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told it was a Health Connector decision and they can do nothing about it. Why is a process which worked so well before now completely broken?\n\nA. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt the health insurance exchanges are messed up and the previously functional one in Massachusetts has tanked as it tries to adapt to new federal requirements. The folks at the Connector seem eager to please and are helping on your case, but acknowledge they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some problems.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very large and very complex system, and anytime you are creating something of this scope bugs are expected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connector spokesman Jason Lefferts said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have had issues with the website and we are frustrated when those issues impact user experience. We are constantly monitoring the site and when specific issues are found we work on finding a solution and making a fix.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\nThe system is taken down a few times a week late at night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it will not be working at all when you try then. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty clear that federally mandated changes have complicated the situation. For example, the new federal law means you can get dental insurance through the Connector. But you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the details online. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to call, Lefferts said.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfortunate that something as beneficial as ensuring that everyone can get health coverage has taken a big step back before being able to step forward. Lefferts said he expects things to improve. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We anticipate new functionality will be added in the coming weeks and months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "consumer alert, product safety, recalls, identity theft, consumer scams, data breaches, Boston, product safety news, consumer news, consumer advocacy", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/community/blogs/images/consumer_alert/mug_esi.png", "site_name": "Boston.com", "description": "A once functioning system in Massachusetts now has some problems.", "title": "Obamacare fallout: Mass.
