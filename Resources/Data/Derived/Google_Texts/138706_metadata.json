Prosecutors asked for the bail increase, saying they feared Solis' family might be able to post the lower amount, raising the possibility he might flee again.\n\nHe is due back in court June 30 for arraignment.\n\nSolis, arrested last month after authorities said he fled to Mexico with help from his father, faces one count of murder and one count of assault with a firearm, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. The complaint includes a special allegation that Solis personally discharged a handgun.\n\nEx-LAPD Cop Booked in SoCal Jail\n\nAn ex-LAPD officer accused of murder was transferred from Texas to Los Angeles and booked into a Pomona jail.

He was sought in the shooting death of 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez following a dispute at a Pomona nightclub in March.\n\nHis return came on the same day a jury in Texas found his father, Victor Manuel Solis, guilty of making false statements to the FBI to prevent authorities from finding his son.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bail was raised to $10 million Tuesday for a former Los Angeles Police Department officer accused of gunning down a man at a nightclub.", "title": "Bail Raised to $10M for Ex-LAPD Officer Accused in Fatal Shooting", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "Bail was raised to $10 million Tuesday for a former Los Angeles Police Department officer accused of gunning down a man at a nightclub.", "title": "Bail Raised to $10M for Ex-LAPD Officer", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Henry-Solis-LAPD-Officer-Murder-Charge-Pomona-Shooting-Death-306671961.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*740/06-05-2015-solis-lapd-officer-murder-pomona-court.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bail was raised to $10 million Tuesday for a former Los Angeles Police Department officer accused of gunning down a man at a nightclub.", "title": "Bail Raised to $10M for Ex-LAPD Officer", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Henry-Solis-LAPD-Officer-Murder-Charge-Pomona-Shooting-Death-306671961.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*740/06-05-2015-solis-lapd-officer-murder-pomona-court.JPG?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "Salome Rodriguez Jr, henry solis, lapd officer arrest, solis timeline, timeline, ex lapd officer timeline, pomona", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Salome Rodriguez Jr, henry solis, lapd officer arrest, solis timeline, timeline, ex lapd officer timeline, pomona"}, "article_summary": "Bail was raised to $10 million Tuesday for a former Los Angeles Police Department officer accused of gunning down a man at a nightclub.\nEx-LAPD Cop Booked in SoCal JailAn ex-LAPD officer accused of murder was transferred from Texas to Los Angeles and booked into a Pomona jail.\nHe was sought in the shooting death of 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez following a dispute at a Pomona nightclub in March.\nThe bail amount for Henry Solis, 27, was originally set at $2 million.\nProsecutors asked for the bail increase, saying they feared Solis' family might be able to post the lower amount, raising the possibility he might flee again."}
