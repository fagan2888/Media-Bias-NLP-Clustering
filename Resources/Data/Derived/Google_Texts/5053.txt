Cruz: Scott Walker Wrong, 2016 GOP Candidate Doesn't Have To Be Washington Outsider

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on whether Scott Walker is right when he says Ted Cruz should not be considered as a 2016 presidential candidate because he’s a “Washington person”: I’ll tell you this; I agree with Governor Walker that Hilary Clinton would make a very poor president. So on that, we are on the same page. And beyond that, you know what, there’s going to be plenty of time to worry about politics going forward… I like Scott Walker. I think he’s done a good job standing up to unions in his state. What I think the next president should be is someone who is leading the fight for free market principals and the constitution, someone who’s listening to the American people, not listening to the established politicians.



What I think matters is, are they fighting to bring back economic growth, to restore free market principals, to bring back jobs, to bring back the constitution and are they listening to the American people? The greatest frustration people have in this country right now is that Washington politicians aren’t listening.



Cruz On whether Chris Christie is a “bonafide conservative”: Well, they’ll be plenty of time… I’m not going to do that. I like Chris Christie, I’m glad he was reelected. I think his blunt, brash style is refreshing and I think we need a lot more people in Washington who have the courage to stand up against ObamaCare, against the failed Obama economic policy and turn our country around. We are facing a fiscal and economic cliff and we need real leadership.



Cruz On whether he is going to run for president in 2016: My focus is on the senate. Good try. (Bloomberg's Political Capital with Al Hunt, November 23, 2013)
