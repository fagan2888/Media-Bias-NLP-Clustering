Preserved next to each other \u2013 and given the dramatic title the \u201cDueling Dinosaurs\u201d \u2013 the tyrannosaur and ceratopsid are going up for auction at Bonham\u2019s in New York City. The two are expected to rake in around nine million dollars, with no guarantee that the fossils will go to a museum or that their beautiful bones will even have the chance to be rigorously studied by scientists. That\u2019s exactly why paleontologists were aghast when the auction block tyrannosaur made an appearance at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology annual meeting yesterday afternoon.\n\nPoster 47 was the focal point of the controversy. Presented by Peter Larson of the commercial outfit The Black Hills Institute, the glossy sheet was titled \u201cThe validity of Nanotyrannus lancensis (Theropod, Lancian \u2013 Upper Maastrichtian of North America).\u201d This was contentious enough. For decades, researchers have debated the identity of this species. Where some see a \u201cpygmy tyrant\u201d that was a small, distinct species of tyrannosaur that lived alongside the famous Tyrannosaurus rex, others argue that such long-snouted, big-eyed specimens actually represent the awkward look of teenage T. rex.\n\nIf the specimen in Larson\u2019s poster was properly curated and cared for at a museum, the argument surrounding the presentation would have been on the validity, or not, of \u201cNanotyrannus.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t the issue creating the looks of frustration and disbelief amongst paleontologists I talked to yesterday. The fossil that Larson highlighted to make his case for \u201cNanotyrannus\u201d should never have been presented at the meeting \u2013 the poster looked more like an auction sale advertisement than science.\n\nThe embattled dinosaur, along with the ceratopsid it was buried with, was discovered on Mary Ann and Lige Murray\u2019s Montana ranch in 2006. The hype around the specimens didn\u2019t pick up until 2011, when a dedicated \u201cDueling Dinosaurs\u201d website tried to entice museums and other potential buyers with photos and videos of the gorgeous fossils. Larson was the spokesman in this push and trumped up the importance of the find, claiming that the horned dinosaur was a as-yet-unknown species and that the young tyrannosaur would finally establish the reality of \u201cNanotyrannus.\u201d And, the site boasted, the two dinosaurs had killed each other. There were no publications or technical details. Such claims were the bait for buyers who might have an interest in displaying and describing the 66 million year old skeletons.\n\nNo one bit. Rumors started to circulate that the pricetag for the skeletons was nine million dollars. The sellers might as well have been asking for a billion. Nine million dollars could fund a museum\u2019s staff and field programs for decades, during which time researchers could collect many more fossil specimens of their own. Not to mention that researchers are skeptical of how scientifically important the \u201cDueling Dinosaurs\u201d actually are. Commercially-collected specimens don\u2019t always come with the essential geologic data to tease out the ecological secrets of such fossils, not to mention that some researchers are doubtful of the three main claims that the pair represent a new ceratopsid, a \u201cNanotyrannus\u201c, and that the two died in mortal combat. Why pony up a ridiculous amount of money for questionable specimens?\n\nSo the dinosaurs are going to auction. They are not reposited and properly curated at a reputable museum. They are waiting for the auctioneer\u2019s gavel, and no one knows who is going to take them home. A museum could blow millions on these dinosaurs, or, as many fear, a celebrity or other private buyer could decide that they absolutely must have a dinosaur pair for their foyer. We\u2019ll find out in a few weeks. But one thing is clear right now \u2013 presenting the \u201cNanotyrannus\u201d at the SVP annual meeting is a violation of the organization\u2019s ethics.\n\nThe standards SVP sets forward on this matter are clear and to-the-point. The society stipulates that \u201cScientifically significant fossil vertebrate specimens, along with ancillary data, should be curated and accessioned in the collections of repositories charged in perpetuity with conserving fossil vertebrates for scientific study and education (e.g., accredited museums, universities, colleges and other educational institutions).\u201d That has not been done with the \u201cNanotyrannus\u201c, and it may never be if it goes to a private fossil aficionado.\n\nMore than that, SVP requires members to preserve fossils for everyone. The organization\u2019s ethics code states:\n\nThe barter, sale or purchase of scientifically significant vertebrate fossils is not condoned, unless it brings them into, or keeps them within, a public trust. Any other trade or commerce in scientifically significant vertebrate fossils is inconsistent with the foregoing, in that it deprives both the public and professionals of important specimens, which are part of our natural heritage.\n\nThe Bonham\u2019s sale is open to anyone with deep enough pockets. Those involved in selling the \u201cDueling Dinosaurs\u201d, including Larson, claim that they want to see the dinosaurs in a museum, but this rings hollow when there\u2019s a good chance that the auction could rob scientists and the public alike of a chance to even see these spectacular animals. And while the abstract submission guidelines of the SVP annual meeting does not mention regulations for presenting on commercial fossils, the society\u2019s Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology rightly requires that \u201cAll specimens used in diagnostic descriptions, in illustrations, or in taxonomic discussions must be properly curated and deposited in a recognized public or private, non-profit institution. All material mentioned in a paper must fulfill the criteria set out within the Society\u2018s Code of Ethics.\u201d Larson\u2019s \u201cNanotyrannus\u201d does not.\n\nI can see how Larson\u2019s paper snuck through the society\u2019s ethical code. The abstract in the official meeting volume makes no mention of the \u201cDueling Dinosaurs\u201d specimen and sounds like a general argument in favor of \u201cNanotyrannus\u201c, similar to what Larson recently published in the book Tyrannosaurid Paleobiology. That\u2019s why researchers were shocked to see a poster plastered with large images of the for-sale dinosaur, with the technical argument restricted to an abstract statement and a table of skeletal characteristics.\n\nFrom the original advertising website to the Bonham\u2019s item entry, the high price of the \u201cDueling Dinosaurs\u201d has at least partly rested on the unsupported argument that these animals are scientific novelties. Now the \u201cNanotyrannus\u201c, at least, bears the imprimatur of having been presented to the premier organization dedicated to the study of such fossils, no doubt another point on the hype scale.\n\nThe scientists who stopped by Larson\u2019s poster may never get to study the tyrannosaur\u2019s fossils, preventing them from even having a chance to evaluate Larson\u2019s claims about a fossil he has principally had access to. And the possible sale of the dinosaur to a private buyer would not only hide a significant specimen from science, but would keep the bones \u2013 and what we can learn from them \u2013 away from the public. There may not be a chance to draw biological secrets from those bones that can help researchers create the dinosaurian visions in museums, books, and movies that continue to awe and inspire us.
