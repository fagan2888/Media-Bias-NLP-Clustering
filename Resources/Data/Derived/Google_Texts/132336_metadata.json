In exchange, they must provide charity care to patients unable to pay, and proactively engage in activities that benefit their communities.\n\nA new study, released by Health Affairs as a Web First, estimates the total value of the exemption to US nonprofit hospitals in 2011 at $24.6 billion. This compares to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s $12.6 billion estimate for 2002. Authors Sara Rosenbaum, David Kindig, Jie Bao, Maureen Brynes, and Colin O\u2019Laughlin found considerable variation in tax benefits by state, driven by several factors, including differences in state tax policy.\n\nAnother important study finding: according to recent IRS estimates, only 8 percent of the $62 billion that the hospitals spent in 2011 for community benefits went to community health improvements. By contrast, hospitals allocated the single greatest proportion of their community benefit expenditures\u2014one-third of all community benefit spending\u2014to offset what they reported as Medicaid \u201cshortfalls.\u201d\n\nFor the study, the authors identified 2,980 private nonprofit hospitals. The primary sources for the data were the 2011 cost reports from the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the hospitals\u2019 2011 Form 990s, maintained by the IRS and available to the public.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires tax-exempt hospitals to engage in communitywide planning efforts to improve community health,\u201d observed the authors. \u201cWe hope that as the ACA\u2019s insurance reforms continue to take hold, the resulting reductions in uncompensated care will lead hospitals to increasingly expand their mission to include community health improvement.\u201d\n\nThis study will also appear in the July issue of Health Affairs. It was supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nRosenbaum and Byrnes are with the George Washington University in Washington, DC; Kindig is an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Bao and O\u2019Laughlin are affiliated with Avalere Health, also in Washington, DC.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/06/17/health-affairs-web-first-us-nonprofit-hospital-tax-exemption-almost-doubles-between-2002-and-2011/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Health Affairs Web First: US Nonprofit Hospital Tax Exemption Almost Doubles Between 2002 And 2011"}, "description": "Health Affairs Web First: US Nonprofit Hospital Tax Exemption Almost Doubles Between 2002 And 2011 | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94b7\"", "article_summary": "A new study, released by Health Affairs as a Web First, estimates the total value of the exemption to US nonprofit hospitals in 2011 at $24.6 billion.\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires tax-exempt hospitals to engage in communitywide planning efforts to improve community health,\u201d observed the authors.\nAnother important study finding: according to recent IRS estimates, only 8 percent of the $62 billion that the hospitals spent in 2011 for community benefits went to community health improvements.\nIn exchange, they must provide charity care to patients unable to pay, and proactively engage in activities that benefit their communities.\nBy contrast, hospitals allocated the single greatest proportion of their community benefit expenditures\u2014one-third of all community benefit spending\u2014to offset what they reported as Medicaid \u201cshortfalls.\u201dFor the study, the authors identified 2,980 private nonprofit hospitals."}
