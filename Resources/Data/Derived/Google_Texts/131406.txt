Being a parent is difficult and an even greater challenge for pares of special needs children, but a non-profit is there to offer relief.

Trinity Heights Respite Care is helping families in Harvey and Marion Counties who truly need it.

"I'm having families call me all the time," said Connie Rickerd, the non-profit's director.

If parents with a special needs child need a break, for any reason, THRC will send a trained caregiver.

"Many of our families get to know our care providers and they become sort of like family," said Rickerd.

Parents pay on a sliding scale, so lower income families can afford the care.
