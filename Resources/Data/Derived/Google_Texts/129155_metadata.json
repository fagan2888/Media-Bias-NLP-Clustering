Earlier this year, the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange in Tokyo, left users with $400 million in losses from alleged theft by hackers.\n\nAfter Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy, U.S. and state regulators have stepped up efforts to protect American consumers using digital money. In March, the Internal Revenue Service required taxpayers to report Bitcoin gains as they would returns on equity investments, surprising many just weeks before the April filing deadline.\n\nLast month in New York, Benjamin Lawsky, the state\u2019s superintendent of financial services, set in motion a 45-day public comment period on the state\u2019s proposed rules, which would be the first in the nation designed to rein in virtual currency use and abuse.\n\n\u201cWe have sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity \u2013 without stifling beneficial innovation,\u201d Lawsky said when announcing the comment period.\n\nAs proposed, New York would distribute \u201cBitLicenses\u201d to businesses that provide exchange services and digital wallets, or online currency storage, for consumers.\n\nRelated: Why States Want a Bite of Bitcoin and Other Virtual Currencies\n\nNew York-based licensees would have the following responsibilities if the regulations take effect as proposed:\n\n\u2022 Licensees must report names, addresses and other identifying information of all parties involved in a transaction and must detail the value and a description of all transactions.\n\n\u2022 Licensees must report any transaction that suggest or facilitate criminal activity, by submitting suspicious activity reports to regulators.\n\n\u2022 Licensees aren\u2019t allowed to do business with \u201cshell entities\u201d that have no physical location.\n\n\u2022 Exchanges must hold dollar-denominated bonds or trust accounts to back customer assets in a proportion to be specified by the state.\n\n\u2022 Any significant business changes, including the introduction of new products or services, must be approved in advance by the state.\n\nCritics say the rules would impinge on Americans\u2019 Constitutional rights and would be too costly. They also say federal authorities should be the ones to design any additional regulations for the global market. Advocates such as the Bitcoin Foundation have asked for more time to review the proposal and demanded disclosure of the state\u2019s underlying research into the matter, and a public petition seeking more time to comment is also circulating, with some 500 signatures already.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin\u2019s Road to Mainstream Acceptance Just Got Rockier\n\nThe proposed rules may also make it harder for people to start new exchanges and could force established businesses to seek new investors and capital infusions.\n\n\u201cOnly the financially connected will be granted BitLicenses and allowed to play in this new crypto-currency game,\u201d David Reischer, a Bitcoin investor in New York who co-founded the LegalAdvice website, wrote in an email.\n\nHowever, even critics of the proposal say the process will help digital money gain ground among skeptical consumers and merchants.\n\n\u201cAny recognition by a government institute takes Bitcoin one step further to public acceptance,\u201d Ofir Beigel, the Tel Aviv-based founder of the 99Bitcoins blog and no fan of the proposal, said by email.\n\nDespite his views that the state\u2019s proposal focuses on wrong issues, Lukasiewicz of Coinsetter is excited by the regulatory step forward, which will provide some clarity and a legal basis for the industry. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s always difficult to know what you can and cannot do,\u201d he said.\n\nHe simply wishes the proposed regulations would be less complex. \u201cIt\u2019s cryptography; it\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said.\n\nClaire Davidson is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a website devoted to helping consumers make smart financial decisions.
