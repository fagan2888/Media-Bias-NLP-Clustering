Q&A With Samir Kapadia From Cleveland Clinic: TAVR Gives Patients New Chance at Life in Later Years

A whole new segment of the population, particularly elderly patients are now eligible for a lifesaving cardiac procedure with the development of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement or TAVR.Samir Kapadia, MD, from Cleveland Clinic discussed how this procedure was developed and implemented at the Ohio institution during an interview with MD Magazine.Now that TAVR is a surgical option patients who might otherwise have survived can now see their lives extended many years.While TAVR may not be available at all hospitals across the country there are many institutions performing this lifesaving procedure.While many patients can benefit from undergoing the TAVR procedure, their ability to afford the procedure and whether their insurance will cover it is another issue. As the procedure becomes more common that could help more patients get the financial help they need.
