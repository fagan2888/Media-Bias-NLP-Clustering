It is in lopsided shape.\n\nEastern Idaho is awash in nurses, while hospitals in Boise bring in traveling nurses a few times a year and send recruiters to conferences in search of people to hire.\n\nIt is hard to find intensive-care, emergency and operating-room nurses, but easier to find new graduates who don\u2019t have the experience to care for an elderly trauma victim.\n\nOverall, stakeholders say the state needs more highly educated nurses who can meet the health care needs of Idaho\u2019s aging population and replenish jobs as seasoned baby boomers retire.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a shortage. We do have a distribution problem,\u201d said Sandra Evans, executive director of the Idaho Board of Nursing.\n\nThat\u2019s a change from 2006, when a nursing task force told then-governor Jim Risch that Idaho had a shortage of nurses - a shortage \u201cexpected to become critical between now and 2020.\u201d The shortage was \u201cmarked by an alarming exodus of the existing nursing workforce and the industry\u2019s inability to adequately compensate by using old, familiar strategies,\u201d the task force wrote.\n\nIdaho\u2019s higher education institutions have since worked to meet employers\u2019 demand for new nurses over the next 10 years, the Idaho Department of Labor found in a recent report.\n\nBut Idaho still has the lowest number of registered nurses per capita in the U.S., according to federal data.\n\nAnd it still takes Saint Alphonsus twice as long to fill local critical-care nursing jobs as it does to fill general nursing jobs. It takes St. Luke\u2019s more than 90 days to fill its local specialized registered nurse positions.\n\n___\n\n\u2018MIDLEVEL\u2019 PROVIDERS\n\nAnna Roy and people like her might be key to staffing the hospitals, hospices and public health agencies of the future.\n\nRoy is a 36-year-old Boise-area native who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Idaho State University, passed a licensing exam and became a registered nurse about 11 years ago.\n\nThe job market was dry in Pocatello then - it still is, she said - so she moved back to the Treasure Valley and started working for the Idaho Medicaid program.\n\nAbout two years ago, she wanted a change of pace: more education opportunities, better pay and benefits, something different. Her husband is a doctor at the Boise VA Medical Center, and Roy took a job in the hospital\u2019s anticoagulation clinic. Now she manages VA patients to make sure they don\u2019t develop blood clots.\n\n\u201cI really fell in love with getting to make an impact in patient lives,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI know personally I can\u2019t change their life, I can\u2019t cure them, but if I make a difference in (giving) better care and compassion to them, then I\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s thinking about becoming a nurse practitioner. That\u2019s an occupation in demand in Idaho, especially as changes in the health care industry put more emphasis on \u201cmidlevel\u201d providers. Nurse practitioners have advanced degrees and are legally allowed to prescribe drugs and act as primary care providers. They have a broader scope of practice than registered nurses, who typically have associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degrees.\n\n___\n\nTHE TEACHERS\n\nNursing students need hands-on practice; they can\u2019t just sit in the classroom to learn.\n\nBut the places where students can learn by doing, with adequate supervision by more experienced teachers, is in short supply in Idaho.\n\nBoise State University School of Nursing Director Ann Hubbert said the school doesn\u2019t have trouble filling its faculty slots.\n\nBut statewide, that\u2019s not the case, and instructors are pushing retirement age, Evans said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the faculty that provide the ability to meet demand,\u201d Evans said. Unless young nurses go on to higher education, \u201cwe are going to run into a problem.\u201d\n\nCompounding the issue is that salaries for nursing school instructors \u201care so low that they\u2019re not competitive with what St. Luke\u2019s and Saint Al\u2019s and Kootenai (hospital) can pay,\u201d Evans said.\n\nThe average nursing instructor in Idaho makes $49,660 - about $10,000 less than a registered nurse, $45,000 less than a nurse practitioner and $119,000 less than a nurse anesthetist, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEvery state that borders Idaho pays its nursing instructors better on average, too - from about $7,000 more in Montana to $35,000 more in Nevada.\n\n___\n\nTHE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT\n\nHospitals, clinics, nursing homes, jails, home-health agencies and school districts are among the 145 \u201cclinical sites\u201d where nursing students can do rotations in Southwest Idaho. Statewide, there are hundreds of sites for future nurses to hone their skills.\n\nBut almost every nursing program in Idaho reports not having enough access to clinical sites for students, according to the Idaho Department of Labor.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because of the lack of faculty members to oversee them, and partly because a hospital in Boise can\u2019t function if it\u2019s crawling with hundreds of nursing students from nearby schools.\n\n\u201cOur clinical partners are maxed,\u201d Hubbert said. \u201cIn addition to nursing students, they\u2019re running (student) physician assistants, EMTs \u2026 and from not only the Treasure Valley.\u201d\n\nNursing schools in other states are sending students to the Treasure Valley for clinical education, she said.\n\nSaint Alphonsus has 126 nursing students signed up for spring 2015 rotations, according to Sherry Parks, regional chief nursing officer.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s had more than 730 nursing students go through clinical rotations in its Treasure Valley sites last year, said Chief Nursing Officer Cy Gearhard.\n\nBoise State University, which has more than 400 nursing students, built a clinical simulation center in 2010. It\u2019s a six-bed pseudo-hospital that holds up to 30 students at a time.\n\n\u201cThe simulation center just adds another tool for us to be able to offer our students those clinical experiences,\u201d said center Director Becky Bunderson. The goal \u201cis to try to create a realistic environment (for hands-on training) that doesn\u2019t pose any risk to patients.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nGearhard and Parks said their hospitals are meeting their patients\u2019 needs for nurses. But they\u2019re gearing up for big shifts in how health care systems operate under the Affordable Care Act, with nurses in charge of more telehealth and outpatient care.\n\nThe hospitals are working with Idaho nursing schools to introduce future nurses to specialties such as critical care, which are stressful, demanding and require staffing around the clock. But sometimes these efforts fall short and hospitals need to hire travel nurses from out of state - staffing that tends to be expensive.\n\nThey\u2019re also cultivating the next generation of highly skilled nurses from within their own ranks.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s and Saint Alphonsus both offer residency programs that orient recent nursing school graduates to the hospital workplace and give them a taste of various specialties.\n\nThey want nurses who attended two-year schools to get a bachelor\u2019s degree - something the National Institute of Medicine is pushing. The institute says 80 percent of the nursing workforce should have a bachelor\u2019s degree - an ambitious goal, given that the national average now is 55 percent and that it took 10 years to get there from about 50 percent.\n\nAbout 57 percent of Saint Alphonsus nurses have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, and about 66 percent of local St. Luke\u2019s nurses do.\n\nSaint Alphonsus is sending employees to college, offering scholarships to Boise State and Northwest Nazarene universities. More than 150 Saint Alphonsus nurses are enrolled now in baccalaureate programs, with 20 of those on full-ride scholarships from Saint Alphonsus.\n\nSaint Alphonsus is budgeting $250,000 in the next fiscal year for nurses to pursue advanced degrees, a spokesman said.\n\nAt St. Luke\u2019s, Gearhard expects to hire 30 percent more nurses over the next 10 years as the system expands, she said.\n\nJust in the past year, St. Luke\u2019s hired 273 registered nurses in the Treasure Valley.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on building that internal pipeline so that we have nurses ready to go into the ICU or operating rooms when an opening occurs,\u201d Gearhard said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Statesman, http://www.idahostatesman.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idaho's nursing workforce isn't in bad shape.
