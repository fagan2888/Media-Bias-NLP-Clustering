JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A 51-year-old Orange Park man has been sentenced after pleading guilty last year to possessing child pornography, U.S. attorneys said.

Ronald Boike was sentenced to three years and four months in federal prison for the charge. He pleaded guilty Sept. 10.

According to the plea agreement, Boike was involved in an online relationship with a minor for at least two years.

Boike sent sexually explicit pictures of himself to the girl in order to coax her to produce and send him pornographic pictures and videos of herself, U.S. attorneys said.

During ongoing conversations with the girl, Boike saved pornographic pictures and videos of the minor on his family's computer, authorities said. His wife learned of his relationship with the girl after discovering the videos on the family's computer, authorities said.

Boike's wife subsequently filed a complaint with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to U.S. attorneys.
