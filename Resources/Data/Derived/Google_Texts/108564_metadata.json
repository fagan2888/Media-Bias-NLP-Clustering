Here\u2019s a video of the speech.\n\nRand Paul came out with rolled up sleeves and blue jeans, a clear shot at Scott Walker. Although many of my older political friends don\u2019t like the blue jeans, young people, who are Rand Paul\u2019s base, love it (more on this later).\n\nRand Paul\u2019s biggest problem over the past few months is that he seemed off track. He was populist Rand, libertarian Rand, conservative Rand, and moderate Rand. This was the first speech he finally put it all together.\n\nRand Paul hit some of his usual themes at the beginning of his speech. He started by asking a simple question, \u201cWill you lovers of liberty? Will you rise to the occasion?\u201d Then he went into his civil liberties heavy message and likened it to the American revolutionaries rising up against the British Crown.\n\nPaul criticized the Roberts decision on Obamacare and said \u201cwe should be presumed free\u201d in response to the Roberts court presuming Obamacare constitutional. Paul also promised to repeal \u201cevery last bit of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nPaul continued his libertarian populist themes with criticisms of the NSA metadata program saying \u201cI say the phone records of law-abiding citizens are none of their damn business.\u201d He also attacked overspending by calling debt \u201ca threat to freedom from within.\u201d\n\nPaul also addressed foreign policy outlining his vision of a less hawkish foreign policy. He also took shots at \u201cHillary\u2019s War\u201d in Libya as jihadists have almost taken over that country. He also slammed Hillary on Benghazi and said \u201cit\u2019s time for Hillary Clinton to permanently retire.\u201d He called ISIS a \u201cdangerous cult\u201d and pointed out that many in ISIS were armed by the U.S. to fight the Syrian government. He called for a foreign policy that \u201cpromotes stability, not chaos.\u201d Paul also said \u201cnot one penny more to these haters of America\u201d as he called for a sharp reduction in foreign aid. I agree with Jim Antle at Rare that the first shots in the Republican Party\u2019s (much-needed) foreign policy debate were fired in the speech.\n\nPaul has refined his outreach to black and working class voters. He said \u201cliberal policies have failed our inner cities\u201d, making it clear he will address income mobility by reducing the size of government. He also said he will propose the largest tax cut in America when he proposes his tax plan and balance the budget in five years.\n\nRand Paul also hit some anti-Washington themes by calling on Congress to read the bills they vote on, term-limits for Congress and judges, and making Congress obey the laws they impose. The pro-Paul crowd was chanting \u201cPresident Paul\u201d as he was finishing his speech.\n\nRand Paul essentially hit a home run with this speech. We finally see a narrative emerging and libertarian populism actually becoming a thing. You know why Rand Paul wears jeans and is one of the best social media trolls on the internet? It\u2019s because that\u2019s what young voters are looking for. They want a fighter and someone who is not \u201cone of the stiff suits.\u201d As a result, young voters love Rand Paul.\n\nJust some anecdotal thoughts here. During Rand\u2019s speech, I was sitting by a couple of people from Wayne Dupree\u2019s Team Ninja in media row covering the speech. When Rand finished, these two people were giving Rand a standing ovation. Ironically, I was also talking to several young \u201cestablishment \u201cRepublicans who were also going to support Rand Paul because of his ideas and outreach.\n\nGoing forward, Rand Paul will be one of the top-tier candidates who can stay in the top-tier throughout the race because he can raise money and he has his father\u2019s libertarian base. However, Rand needs to expand on his foreign policy views with a foreign policy speech and soon. Rand also needs to follow through on his promises on taxes and the budget.\n\nRand Paul will also come under fire over his father\u2019s more nutty remarks. Will these attacks be fair? No, but Rand\u2019s a Republican and the same media that didn\u2019t care about Obama\u2019s associations will go over Rand\u2019s with a fine toothed comb.\n\nIf Rand can stay standing during these attacks, he has a shot at the nomination and the White House.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Hayride", "description": "....and he hit a home run. \u00a0Here's a video of the speech. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfw46xdBCd0 Rand Paul came out with rolled up sleeves and blue jeans, a clear shot at Scott Walker.\u00a0Although\u00a0many of my older political friends don't like the\u00a0...", "title": "So Rand Paul Gave A Speech at CPAC\u2026\u2026.", "url": "http://thehayride.com/2015/02/so-rand-paul-gave-a-speech-at-cpac/", "image": "http://thehayride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/RandPaul-150x150.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "2016 presidential election, CPAC 2015, Rand Paul", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f7f\"", "article_summary": "He was populist Rand, libertarian Rand, conservative Rand, and moderate Rand.\nHowever, Rand needs to expand on his foreign policy views with a foreign policy speech and soon.\nRand Paul came out with rolled up sleeves and blue jeans, a clear shot at Scott Walker.\nRand Paul hit some of his usual themes at the beginning of his speech.\nYou know why Rand Paul wears jeans and is one of the best social media trolls on the internet?"}
