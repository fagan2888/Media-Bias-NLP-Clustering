They were always supportive when I was a contributor. I was their fair-haired boy,\u201d Trump said to The Hill in the interview on July 22. \u201cThe RNC has been, I think, very foolish.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the chance of him running as a third-party candidate will \u201cabsolutely\u201d increase if he does not win the Republican nomination, stating that \u201cso many people want me to, if I don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to see how I\u2019m being treated by the Republicans. Absolutely, if they\u2019re not fair, that would be a factor,\u201d he added.\n\nThe New York Times noted the significance of past third-party candidates. For example, Ralph Nader\u2019s candidacy in 2000 likely siphoned off votes from Democratic nominee Al Gore in one of the closest elections in the nation\u2019s history. In 1992, Ross Perot received 19 percent of the vote, enough for incumbent George H.W. Bush to lose to Bill Clinton.\n\nEarlier this month, RNC chair Reince Priebus personally called Trump and asked him to tone down his comments about Mexican immigrants, among other topics, according to The Hill. After being questioned about the conversation by reporters, Trump said Priebus was supportive of him and his candidacy.\n\nTrump says other Republicans who have publicly criticized him for his remarks, specifically the most recent attack against Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, are only distancing themselves from Trump because the billionaire businessman is not part of the GOP establishment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the gang. I\u2019m not in the group where the group does whatever it\u2019s supposed to do. I want to do what\u2019s right for the country \u2014 not what\u2019s good for special interest groups that contribute, not what\u2019s good for the lobbyists and the donors,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about the U.S. Supreme Court, Trump said he would appoint justices with a \u201cconservative bent,\u201d much like that of current Justices Sam Alito and Antonin Scalia. He also criticized Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican who was appointed by former President George W. Bush in 2005.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush was the one that pushed Roberts through his brother, and Roberts gave us Obamacare,\u201d Trump said. \u201cRoberts was a terrible choice. We wouldn\u2019t be talking about Obamacare right now if we didn\u2019t have Roberts.\u201d\n\nTrump also praised Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders for opposing President Barack Obama\u2019s trade deal, saying that\u2019s the \u201cone thing\u201d he agrees with the Vermont senator on.\n\nSources: The Hill, The New York Times\n\nPhoto credit: Gage Skidmore/Flickr", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "In a new interview with political news website The Hill, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke ...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Donald Trump Threatens Third-Party Run If GOP Rejects Him", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/new-interview-trump-blames-john-roberts-obamacare", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "In a new interview with political news website The Hill, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke ...", "title": "Donald Trump Threatens Third-Party Run If GOP Rejects Him"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-23T16:21:39+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2015-07-23T16:21:39+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 859824}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16d6\"", "article_summary": "But one thing Trump said is making headlines everywhere: He is not opposed to running as a third-party candidate if he does not win the Republican nomination.\nIn a new interview with political news website The Hill, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke on a variety of subjects, from his controversial comments about Mexican immigrants, to his presidential challengers in both parties, to the Supreme Court.\n\u201cThe RNC (Republican National Committee) has not been supportive.\n\u201cJeb Bush was the one that pushed Roberts through his brother, and Roberts gave us Obamacare,\u201d Trump said.\nHe also criticized Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican who was appointed by former President George W.
