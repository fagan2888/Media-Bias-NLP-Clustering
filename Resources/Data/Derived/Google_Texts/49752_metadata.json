When data for all four plans are included, premium costs will actually rise on average 20.3 percent next year.\u201d\n\nFor comparison purposes, Obamacare costs in 2015 rose only two percent.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Center for Medicare Services, the entity that oversees Obamacare, miscalculated the degree of price hikes because officials failed to include data for the Bronze, Gold and Platinum plans. They only based estimates using data for the Silver plan, which is what the IRS uses as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d program for tax purposes, the Daily Caller reported.\n\nHere\u2019s the help you\u2019ll need to prepare your household for the realities of living under a centralized health-care system \u2014 order Dr. Lee Hieb\u2019s \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare\u201d\n\nConversely, the 20.3 percent number is the average for all the plans. But it\u2019s only an average, which means some states\u2019 enrollees, like Utah, could see hikes by 45 percent. Illinois residents may see increases by 42 percent; Tennessee residents, by 36 percent, the Daily Caller reported.\n\nPacific Research Institute senior fellow in business and economics Wayne Winegarden told the Daily Caller News Foundation the feds\u2019 7.5 percent price-hike forecast is a \u201cmisleading and a meaningless statistic\u201d that isn\u2019t \u201crelevant to any individual in any state,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Obamacare premium costs are going to surge by 20.3 percent on average in 2016, a massive hike that counters the much more modest 7.5 percent increase predicted by feds.
