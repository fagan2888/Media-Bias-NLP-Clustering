Some people who completed applications late last year \u2014 before the deadline for coverage to begin on Jan. 1 \u2014 are still waiting for insurance cards.\n\nAnd so are those who have signed up for N.J. FamilyCare, the state\u2019s newly expanded Medicaid program, and private policyholders.\n\nThe paperwork chaos has real-world consequences, said insurance agent Susan Goodman, director of group benefits for New Agency Partners in Parsippany.\n\nHer clients report pharmacies don\u2019t know how much to charge for prescriptions, hospitals are asking for credit cards upon arrival and pre-certifications for special services can\u2019t be obtained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly, truly a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nDavid Vasquez, a 49-year-old diabetic, has been paying hundreds of dollars for his medicine and hopes to be reimbursed, but he\u2019s putting off seeing a doctor until he receives his insurance card.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been postponing that because if I walk in with a card, it\u2019s 20 bucks, but if I walk in without a card, it\u2019s $300,\u201d said Vasquez, who lives in New York but is insured through his South Hackensack employer. \u201cI\u2019m hoping they get their collective act together in the next few weeks, because it\u2019s torture.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of New Jersey residents have successfully obtained insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The state Medicaid program has added more than 82,000 residents to its rolls and the insurance companies have issued insurance cards, though they won\u2019t say how many.\n\nBut thousands of others are still waiting \u2014 waiting for an insurance card, and waiting on hold and on the computer for answers.\n\n\u201cWe have maintained increased staffing levels and operating hours to help us quickly resolve claims, authorization, billing and enrollment questions that have accompanied what is an unprecedented transition for the industry and health insurance consumers,\u201d said Tom Vincz, a spokesman for Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. \u201cWe are working closely with state and federal regulators, members, brokers and community organizations to implement health care reform and make the ACA work.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, what should have been routine renewals of private policies \u2014 those having nothing to do with Obamacare \u2014 have been delayed as well.\n\n\u201cI am still trying to get bills straightened out for January 1 renewals,\u201d said agent David Oscar, a Fairfield-based agent who manages 120 policy renewals a month.\n\n\u201cThe insurance carriers were clearly not prepared,\u201d said Oscar, who is also the spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters. \u201cI can\u2019t blame them fully because I don\u2019t think they got all the guidance they required.\u201d\n\nCarriers didn\u2019t set their rates until the end of November, and didn\u2019t get final approval from the state until December, which compressed the time left to process renewals, he said.\n\n\u201cThere was no way on God\u2019s green earth they could\u2019ve gotten it done by December,\u201d he said.\n\nAetna spokeswoman Susan Millerick said its backlog was due to unexpected growth in its small business category. \u201cAs a result, we had to redeploy resources to address a surge in the last few months,\u201d she said. That included moving employees to the Northeast to help get new customers enrolled.\n\nConsumers who feel they can\u2019t wait can contact the state Department of Banking and Insurance.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t get their insurance card and can\u2019t get treated, they should call us,\u201d said Marshall McKnight, department spokesman. The complaint hotline is (800) 446-7467 or online.\n\n\n\nThe Record contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@river','@starledger','health-news','obamacare'", "title": "Widespread backlog roils NJ health insurance market", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Widespread backlog roils NJ health insurance market \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/widespread_backlog_roils_nj_health_insurance_market.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/obamacareappjpg-84e56afbb4bd0187.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12414716\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-13T10:18:23Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"health-news\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/13955093-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "A backlog in the health insurance pipeline has left some consumers without crucial proof-of-insurance cards.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@OBrienLedger"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, March 13, 2014,  6:18 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/obamacareappjpg-84e56afbb4bd0187.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "A backlog in the health insurance pipeline has left some consumers without crucial proof-of-insurance cards.", "title": "Widespread backlog roils NJ health insurance market", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/widespread_backlog_roils_nj_health_insurance_market.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, March 13, 2014,  6:15 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "A backlog in the health insurance pipeline has left some consumers without crucial proof-of-insurance cards."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a6a\"", "article_summary": "But thousands of others are still waiting \u2014 waiting for an insurance card, and waiting on hold and on the computer for answers.\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t get their insurance card and can\u2019t get treated, they should call us,\u201d said Marshall McKnight, department spokesman.\nThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act has clogged the system for nearly all types of health insurance in New Jersey, causing frustration and delays for consumers, agents and policyholders say.\n\u201cThe insurance carriers were clearly not prepared,\u201d said Oscar, who is also the spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters.\nSome people who completed applications late last year \u2014 before the deadline for coverage to begin on Jan. 1 \u2014 are still waiting for insurance cards."}
