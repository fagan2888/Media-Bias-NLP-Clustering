Pernessa Seele, founder and CEO of The Balm in Gilead, talked with Qcitymetro about her upcoming Healthy Churches 2020 conference, which arrives in Charlotte Nov. 4.\n\nComing to Charlotte: A health conference with a focus on churches\n\nBy Glenn Burkins\n\nA Virginia organization with a faith-based focus on health in the African American community is bringing a national conference to Charlotte November 4-6 at the Hilton Charlotte University Place.\n\nPernessa Seele, founder and CEO of The Balm in Gilead, said the Healthy Churches 2020 conference is designed for congregational leaders who oversee health ministries, kitchen ministries and other health-related ministries.\n\nShe spoke with Qcitymetro about the three-day event and why she believes church leaders must become more proactive in promoting healthy lifestyles. Some of her comments were edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nQ. What is Healthy Churches 2020?\n\nHealthy Churches 2020 is our national conference. It is the only faith-based and public health conference created to bring church folks together to address health issues. It is a conference where health professionals and doctors come together to talk to people in our congregations who run the health ministries, members of the kitchen ministries, missionaries, deacons, people who are active in outreach, to give them the skills and information and resources to be able to help our folks in the community.\n\nQ. Why focus on churches?\n\nIn the African American community, the church is a central organization. It\u2019s where we mobilize our community. It\u2019s a central community in which we disperse information. When we look at the tremendous burden of health on the African American community \u2013 whether its diabetes, whether it\u2019s hepatitis C, or whether it\u2019s breast cancer or prostate cancer \u2013 we just have an overwhelming incidence of just about every disease you can imagine. So we\u2019re asking our churches to really get serious about helping their members and the community about addressing health issues. We as a people are having untimely deaths, and we must stop. We must work together.\n\nQ. Are you seeing churches stepping up to do that?\n\nAbsolutely. The Balm in Gilead, we\u2019ve been around for over 26 years, and we have been involved in helping establish over a thousand health ministries throughout this country. I can look at a church like Grace Baptist Church up in New York that has over 44 physicians in that church. But we also have churches out there in Yemassee, South Carolina, that may not have ministries like that, but they have someone \u2013 I always call her Sister Mary \u2013 who is always going out helping the sick and shut-in, trying to send information out on diabetes prevention. We want every church, in big ways and small ways, to be able to educate that congregation and that community about health issues.\n\nQ. How old is this conference?\n\nThis is our second year. We\u2019re doing workshops on mental health, because our churches must be able to address mental health. We have a workshop on emergency preparedness, making sure our churches and the people in our churches have a toolkit and are prepared for the next emergency that is coming. We have workshops on nutrition. And one of the things that I\u2019m excited about\u2026the American Heart Association is providing a free CPR-certification class.\n\nQ. How will this year be different than last year?\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a few things, but we\u2019ve also expanded the conversation. This year we\u2019re breaking up men and women \u2013 men go one way, and women go another way for a couple hours \u2014 to address issues in the privacy of womanhood or the privacy of manhood, to talk about those issues that we sometimes don\u2019t want to talk about in front of each other. We have a doctor and a preacher who will be talking with the men about men\u2019s health. At the same time, on the women\u2019s side, we\u2019ll have the Rev. Dr. Renita Weems and Dr. Linda Bradley, who is a physician out of the Cleveland Clinic and is an expert on fibroids and menstrual disorders.\n\nFor more information or to register, visit the conference website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Healthy Churches 2020 conference will be in Charlotte Nov. 4-6 at the Hilton Charlotte University Place.", "og": {"site_name": "Q City Metro", "description": "The Healthy Churches 2020 conference will be in Charlotte Nov. 4-6 at the Hilton Charlotte University Place.", "title": "Coming to Charlotte: A health conference with a focus on churches - Q City Metro", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://qcitymetro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Taking-back-community-march-1-1.jpg", "height": 853}, "updated_time": "2015-10-21T18:10:37+00:00", "url": "http://qcitymetro.com/2015/10/20/coming-to-charlotte-a-health-conference-with-a-focus-on-churches/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://qcitymetro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Taking-back-community-march-1-1.jpg", "description": "The Healthy Churches 2020 conference will be in Charlotte Nov. 4-6 at the Hilton Charlotte University Place.", "card": "summary", "title": "Coming to Charlotte: A health conference with a focus on churches - Q City Metro"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 548063915340770}, "article": {"section": "Faith", "tag": "Pernessa Seele", "published_time": "2015-10-20T18:27:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-21T18:10:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Coming to Charlotte: A health conference with a focus on churchesBy Glenn BurkinsA Virginia organization with a faith-based focus on health in the African American community is bringing a national conference to Charlotte November 4-6 at the Hilton Charlotte University Place.\nIt is the only faith-based and public health conference created to bring church folks together to address health issues.\nPernessa Seele, founder and CEO of The Balm in Gilead, said the Healthy Churches 2020 conference is designed for congregational leaders who oversee health ministries, kitchen ministries and other health-related ministries.\nPernessa Seele, founder and CEO of The Balm in Gilead, talked with Qcitymetro about her upcoming Healthy Churches 2020 conference, which arrives in Charlotte Nov. 4.\nSo we\u2019re asking our churches to really get serious about helping their members and the community about addressing health issues."}
