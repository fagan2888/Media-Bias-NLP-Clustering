REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\n4885824\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee passed a resolution Wednesday in an effort to rein in rampant executive overreach \u2014 a measure done largely in response to President Barack Obama\u2019s overuse of executive orders.\n\nThe resolution creates a task force to study executive overreach and ways to reduce it. Many in Congress believe the measure will be the first step to restoring power to Congress after a slew of contentious executive orders from Obama.\n\nIn a Monday USA Today editorial, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte pointed to Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration and his efforts to prevent Congress from gaining access to documents pertaining to the Fast and Furious scandal as executive overreach. He also blasted Obama because he has \u201cdelayed the Obamacare employer mandate unilaterally, essentially stopped the enforcement of our immigration laws, provided quasi-legal status to unlawful immigrants, and released terrorists from Guantanamo Bay without notifying Congress as required by law.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte said the overreach is bipartisan, predating Obama, and includes former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\u2019s abuse of prosecutor discretion on immigration.\n\nThe chairman of the task force will be Republican Congressman Steve King and the ranking minority member will be Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen . Goodlatte called the growth of executive power a \u201ctroubling trend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, however, presidents of both parties have aggrandized their power and usurped Congress to legislate from the Oval Office,\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement. \u201cThis is not a partisan issue; it\u2019s an American issue and touches the very core of our system of government.\u201d\n\nSend tips to [email protected].
