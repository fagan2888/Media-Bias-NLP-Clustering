Officers were originally called to the complex to investigate a man suspected of stalking a young teenage girl. The girl's mother called police to report the man had been seen at the complex several times in the recent past.

When officers arrived they found Griffith sitting in a vehicle. After determining Griffith did not live at the complex, police detained him while they searched his car. During the search, officers found what appeared to be an improvised explosive device.

Police say Griffith told them he had a "bomb" in his car. Officers evacuated three apartment buildings near the vehicle, the surrounding parking lot and closed the 1100-1500 blocks of Hefner Road while they investigated the device.

The OCPD Bomb Squad responded and deemed the device as dangerous. Bomb Squad technicians remove the explosive device from the suspect's vehicle and transported it to the OCPD Bomb Range for destruction.

Griffith lives at the Britton Crossings Apartments on Britton Road, about four miles away. The OCPD Bomb Squad checked his apartment for additional explosives as a precautionary measure.

Griffith was arrested on complaints of manufacturing an explosive device, first degree burglary, second degree burglary, assault and battery, possession of burglary tools and indecent exposure.

The Cottages apartment complex released a statement concerning the incident.
