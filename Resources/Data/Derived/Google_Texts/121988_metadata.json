The program is now in its 30th year, and treated its 5000th recipient earlier this June.\n\nThe two men had established an email correspondence a year after the transplant, but it was still an overwhelming experience to see each other in the flesh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some things that just leave you speechless and for me to be speechless is pretty amazing,\u201d Pence told WNCN.\n\nAnd while Lasiter, a one-time Marine and present-day firefighter, has had plenty of experience with saving lives, it was still an unique opportunity he was presented with.\n\n\u201cBeing a firefighter, I\u2019ve helped many people through the course of my career. I\u2019ve never had the chance to see it all the way until the end and see how much of an impact something very specific I had done would actually impact someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Lasiter, who originally signed up as a potential donor through the organization Be The Match because a colleague\u2019s relative was in need of a transplant. Though he wasn\u2019t a match for that person, he did turn out to be one for Pence.\n\nThough the two men may never see each other again, they both feel that their shared journey will forever entwine them together, with Pence calling them \u201cblood brothers,\u201d a sentiment that Lasiter can\u2019t help but agree with.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely become blood brothers, literally,\u201d he said. \u201cThis bond that\u2019s been found here is going to be unbreakable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bone, marrow, donation, cancer, survivor, meets, man, who, saved, his, life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A leukemia survivor finally gets to meet the man who saved his life with a blood marrow donation four years ago.", "title": "Cancer Survivor Meets The Man Who Saved His Life: 'We're Blood Brothers' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/bone-marrow-donation-cancer-survivor-meets-man-who-saved-his-life-352380", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/13/bone-marrow-donation-cancer-survivor-meets-man-who-saved-his-life.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A leukemia survivor finally gets to meet the man who saved his life with a blood marrow donation four years ago.", "title": "Cancer Survivor Meets The Man Who Saved His Life: 'We're Blood Brothers' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/bone-marrow-donation-cancer-survivor-meets-man-who-saved-his-life-352380", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/13/bone-marrow-donation-cancer-survivor-meets-man-who-saved-his-life.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/13/bone-marrow-donation-cancer-survivor-meets-man-who-saved-his-life.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-13T16:27:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-13T16:48:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A leukemia survivor finally gets to meet the man who saved his life with a blood marrow donation four years ago."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9efb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s some things that just leave you speechless and for me to be speechless is pretty amazing,\u201d Pence told WNCN.\nThough he wasn\u2019t a match for that person, he did turn out to be one for Pence.\nThe program is now in its 30th year, and treated its 5000th recipient earlier this June.\nThe two men had established an email correspondence a year after the transplant, but it was still an overwhelming experience to see each other in the flesh.\n\u201cBeing a firefighter, I\u2019ve helped many people through the course of my career."}
