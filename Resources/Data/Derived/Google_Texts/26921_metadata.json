GOP House and Senate leaders will make a big push soon to try to work out a two-year compromise with the White House before the Christmas recess.\n\nNone of the measures are part of the permanent federal tax code and therefore must be renewed every year or two. For that reason, they are called tax \u201cextenders,\u201d although they could be viewed more colorfully and perhaps more accurately as generous gifts in wrapping paper under the Christmas tree. Congress last handled this chore in December 2014.\n\nThese tax rules range in quality from the very serious \u2013 such as business research and development tax credits and tuition fee reductions -- to the frivolous or even ridiculous, including tax breaks for NASCAR track owners and write-offs for film and television producers.\n\nThe one thing they all have in common, however, is that they aren\u2019t paid for. As much as Republican and Democratic members of Congress wring their hands over the federal deficit and the massive national debt, when it comes to the many billions of dollars in revenues lost to the tax extenders, they are more than happy to add it to the nation\u2019s credit card. A Senate version of a new two-year extenders bill approved last summer would increase the deficit by $87 billion over the coming decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Already Making Next Year\u2019s Tax Season More Confusing\n\nJust like spending on the war in Afghanistan, Iraq and now Syria, lawmakers don\u2019t bother to try to find offsetting cuts in entitlement programs or other tax provisions to make their exercise \u201cbudget neutral\u201d \u2013 a source of consternation to many government spending watchdog groups such as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\n\u201cWe should be reforming the tax code to make it more competitive, not simply extending tax breaks year after year,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cWith debt already at record high levels, it is absolutely the wrong time for policymakers to pass tax cuts that further add to the debt.\u201d\n\nOne of the budget organization\u2019s pet peeves is with the so-called \u201cbonus depreciation,\u201d an incredibly costly measure that the government used several times during the Great Recession but that seems superfluous and extravagant since the recovery.\n\nThe bonus depreciation allows businesses to write off 50 percent of the cost of capital investments immediately while the rest is deducted more gradually over time. Between 2008 and 2014, the bonus depreciation has cost the Treasury roughly $200 billion, including interest, and it will cost even more if it is reauthorized retroactively for the 2015 tax year.\n\nRelated: The Next Debt Crisis Could Be Much Worse than 2013, GAO Warns\n\nYet Republican lawmakers have even bigger plans for the bonus depreciation. They want to make it permanent, along with the research and experimentation tax credit, a favorable expensing provision for small businesses, certain charitable deductions and a deduction for state and local taxes.\n\nIf the bonus depreciation is made permanent, the Committee on a Responsible Federal Budget warns it would cost overall nearly $450 billion through 2025. The other tax breaks made permanent would drain the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars more in just the next couple of years.\n\nThe White House and congressional Democrats are resisting such a move, according to Washington policy experts familiar with the talks. The Democrats are threatening to block making those business tax breaks permanent unless the Republicans also agree to enhance the benefits under the Earned Income Tax Cred and Child Tax Credit and make them permanent as well.\n\nMillions of working families each year claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC), which have helped lift 31.7 million people above or closer to the poverty line in 2013. However, adults without children and non-custodial parents have been left out, and the Democrats are seeking changes to correct that and other problems. According to some estimates, converting the two credits to permanent measures would cost roughly $100 billion over the coming decade.\n\n\u201cSaving these provisions deserves bipartisan support,\u201d wrote Bryann DaSilva of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cPolicymakers are expected to try to permanently extend several corporate tax breaks before year\u2019s end. As they consider which expiring tax provisions to make permanent, they should accord top priority to these important EITC and CTC provisions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the holiday season upon us, Congress and the White House are once again", "title": "Congress Prepares Huge Tax-Break Giveaways for 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/30/Congress-Prepares-Huge-Tax-Break-Giveaways-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_Uncle_Sam_Handout_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/30/Congress-Prepares-Huge-Tax-Break-Giveaways-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_Uncle_Sam_Handout_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "With the holiday season upon us, Congress and the White House are once again", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "None of the measures are part of the permanent federal tax code and therefore must be renewed every year or two.\nMillions of working families each year claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC), which have helped lift 31.7 million people above or closer to the poverty line in 2013.\n\u201cPolicymakers are expected to try to permanently extend several corporate tax breaks before year\u2019s end.\nRelated: The Next Debt Crisis Could Be Much Worse than 2013, GAO WarnsYet Republican lawmakers have even bigger plans for the bonus depreciation.\nThe other tax breaks made permanent would drain the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars more in just the next couple of years."}
