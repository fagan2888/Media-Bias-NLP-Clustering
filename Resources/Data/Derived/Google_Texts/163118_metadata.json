Aerotron, a UK-based aviation services firm, in its petition has said that Mallya\u0092s airline owes it a sum of Rs 37 crore, or $6 million.\n\nAerotron is among several companies that have filed winding-up petitions in the Karnataka High Court against the airline. The airline, which has been grounded for more than a year, in a submission to the court has estimated its assets to be worth a little less than Rs 612 crore including the Mumbai headquarters.\n\nThe court has also continued the stay order against State Bank of India taking possession of the company headquarters, the Kingfisher House, giving the airline a few more weeks in it attempts to revive the carrier. The court has reserved its judgment on the petition for another day.\n\nSBI had moved the magistrate court in Mumbai to take possession of the building under the Sarfaesi Act, but KFA obtained a stay order on grounds of ongoing due diligence and other technicalities.\n\nThe Karnataka High Court, in a separate case, in November, had admitted a winding-up petition filed by BNP Paribas against United Breweries (Holdings) Ltd , laying claim to an amount of $26.63 million under corporate guarantee, which the company had not paid. UBHL is the holding company of the UB Group, to which Kingfisher belongs.\n\nMallya during the company\u0092s annual general meeting in September had claimed that he was in talks with a foreign investor and a decision on this would be reached in 90 days.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A UK-based firm, in its petition has said Mallya's airline owes it a sum of Rs 37 crore, or $6 million.", "author": "fe Bureau", "og": {"site_name": "The Financial Express", "description": "A UK-based firm, in its petition has said Mallya's airline owes it a sum of Rs 37 crore, or $6 million.", "title": "Setback for Vijay Mallya as court accepts Kingfisher Airlines winding-up petition", "url": "http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/setback-for-vijay-mallya-as-court-accepts-kingfisher-airlines-windingup-petition/1204343", "image": "http://static.financialexpress.com/pic/uploadedImages/mediumImages/M_Id_446617_Kingfisher_Airlines.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Last-Modified": "Sat Dec 07 2013. 13:26 hrs", "keywords": "Vijay Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines, Kingfisher Airlines winding-up, UB Group, United Breweries Holdings, UK aviation firm, Aerotron, Karnataka High Court, Sarfaesi Act", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Setback for Vijay Mallya as court accepts Kingfisher Airlines winding-up petition\",\r\n                \"link\": \"http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/setback-for-vijay-mallya-as-court-accepts-kingfisher-airlines-windingup-petition/1204343\",\r\n                \"image_url\": \"http://static.financialexpress.com/pic/uploadedImages/mediumImages/M_Id_446617_Kingfisher_Airlines.jpg\",\r\n                \"type\": \"post\",\r\n                \"post_id\": \"1204343\",\r\n                \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-07T13:26:22+05:30\",\r\n                \"section\": \"Latest News\",\r\n                \"author\": \"fe Bureau\",\r\n                \"tags\": [\"Vijay Mallya\",\"Kingfisher Airlines\",\"Kingfisher Airlines winding-up\",\"UB Group\",\"United Breweries Holdings\",\"UK aviation firm\",\"Aerotron\",\"Karnataka High Court\",\"Sarfaesi Act\"]\r\n               }", "news_keywords": "Vijay Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines, Kingfisher Airlines winding-up, UB Group, United Breweries Holdings, UK aviation firm, Aerotron, Karnataka High Court, Sarfaesi Act"}, "article_summary": "In another setback to liqour baron Vijay Mallya, the Karnataka High Court on Friday admitted a winding-up petition filed against Kingfisher Airlines Ltd , seeking liquidation of the carrier.\nAerotron is among several companies that have filed winding-up petitions in the Karnataka High Court against the airline.\nAerotron, a UK-based aviation services firm, in its petition has said that Mallya\u0092s airline owes it a sum of Rs 37 crore, or $6 million.\nThe Karnataka High Court, in a separate case, in November, had admitted a winding-up petition filed by BNP Paribas against United Breweries (Holdings) Ltd , laying claim to an amount of $26.63 million under corporate guarantee, which the company had not paid.\nThe court has reserved its judgment on the petition for another day."}
