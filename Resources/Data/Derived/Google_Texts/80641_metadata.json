Although Cyrus and her record label hoped to unveil the full-length video today (December 26), someone decided to release the video ahead of schedule.\n\nHowever, you shouldn\u2019t point the finger of blame directly at Miley Cyrus. The singer swears she\u2019s not responsible for the leak. In fact, the former Hannah Montana star is downright angry that a sneaky individual beat her to the musical punch.\n\n\u201cWe all know Smilers would break another record if it wasn\u2019t for the f*** face who leaked my video. All good! Keep smiling,\u201d Cyrus recently tweeted.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t feel the need to watch the clip, the \u201cAdore You\u201d video finds Miley Cyrus writhing around under sheets while filming herself with a handheld camera. The singer also pretends to masturbate, something that will surely send countless viewers to VEVO when it officially arrives later today.\n\nPutting together extremely provocative clips for her songs is precisely how the singer generates so many views these days. \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d which finds Cyrus swinging from the titular object while completely naked, is easily this year\u2019s most popular music video. As of this writing, the clip has over 437 million views.\n\n\u201cAdore You\u201d is the third single from the singer\u2019s latest album Bangerz. Considering there\u2019s a significant amount of buzz brewing for the tune at the moment, chances are the official music video will generate millions of hits by the time years comes to a close.\n\nGiven the clip\u2019s sexual nature, a fair amount of controversy is sure to follow its release. Both \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d and \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d raised eyebrows and caused pearl-clutchers to shake their heads in disapproval. \u201cAdore You\u201d will no doubt follow in their footsteps.\n\nCurious to see what all the fuss is about? Check out the leaked video below. Since the clip is definitely a little raunchy, viewer discretion is strongly advised.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only reason Miley Cyrus has made headlines in recent days. The singer recently came under fire from quite a few folks after wearing a fur coat during her appearance at the Jingle Ball in Miami. The questionable attire also made an appearance during a show in Washington D.C.\n\nWhat do you think about the video for Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cAdore You\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Miley Cyrus isn't very happy that someone leaked the highly-anticipated \"Adore You\" music video ahead of its official release.
