This week: the death and legacy of Philip Seymour Hoffman, the new Congressional Budget Office report about Obamacare and employment, and Obama's combative Super Bowl interview on Fox.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman died on Sunday of an apparent heroin overdose, at the age of 46. Hoffman was one of the great actors of our era on both the stage and the screen. How can we make sense of his legacy and his death?\n\nIt will always be easier to make sense of Hoffman\u2019s legacy than of his death. This tragic loss doesn\u2019t fit the Kurt Cobain/Jim Morrison \u2014 or James Dean/Heath Ledger \u2014 template of a brilliant (and glamorous) young performer self-destructing or being struck down, leaving behind a relatively brief and stunted career and reveries of what might have been. Hoffman was not a romantic heartthrob. He was the same age as David Foster Wallace, and like Wallace, left behind a mature, epic-sized canon of such variety and complexity that it\u2019s hard to fathom how he could produce it while wrestling with such vicious and debilitating demons. The Internet Movie Database lists 63 film appearances. And what\u2019s remarkable is that even the small and early roles \u2014 especially those in Scent of a Woman, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and the incomparable Boogie Nights \u2014 are as indelible as his Oscar and post-Oscar star turns.\n\nAudiences will always be able to revisit those Hoffman achievements. What will be lost to memory, sadly, is his nearly as voluminous and no less prodigious stage work. Such was his dedication to the theater that he made the time to serve for a while as the artistic director of an Off-Broadway company, the LAByrinth, for which he also acted and directed. His remarkable appearance in the 2000 Matthew Warchus production of Sam Shepard\u2019s True West \u2014 in which he and John C. Reilly alternated in the very different roles of the play\u2019s fractious siblings \u2014 was as much of a feat as Mark Rylance\u2019s current Shakespeare double-header. And then there was Death of a Salesman just two years ago. At 44, Hoffman was young for the role on paper, but not on stage, where his Willy Loman was \u201ctired to the death\u201d down to his core. I saw this Mike Nichols production early in its run and at the last performance, and it was amazing to see how much Hoffman had kept working in the interim, adding details and layers of sadness and neurosis to a characterization that had seemed to be fully realized at the start. It\u2019s mind-boggling to imagine anyone doing Willy Loman eight times a week, let alone at this level, playing in a Broadway-size house, while fighting addiction. But it was all there, and it was quintessential Hoffman. Loman is a failure on every front \u2014 an inattentive and insensitive father, a philandering husband, a failed breadwinner. And yet you love him anyway and follow him into the depths of his inner ruins, and then mourn deeply when, in the end, he kills himself.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office released a report on Tuesday in which it estimated the Affordable Care Act would reduce the workforce by over two million full-time positions by 2024. Republicans, of course, jumped on the report as evidence of the law's failure, and Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin went so far as to dub the report the law's \"Waterloo.\" How concerned should Obamacare's supporters be?\n\nWhat the CBO actually said was that more than two million workers would choose to leave their jobs precisely because of the law\u2019s success: If you have affordable care, and can\u2019t be denied insurance because of a pre-existing condition, you may want to leave a job, or cut back in hours, if you are staying in that job mainly to get employer-based health-care that Obamacare renders obsolete. Of course the Republicans immediately distorted what the CBO was saying to portray it as evidence that the law is a \u201cjob killer,\u201d and even worse, they were aided and abetted in this ruse by the so-called liberal media, which garbled what the CBO said. Even the Times had to yank and then run a correction for its inaccurate original homepage headline, \u201cHealth Law to Cost Millions of Jobs, Federal Study Projects.\u201d (The replacement headline was: \u201cHealth Law Seen As Leading to Two Million Fewer Workers.\u201d)\n\nNone of this has any effect on the implementation or future of Obamacare itself. It\u2019s just the latest chapter in the Republicans\u2019 political strategy to make Obamacare the main bogeyman in the 2014 midterms. That effort may well succeed in the short term if the law\u2019s successes are not real and pervasive by November. As a political matter, the Affordable Care Act still has to overcome the lousy rollout and the president\u2019s bogus statement that no one would lose their existing health-care plans. But the GOP has not begun to address what happens after 2014, when it no longer has Obama and Obamacare to run against, and when its own cupboard of achievements and policies is revealed to be bare. In the long term, the most consequential piece of political news over the past 24 hours was not the CBO ruckus, but Mitch McConnell\u2019s declaration that immigration reform is an \u201cirresolvable conflict.\u201d The longer the GOP stays its course on immigration and remains the xenophobic party, the more its prospects shrink in national elections.\n\nLast week, you wrote about the waning influence of Fox News. On Super Bowl Sunday, President Obama was interviewed by Bill O'Reilly and declared the anchor's treatment of him \"unfair.\" (For good measure, Hillary Clinton tweeted that she was happy to see \"someone else being blitzed & sacked\" on Fox \u2014 she meant Peyton Manning, not the president.) Would the Democratic Party's two most prominent figures have risked those statements four years ago? And what does their combative approach to Fox News say about them and the network?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s stipulate that the interview was pointless, serving mainly to rile up the political bases of both men while generating no actual news (now and never the point of Fox News in any case). O\u2019Reilly simply repeated his party\u2019s usual talking points (Benghazi, IRS, Obamacare). As I wrote in my piece, liberals, the president included, would be better off just letting Fox rant on to its self-selected audience: a paltry average viewership of a bit over one million in prime time, with a median age of 68 \u2014 a virtually all-white retirement community that will vote Republican no matter what, often in red states and districts that are safely Republican in any event. To let O\u2019Reilly sit in front of a White House backdrop elevates him in a way unmerited by his \u201cjournalism.\u201d But what was good about the interview was that Obama manifestly didn\u2019t take him seriously and brushed off his fisticuffs sardonically. The president came off as dignified, O\u2019Reilly as a cranky, disrespectful bull in the White House china shop.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton, there\u2019s a whole other issue involved. As Gabriel Sherman reminds us in his new biography of Roger Ailes, she let Rupert Murdoch, Fox News\u2019s proprietor, give her a fundraiser in 2006. So when Hillary Clinton, the prospective presidential candidate of 2016, publicly mocks Fox News on Twitter, it\u2019s yet another of her attempts to repackage herself for the Democratic base by de-accessioning her past concessions to the right on a myriad of issues, much as she tried and failed to airbrush her support of the Iraq War in 2008.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "How can we make sense of his legacy and his death?", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "How can we make sense of his legacy and his death?", "title": "Frank Rich on the National Circus: What Philip Seymour Hoffman Left Behind", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/frank-rich-what-phillip-seymour-hoffman-left-us.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/02/02/02-hoffman-obit.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How can we make sense of his legacy and his death?", "creator": "@frankrichny", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/02/02/02-hoffman-obit.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Frank Rich: What Philip Seymour Hoffman Left Us", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national circus, philip seymour hoffman, obamacare, politics, frank rich, fox news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national circus,philip seymour hoffman,obamacare,politics,frank rich,fox news", "published_time": "2014-02-05T17:22:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Frank-Rich/328892397158914"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national circus, philip seymour hoffman, obamacare, politics, frank rich, fox news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c95\"", "article_summary": "Philip Seymour Hoffman died on Sunday of an apparent heroin overdose, at the age of 46.\nThis week: the death and legacy of Philip Seymour Hoffman, the new Congressional Budget Office report about Obamacare and employment, and Obama's combative Super Bowl interview on Fox.\nEvery week, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich talks with contributor Eric Benson about the biggest stories in politics and culture.\nHoffman was one of the great actors of our era on both the stage and the screen.\nIt\u2019s just the latest chapter in the Republicans\u2019 political strategy to make Obamacare the main bogeyman in the 2014 midterms."}
