The Tampa Tribune reported Sunday morning that Sidney Resmondo, a senior at the University of South Florida, was crowned Miss Tampa 2015 on Saturday at the 69th Annual Miss Tampa Scholarship Pageant.

The pageant took place near the university at the Moroccan Palace Theatre at Busch Gardens. Resmondo received the crown from Miss Tampa 2014, Katy Sartain.

Sidney Resmondo was selected from a field of 14 contestants in the pageant, and along with the title of "Miss Tampa 2015," she will receive a $5,000 scholarship. She isn't stopping here either, as she'll go one to compete in the Miss Florida Scholarship Pageant.

If she wins that, of course, she could move on to compete in the Miss America Pageant.
