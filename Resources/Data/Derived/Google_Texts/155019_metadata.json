Much of the fine art now is housed in the Cafesjian Center for the Arts in Armenia, and more than 900 pieces of jewelry were auctioned in Chicago in April, a collection worth $1.8 million . But his huge collection of lapidary art, minerals and gems \u2014 valued at at least $1 million \u2014 is now in Denver, being prepared for sale in September by Leslie Hindman Auctioneers.\n\nThe collection of more than 700 pieces arrived last month in a pair of box trucks from the West Publishing Co. executive\u2019s Florida home.\n\nCafesjian had a staff dedicated to crating and shipping his valuable objects, and so they arrived immaculately packed, said Alexander Eblen, the auction house\u2019s natural history director.\n\nCafesjian began his career as a legal editor for West Publishing and rose through the ranks. He retired in 1996, when the legal publishing and research company was sold to Thompson Publishing.\n\nEblen spent more than a week unpacking and assessing the objects, which include gems and minerals from places like South Africa, Brazil and Colorado, and elements of what he described as a \u201cpretty stupendous\u201d menagerie of stone carvings.\n\nManaging and sorting such a large and diverse collection is chaotic. Packing materials mingle with photo equipment in the Chicago-based auction house\u2019s Cherokee Street office. Boxes are stacked along nearly every wall, from its front entrance to the loading dock.\n\nIn one crate, there\u2019s an eagle carved from a single piece of ruby weighing some 50 pounds. Elsewhere, there\u2019s a realistic falcon made from agate and perched on a copper base, and a pink morganite sea turtle mounted on a piece of clear quartz.\n\nThere are about 200 pieces like them, Eblen said, including a large number of works by some of the world\u2019s best lapidary artists in Idar-Oberstein, Germany.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is just the quantity of the single-owner collection, the diversity of it, some of the crazy, fantasy pieces that can be made from these pieces,\u201d said Annie McLagan, one of two auctioneers handling the sale. \u201cIt\u2019s startling.\u201d\n\nThe collection includes unusual raw gem specimens, some collected from Colorado, and a 500-pound amethyst geode cut to serve as a coffee table.\n\nThe auction \u2014 held in person and online Sept. 15 \u2014 will be previewed during the Denver Gem & Mineral Show Sept. 12-14. The show is one of the world\u2019s largest, said James Hagadorn, geology curator for the Denver Museum of Nature & Science.\n\nBetween 5,000 and 10,000 come to the show at Denver Mart each year, inspiring a pair of secondary shows and other sales, Hagadorn said. Each year, sellers convert hotel rooms into makeshift showrooms, making it a week-long event. The size of the show \u2014 one of the three largest in the world, Hagadorn said \u2014 speaks to the size of Colorado\u2019s collecting community.\n\nMetro Denver alone has eight gem and mineral clubs, and it\u2019s one of the largest such communities in the world, Hagadorn said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown and grown and grown,\u201d Hagadorn said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as big as the Stock Show, but in 10 more years, it might be.\u201d\n\nColorado ranked No. 8 in the nation for gemstone mining in 2011, worth $440,000, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Foreign stones are brought here, too, to be processed, Hagadorn said.\n\nAnd, he said, mining is embedded in the state\u2019s history: It led to Denver\u2019s founding, helped lead Colorado to statehood and drove people to the mountains.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re full of minerals, they\u2019re full of rocks and they\u2019re full of fossils,\u201d Hagadorn said. \u201cThere are phenomenal specimens that have been coming out of these mountains for 100 years.\u201d\n\nThad Moore: 303-954-1902, tsmoore@denverpost.com or twitter.com/thadmoore", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cafesjian gem collection worth more than $1M to be sold in Denver", "title": "Cafesjian gem collection worth more than $1M to be sold in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/04/cafesjian-gem-collection-worth-more-than-1m-to-be-sold-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704__20140706_K1_BZ06GEMSp2.jpg", "height": 506}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704__20140706_K1_BZ06GEMSp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-04T19:44:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:44:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbea\"", "article_summary": "The auction \u2014 held in person and online Sept. 15 \u2014 will be previewed during the Denver Gem & Mineral Show Sept. 12-14.\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown and grown and grown,\u201d Hagadorn said.\nBefore he died in September at age 88, Gerard Cafesjian amassed a huge collection of art, jewelry and gems.\nMetro Denver alone has eight gem and mineral clubs, and it\u2019s one of the largest such communities in the world, Hagadorn said.\nThe show is one of the world\u2019s largest, said James Hagadorn, geology curator for the Denver Museum of Nature & Science."}
