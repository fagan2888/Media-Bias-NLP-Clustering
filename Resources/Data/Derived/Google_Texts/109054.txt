Jared Leto, accidental holy man and unlikely fashion icon, has received a much-needed beard trimming thanks to Jimmy Fallon. The “Tonight Show” host, who has just the right amount of hair-cutting experience (that is, none), brandished an electric razor and held it to the actor’s face against his will. Leto, though visibly concerned, was a pretty good sport through it all. Fans of the beard can rest assured, however, that Fallon didn’t take much off.
