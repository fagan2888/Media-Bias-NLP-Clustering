Phone and email communication were not included in the report.\n\nThe president reportedly held 277 private meetings with 16 other Cabinet secretaries from March 23, 2010, to Nov. 30, 2013, though not with Sebelius, who was tasked with implementing his signature legislative achievement.\n\nAnd here\u2019s something else: The official White House calendar doesn\u2019t even list an official meeting between the president and Sebelius, according to the Government Accountability Institute, because the White House calendar only goes back as far as July 12, 2010. So the organization had to look to the Politico calendar to find any trace of an official face-to-face meeting between Obama and Sebelius.\n\nThe institute \u201canalyzed the entirety of the Politico calendar from March 23, 2010 to November 30, 2013 and found a single mention of an April 21, 2010 joint meeting between Obama, then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Sebelius.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nIn the midst of healthcare.gov\u2019s disastrous rollout, Obama said he was \u201cnot informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services immediately responded to TheBlaze\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama apparently met officially with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius just once in the nearly four years leading up to the Oct. 1 launch of the Obamacare website healthcare.gov, according to an analysis by the conservative Government Accountability Institute.
