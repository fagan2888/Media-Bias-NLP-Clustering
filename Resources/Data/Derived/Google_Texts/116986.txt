WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — The Screaming Eagle Invitational was held Saturday at Ashley High School. This event featured a marching band competition for high schools bands from across the Carolinas.

Due to weather only 9 out of the 14 high school marching bands that signed up were able to competed for the top title.

Bands performed in five class sizes and was judge by music, visual, and general effect captions.

Ashley High School Band Director Robert Parker says one of their goals is to have good scores.

“Winning is a really fun thing, but I call it shiny plastic”, said Parker. “It’s the secondary portion of it. The assessment that we get is what really matters to us. We take that assessment and make ourselves better from that.”

This event was aligned with the North Carolina Bandmasters Association as an official North Carolina State Sanctioned event.

Parker says the money raised at the event will help buy instruments, travel expenses, and variety of other things with the band program.
