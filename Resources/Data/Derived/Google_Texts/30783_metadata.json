Because Texas mandates that individual plans must cover applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy, other parents of autistic children have made a similar choice. But many of those families are facing difficulties finding adequate coverage in 2016.\n\nThe Maupins chose a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan, which covers some of the cost of doctors and hospitals that don\u2019t have contracts with the insurer. Since they opted for an out-of-network therapist, that meant higher out-of-pocket payments, but the plan\u2019s partial coverage made the intervention therapy affordable, and their son began to make strides.\n\n\u201cHe went from a 2-year-old speaking three words, a kid we thought was significantly delayed, to a kid with normal language who is cognitively ahead,\u201d Maupin said of her son.\n\nBut 2016 brought some major changes to the individual marketplace and they don\u2019t have the same option this year. Most major insurance carriers in the state have done away with PPO plans and have replaced them with options that provide no coverage for out-of-network care, such as HMOs. Insurers said the move came after heavy losses from large numbers of high-cost enrollees buying individual plans and a shortfall in payments expected from the government.\n\nThe new, narrower networks often mean families are losing access to therapists and providers they have used for their autistic children.\n\nMany Texas providers, from neurologists to behavioral therapists who treat autistic children, are not part of the HMO plans. These insurers often do offer waivers if there are no providers in network within a reasonable distance, but many parents have said the waiver process is complicated and contentious.\n\nMultiple Therapists And Doctors\n\nWhile every autistic child has different treatment needs, many autistic children rely on multiple providers for occupational therapy, speech therapy and applied behavioral analysis. Providers licensed for that therapy may charge anywhere from $60 to $150 an hour. Because the ABA is evidence-based and has been linked to gains in social function and IQ, autism advocates have successfully lobbied to mandate its coverage through individual insurance plans in the District of Columbia and 43 states, including Texas.\n\nEmployer plans generally do not come under the states\u2019 requirements to cover expensive autism therapies, so families often choose to buy individual plans for their children in those states. Insurers say that trend is among the factors driving up their outlays in marketplace business.\n\n\u201cThe cost of individuals enrolling on the market far exceeded expectations,\u201d said Clare Krusing, director of communications for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a national trade group. \u201cWhat compounds the problem is that some co-ops failed as well, so plans had to take on the risk associated with new enrollees.\u201d\n\nKrusing said that another blow to insurance companies was a drastic reduction in expected federal payments as part of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s premium stabilization program. That is supposed to help insurance carriers for several years during the health law transition, in part by transferring funds to individual marketplace insurance plans that are not making money.\n\n\u201cPlans will receive 13 percent of what they were owed,\u201d Krusing said. \u201cEvery plan is impacted by that shortfall and has had to reevaluate their participation in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe problems have been big in Texas. \u201cTexas is particularly problematic for the insurance companies in terms of losses,\u201d Justin Boulet, an insurance broker in Houston who works with families with special-needs children, wrote in an online forum. \u201cThe individual insurance market in Texas is suffering traumatic financial loss that is completely unsustainable long term.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, one of the carriers that eliminated its PPO marketplace plans, was candid about the decision.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, our individual policies just weren\u2019t sustainable,\u201d Dr. Dan McCoy, chief medical officer for the company, said in a video addressed to customers posted online Dec. 4. \u201cWe experienced significant financial losses \u2026 if we continued to offer the individual PPO, we\u2019d have to raise those rates as well as the rates for all of our individual plans. Our competitors are facing the same dilemma \u2026 in fact, no one is offering a broad individual PPO anywhere in Texas anymore.\u201d\n\nSince the release of McCoy\u2019s video, at least one carrier, Humana, did offer a broad individual PPO plan in some Texas counties. But the costs associated with that plan are high \u2014 an out-of-pocket maximum of $25,800 for out-of-network providers \u2014 which makes it unaffordable for many families.\n\nAnd all these changes come at a time when more children than ever \u2014 1 in 45 \u2014 are being diagnosed with autism.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Pretty Drastic\u2019\n\nFor Carol Markes, a Dallas-area parent who bought her autistic son an individual PPO marketplace plan in 2015, the changes in the marketplace plans meant suddenly losing access to her son\u2019s general neurologist, the neurologist that deals with his epilepsy and his primary care doctor \u2014 all providers who had been in network.\n\n\u201cMy husband is an independent corporate contractor and I substitute teach when I\u2019m not at home because of my son\u2019s many issues,\u201d Markes said. \u201cWe simply cannot lose all his doctors! This is crazy!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty drastic,\u201d Lee Spangler, vice president of medical economics for the Texas Medical Association, said of the insurance company changes. \u201cThe ACA says a carrier can\u2019t turn someone down for a preexisting condition. But these new narrow networks \u2014 that\u2019s the new medical underwriting.\u201d\n\nMany parents say they will find ways to adjust. Markes and her husband opted to buy a small group plan for his business that would cover their son\u2019s providers. That means their insurance costs will increase by 35 percent in 2016, but it also means all of their son\u2019s doctors are in network.\n\nOther parents, like Dallas residents Jill Albright Briesch and her husband, have decided to simply pay out of pocket for certain therapies. For Jill Briesch that also means picking up more work as a CPA to cover the bills for her two sons, Alexander and William, both of whom are on the autism spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve absorbed $1,100 a month in in-home ABA,\u201d Briesch said. \u201cOur speech therapist is out of network, and we just pay her.\u201d\n\nBriesch knows that her family is lucky to be able to make that kind of decision; many cannot.\n\n\u201cTexas is a very difficult state to live in if you have a child with autism and you\u2019re not really rich, or really educated,\u201d Briesch said.\n\nShe also lamented that the current policies are short-sighted. \u201cEarly intervention saves hundreds of thousands of dollars on the back end by improving [autistic] people\u2019s life functionality,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can get even 25 percent of them to function as normal adults, you\u2019re saving money. If they end up needing 24/7 supervision, the state doesn\u2019t even want to know how expensive that will be.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering healthy policy issues at the federal and state level.
