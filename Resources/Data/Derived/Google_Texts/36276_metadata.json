Apparently, its current bull, which is used for recruiting purposes at events, is in rough shape and in desperate need of an upgrade.\n\nBut due to \u201cdifficulties with the contracting process and insufficient funds\u201d (thanks, Congress!) the Guard was cowed into delaying the purchase and will \u201cmake do with the old one,\u201d Lt. Col. Hank McIntire said. He added that he was unsure why the GSA\u2019s website still had the posting up.\n\n\u201cThe National Guard was interested in a bull a few months ago, but they\u2019ve tabled it, Meier said. \u201cI suspect it was because of this whole shutdown\u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re carelessly buying these bulls while the government is shut down.\"\n\nBully for them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A handful of news outlets are falsely reporting that the U.S. Army purchased a mechanical bull seven days into the government shutdown.", "title": "Army\u2019s Bull Story Turns Out to Be Bulls#!t", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/09/Army-s-Bull-Story-Turns-Out-Be-Bullshit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10092013_Mechanical_Bull.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/09/Army-s-Bull-Story-Turns-Out-Be-Bullshit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10092013_Mechanical_Bull.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A handful of news outlets are falsely reporting that the U.S. Army purchased a mechanical bull seven days into the government shutdown.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa28\"", "article_summary": "A handful of news outlets are reporting that the U.S. Army purchased a mechanical bull seven days into the government shutdown.\n\u201cThe National Guard was interested in a bull a few months ago, but they\u2019ve tabled it, Meier said.\n\"To the best of my knowledge, we have not sold these bulls to the Army,\u201d Christopher Meier, national sales consultant for Mechanical Bulls Sales, Inc, said.\n\u201cPlus, ours cost way less than that.\u201dThe National Guard of Utah was in the market for a new mechanical bull earlier this summer and initiated the contract process in July.\nApparently, its current bull, which is used for recruiting purposes at events, is in rough shape and in desperate need of an upgrade."}
