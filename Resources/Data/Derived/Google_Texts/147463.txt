Fire crews battling a wildfire for several days in Barber County were able to keep the fire from spreading overnight Friday into Saturday.

The Anderson Creek Fire began Tuesday night in Woods County, Oklahoma before spreading into Comanche and Barber Counties. The fire has scorched nearly 325 square miles in both states, the majority of the devastation in south-central Kansas.

The Barber County Sheriff's Office said Saturday morning crews contained the perimeter, giving patrols the opportunity to look for hot spots and protect structures. However, estimates still put the fire at about 15 percent contained in Barber County and 100 percent contained in Comanche County.

During the Kansas Adjutant General's visit to Barber County on Friday, it was announced he will be ordering National Guard helicopters to assist with firefighting efforts. Four Black Hawk helicopters arrived in Medicine Lodge Saturday morning.

Officials continue to monitor the overall damage in the county and are trying to determine if the damage estimates meet or exceed the threshold necessary to qualify for a FEMA Disaster Declaration that would provide public assistance for damaged public infrastructure.

Any donations should be directed through United Way's 211 system.

Barber County officials are expressing their thanks to those who have taken the time out of their own lives and from their families to assist in the Anderson Creek Fire incident.

“It is very humbling to see the outpouring of donations, resources, and individual’s time coming into this community,” said Gaten Wood, Barber County Attorney. “Your help is really appreciated!”
