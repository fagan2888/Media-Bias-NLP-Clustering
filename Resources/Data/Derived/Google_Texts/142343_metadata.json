As part of his pitch last week for prison reform, President Obama told the NAACP national convention that \u201cwe should not be tolerating rape in prison, and we shouldn\u2019t be making jokes about it in our popular culture.\u201d (Photo: AP)\n\nAs part of his pitch last week for prison reform, President Obama told the NAACP national convention that \u201cwe should not be tolerating rape in prison, and we shouldn\u2019t be making jokes about it in our popular culture.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. Those who are incarcerated are wards of the state and thus the responsibility of the public. Known and pervasive sexual violence inside prison walls is on us as a society. But what has been done to end the problem?\n\nIn 2009, the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission reported its finding that sexual abuse in our nation\u2019s prisons is \u201cwidespread,\u201d and that there is a general public attitude that sexual abuse is \u201can expected consequence of incarceration\u201d and \u201cpart of the penalty.\u201d At some federal prisons, as many as 15.7 percent of the inmates are raped. For minors in juvenile detention, the rate of abuse is even higher, at approximately 20 percent.\n\nThe commission put the number of sexual abuse cases in prison at 60,500 a year, but more recent estimates peg the number of victims at more than 200,000 annually. Whatever the real toll is, rape is underreported in the prison system because guards and administrators cover up the problem, and inmates threaten more violence against anyone who snitches.\n\nCongress and the White House condemn the problem, but enforcement of tougher standards to protect prisoners is lacking.\n\nIn 2003, Congress passed a law imposing financial penalties on states that do not take concrete steps to reduce prison rape. It took nine years for the Justice Department to issue guidelines for better monitoring and reporting inside prisons, but penalties for failure are weak.\n\nStates that are not in compliance only risk losing 5 percent of federal funds they would receive for their prisons, and even that penalty can be appealed. Only two states are in compliance, 41 are working on it, and seven have opted out altogether. Fines have totaled a little over $2 million.\n\nAnother barrier to ending prison rape is the reality that half of reported prison assaults are perpetrated by prison personnel.\n\nThe prosecution acceptance rate for sexual misconduct by federal prison officials is a low 49 percent. The Justice Department has refused to act on a major provision recommended by the commission that would set up a framework to ensure cooperation between prosecutors and prison officials in investigating cases.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, yet there is evidence that prison rape may be growing instead of becoming rarer.\n\nThe national commission concluded that more top-down leadership was needed to address the culture of prison rape, and that new policies need to be based on \u201czero tolerance with teeth.\u201d It\u2019s great that Obama is speaking up about prison rape, but he also has the power to act. He should be held accountable for what happens in the next 18 months.\n\nBrett M. Decker is a director at the White House Writers Group.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://oshko.sh/1MQoQsR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "President Obama told the NAACP national convention that \u201cwe should not be tolerating rape in prison, and we shouldn\u2019t be making jokes about it...\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Northwestern Media", "description": "President Obama told the NAACP national convention that \u201cwe should not be tolerating rape in prison, and we shouldn\u2019t be making jokes about it...\u201d", "title": "America\u2019s prisons remain rife with rape", "url": "http://www.thenorthwestern.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/07/26/americas-prisons-remain-rife-rape/30699787/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thenorthwestern.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama told the NAACP national convention that \u201cwe should not be tolerating rape in prison, and we shouldn\u2019t be making jokes about it...\u201d", "title": "America\u2019s prisons remain rife with rape", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7fc561e73666c499b63691ac665953f7b2ce250/c=419-0-1809-1390&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/26/Oshkosh/B9318166776Z.1_20150726142109_000_GU0BEM976.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@onwnews", "site": "@onwnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883770549", "fb": {"app_id": 167919243249397}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "rape, prison, Obama"}, "article_summary": "Another barrier to ending prison rape is the reality that half of reported prison assaults are perpetrated by prison personnel.\nIn 2003, Congress passed a law imposing financial penalties on states that do not take concrete steps to reduce prison rape.\nThe Constitution guarantees freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, yet there is evidence that prison rape may be growing instead of becoming rarer.\nIt took nine years for the Justice Department to issue guidelines for better monitoring and reporting inside prisons, but penalties for failure are weak.\nKnown and pervasive sexual violence inside prison walls is on us as a society."}
