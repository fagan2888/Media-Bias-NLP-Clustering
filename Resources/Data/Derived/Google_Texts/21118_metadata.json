But those ideas have lost their political support, because of their supposed lack of success in the Obama era. Meanwhile, left-leaning economists are proposing new ideas to supplement Obama\u2019s economic policies, but they have little political support.\n\nIn a paper for the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities\u2019 Full Employment project, created by Jared Bernstein, the former chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden, Larry Summers argued that the United States is experiencing \u201csecular stagnation.\u201d Under secular stagnation, the economy can only grow at an adequate pace if it is artificially boosted by the creation of unsustainable financial bubbles. Without them, economic growth is meager and the economy fails to reach full employment. The solution to secular stagnation is significant rounds of fiscal stimulus to fill the still-large hole in consumer demand for goods and services, known as aggregate demand. But after the first stimulus failed to produce the promised results\u2014mainly because nearly every economist severely underestimated the magnitude of the financial crisis\u2014stimulus has become a dirty word among Washington Democrats. Republicans would answer any calls for additional stimulus with fear-mongering about the deficit. Given the public\u2019s continued concern about the debt, the politics play in the GOP\u2019s favor.\n\nA separate paper, from left-leaning economist Dean Baker, argues that the trade deficit is a significant impediment to full employment. U.S. imports exceeded exports by $500 billion in 2013\u2014that is, $500 billion of American demand for goods and services supported jobs overseas. In response, Baker proposes lowering the value of the dollar and cracking down on currency manipulators like China who artificially lower the value of their currency so that their goods and services are cheaper, boosting exports. Yet, trade policy is not an exciting or accessible issue to most voters. A candidate could include it as part of their economic platform, but it cannot form the backbone of it.\n\nBernstein and Larry Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, have both proposed a monetary policy regime that prioritizes low unemployment along with low inflation. Given the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence from the federal government, though, it\u2019s hard to imagine how better monetary policy could become a focal point of a campaign, as it hardly energizes voters. \u201cYou are basically getting at the fundamental problem for Democrats in terms of their economic agenda, in terms of the relationship between what they can run on and what they can actually do,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cThe public is not Keynesians or anything close to it. They don\u2019t understand the relationship between spending, debt and growth. And, therefore, it\u2019s the hardest sell.\u201d Republicans, as the minority party, can simply promise a change from the Democratic agenda, regardless of voters\u2019 understanding of their actual economic proposals.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee\u2014presumably Hillary Clinton\u2014will have to fashion an economic agenda that overcomes this problem. Bernstein believes that a collection of the above policies, along with popular Obama-era ones like increased infrastructure spending, could appeal to voters.\n\n\u201cI see absolutely no reason why a candidate couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t run on a full employment agenda,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cMaybe those aren\u2019t the right words. I\u2019m not a pollster. The idea that the absence of a robust job market that helps channel the benefits of growth fairly to the middle class strikes me as important. I don\u2019t see why that couldn\u2019t be the core of an effective campaign.\u201d In other words, Democrats will have to convince voters that much of the Obama agenda is still the right prescription for the economy, despite the weak results over the past five-plus years. That\u2019s not easy.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans will have a policy agenda that seems substantial and is untested. Whoever the GOP nominee is for 2016, their economic platform will almost certainly contain spending and tax cuts along with a deregulatory plan\u2014the same policies they have supported throughout the Obama presidency. As the minority party, the GOP does not need to change that platform, and it might just appeal to voters if Democrats can't find a better way to sell their economic ideas.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Amid all the midterm hoopla over Benghazi, the IRS and Veterans Affairs scandals, and Obamacare, it\u2019s easy to forget that presidential elections are mostly defined by the economy.
