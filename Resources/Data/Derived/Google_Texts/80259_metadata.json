According to a report by Research and Markets , the global market for telehealth and telemedicine will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 14% through 2018. In dollar terms, that means growing from a 2011 valuation of $13.2 billion to $32.5 billion.Where might the next growth spurt occur? It could be telepharmacy.Telepharmacy is the practice of performing medication order verification from a remote setting.\u201cIt\u2019s really a cognitive process that a pharmacist goes through, especially in a hospital or an acute care setting, to make sure that a script that has been written has been reviewed for drug-drug interactions, for potential allergies, or for a variety of other dosage levels,\u201d explains Brian Roberts, CEO of PipelineRx , a provider of cognitive medication management services.In other words, a safety net for physicians.PipelineRx launched 5 years ago by focusing on rural and community hospitals that typically need pharmacy care at night and on the weekends when prescription volumes drop. As Roberts asks, rhetorically, \u201cDoes it make sense for a small hospital running on a small budget to have a pharmacist sitting there for $90 to $100 an hour and be sub-optimized in terms of their work flow?\u201dEasy question to answer. So, what telepharmacy does is use a single telepharmacist working from home, from a secure HIPAA location, who can be monitoring anywhere from 4 to 6 hospitals at one time. It\u2019s labor sharing because the 4 or 5 hospitals can divvy up the cost of the telepharmacist, thereby saving the small and/or rural hospital significant dollars.The idea is catching on. Roberts says that telepharmacy is growing north of 20% a year. And he expects that trend to continue as technology continues to improve.\u201cTechnology is so much better now, you can move those scripts into pipeline servers to get read by a remote pharmacist.\u201dFor doctors rounding on their patients and writing scripts in the hospital, expert pharmacy care is now available 24/7. Physicians can be confident that their scripts are being reviewed.\u201cThere are all sorts of studies showing that when we\u2019re in there, the safety and cost savings being generated are somewhere in the nature of about 80% of our costs,\u201d Roberts explains.In addition to protection/oversight for physicians, Roberts says the turnaround time in reviewing scripts if faster. He says the average time it takes a hospital to read a prescription, get it down to the pharmacy, and have the medication delivered to a patient\u2019s room is upwards of 20 minutes.\u201cSometimes as great as an hour.\u201dThe average time using a telepharmacist is 8 minutes. Reducing the turnaround time is beneficial for patients because it enables small and rural hospitals to drive quality standards. It\u2019s also beneficial to the small or rural hospital that no longer has to pay a full-time pharmacist to either be on duty or be on call.\u201cThe hospital is able, if it chooses not to employ that night or weekend pharmacist, to save anywhere between 30 and 70 percent of its labor costs.\u201dIt\u2019s also beneficial for physicians because the quicker turnaround time results in improved workflow. But there are additional benefits.\u201cPhysicians are able to work more efficiently, and their patients are better taken care of, so potentially fewer lawsuits, another factor,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cOur telepharmacists are at home, they have 3 computer screens up, they\u2019re working in our software, and they\u2019re linked to all the hospitals they\u2019re working with. So that physician who is rounding knows that if there\u2019s any kind of question, pick up the phone, and there\u2019s one dialed number that immediately routes to our pharmacist on duty.\u201dRoberts expects the growth of telepharmacy to continue. PipelineRx has doubled its number of telepharmacists every year since its inception 5 years ago. And the introduction of its SAAS product, Software As A Service, gives hospitals even more flexibility and opportunities for savings.\u201cWe repurpose our PipelineRx software so that it\u2019s now a client-facing software product,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome hospitals want to start their own telepharmacy business using their own pharmacists, and we\u2019re providing the technology for them to do that. In an era where there\u2019s a lot of hospital consolidation, hospitals are able to reap cost savings without compromising any clinical quality. We\u2019re very excited about that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The emerging telepharmacy industry promises small and rural hospitals the same safeguards and protections of an in-house pharmacist, but at a lower cost.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "The emerging telepharmacy industry promises small and rural hospitals the same safeguards and protections of an in-house pharmacist, but at a lower cost.", "title": "Telepharmacy Benefits Physicians, Small and Rural Hospitals", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/physicians-money-digest/columns/financial-health-check-up/01-2015/telepharmacy-benefits-physicians-small-and-rural-hospitals", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/pillshandcomputer.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "telemedicine, telehealth, telepharmacy, efficiency, savings, value, small hospitals, rural", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d64\"", "article_summary": "Reducing the turnaround time is beneficial for patients because it enables small and rural hospitals to drive quality standards.\nIt\u2019s labor sharing because the 4 or 5 hospitals can divvy up the cost of the telepharmacist, thereby saving the small and/or rural hospital significant dollars.The idea is catching on.\n\u201cSome hospitals want to start their own telepharmacy business using their own pharmacists, and we\u2019re providing the technology for them to do that.\nIn an era where there\u2019s a lot of hospital consolidation, hospitals are able to reap cost savings without compromising any clinical quality.\nSo, what telepharmacy does is use a single telepharmacist working from home, from a secure HIPAA location, who can be monitoring anywhere from 4 to 6 hospitals at one time."}
