Concern over an Ebola breakout in the U.S. is spreading like the flu in winter. Unlike the Ebola situation, where little is known, flu season is approaching, and it will extract a price for employers.

Each flu season is distinct. The Centers for Disease Control says there's no way to predict what the 2014-2015 flu season will bring, but it does offer steps to limit the toll it will take. Vaccination is highly recommended by the CDC.
