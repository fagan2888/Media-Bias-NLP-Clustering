So, in urban areas, you could actually cover very significant portions of the population. And so, it won\u2019t work for everything; you know, we\u2019re not gonna deliver kayaks or table saws this way. These are electric motors, so this is all electric; it\u2019s very green, it\u2019s better than driving trucks around.\n\nWhile the idea sounds revolutionary, the hitch for those in the D.C. area is that Amazon doesn't have any fulfillment centers within 10 miles.\n\nIn October, the retailer announced plans to build a 1 million square foot fulfillment center in Baltimore in 2014. That will join the two fulfillment centers in Virginia, in both Chesterfield and Dinwiddie Counties.\n\nWhen you draw circles with a radius of 10 miles from those fulfillment centers, it covers most of Baltimore up through the Towson area, as well as much of the southern half of Richmond. Most of the D.C. Metro area is well outside those boundaries.\n\nPerhaps that is just as well, because drones currently occupy a murky legal territory, but that may change. The FAA is slated to issue new rules governing unmanned aerial systems in 2015. Regardless, that may not matter. The use of drones, even those flown by hobbyists, are banned in D.C.'s restricted airspace.\n\nSo at least for the time being, residents of the District will have to settle for delivery the old-fashioned way.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Chris Chester", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": ".mainpic {\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.caption {\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.photosource {\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAre you within 10 miles of a fulfillment center?\r\n\r\n\r\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos generated a", "title": "Why You Won't Likely See Amazon Drones In The D.C.
