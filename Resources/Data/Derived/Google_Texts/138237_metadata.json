According to a 2012 Gallup poll, 87 percent of Republicans believe the use of birth control is \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d The percentage of Republicans who think it should be legal is certainly higher.\n\nThis compares to 90 percent of Democrats and 89 percent of independents who believe birth control is okay. Given the poll\u2019s margin of error, however, it\u2019s possible there is no difference at all.\n\nThere are statistically significant differences of opinion between the two major parties on abortion, the death penalty, even wearing fur coats. But there isn\u2019t on birth control.\n\nSo if Republican leaders say they want birth control to be legal and rank-and-file Republicans say they have no moral qualms about its use, why does there need to be a plot to convince people to believe what is clearly true? Republicans support birth control.\n\nLegal birth control isn\u2019t good enough, counter our friends at ThinkProgress. \u201cBut legality isn\u2019t exactly the same as accessibility,\u201d writes Tara Culp-Ressler. \u201cAnd the Hobby Lobby case was about the latter.\u201d\n\nWell, one might quibble that the Hobby Lobby case was about whether the only effective way to make birth control more accessible is to force third parties with religious objections to pay for it.\n\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act \u2014 signed into law by the notoriously prudish and anti-sex reactionary President Bill Clinton \u2014 doesn\u2019t say that religious commitments trump all other considerations. But it does stipulate religious conscience can only be overridden to serve a compelling public interest when no other less coercive means are available.\n\nNevertheless, it is refreshing to see this level of honesty in the contraceptive mandate debate. There has been a lot of loose talk about Republicans wanting to ban birth control. Where Alan Keyes could once run for office without being quizzed about whether he would make contraception illegal, Mitt Romney and Ken Cuccinelli can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSuccessful efforts to limit access to women\u2019s health care services don\u2019t typically result from outright bans,\u201d writes Culp-Ressler. Instead they result from nuns refusing to pay for intrauterine devices. \u201cIn that context, it doesn\u2019t matter that IUDs aren\u2019t technically illegal,\u201d she continues. \u201cIf women don\u2019t have the insurance benefits to make them affordable, they\u2019re still just as far out of reach.\u201d\n\nIUDs are a particularly expensive form of birth control. Because they can theoretically act as abortifacients, they are also particularly controversial. Relatively few people have ever called for banning them, however. Twenty years ago, John G. Schmitz campaigned against IUDs in a Republican primary against Bob Dornan.\n\nDornan, who opposed a ban, won the primary. Schmitz would go on to be kicked out of the John Birch Society for being too extreme.\n\nYou can find the occasional Republican, like this misguided Ohio lawmaker, whose efforts would make it harder to cover birth control. There are many more Republicans like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Colorado Rep. Cory Gardner who want to make birth control cheaper and more accessible by allowing oral contraceptives to be sold over the counter.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u2014 which wasn\u2019t wild about the Hobby Lobby ruling \u2014 has endorsed the idea. It is a good way to use markets to make a product more affordable for women who want it without implicating men and women who don\u2019t.\n\nAnother possibility is separating health insurance from employment, a rare point of agreement between Obamacare supporters and proponents of various free-market reform plans. This would allow women to buy health insurance plans that cover the services they want, regardless of whether they work for Hobby Lobby.\n\nTaken together, free-market health care reform and over-the-counter access to the pill would mean women could get birth control without a permission slip from their government, doctor or employer.\n\nBut to some people, such common-sense solutions are neither as politically advantageous nor emotionally satisfying as pretending Republicans are going to bring America back to the theocratic dark ages of contraceptive access that prevailed during Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nUp next: the GOP\u2019s plot to convince you water is wet and the sky is blue.\n\nW.
