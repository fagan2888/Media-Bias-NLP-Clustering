This time, it involves a small bakery in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nAshers Bakery owners Daniel and Amy McArthur are devout Christians. Their religious conscience was challenged when an LGBT activist asked them to bake a cake with the words \u201cSupport Gay Marriage\u201d above a photo of Sesame Street\u2019s Bert and Ernie, two male roommates on the children\u2019s show whom are often labeled a gay couple. When the Christian managers refused to ice such a cake, Lee sued.\n\nLee\u2019s team suggested his request was nothing more than just a \u201cmechanical process.\u201d Yet, that's now how the McArthurs see it. To them, to honor Lee's request would be a violation of their faith. Daniel said as much:\n\n\"We felt as Christians we could not in conscience put it on a cake. We believe the business is being given to us by God and how we use it is on our shoulders.\"\n\nYet, the court sided with Lee. They found the McArthurs guilty of \"discrimination\" and fined them \u00a3500.\n\nThat's when Captain Jean-Luc Picard (AKA Patrick Stewart) went on Newsnight to voice his support for the Christian family.\n\n\"It was not because it was a gay couple that they objected, it was not because they were celebrating some sort of marriage or an agreement between them,\" said Stewart. \"It was the actual words on the cake they objected to. Because they found the words offensive.\" He continued: \"I would support their rights to say no, this is personally offensive to my beliefs, I will not do it.\"\n\nExactly. Why should a Christian business be forced to comply with a request that makes them uncomfortable? They have every right to not do so.\n\nWe have had our share of Christian companies here in America being pressured to violate their beliefs as well. You may recall the small business Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, was even forced to close up shop when they received backlash and death threats for voicing their support of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act. When The Blaze\u2019s Dana Loesch started a GoFundMe page on their behalf, however, Americans overwhelmingly responded and helped get the business back up and running.\n\nThe McArthurs are also fighting back. Last week, the family announced they would appeal the court's unfair decision.\n\nOne more thing: Lee claimed he felt like a \u201clesser person\u201d when the Ashers denied his request. His overly dramatic reaction seems like another example of the left trying to silence debate by feigning outrage against the \"bigoted\" religious right. My colleagues Guy Benson and Mary Katharine Ham talk about this shameful strategy in their new book \u201cEnd of Discussion,\u201d available for preorder here.\n\nWhatever the court\u2019s decision, it is sure to have a ripple effect across Northern Ireland and the rest of Europe. Hopefully they learn a thing or two from the admirable comeback of Memories Pizza.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not again....05/27/2016 4:41:02AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not again...", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Actor Defends Christian Bakers Who Were Fined for Refusing to Ice a Gay 'Bert and Ernie' Cake", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/06/05/actor-defends-christian-bakers-right-to-opt-out-of-gay-weddings-n2008623", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/270/cd22652c-501f-42ec-9fb5-77ebd6d71bca.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not again...", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Actor Defends Christian Bakers Who Were Fined for Refusing to Ice a Gay 'Bert and Ernie' Cake", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/06/05/actor-defends-christian-bakers-right-to-opt-out-of-gay-weddings-n2008623", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/270/cd22652c-501f-42ec-9fb5-77ebd6d71bca.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Actor Defends Christian Bakers Who Were Fined for Refusing to Ice a Gay 'Bert and Ernie' Cake, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "When the Christian managers refused to ice such a cake, Lee sued.\nWhy should a Christian business be forced to comply with a request that makes them uncomfortable?\nThat's when Captain Jean-Luc Picard (AKA Patrick Stewart) went on Newsnight to voice his support for the Christian family.\n\u2018Star Trek\u2019 actor Patrick Stewart has joined a rare club in Hollywood that has dared to speak out in defense of religious freedom.\nWe have had our share of Christian companies here in America being pressured to violate their beliefs as well."}
