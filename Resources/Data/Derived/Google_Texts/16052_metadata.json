A Senate committee voted Thursday to approve a bill that would ban those plans from covering abortions in the state.\n\nState Senator Judson Hill (R-Marietta) is sponsoring the bill.\n\nThe legislation, S.B. 98, bans any state health plan from covering abortions. It also prohibits federal plans, like those subsidized under the Affordable Care Act, from offering abortion coverage in Georgia.\n\nState leaders have shied away from helping implement the ACA, also known as Obamacare.\n\nWhen asked why the state now gets to have input on the type of coverage offered under the Affordable Care Act, Hill said the issue isn\u2019t about federal and state money.\n\n\u201cIt comes out of the same pocket that I buy groceries from, put gas in my car, pays my federal and state tax bill.\u201d\n\nHill says S.B. 98 is not an abortion bill, but a bill protecting taxpayers from paying for a procedure with which they don't agree.\n\n\"It's nothing to do with whether or not you can have one and the rights to have one or not,\u201d said Hill.\n\nSenator Nan Orrock (D- Atlanta) says this bill is a violation of women\u2019s privacy rights and a part of what she calls \"the war on women.\"\n\n\"Abortion is a medical procedure just like countless other medical procedures,\u201d said Orrock. \u201cIt's a medical decision and it's a decision between a woman and her doctor and what they're doing is singling out this procedure and treating it differently from all other medical procedures.\"\n\nRight now, the State Health Benefit Plan does not cover abortions.\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama signed an executive order outlawing the use of public money to pay for abortions under the Affordable Care Act. Instead, insurance companies must use money from coverage premiums to cover any abortion procedures.\n\nNow that the committee approved the bill, Senate rules will decide when to put schedule the measure for a vote of the full Senate.", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "Georgia Insurance Bill Bars Abortion Coverage", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "More than one 100,000 Georgians are now enrolled in health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
