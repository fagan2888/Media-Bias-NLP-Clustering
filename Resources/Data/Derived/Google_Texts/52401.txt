North Carolina U.S. Senators Richard Burr and Thom Till joined 43 other Senate Republicans Tuesday in defeating an amendment aimed at reducing the bullying of LGBTQ students in the nation’s public schools.

The amendment offered by Minnesota Senator Al Franken was tacked onto to a bill updating No Child Left Behind legislation.

“You cannot learn if you dread going to school,” reasoned Franken.

Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander worried the proposal would only spark more costly lawsuits, and Franken’s amendment failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance.
