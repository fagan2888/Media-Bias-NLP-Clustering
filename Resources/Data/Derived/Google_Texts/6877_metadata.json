I think the show had become a talking shop that raked over the cold embers of what had gone on the previous week. The one-on-one conversation belongs to a decade ago.

While the network still has a ways to go, she was able to retain Matt Lauer at \u201cToday,\u201d despite the drama at the morning program in recent years, and also helped boost the ratings for Brian Williams\u2018 nightly newscast (also a success, with a 6 percent increase in viewership).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chuck-Todd-and-David-Gregory-Meet-the-Press-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Jordan Zakarin", "description": "Deborah Turness hopes to revive the struggling Sunday talk show", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "Deborah Turness hopes to revive the struggling Sunday talk show", "title": "NBC News President Plans 'Meet the Press' Overhaul, Says Show Needs 'More Edge'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chuck-Todd-and-David-Gregory-Meet-the-Press.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-08-25T08:26:22+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/nbc-news-president-plans-meet-the-press-overhaul-says-show-needs-more-edge/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Deborah Turness hopes to revive the struggling Sunday talk show", "title": "NBC News President Plans \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 Overhaul, Says Show Needs \u2018More Edge\u2019", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/nbc-news-president-plans-meet-the-press-overhaul-says-show-needs-more-edge/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chuck-Todd-and-David-Gregory-Meet-the-Press-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chuck-Todd-and-David-Gregory-Meet-the-Press-340x300.jpg"}, "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-25T14:03:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "NBC News President Plans \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 Overhaul, Says Show Needs \u2018More Edge\u2019", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chuck-Todd-and-David-Gregory-Meet-the-Press.jpg", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Media", "tag": "NBC News", "published_time": "2014-08-25T07:03:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-25T08:26:22+00:00"}, "sailthru.tags": "brian williams,meet the press,nbc news,chuck todd,david gregory,deborah turness", "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.category": "media,tv", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"NBC News President Plans \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 Overhaul, Says Show Needs \u2018More Edge\u2019\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/nbc-news-president-plans-meet-the-press-overhaul-says-show-needs-more-edge\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/08\\/Chuck-Todd-and-David-Gregory-Meet-the-Press-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"332766\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-25T14:03:00Z\",\"section\":\"Media\",\"author\":\"Jordan Zakarin\",\"tags\":[\"brian williams\",\"chuck todd\",\"david gregory\",\"deborah turness\",\"meet the press\",\"nbc news\"]}", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd817c\"", "article_summary": "Deborah Turness hopes to revive the struggling Sunday talk showChuck Todd will take over soon as the new host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d but he\u2019s going to have a lot of company in the spotlight.\nWe need more of a coffeehouse conversation.\u201dAlso read: David Gregory Confirms \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 Exit: I\u2019m Humbled and GratefulTurness, a British journalist who was previously the editor of ITV News, has reason to be optimistic about the coming changes; despite the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d problems, she largely had a successful first year at NBC.\nAlso read: Meet the Press\u2019 Pays Tribute to Ousted Moderator David GregoryAccording to the Times\u2019 story, the program will also add \u201ca regular panel of journalists who will question guests,\u201d making for more of a lively, controversy-courting arena.\nChuck Todd, the political director at NBC News and former host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDaily Rundown,\u201d will replace Gregory in September, but as Turness suggested, that won\u2019t be the only change.\n\u201cThe show needs more edge,\u201d Turness admitted."}
