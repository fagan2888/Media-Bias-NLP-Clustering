She has a remarkable ability to take other people\u2019s stories alongside her own and present necessary narratives that stay with the reader long after finishing the book.\n\nAs part of Salon\u2019s series of year-end conversations with some of the most essential nonfiction voices of 2014, we spoke both over the phone and then by email about everything from Ebola to selfies to tattoos.\n\nYour collection is in so many ways about pain, about how we face and discuss and experience illness and pain. So I\u2019m curious about a story that broke after your book was published: How do you think our country is handling Ebola victims and the medical workers who have traveled overseas?\n\nI was doing an event in Chicago a few days after Craig Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola \u2014 after returning from his work for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 and all of New York was going crazy and the Internet was publishing maps of where he\u2019d gone bowling in Williamsburg and where he\u2019d eaten a snack and which subway lines he\u2019d ridden. Somebody asked me whether I felt like Americans were showing enough empathy about Ebola. It was something I\u2019d already thought about in relation to the uproar over Spencer \u2014 how sometimes fear can be the enemy of empathy.\n\nIf this man were going through something similar in a faraway place \u2014 i.e., he\u2019d been doing important medical work and had gotten diagnosed with a potentially fatal illness \u2014 people might have respected his bravery. But in this case, many people\u2019s primary reactions had to do with their own proximity to danger. It was striking to me how that sense of fear \u2014 a kind of communal panic \u2014 seemed to trump feeling empathy for him, much less respecting him for the choices he\u2019d made. One of the things we need to push back against in order to access feelings of empathy and understanding can be various kinds of self-concern, fear being one of those.\n\nThat said, to be totally honest and tell on myself, I was also checking which subway lines he\u2019d been riding: had I ridden those lines? I know I\u2019m not immune from the infectious quality of communal fear. I also think our response to Ebola illuminates something abiding and unfortunate \u2014 that we have a harder time caring about suffering when it\u2019s far away.\n\nThere was an outpouring of outrage and pain over the events, and grand jury decisions, in Ferguson and here in New York City with Eric Garner. What\u2019s the role of the writer when it comes to documenting these critically important stories of social injustice?\n\nI think Ferguson is a really important illumination of the different roles that individuals and collective groups can play in responding to social injustice. There\u2019s something absolutely amazing to me about the breadth and depth and expansiveness of the collective action that\u2019s happening in response to Ferguson. Almost every day in New York, I feel like I\u2019ve been in contact with some sort of march. But the police are out a lot more too. I walk by certain corners and they are just six policemen deep. There\u2019s a sense of menace in that heightened presence. But I do think that there\u2019s a power and an articulation that happens with a sheer number of bodies on the street, speaking out.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of work that no single writer can do, because it depends on having that many bodies and that kind of collectivity. But it\u2019s also been a real solace to me to have writers I respect \u2014 Roxane Gay is coming to mind \u2014 offering commentary and reactions to what\u2019s been going on, how we might think about these high-profile events in relation to our everyday lives. \u201cCitizen,\u201d by Claudia Rankine, was also a really important book for me this year in helping me think through how racial tensions and injustice show up everywhere \u2014 not just headline news but ways that are less visible, easier to ignore. So what is the role of the writer in relation to these events? To offer a voice questioning the way that things are being handled. To offer a voice calling attention to the ways people have suffered and the ways that they\u2019re still suffering. The work of the writer has always been about making the invisible visible.\n\nOn a much lighter and more personal note: I\u2019m interested in your thoughts on selfies, especially because you write about the body in such vivid detail in some of your essays and so much of your book incorporates other people\u2019s stories alongside your own. The selfie in a lot of ways is kind of akin to a personal essay. Is there room for self-examination in a non-narcissistic way without bringing oneself into the context of the larger world?\n\nThe idea of being able to represent yourself in a photograph rather than being represented by somebody else; I think there\u2019s a whole realm of possibility in that. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything intrinsically narcissistic or self-involved in the idea of self-representation. It\u2019s like the Internet \u2014 I\u2019m not for it or against it. The question is: How can it be used in an interesting way? When I see selfies that seem directed toward commodifying the self as a sex object or something like that, it\u2019s less that I feel like they are self-involved and narcissistic and more that they seem like missed opportunities. It seems like certain societal expectations or pressures are just being regurgitated by somebody who has internalized those pressures so much that they\u2019re representing themselves through their lens. But I think selfies get interesting when people do them in surprising ways, or use them to surprising effect \u2014 make you feel like you\u2019re sharing a private moment with somebody even though you\u2019re not there and you know it\u2019s an illusion \u2014 that it\u2019s a private moment. It\u2019s artifice and access at once. That\u2019s where the selfie can be a really cool thing.\n\nDefinitely. If you could change one thing about the literary world, what would it be?\n\nI would want the literary world to curate more actively the voices of people who don\u2019t have power or money or access to literary prestige. How can we create an environment where these stories are heard? It\u2019s not an easy question to answer, but it\u2019s an important imperative. Some examples come to mind; there are plenty more out there: I mentor for the PEN Prison Writing program, which pairs up incarcerated writers with mentors who work with them by correspondence. This poet named Mark Nowak did a program with NYC taxi drivers where he had them write their own stories and then hosted a reading. So I think there are all kinds of means by which we can try to create a space for hearing voices that don\u2019t usually get heard. It brings to mind questions about equal representation in media, and disparities in how voices get compensated. Julia Wong has written some powerful and provocative pieces for The Nation about people of color in media, and how voices on Twitter can get appropriated for other peoples\u2019 stories.\n\nBut thinking about making access for voices from various margins \u2014 that\u2019s certainly where my mind goes when I think about how I\u2019d want the literary world to be different: What stories are getting told, and what stories should be getting told, and who should we be listening to, and who aren\u2019t we listening to.\n\nYou\u2019ve participated in a lot of conversations and panels this year while on your book tour. What have you learned from engaging with other writers in front of a live audience?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question. One thing I\u2019ll say is with my first book I did a lot of solo events. It was a very pointed decision this time around: I wanted to do events with other people. There are a couple of reasons for that, but one is that I love the idea of a non-repeatable event. If you have a particular combination of minds or voices, it\u2019s going to create something that\u2019s never happened before and isn\u2019t going to happen again.
