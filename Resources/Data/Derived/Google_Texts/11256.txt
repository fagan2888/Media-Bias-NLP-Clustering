Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee told Martha Raddatz on ABC News’ “This Week” that he’s seriously considering a run for president.

“It’s wide open. Anybody could be a contender,” says @GovMikeHuckabee on the 2016 presidential field.

Huckabee, who left his Fox News show earlier this month, said there is a strong likelihood he’ll enter the 2016 race, and that he’ll clearly state his intentions in the spring.

His previous campaign suffered due to a lack of funding, he said, a problem he hopes he can change in a second race for the White House.

Huckabee didn’t express concern about facing off against powerful Republican rivals such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the GOP’s 2012 nominee.

“It’s wide open. Anybody could be a contender,” said Huckabee. “The voters will make that decision, and that’s the way it ought to be.”

Huckabee also addressed a controversial passage in his new book, “God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,” where he criticizes Beyonce’s “explicit” song lyrics, and her husband Jay-Z as a “shrewd businessman” who exploits his wife “as a sex object.”
