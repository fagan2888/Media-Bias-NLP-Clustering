Virginia, which in 1967 invalidated state laws forbidding miscegenation.\u201d He gets to the heart of the similarity between the two when he notes that in neither case was there any harm done to anyone else from the forbidden marriages.\n\nBut there is one major respect in which Loving differs greatly from Obergefell v. Hodges: Loving was 9\u20130. Obergefell was 5\u20134.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn Loving, no one dissented. In Obergefell, the four dissenting justices wrote four separate dissenting opinions. The judicial opponents of gay marriage were not content to go gently into that good night.\n\nFirst, there is Chief Justice John Roberts, who would want to correct what I just wrote by arguing that he is not an \u201copponent of gay marriage\u201d: He simply wants the issue resolved by the people or their elected representatives in the states. In the Slate Amicus podcast you and I recorded on Friday, Dahlia, I noted that the chief seemed to go out of his way to be respectful of LGBT advocates, noting, for example, that they \u201cmake strong arguments rooted in social policy and considerations of fairness.\u201d You (and others who were actually in the courtroom Friday) tell me that his spoken summary of his dissent sounded more hostile and dismissive than the written opinion.\n\nIn the end, the chief justice\u2019s dissent fails to offer any meaningful response to the simple argument that governmental restrictions on freedom must be justified by a reason\u2014some public harm averted. Roberts doesn\u2019t really provide any list of harms averted. And as Posner points out, what is left when there is no real harm is the possibility of hostility to the rights of others, an impermissible basis for a governmental rule.\n\nThere is, of course, the appeal to \u201ctradition.\u201d But\u2014much like the defenses of the Confederate battle flag we\u2019ve heard this past week, \u201ctradition\u201d and \u201cheritage\u201d come to nothing unless you can show that there is a valuable tradition or heritage worth defending. Gay exclusion alone doesn\u2019t count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf the chief\u2019s written dissent is at least somewhat respectful, the other dissents are markedly not. Reading Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s dissent, I felt as if I had stumbled upon a Fox News war on Christmas special report. He appears to see himself as a rightward version of William J. Brennan, charged with protecting a beleaguered minority from oppression. Alito\u2019s oppressed group is some combination of conservatives; white people; and religious adherents, particularly Christians. I just don\u2019t see it, but he seems genuinely to believe it.\n\nIn an extraordinary passage, Alito writes that the court\u2019s decision \u201cwill be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.\u201d He further asserts that \u201c[r]ecalling the harsh treatment of gays and lesbians in the past, some may think that turnabout is fair play. But if that sentiment prevails the Nation will experience bitter and lasting wounds.\u201d Here, I believe, he really jumps the rails: Does he really mean to equate whatever criticism opponents of gay rights may face in the future with the horrendous, violent persecution of gays and lesbians that is a blight on civilization? If so, as I wrote on Slate in another context a few years ago, he misses the first lesson from Sesame Street: \u201cWhich of these things is not like the others?\u201d\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent seems at times to be less about his hostility toward gay marriage and more about his hostility toward Justice Anthony Kennedy. To be sure, many dissents are sharp in their criticisms of majority opinions. But this is different: Scalia dissents from the style of Kennedy\u2019 s opinion. And he does so in ways that are deeply personal, as he writes that Kennedy\u2019s \u201copinion is couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic\u201d and mocks the \u201cprofoundly incoherent\u201d opinion\u2019s \u201cshowy profundities\u201d and \u201csilly extravagances of thought and expression.\u201d You would think the court is some writer\u2019s boot camp and that it was Kennedy\u2019s misfortune to be assigned to the section run by Professor Kingsfield in One-L.\n\nWhat may be most notable about Scalia\u2019s dissent is the possibility that he is revealing something about the court\u2019s internal deliberations about this case. One of his sharpest barbs is aimed not directly at Kennedy but at the four other justices who joined his majority opinion. Scalia says that if \u201cI ever joined an opinion for the Court that began\u201d with the flowery sentence Kennedy wrote, \u201cI would hide my head in a bag.\u201d But he adds to that a very telling phrase, saying: \u201cIf, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began\u201d that way \u2026 (emphasis added). What work is being done by \u201ceven as the price to be paid for a fifth vote\u201d? Is Scalia suggesting that Kennedy\u2019s vote was still in play and that the court\u2019s four more liberal justices had to let him write whatever he wished as the \u201cprice to be paid\u201d for his fifth vote? I think that would be a slim reed upon which to rest such a conclusion. But there is substantial evidence that Kennedy was not ready to rule definitively in favor a gay marriage just two terms ago, a time when such a decision would have overturned the laws of 44 states.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Loving v.
