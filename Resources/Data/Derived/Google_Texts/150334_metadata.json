The 64-year-old woman, who had suffered from severe depression for 17 years, wanted to be hospitalized to ensure she didn\u2019t drink away her fear of what was planned for the next day.\n\nWhen she awoke, she couldn\u2019t help but think about One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. The Jack Nicholson movie and its gruesome depictions of electroconvulsive therapy ran through her mind as she walked to the basement procedure room to get her own, far more modern version of \u201cshock\u201d therapy in hopes of driving away the depression.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAlmost immediately, she felt better\u2014lighter, happier. She and her husband were able to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary that night in awe of the complete turnaround.\n\nJane Dee, though, was no ordinary patient. She had tried\u2014sometimes unsuccessfully\u2014to keep her history of depression and drug and alcohol abuse out of the public eye during her husband\u2019s political career. Now that her husband was out of office, she had an even bigger secret: shock therapy.\n\nThe couple quickly found that electroconvulsive therapy was massively successful at treating severe depression. But it suffered a huge public relations problem: It developed a horrible reputation in the middle of the 20th century when it was used without today\u2019s patient safety protections, it was stigmatized through pop culture and there was no one willing to talk publicly about its effectiveness.\n\nWithin a few years of that first treatment, Kitty Dukakis\u2014the wife of 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis\u2014decided she didn\u2019t want to be anonymous anymore. Together, Michael and Kitty decided that they had a platform to advocate a medical treatment that, despite its massive image problem, is widely credited with saving lives and setting patients once crippled with depression on the road to happy and productive futures.\n\nIn the process, the Dukakises have found themselves to be the unexpected champions of one of the most controversial and misunderstood\u2014but highly effective\u2014procedures in modern medicine.\n\n***\n\nThroughout Michael\u2019s nearly three decades in elected office, he was the star of the couple. He served a record three terms as governor of the commonwealth of Massachusetts; his one run for the presidency still haunts the Democratic Party as a winnable failure.\n\nBut now, nearly 25 years after he finished his third term as governor, it is Kitty who is drawing the crowds, Michael boasts in an interview with POLITICO in his office at Northeastern University, where he teaches political science. He says he was struck by the role reversal at a fundraising dinner for a Cambridge health care association in April, where they were both given an award for their contributions to universal access to health care and reducing the stigma of mental illness.\n\n\u201cIt was a big crowd; they raised a lot of money and Kitty got a standing ovation for about five minutes,\u201d he explains during an interview this summer in his office, where he sits under a sign advocating for his Massachusetts universal health care bill, which he signed in 1988\u2014decades before Congressional Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. \u201cNot me\u2014I got polite applause. I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s pretty extraordinary.\u201d\n\nKitty does have quite a story to tell. It was during Kitty\u2019s junior year of college, years before she met Michael, that she began sneaking her mother\u2019s \u201cdiet pills\u201d\u2014a 1950s era euphemism for amphetamines, or speed.\n\nThat grew into a two-decade habit that she kept secret through a short-lived first marriage, through meeting and marrying Michael in 1963, through the pregnancies of three children and through four miscarriages. It wasn\u2019t until 1974\u2014shortly before Michael won his first election as governor of Massachusetts\u2014that he stumbled upon the pills and asked her to stop.\n\nShe did stop for a little while, but the addiction quickly and quietly returned. It wasn\u2019t until a successful visit to rehab eight years later that she finally kicked the pill habit.\n\nBut with the pills gone, alcohol slowly began to take their place. That\u2019s not uncommon; mental health experts say many patients with depression subconsciously self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, just like Kitty did.\n\nThroughout her husband\u2019s governorship, she drank but it was rarely problematic. When his 1988 presidential campaign got serious, she turned to alcohol to deal with the pressures of the race. The mounting demands of a campaign and the fear of actually becoming First Lady hit her shortly before the pivotal New Hampshire primary. \u201cI was petrified at the prospect of his winning the Democratic nomination, not to mention the presidency,\u201d she wrote in her 2006 book. She cancelled two trips before the Ohio primary and said she had the flu. Sitting in her house alone, she drank enough to send herself into a stupor.\n\nKitty Dukakis, here in an empty airport in 1988, has a new campaign she's fighting for. | Getty\n\nShe bounced back for the general election, but alcohol was a constant companion on the campaign trail. Her staff was instructed to leave vodka in her hotel room each night after a day of campaigning. She set up a routine: down a single shot, close the bottle and go to bed.\n\nThat measure of control vanished after the crushing, lopsided election defeat. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush won 40 states, having convinced voters that Dukakis was a dispassionate, wonky academic. Two days after Election Day, Michael went back to the Massachusetts statehouse to resume his duties as governor. But Kitty, with her packed campaign scheduled done, began binge drinking. She drank every day, a little more each day.\n\nMore than 25 years later, Michael still remembers the day he came home, searched through their Brookline home and couldn\u2019t find her. \u201cFinally, I went up to the third floor and I saw what looked like was a bunch of rags on the floor,\u201d he says now. \u201cIt was my wife, completely passed out on the third floor. How she got up there?\u2014Jesus, it was horrible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Can he and Kitty lift the stigma from the electric shock treatment that saved her life?", "title": "Michael Dukakis\u2019 Final Campaign", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/dukakis-depression-treatment-campaign-213116", "image": "http://static.politico.com/f1/f9/92b8be2240bc8a360474f9d6a488/http-s3-origin-imagespoliticocom-2013-11-05-14-ap8811090607jpg.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Can he and Kitty lift the stigma from the electric shock treatment that saved her life?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6c9c\"", "article_summary": "Kitty Dukakis, here in an empty airport in 1988, has a new campaign she's fighting for.\nTwo days after Election Day, Michael went back to the Massachusetts statehouse to resume his duties as governor.\n| GettyShe bounced back for the general election, but alcohol was a constant companion on the campaign trail.\nWhen his 1988 presidential campaign got serious, she turned to alcohol to deal with the pressures of the race.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1974\u2014shortly before Michael won his first election as governor of Massachusetts\u2014that he stumbled upon the pills and asked her to stop."}
