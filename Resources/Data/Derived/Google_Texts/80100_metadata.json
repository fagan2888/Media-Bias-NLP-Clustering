I was scared it will fall short.\u201d\n\nTrevor Samson\u2019s 35-yard field goal pulled BYU within 28-27 with 7:57 left, and after Drew Brown missed a 41-yard field goal for Nebraska, the Cougars started their final drive from their own 35. There were 48 seconds to play.\n\nMangum drove BYU to the Nebraska 42 before launching his winning pass against a three-man rush on fourth-and-3.\n\nAs BYU celebrated, a pained Riley raised clenched fists over his head and looked down as his headset slipped backward.\n\nThe Huskers lost their season opener for the first time since 1985, ending the nation\u2019s longest streak.\n\nHill, who drew notice as a possible Heisman Trophy candidate before fracturing a leg in the middle of last season, threw for 268 yards and a touchdown and ran for 72 yards and another score.\n\nHill missed a couple snaps in the first half after running for a 21-yard touchdown and got hurt again early in the fourth quarter with his team trailing 28-24.\n\nMangum, a celebrated recruit out of Idaho, finished 7 of 11 for 111 yards.\n\nNebraska\u2019s Tommy Armstrong Jr. passed for 319 yards and three touchdowns, his last one going 9 yards to Trey Foster for a 28-24 lead.\n\nThis opener was long anticipated by both teams. Riley, who spent the last 12 years at Oregon State, was athletic director Shawn Eichorst\u2019s surprise hire last December after Bo Pelini was fired.\n\nBYU, meanwhile, came in looking to continue raising its profile as an independent and was coming off three wins last year against opponents from Power Five conferences. The Cougars play Boise State at home next week, then play back-to-back road games against UCLA and Michigan.\n\nEach team was without players who were suspended for disciplinary reasons. Among the five missing Huskers were linebacker Michael Rose-Ivey, cornerback Jonathan Rose and tight end Cethan Carter. Among the suspended BYU players were defensive lineman Tomasi Laulile, free safety Kai Nacua, linebacker Sione Takitaki and wide receiver Trey Dye.\n\n___\n\nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org\n\nHugh Johnson: 303-954-1037, hjohnson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/HughJohnsonDP", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tanner Mangum\u2019s Hail Mary TD gives BYU 33-28 win over Huskers", "title": "Tanner Mangum\u2019s Hail Mary TD gives BYU 33-28 win over Huskers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/05/tanner-mangums-hail-mary-td-gives-byu-33-28-win-over-huskers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150905__huskers-byup1.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150905__huskers-byup1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T18:26:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T22:17:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Mangum drove BYU to the Nebraska 42 before launching his winning pass against a three-man rush on fourth-and-3.\nAmong the suspended BYU players were defensive lineman Tomasi Laulile, free safety Kai Nacua, linebacker Sione Takitaki and wide receiver Trey Dye.\nAs BYU celebrated, a pained Riley raised clenched fists over his head and looked down as his headset slipped backward.\nNebraska\u2019s Tommy Armstrong Jr. passed for 319 yards and three touchdowns, his last one going 9 yards to Trey Foster for a 28-24 lead.\nMathews pulled down the winning pass in front of Nebraska safety Nate Gerry and several other defenders just inside the goal line, and the play stood after officials reviewed the play."}
