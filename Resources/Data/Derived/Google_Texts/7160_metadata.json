Today, he wears a realistic-looking myoelectric prosthesis with moveable fingers and thumb, but he still does many things with one hand.\n\n\u201cI just got used to compensating,\u201d said Gerber, now 78 and a pro at buttoning his shirt, doing household chores and typing with one hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t get fitted for a prosthesis for six months after my accident and my first prosthesis was an ugly thing made of wood.\u201d\n\nProstheses have come a long way in the past 50 years. Technology is opening doors to advancements never dreamed possible in the days when Gerber had his accident.\n\nNot only are prostheses more realistic-looking than ever before; they are also much more functional, said Brock Heller, certified prosthetist and orthotist with Hangar Prosthetics and Orthotics, which has several offices in central Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re constantly working on new prostheses that have better range of motion and are much lighter than they used to be,\u201d agreed Georgia Foltz, vice president of the Amputee Support Team of Central Pennsylvania, who lost her leg six inches below the knee after a blood clot in 2003.\n\nAdvances in artificial limbs allow greater function\n\nThe Artificial Limb Program, overseen by the National Academy of Sciences, was established in 1945 to enhance progress in the development of artificial limbs to address the injuries of World War II veterans. Advances in design, materials and surgical methods have increased significantly in the decades since.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of research and advancement going on since the Iraqi-Afghanistan conflict because of all the soldiers coming home with amputations,\u201d said Gary Reinhold, also a certified prosthetist with Hangar.\n\nMore than 1,200 U.S. military veterans lost an arm or leg in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A recent study released by the department reported that the majority of the amputees \u2013 91 percent of lower limb and 80 percent of upper limb amputees \u2013 reported that \u201clife is full.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has a center specifically aimed at improving quality of life for veteran amputees. The Rehabilitation Research and Development Center of Excellence for Limb Loss Prevention and Prosthetic Engineering bring together a team that includes orthopedic surgeons, engineers, rehabilitation psychologists and prosthetists. The center\u2019s prosthetic engineering research team compares existing prosthetic technologies and develops innovative new approaches.\n\nGerber cringes when he thinks of the shoulder straps he wore for years with uncomfortable cables that went under his armpits. By pulling the left arm down, he could pull the cables that would open the prosthesis on his left hand.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Gerber began reading about lightweight, battery-powered options called myoelectric prosthetics that work by placing muscle sensors against the skin. The electric signals generated by the muscle allow the prosthesis to move. Gerber was anxious to try it.\n\n\u201cFirst, we had to see if I had enough muscle power in my arm to be able to use it. Thankfully, I did,\u201d he said. \u201cTo open the hand, I have to push my muscles up and to close it, I have to push my muscles down. I had to learn how to do that, but now I just do it naturally.\u201d\n\nLimb loss not uncommon\n\nMore than 500 amputations are performed daily in America, adding up to more than 180,000 amputations each year, according to the Amputee Coalition. Nationwide, some 2 million Americans are amputees.\n\nDiabetes is the leading cause of amputation, followed by traumatic injury and cancer, according to the Amputee Coalition.\n\nCosmetically speaking, improvements to prostheses have made them hardly noticeable at a glance. Silicone covers can be made that are identical to the amputee\u2019s real leg or arm -- freckles, hair and all.\n\nProstheses have also gotten much lighter and easier to control, Heller said. Carbon-coated prosthetics store energy as weight is put on them and then return the energy to make moving faster and easier for the amputee.\n\nComputer technology is also allowing prostheses to \u201cthink\u201d in a way.\n\nFor example, a microprocessor knee, known as a C-leg, Leg is programmed by the prosthetist using a laptop as the patient walks to fine-tune gait and stride. Sensors then recognize which walking phase the user is in and the C-leg automatically adjusts itself.\n\nBionic knees, run by gears that flex and extend, can actually allow an amputee to walk up steps normally, step over step.\n\nThe i-Limb, a bionic hand, has fin\u00acger \u201cjoints\u201d that flex and bend like natural fingers. Each finger has an individual motor powering it, en\u00achancing dexterity and allowing pa\u00actients to grasp round objects and shake hands.\n\nWith the higher technology, however, comes a higher price for the prosthetics, which can cost upwards of $50,000, Heller said. The Affordable Care Act will cover prostheses as an essential health benefit; however specifics are still being nailed down.\n\nDetermination, positive attitude necessary for success\n\nAs great as the technology is, it takes practice to learn to use the prosthesis, Heller said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just put it on and go. It\u2019s our job to fit you properly and make you as comfortable as possible, but you should figure on doing physical therapy and occupational therapy to learn to use your prosthesis properly,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, it takes a lot of practice to learn to open and close the hand at the right grip and strength for what you want to do.\u201d\n\nGerber knows the difficulties well. The first time he tried to change the battery in his hearing aid, he smashed the earpiece to bits because he couldn\u2019t get the grip to relax. Today, he laughs as he tells the story.\n\nOne necessary ingredient for success hasn\u2019t changed through all the years of advancements \u2013 attitude.\n\n\u201cI remember telling my mother, \u2018Mom, I know this is serious, but I know it is not going to ruin my life,\u2019\u201d said Gerber, who worked in his family\u2019s upholstery business for 12 years, enjoyed 30 years of success in the insurance business and now sells furniture at the Bon-Ton in Camp Hill.\n\n\u201cI see the cup as half full, not half empty. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m anything extra special, but I knew immediately that I wasn\u2019t going to sit in the corner sucking my thumb about it.\u201d\n\nStill, Gerber doesn\u2019t mean to make light of the hard work it took to accommodate his life to his limb loss.\n\nIn the summer afternoons before school began in the fall of \u201952, Gerber spent hours working with his former first-grade teacher, learning to grasp a pencil with his left hand and coax out legible letters, words and sentences.\n\nAfter high school graduation, he went to business college, where he requested a typing book like the returning veteran amputees were using that would teach him one-handed typing.\n\nWhen he felt discouraged, he reminded himself that people had worse things to deal with than he did. He knew he would rather have lost a hand than a leg or his eyesight \u2013 or even his life.\n\n\u201cA lot of my contemporaries were going in the Korean War, but I couldn\u2019t go. Maybe I would\u2019ve gone and been killed,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cMaybe this thing actually saved my life.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Carolyn Kimmel | Special to PennLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "body and mind, health, living", "title": "From a wooden hand to bionic fingers: advances in prosthetics allowing amputees to regain mobility and dexterity", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "Not only are prostheses more realistic-looking than ever before; they are also much more functional.", "title": "From a wooden hand to bionic fingers: advances in prosthetics allowing amputees to regain mobility and dexterity", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/bodyandmind/index.ssf/2014/02/from_a_wooden_hands_to_bionic.html", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/bodyandmind_impact/photo/14285134-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/bodyandmind_impact/photo/14285134-standard.jpg", "title": "From a wooden hand to bionic fingers: advances in prosthetics allowing amputees to regain mobility and dexterity", "description": "Not only are prostheses more realistic-looking than ever before; they are also much more functional.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@pennlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, February 16, 2014, 10:06 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, February 16, 2014, 10:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Not only are prostheses more realistic-looking than ever before; they are also much more functional."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc993e\"", "article_summary": "Today, he wears a realistic-looking myoelectric prosthesis with moveable fingers and thumb, but he still does many things with one hand.\nHe knew he would rather have lost a hand than a leg or his eyesight \u2013 or even his life.\nSilicone covers can be made that are identical to the amputee\u2019s real leg or arm -- freckles, hair and all.\nBy pulling the left arm down, he could pull the cables that would open the prosthesis on his left hand.\nEach finger has an individual motor powering it, en\u00achancing dexterity and allowing pa\u00actients to grasp round objects and shake hands."}
