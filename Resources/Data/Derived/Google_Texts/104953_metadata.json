They have petitioned the so-called ColoradoCare plan onto the November 2016 ballot. So Colorado voters will have the final say on this nightmare that would make President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and all its problems look small by comparison.\n\nSen. Irene Aguilar, D-Denver, a physician at Denver Health Medical Center, is the moving force behind this campaign. After failing to get her fellow legislators to pass a universal health care law, she has rallied other advocates who agree with her that even Obamacare doesn\u2019t go far enough to force socialized medicine on the nation.\n\nThe $25 billion tax is not a misprint. The $25 billion, the highest imaginable tax on Coloradans\u2019 paychecks, would nearly match the state\u2019s entire budget, which funds education, transportation, corrections, public safety, social welfare and the ever-expanding Medicaid program. In fact, it would swamp everything the state funds now.\n\nAlthough the state would have to collect the tax, the massive takeover of health care wouldn\u2019t actually be under the control of the Legislature or governor. Instead, ColoradoCare proposes creating an elected board of trustees who then would, in the words of The Associated Press, \u201cact as an enormous insurance company and reimburse doctors.\u201d\n\nThe AP also reported that ColoradoCare would tax us enough \u201cto cover everyone, even people who don\u2019t work or aren\u2019t legally in the country. It\u2019s not exactly a single-payer plan, because Medicare and the military health care system would remain intact.\u201d\n\nThis harebrained scheme would do far more harm than the good these liberal ideologues dream it would do. The tax would drive businesses and taxpayers out of the state and likely spell the exodus of doctors, other medical providers and the private insurance industry.\n\nBe forewarned: An extremely dangerous $25 billion tax socialized medicine issue looms on the 2016 ballot. We trust the voters to kill it when the time comes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/opinion/4152034-120/tax-health-billion-care", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://forms.chieftain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pueblo-chieftain-1200x630.png", "type": "article", "title": "$25 billion tax looms"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f75\"", "article_summary": "Be forewarned: An extremely dangerous $25 billion tax socialized medicine issue looms on the 2016 ballot.\nThe $25 billion tax is not a misprint.\neditorialschieftain editorialIMAGINE A $25 billion-a-year payroll tax to force every single person in Colorado into a government-run universal health care system.\nThe $25 billion, the highest imaginable tax on Coloradans\u2019 paychecks, would nearly match the state\u2019s entire budget, which funds education, transportation, corrections, public safety, social welfare and the ever-expanding Medicaid program.\nWell, advocates for a single-payer \u2014 socialized medicine \u2014 mandate are trying to do just that."}
