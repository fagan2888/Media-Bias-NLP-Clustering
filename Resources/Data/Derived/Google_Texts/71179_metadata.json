It will cost $12 million a month.\n\nAdditionally, these units could be given arrest powers if they come across any immigrants trying to illegally enter the United States (via NYT):\n\nIn 2006, President George W. Bush sent 6,000 troops to the four border states where they repaired and built fences and roads, conducted surveillance and took over administrative and logistical duties. In 2010, Mr. Obama deployed 1,200 troops to bolster border security. Troops in those deployments did not have arrest and apprehension powers. The ones due at the border next month will work side by side not with federal Border Patrol agents but with state police officers of the Department of Public Safety. They will not be able to enforce federal immigration laws but may be able to enforce state law. A 19th-century federal law [Posse Comitatus] that makes it a crime for military personnel to perform civilian law enforcement activities does not apply to state-duty troops. \u2026 It remains unclear if Mr. Perry will grant the troops the authority to make apprehensions. General Nichols suggested this week that Guard troops could do so if the governor requested it but that they had no plans to. Mr. Perry has previously favored such powers. In a letter to President Obama last month, he asked him to deploy 1,000 troops under presidential authority and to give those troops \u201carrest powers to support Border Patrol operations.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure Attorney General Eric Holder and the Obama administration will have a problem with this\u2026after their next fundraiser.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Border crisis drags on....05/25/2016 17:14:23PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Border crisis drags on...", "title": "- Gov.
