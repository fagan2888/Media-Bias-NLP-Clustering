GoPro Inc. this week lost a chief operating officer but gained a CIO, hiring long-time Informatica Corp. executive Tony Young to the be first tech chief for the fast growing maker of wearable cameras.

The company declined to issue a statement concerning the hire, which Young confirmed to CIO Journal after updating his LinkedIn profile earlier this week. On Thursday, GoPro GPRO, +3.81% said that COO Nina Richardson resigned after serving in the role for two years. It didn’t name a replacement.

Young joins GoPro from integration software maker Informatica Corp., where he most recently worked as senior vice president of subscription/cloud sales. Prior to that role, he served as Informatica’s CIO from 2002 until 2013. He began his tech career in 1989, developing software for Hewlett-Packard Co.

Young, in a March 2013 interview, said that CIOs should manage and secure data rather than spending the $400,000 it could cost on software and staff to manage mobile devices. “You’re asking me to buy expensive software and infrastructure, and to train and apply headcount for something that isn’t foolproof,” he said. “That’s a pretty expensive resource to operate,” he said.

The company, which is also looking to sell content captured with its cameras, is also building camera-outfitted drones.
