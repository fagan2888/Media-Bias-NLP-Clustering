Between April 2014 and September 30, 2015, Alston & Bird were paid $280,000 in taxpayer dollars for its lobbying services.\n\nAccording to a final rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on Dec. 13, 2011, no portion of the loans given to co-ops could be used for \u201cpropaganda purposes, attempts to influence legislation, or marketing.\u201d\n\nFederal law additionally states, \u201cNo appropriated funds may be expended by the recipient of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any of the following covered Federal actions: the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal grant, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services did not directly answer a question regarding the group\u2019s lobbying activities, but instead sent a link back to the rule.\n\nOn Sept. 25, 2015, New York financial regulators announced that the co-op would cease issuing new insurance policies.\n\n\u201cGiven Health Republic\u2019s financial situation, commencing an orderly wind down process before the upcoming open enrollment period is the best course of action to protect consumers,\u201d said Anthony Albanese, an acting regulatory official.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2015, beginning in July and lasting through the end of September, the co-op used $50,000 in a last ditch effort to lobby for more solvency dollars as the co-op was nearing its end.\n\nNew York financial regulators are now investigating Health Republic Insurance of New York after finding that the co-op had \u201cinaccurate representations\u201d of their financial condition and \u201csubstantial underreporting.\u201d The investigators ordered the co-op to stop issuing health insurance policies at the end of November.\n\nThe New York co-op was the largest of the 23 created under Obamacare and had more than 150,000 members. It received $265 million in federal loans in 2012 and engaged lobbyists to secure an additional $90 million in solvency funds in 2014, which was approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWhen the Washington Free Beacon reached out to Pomeroy and Siggins about their lobbying activities on behalf of the failed co-op, a member of Alston & Bird\u2019s communications department responded saying they could not discuss client matters.\n\nHealth Republic Insurance of New York declined to comment.\n\nA spokesman for government watchdog Citizens Against Government Waste said that the hundreds of thousands put into lobbying efforts using taxpayer dollars is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe recent financial death spiral of the Obamacare CO-OPs has already left millions of Americans scrambling to find new health insurance next year,\u201d spokesman Curtis Kalin said. \u201cThe revelation that a state program improperly used taxpayer funds on lobbying instead of ensuring the program\u2019s financial stability is unacceptable and outrageous. It is salt in the wound for American taxpayers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A failed co-op currently under investigation for underreporting its financial situation used hundreds of thousands in taxpayer dollars for lobbying, according to Senate lobbying disclosure records.", "title": "Failed Co-Op Under Investigation Used $280K in Taxpayer Dollars For Lobbying", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/failed-co-op-under-investigation-used-280k-in-taxpayer-dollars-for-lobbying/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cool-baby-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cool-baby-150x150.jpg", "description": "A failed co-op currently under investigation for underreporting its financial situation used hundred", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Failed Co-Op Under Investigation Used $280K in Taxpayer Dollars For Lobbying"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY:A failed co-op currently under investigation for underreporting its financial situation used hundreds of thousands in taxpayer dollars for lobbying, according to Senate lobbying disclosure records.\nBetween April 2014 and September 30, 2015, Alston & Bird were paid $280,000 in taxpayer dollars for its lobbying services.\nThe New York co-op was the largest of the 23 created under Obamacare and had more than 150,000 members.\n\u201cThe revelation that a state program improperly used taxpayer funds on lobbying instead of ensuring the program\u2019s financial stability is unacceptable and outrageous.\nA spokesman for government watchdog Citizens Against Government Waste said that the hundreds of thousands put into lobbying efforts using taxpayer dollars is unacceptable."}
