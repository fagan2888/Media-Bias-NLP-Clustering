Plus, it\u2019ll give you good fodder for small talk at holiday cocktail parties.\n\nRelated: 10 Great Spring Break Destinations for Families\n\nFollow these tips to save:\n\nON TRANSPORTATION\n\nBook soon. For off-peak travel, the best time to book is about a month and a half ahead of a trip. But given the popularity of vacations during spring break, the earlier you can book the better your price will likely be, according to an analysis released in February by CheapAir.com.\n\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re talking about a peak travel period, it\u2019s a lot better to buy too early than too late, and with spring break you definitely run a risk if you wait,\u201d says CheapAir.com CEO Jeff Klee. \u201cThe less flexible you\u2019re willing to be, the earlier you should book.\u201d\n\nLast year, prices to the most popular spring break destinations rose by more than a third as peak travel time approached. Booking far in advance is also your best shot at using miles to cover a flight, since airlines only allow a certain number of rewards seats on each flight. See whether you\u2019re getting a deal by dividing the ticket cost by the number of miles you need to purchase it. You\u2019ll want a rate of at least a penny per mile.\n\nRelated: When to Book Your Flight for the Best Deal\n\nTravel off-peak. For spring break travel, you\u2019re usually beholden to your kids\u2019 school calendar, but any flexibility you can find with your schedule can save you money. \u201cIf you can take the kids out of school for a day or two and move your trip to Tuesday to Monday, that can make a big difference on price,\u201d says Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at Hopper.com.\n\nFlying to or from a small airport or on a connecting flight also usually costs less. For North American flights, you might also save money by buying two one-way tickets on different airlines rather than one round-trip ticket. Use the booking tools at CheapAir.com and Google Flights to compare prices on one-way versus round-trip tickets.\n\nBundle your hotel and airfare. If your heart is set on spending spring break on the beach, you may be able to find a good package deal on sites that specialize in Caribbean travel or directly from the cruise lines, although sometimes you\u2019ll end up with layovers over flights at inconvenient times. All-inclusive hotels can also be a great way for families to keep costs in check.\n\nBefore booking a package deal, run the numbers to be sure you are actually saving by making the purchase that way rather than a la carte.\n\nStick to the roads. If you have the option to travel by car, it\u2019s almost always cheaper than flying. There\u2019s no guarantee that gas prices will remain near their 10-year low of $2.20 per gallon (they typically start to rise in the spring), but even if prices rise by a dollar, you\u2019ll likely still come out ahead over purchasing four round-trip airline tickets. Use the Web site TravelMath to run the numbers.\n\nON LODGING\n\nSkip the hotel. Hotel vacations can be tough with family. You\u2019re either all crammed into one room or you\u2019ve got to spring for multiple rooms or a pricey suite. A more economical option can be renting a house. Check HomeAway.com or AirBnB for options. Sometimes an individual owner will offer a discount for nonrefundable payment, in full and in advance.\n\nRelated: 8 Great Holiday Travel Trips for Procrastinators\n\n\u201cA lot of families like to have the space to spread out in a house, regardless of the price,\u201d says Jodi Grundig, a founder and editor at Family Travel Magazine. \u201cYou can also save with a house by doing your own meal preparation.\u201d\n\nUse points. If you can\u2019t find a suitable home rental, consider cashing in credit card or hotel reward points to cover your stay. Hotel points are most valuable during peak season when rooms cost the most.\n\nBook the cheapest room. Sure, it\u2019s nice to sit on your balcony and take in the view, but when you\u2019ve got kids you\u2019re likely not spending much time in your room anyway. Rather than spending a premium for a room with a view, pocket the savings by opting to overlook the parking lot or take an interior cabin on a cruise.\n\nCheck the local calendar. Unlike winter breaks, which all align with Christmas and New Year\u2019s, there\u2019s some variation in when schools close for spring break. Schools in the south and Midwest tend to be off in early March, while schools in the northeast generally let kids out in April close to Easter.\n\n\u201cResorts tend to follow the spring dates for their region, so if you\u2019re flying in from another area, you might be able to avoid the highest peak prices,\u201d says family vacation expert Suzanne Rowan Kelleher.\n\nON DESTINATIONS\n\nGo non-traditional. The traditional spring break vacation is to someplace warm with an ocean, and those places tend to charge peak prices during spring break. If the goal is just to get away with your family, an international trip or a city vacation might be a good option. Flights to New York City, Los Angeles, London or Paris don\u2019t fluctuate much during this time of year. \u201cIt helps to think creatively about your destination,\u201d says Ryan Lile of the Frequent Flier Academy.\n\nAnother nontraditional option for spring break families is to hit the slopes. Mountain resorts typically have low fares outside of peak ski season and the summer rush. Ski areas located far north or in the West may still offer skiing through March, while others offer other outdoor activities such as hiking and biking.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If shorter days, falling temperatures and holiday stress already have you dreaming of", "title": "8 Tips to Save on Spring Break Travel", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/19/8-Tips-Save-Spring-Break-Travel", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/Beach_House_Wailuku.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/19/8-Tips-Save-Spring-Break-Travel", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/Beach_House_Wailuku.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If shorter days, falling temperatures and holiday stress already have you dreaming of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The traditional spring break vacation is to someplace warm with an ocean, and those places tend to charge peak prices during spring break.\nFor spring break travel, you\u2019re usually beholden to your kids\u2019 school calendar, but any flexibility you can find with your schedule can save you money.\nRelated: 10 Great Spring Break Destinations for FamiliesFollow these tips to save:ON TRANSPORTATIONBook soon.\nUnlike winter breaks, which all align with Christmas and New Year\u2019s, there\u2019s some variation in when schools close for spring break.\nIf shorter days, falling temperatures and holiday stress already have you dreaming of warmer weather, it may be time to book your family\u2019s spring break vacation."}
