The White House has previewed its $1.1 billion proposal for an opioid epidemic response and the $755 million ask for the cancer moonshot. Almost all those funds would be mandatory, i.e., outside the budget caps that the Obama administration agreed to last year. We'll learn about discretionary funding when the budget's released Tuesday. Before last year\u2019s $2 billion boost \u2014 much more than what the White House had requested \u2014 NIH funding had essentially stagnated for more than a decade. FDA also has a lot of programs it needs to ramp up, including biosimilars. More on that below.\n\nDRUG PRICES \u2014 The White House is sure to re-up longstanding proposals to let Medicare Part D negotiate drug prices, and other familiar measures, like cutting the monopoly protection on biologics from 12 years to seven. The budget could highlight payment demonstrations related to drug spending at CMS's Innovation Center. CMS has talked a lot about bringing more transparency to drug pricing, but will the White House go beyond what the agency has done in publishing Medicare data? We\u2019ll know the details Tuesday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHappy Monday and welcome back to Prescription PULSE, where we recall that this month more than 230 years ago, Rene Laennec, who would go on to invent the first stethoscope was born in France. It was made of wooden tubing and helped doctors listen to patients' lungs and chest. For a detailed history of the stethoscope visit: http://1.usa.gov/1C4TXhi\n\nHELP TO MARK UP FIRST \u2018CURES\u2019 BILLS \u2014 Tuesday will also bring the first step in the Senate\u2019s new piecemeal approach to a medical innovation package, with seven bipartisan bills slated for markup. That includes ranking member Patty Murray\u2019s legislation to step up FDA oversight of duodenoscopes \u2014 introduced last week \u2014 and other bills including significant health IT legislation with broad support. Expect Murray and fellow Democrats to talk up the need for action on drug prices and NIH funding. Lobbyists said that the first markup should be relatively harmonious, though whether that will extend to additional markups scheduled for March and April is anyone\u2019s guess. The notice, with details on the bills: http://1.usa.gov/1Kohssb\n\n\u2026 Chairman Lamar Alexander said last week that he hoped to include the Obama administration\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative and cancer moonshot in the innovation package, but he stopped well short of committing to new money for the NIH and FDA. For the moonshot \u201cto succeed in the Senate, it needs to be a part of our biomedical research bill, which we're working on over the next 60 days and I think it can be,\" Alexander told Pro\u2019s Jennifer Haberkorn. He indicated that the amount - and the \"mandatory\" funding label - is a \"separate question but the goal is a good goal.\" Additional mandatory funding remains a hard sell for GOP appropriators. In any case, no such funding measures are on Tuesday\u2019s agenda and no clear prospect has appeared on the horizon yet.\n\nWILL ABORTION DEBATE IMPACT GENE EDITING POLICY? \u2014 A powerful new gene editing technology is forcing the United States and other countries to reexamine their regulation of research and it has caused both pro-abortion rights and anti-abortion groups to sound alarms. They\u2019re opposed to using CRISPR/Cas9 to tinker with the human race through germline gene editing \u2014 that is, altering cells that become a human being, thereby changing an inherited trait for generations. The issue is ripe for more political debate and Congressional intervention. A policy rider in the year-end budget deal prohibited FDA\u2019s reviews of germline gene research but it doesn\u2019t prevent scientists from tinkering in the lab. And while federal money can\u2019t be used for research on human embryos, the private sector has poured at least $1 billion into CRISPR. Plus, other countries like China and the United Kingdom have been more willing to allow scientists to experiment, which could have global ramifications. Sarah has more for Pros.\n\nFDA NEEDS MORE RESOURCES FOR BIOSIMIARS \u2014 Reading between the lines, FDA wants some congressional appropriations for biosimilars. Janet Woodcock wouldn\u2019t come out and say it directly, but she got House Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone to go there at a hearing Thursday. Woodcock explained that Congress never appropriated funds for FDA to implement the biosimilar pathway created under Obamacare in 2010 to speed cheaper versions of biologic medicines to patients. Two years later lawmakers passed a biosimilar user fee bill which allowed FDA to collect fees from companies \u2014 but it had to spend $20 million of taxpayer funding before it could spend any of the user fees. Now FDA is seeing increased activity from biosimilar companies and it needs some help. \u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about is that this program is going to explode \u2026 I am concerned that we will not have the staff because we are always waiting to catch up,\u201d Woodcock said at an Energy and Commerce Health subcommittee. \u201cIt sounds like you need some appropriations, but you aren\u2019t going to tell me,\u201d Pallone responded.\n\n\u2026 CMS took a little bipartisan beating in the hearing as lawmakers criticized its decision to reimburse all biosimilars of the same branded biologic at the same rate, treating them like generic drugs. Subcommittee ranking member Gene Green said he understands the need to control costs but said he fears in this case \u201cit undermines this infant market and creates a race to the bottom.\u201d Two lobbying groups, The Biosimilars Forum and GPhA\u2019s Biosimilar Council put out statements against CMS\u2019s payment policy.\n\nSECOND U.S. BIOSIMILAR IS ON THE WAY \u2014 If you\u2019re keeping track as of Jan. 21, Woodcock said 59 proposed biosimilar products were seeking to copy 18 different branded biologics in FDA\u2019s biosimilar program. The next biosimilar approval is likely to be Celltrion\u2019s copycat of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Remicade (infliximab), which is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative cqcolitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions. An FDA advisory committee will weigh in on the treatment Tuesday and FDA\u2019s briefing document indicate the agency is satisfied with the drug. http://1.usa.gov/1PZELeo\n\nSHKRELI WRAP-UP: WHERE DOES PRICING DEBATE GO FROM HERE? \u2014 The Martin Shkreli circus has come and gone from Washington, but there wasn\u2019t even a hint of a policy consensus in the four-hour long House Oversight hearing into drug prices Thursday. Republicans put a lot of blame on the FDA for being too slow to approve generics, allowing companies to exploit market monopolies. Democrats brought up allowing Medicare to negotiate prices in Part D and the need for more transparency around pricing. Ranking Member Elijah Cummings told reporters after the hearing he plans to look at the behavior of other companies, but he was the only one to call out by name industry members besides Turing and Valeant for price hikes.\n\nSupply chain and distribution practices including the use of co-pay coupons and the practices of pharmacy benefits managers got a bit of scrutiny but overall payers were overshadowed given lawmakers frustration with Turing and Valeant. A recap on the Shkreli drama is here. FDA\u2019s beating is chronicled for Pros.\n\nPAINKILLER ACTION BRINGS NO RELIEF FOR CALIFF (YET) \u2014 The Obama administration last week announced a $1 billion package to fight the opioid epidemic and a suite of FDA actions. But it didn\u2019t budge the three Democrats \u2014 Bernie Sanders, Joe Manchin and Ed Markey \u2014 who have a hold on Robert Califf\u2019s nomination for FDA commissioner because of painkiller concerns. Markey and Manchin insisted that the FDA\u2019s action plan didn\u2019t go far enough. Both said the commitment to additional advisory committee input should apply not only to new painkillers without abuse deterrent technology, but all of these powerful drugs. \u201cWhether an opioid is abuse deterrent or not hasn\u2019t prevented tens of thousands of people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or experienced lower back pain from getting addicted to these painkillers. That is why the FDA must change its decision,\u201d Markey said Thursday. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski still has a hold on Califf over rules for labeling genetically modified salmon. Our story, ICYMI: http://politico.pro/1QifNBf\n\n\u2026 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voiced his own concern on FDA opioid policy after meeting Califf Thursday. He said the agency \u201cmust do more\u201d and pledged to review the new FDA plan. McConnell\u2019s office had no news to share on plans for a confirmation vote.\n\nA GOP pharma lobbyist said the Democratic opposition to the White House nominee had \u201cthrown a monkey wrench\u201d in the HELP committee\u2019s plan to have Califf confirmed by now. \u201cI think they made a mistake,\u201d the lobbyist said. \u201cCaliff is actually the only one who is willing to go in there and shake the institutional cage. They would have done better to get him confirmed and then work with him.\u201d\n\nCaliff still has very broad support, but the nomination may not be able to move without some legislation partially addressing concerns, the lobbyist said. A potential vehicle is due for a markup on Thursday \u2014 the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act \u2014 and it\u2019s expected to get a quick ride to a floor vote. It doesn\u2019t address FDA oversight now, however, and it\u2019s not clear what could be included that the FDA could live with that might tamp down Dem opposition.\n\n** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association: The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association's new campaign-That's What PBMs Do -highlights how pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) reduce prescription drug costs and improve convenience and safety for consumers, employers, unions, and government programs.

Husted ordered re-certification of the signatures after attorneys for PhRMA alleged violations of Ohio law and fraudulent practices during the petition drive. A second review did lead to nearly 36,000 signatures being invalidated \u2014 but the initiative still surpassed the nearly 92,000 signatures needed. The announcement: http://bit.ly/1PZO4ev\n\nOhio\u2019s General Assembly can decide to pass the proposal, which calls for the state to pay no more for medicines than the price negotiated by the VA. If it doesn\u2019t act or passes an amended version, the petitioners must collect additional signatures to get it on the state\u2019s 2016 ballot. PhRMA, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the Ohio Pharmacists Association, and a handful of other groups in a statement Thursday described the petition as \u201carbitrary and vague.\u201d The groups questioned whether the proposal would reduce costs for medicines \u2014 and suggested it might actually cause prices to rise.\n\nColorado\u2019s state legislature will take up its drug pricing transparency bill Feb. 18. It will be reviewed by the House Health, Insurance and Environment Committee. http://1.usa.gov/1VW4uCK. A similar bill stalled in Virginia last week: http://wapo.st/1PZSFNM. Washington\u2019s Senate Health Committee also held a hearing on its transparency bill last week: http://1.usa.gov/1QLiM84\n\nFROM THE 340B WARS \u2014 AIR340B released a fact sheet with new research finding that 340B hospitals accounted for about 60 percent of Medicare Part B drug reimbursements but less than half of all Medicare outpatient revenue. That suggests \u201cperverse financial incentives\u201d that are undermining the program, AIR340B spokesperson Stephanie Silverman said. The fact sheet: http://bit.ly/1PbNHdl\n\n\u2026 Coming Wednesday: A media conference call with \u201cphysician leaders\u201d and Ted Slafsky, CEO of 340B Health, warning of \u201cnegative implications \u2026 patients face if the program is scaled back.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE ON THE MOVE: KNEUER JOINES TAUZIJN \u2014 Mimi Simoneaux Kneuer joins former Rep. Billy Tauzin\u2019s consulting firm as a principal. \u201cShe was executive vice president of external affairs at PhRMA, which Tauzin used to lead, and was his chief of staff when he chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee from 2000 to 2004,\u201d POLITICO Influence reported.\n\nCATCHING OUR ATTENTION: HOW MEDICARE PART D NEGOTIATIONS COULD WORK \u2014 Democrats love throwing out the idea of allowing the government to negotiate drug prices in Medicare Part D as a way to control costs, but few discuss how that might really work. It doesn\u2019t have to be one-size-fits-all. A Health Affairs blog lays out a variety of ways the government could intervene in Part D pricing. Things to consider: whether HHS would negotiate prices for all drugs or just certain products, would it also negotiate formulary design and would the government\u2019s authority apply to all or just some Part D plans? http://bit.ly/1nzyNEf\n\n** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association: PBMs are projected to save employers, unions, government programs, and consumers $654 billion - up to 30 percent - on drug benefit costs over the next decade. PBMs reduce drug costs by: \u00b7 Offering Amazon-style home delivery of medications and creating select networks of more affordable pharmacies; \u00b7 Encouraging the use of generics and more affordable brand medications; \u00b7 Negotiating rebates from drug manufacturers and discounts from drugstores; \u00b7 Managing high-cost specialty medications; and \u00b7 Reducing waste and improving adherence.
