Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) presidential campaign announced on Friday that it has hired a veteran Latino rights activist as its Latino outreach director, marking an escalation of the campaign\u2019s efforts to shore up a constituency that has yet to warm to his candidacy.\n\nArturo Carmona, who was executive director of Presente.org, a Los Angeles-based online Latino advocacy group active in the immigration reform fight, will also serve as Sanders\u2019 Southwest political director.\n\n\u201cI am going to work hard to build a strong team that can connect Bernie\u2019s campaign with Latino families,\u201d Carmona said in a statement released by the Sanders campaign. \u201cAs the son of an immigrant, his story resembles that of millions of Latinos in the U.S.\u201d\n\nCarmona said that Sanders\u2019 positions on economic inequality, climate change and criminal justice policy -- not just immigration reform -- will resonate with Latino voters.\n\n\u201cLatinos need to be part of the political revolution that Sen. Sanders is calling for,\u201d Carmona said.\n\nSanders is ahead of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, and now rivals the Clinton campaign in fundraising, but he has struggled to attract the support of African-Americans and Latinos.\n\nClinton enjoys the support of 57 percent of black and brown Democrats nationwide, according to a Sept. 14 ABC News/Washington Post poll, while Sanders has the backing of just 13 percent.\n\nSanders drew criticism from immigration reform activists in July with comments implying that expanding some forms of legal immigration would threaten American jobs. (None, however, denied Sanders\u2019 support for comprehensive immigration reform, which he voted for in 2013.)\n\nCarmona\u2019s hiring is the latest in a series of moves by the Sanders campaign aimed at assuaging Latinos\u2019 concerns and winning their support. Sanders told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Thursday that he supports granting some undocumented immigrants eligibility to purchase health care coverage on the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.\n\nSanders hired Lilia Chacon, a former press secretary to the Chicago city treasurer and the daughter of two immigrants from central America, as his Iowa press secretary, in September.\n\nSanders\u2019 Latino outreach efforts mirror attempts to address African-American concerns about his candidacy. Sanders hired African-American criminal justice organizer Symone Sanders as his campaign press secretary in August, after Black Lives Matter activists argued that Sanders was focusing on economic equality to the exclusion of racial justice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Vermont progressive has struggled to build support among Latinos.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-10-03 17:34:58 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Vermont progressive has struggled to build support among Latinos.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Appoints Latino Outreach Director", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-latino-outreach-director_us_560eeae2e4b0dd85030c14bf", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/560eeb701600002e00037ef7.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Vermont progressive has struggled to build support among Latinos.", "creator": "@danielmarans", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/560eeb701600002e00037ef7.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Bernie Sanders Appoints Latino Outreach Director", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-02 17:34:58 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_560eeae2e4b0dd85030c14bf", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders,2016 latino vote,Latino Politics,2016 election", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Bernie Sanders,2016 latino vote,Latino Politics,2016 election", "published_time": "2015-10-02 17:34:58 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-10-02 17:35:24 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce210\"", "article_summary": "Sanders\u2019 Latino outreach efforts mirror attempts to address African-American concerns about his candidacy.\nArturo Carmona, who was executive director of Presente.org, a Los Angeles-based online Latino advocacy group active in the immigration reform fight, will also serve as Sanders\u2019 Southwest political director.\nSanders hired Lilia Chacon, a former press secretary to the Chicago city treasurer and the daughter of two immigrants from central America, as his Iowa press secretary, in September.\nSanders hired African-American criminal justice organizer Symone Sanders as his campaign press secretary in August, after Black Lives Matter activists argued that Sanders was focusing on economic equality to the exclusion of racial justice.\n(None, however, denied Sanders\u2019 support for comprehensive immigration reform, which he voted for in 2013.)"}
