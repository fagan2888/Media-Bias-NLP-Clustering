The registration deadline is Sept. 11.\n\nPeople with MS and their relatives or caregivers received the invitations. They\u2019ll spend the day with local doctors and medical researchers. More significantly, the researchers want to spend the day with them to learn what they think is important to research.\n\n\u201cThe meeting is the beginning of ongoing efforts to have the patients lead us,\u201d said Bonnie Paris of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria, a co-leader on the project.\n\n\u201cIn the past, researchers have come up with the questions, then found the subjects. Now it\u2019s the patients coming up with the questions for researchers to answer.\u201d\n\nPeople with MS are eligible for a $50 stipend for participating.\n\nDeveloping patient-led research on MS is a joint effort involving the Center for Outcomes Research at the UICOMP, the Illinois Neurological Institute MS Clinic, and the Central Illinois MS Council.\n\nThe meeting is funded, in part, by a small grant from Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, or PCORI, a lesser-known aspect of the Affordable Care Act designed to fund patient-centered research on which medical treatments work best.\n\nThe Peoria-based project is the only PCORI grant funded for MS research, according to Carl V. Asche, another project co-leader, who is director of UICOMP\u2019s Center for Outcomes Research.\n\nThough there is no cure for MS, a disease of the central nervous system, certain medications can reduce relapse rates and the effects of symptoms, such as numbness and tremors.\n\nAsche is already involved in developing a database of demographics, treatments and outcomes of each MS patient treated locally. The community meeting, subsequent feedback from patients, and the database sets the stage for larger research grants, he said.\n\nThe idea of creating a nationally recognized center for MS treatment and research in Peoria began more than a decade ago, after the Central Illinois MS Council broke off from a national MS organization to focus.\n\n\u201cSince then, we\u2019ve developed a vision to become one of the best MS centers in the country,\u201d said Larry Wallden, who has MS and serves on the local MS council.\n\nThe patient-led council\u2019s focus on retaining fundraising revenues and improving treatment and reseach programs in central Illinois was already established when the Affordable Care Act funded PCORI to address healthcare research most relevant to patients and caregivers.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re successful with patient-led research on MS, I think we can transfer the model to other areas, such as strokes or diabetes,\u201d Asche said.\n\nPam Adams can be reached at 686-3245 or padams@pjstar.com.
