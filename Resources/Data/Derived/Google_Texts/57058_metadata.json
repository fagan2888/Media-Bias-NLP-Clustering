It's from our good friend Dan Mitchell's website at the Cato Institute. This on bureaucrats and healthcare, but it speaks to so much more. In fact, it's a challenge to all that you big government types believe in.\n\nSo, What have you got? Nothing? Well, go away with your tail between your embarrassed legs. Yes, that's it!\n\nExcept, see the whole deal from the smartest free market institute in the world, here. Oh, and if you really, really want to fight, we're ready, they're ready, Dan's ready. Running away again?\n\nCan you imagine that the Left would have the balls to put up a fight like this, with the prospect that differing views would be allowed in a forum of theirs? What a concept...!\n\nHappy Friday night from Europe...
