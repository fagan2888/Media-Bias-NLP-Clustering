That\u2019s mostly because of the county\u2019s large hog\n\nproduction, which leads the state, said Kent Wolfe, director of the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences\u2019 Center of Agribusiness and Economic Development.\n\nWolfe is also the editor of the report, along with researcher Karen Stubbs.\n\nEven Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties rank high for one kind of agriculture \u2014 ornamental horticulture. Clarke is the state\u2019s No. 3 county at $32.4 million in total ornamental horticulture. Oconee County is No. 8 at $17.3 million worth of production last year.\n\nThe new report also shows that beef has overtaken cotton as the state\u2019s No. 2 type of agricultural production.\n\nHerds increased along with beef prices, while cotton prices tumbled as China pulled back from buying cotton after stockpiling it, Wolfe said.\n\nMadison County leads the state in overall value of agricultural production, but several other northeast Georgia counties rank in the top 10 \u2014 mostly because of poultry production, which accounts for the great majority of agricultural production in Northeast Georgia.\n\nBroilers are by far Georgia\u2019s the most valuable agricultural product, with a value of $4.5 billion in 2014 \u2014 four times the value of second-place beef, at $1.1 billion.\n\nOverall agricultural production in Georgia was worth $14.1 billion in 2014, up $448 million from 2013, according to the Farmgate report. Almost all that gain was because of beef production, which shot up by $443 million between 2013 and 2014.\n\nIn addition to Madison, six other Northeast Georgia counties rank in Georgia\u2019s top 10 for total agricultural production, including neighboring Jackson and Oglethorpe counties.\n\nNo other state in the union keeps as detailed an account of its agriculture as Georgia, Wolfe said.\n\nSome other highlights from the report:\n\n\u2022 Georgia may be the Peach State, but sales of that fruit are only a fraction of what Georgia farmers get for the state\u2019s blueberries. Farmers sold $335.3 million worth of blueberries last year, four times the amount the crop\u2019s value five years earlier. The value of the peach crop in 2014 was about $53.5 million.\n\n\u2022 Tift County farmers grew the most watermelons \u2014 worth $18.4 million in 2014.\n\n\u2022 Colquitt County topped the vegetable production chart at $155 million; most of the state\u2019s vegetable production is in south Georgia. The state\u2019s most valuable vegetable crop is onions at $138.5 million.\n\n\u2022 At $156.1 million, agricultural tourism grew by about 9 percent from 2013 to 2014 and has nearly doubled in value in five years.\n\n\u2022 The value of the cotton crop declined from about $1.2 billion to about $965 million. In 2011, the Georgia cotton crop was worth $1.5 billion.\n\nThe full report is online for viewing or download at www.caes.uga.edu/center/caed.\n\nFollow education reporter Lee Shearer at www.facebook.com/LeeShearerABH or https://twitter.com/LeeShearer.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Mobile, Local News, Lee Shearer", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "Athens may not look like a farming town, but in fact, the four-county Athens metropolitan area is one of the state's top-producing agricultural regions.", "title": "Metro Athens is agriculture powerhouse, Madison County's No. 1", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2015-11-01/metro-athens-agriculture-powerhouse-and-madison-countys-no-1", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/14859161.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "Oglethorpe County, another neighboring County in the Athens area, is the state\u2019s top producer in the livestock and agriculture category at $125 million.\nIn addition to Madison, six other Northeast Georgia counties rank in Georgia\u2019s top 10 for total agricultural production, including neighboring Jackson and Oglethorpe counties.\nFarmers sold $335.3 million worth of blueberries last year, four times the amount the crop\u2019s value five years earlier.\nMadison County, a part of the Athens metro area, is the No.\n2 type of agricultural production."}
