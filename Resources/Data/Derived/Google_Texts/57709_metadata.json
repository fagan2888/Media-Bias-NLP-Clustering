Guests had their phones taken away for the ceremony and reception in an effort to ensure that no photos or details leaked out.\n\n\u201cA first-class affair,\u201d said one of the guests, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Sunday because the couple had yet to reveal any details of the event themselves. \u201cCeremony was short and sweet.\u201d\n\nMany members of the Heat organization were there, including Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, managing general partner Micky Arison and coach Erik Spoelstra. Wade and girlfriend Gabrielle Union posted images of themselves dressed for the occasion on social media, as did Bosh and his wife Adrienne. Some of James\u2018 longtime friends were also in attendance, including his manager Maverick Carter.\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful evening!!\u201d Adrienne Bosh wrote on Twitter. \u201cCongratulations to Mr. & Mrs. James\u2026Thanks for sharing Ur night & love with us\u201d\n\nThe ceremony was the obvious highlight of a three-day wedding weekend for the couple, who were high school sweethearts and are the parents of two sons. They were engaged just after midnight on Jan. 1, 2012, when James dropped to a knee and surprised his longtime girlfriend by finally popping the question as many of their close friends were gathered around.\n\nJames told AP last year that he and Brinson decided not to rush plans for their wedding, especially since last summer was hectic for him basketball-wise \u2014 James played for the U.S. in the London Olympics, helping the Americans win a gold medal, and also was involved in the wedding for one of his longtime close friends.\n\nSo the date was set for this offseason, and even after a 21-month engagement, very few details leaked out \u2014 including why the wedding was taking place in San Diego, especially since the couple still considers Akron, Ohio as home and have essentially been based in Miami for three years now.\n\nAlso unclear: If the couple would be using social media to make any statement about the wedding \u2014 James has more than 14 million fans on Facebook, and nearly 10 million followers on Twitter.\n\nThe measures to ensure privacy were hardly a surprise. In an interview with AP last spring, Brinson acknowledged that she\u2019s leery of media coverage, since she hasn\u2019t always found it to be fair or factual.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard things about me that are bad, where they\u2019ve literally looked up into the sky and said, \u2018What can they say about Savannah?,\u2019\u201d Brinson told AP in April. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nTelevision stations in San Diego showed aerial images of the hotel, including large tents set up for both the reception and to shroud the arrival of guests. In some cases, umbrellas were even used to protect the identity of wedding-arrivers from prying eyes in the sky, and people who tried to gain access to the hotel just to get a better look were quickly ushered away and told only that a private event was taking place.\n\nEven some local vendors in the San Diego area thought they had a role in the wedding \u2014 though were not themselves actually sure if that was the case. The Village Mill Bread Company \u2014 located about 3 miles from the wedding site \u2014 told Fox affiliate KSWB that someone ordered 500 loaves of Brioche from them to be delivered Saturday, but would not confirm that they were heading to the James-Brinson nuptials.\n\nJames is a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, and he will be back in Miami later this month to resume preparing for training camp. James is scheduled to address reporters when the Heat hold their annual media day on Sept. 30, and the first practice of the new season is scheduled for Oct. 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "James and Brinson, 27, have been together since high school and have two sons.
