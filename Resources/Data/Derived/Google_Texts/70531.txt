All of the City of Wichita neighborhood pools opened for the swimming season this afternoon.

For the past several weeks, multiple departments including public works, water, and park maintenance have been working to get the pools ready for the season.

The nine pools are fully staffed this year, but the city is aware that teens have more options for employment.

"It is getting harder and harder these days to hire lifeguards. There's so many more opportunities for these kids to go find other jobs, doing a lot of other things. Thankfully, we have a lot of good returning staff that it wasn't really trouble for us here in the city," said Brian Hill, Wichita Aquatics Manager.

All lifeguards are certified and went through training that costs about $200.

The city plans to provide more training for future lifeguards, including a July 2014 training session and opening the pool by the middle of May 2015 for training.
