She died Saturday morning from her injuries.\n\n\"This is my way of remembering her,\" said Marcie Bell, Davis' fiance's daughter.\n\nBell says she brought a poster with Davis' name and pictures on it to the vigil to put a face to all of the news stories about her.\n\nWhile letting go of balloons near the tennis courts where Davis was raped, beaten and set on fire, her family and friends shared memories of the mother of four.\n\n\"She was kind and she had a great heart,\" said her 8-year-old son.\n\n\"She was a great mom. She was amazing. She always tried her hardest to make sure she could take care of us,\" said her 15-year-old daughter.\n\nDavis' kids say they're humbled by the support, and want their mom's death to be a lesson for everyone to cherish each moment with loved ones.\n\n\"You never know when you could lose someone,\" her daughter said. \"It happened so fast. I wish I had more time with her.\"\n\nCity council member Lavonta Williams hopes the public also learns another lesson from this crime.\n\n\"Violent acts against women is something that is unacceptable,\" Williams said.\n\nShe's working with police, Wichita State, and other city leaders in an effort to make the neighborhood a safer place.\n\n\"No place I was going to be tonight other than right here to let the family know that the city of Wichita is concerned and that this community is concerned,\" Williams said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Sunday's cold, wet weather couldn't keep dozens of people from coming out to Fairmount Park for a vigil for the woman attacked nearly 10 days ago.", "language": "english", "author": "Madeline Anderson", "og": {"description": "Sunday's cold, wet weather couldn't keep dozens of people from coming out to Fairmount Park for a vigil for the woman attacked nearly 10 days ago.", "title": "Family identifies Fairmount Park attack victim at vigil", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Fairmount-Park--283657901.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BAD/333/BAD333DA1DB641F7A0AC4173CCF19376", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/CFF/626/CFF6266EC2A74B699CF4772ED528C73E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Sunday's cold, wet weather couldn't keep dozens of people from coming out to Fairmount Park for a vigil for the woman attacked nearly 10 days ago.", "title": "Family identifies Fairmount Park attack victim at vigil", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Fairmount-Park--283657901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Letitia+Davis1.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Family identifies Fairmount Park attack victim at vigil", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Family identifies Fairmount Park attack"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbac2\"", "article_summary": "Sunday's cold, wet weather couldn't keep dozens of people from coming out to Fairmount Park for a vigil for the woman attacked nearly 10 days ago.\n\"No place I was going to be tonight other than right here to let the family know that the city of Wichita is concerned and that this community is concerned,\" Williams said.\nShe's working with police, Wichita State, and other city leaders in an effort to make the neighborhood a safer place.\nBell says she brought a poster with Davis' name and pictures on it to the vigil to put a face to all of the news stories about her.\nCity council member Lavonta Williams hopes the public also learns another lesson from this crime."}
