Photo Twitter screenshot\n\nPedialyte has made it clear that the upset stomach remedy you remember from childhood is all grown up. The product\u2019s new \u201cSee the Lyte\u201d campaign cleverly reflects its shift from nursing toddlers back from a bout of a stomach bug to nursing 20-somethings back from a weekend bender.\n\nVomiting, diarrhea, and general malaise are symptoms associated with both a stomach flu and a night of heavy drinking, so it would make sense that the recovery method would be similar. At least, that\u2019s the idea an increasing number of young drinkers share. But what first began as an underground \u201cquick fix\u201d to the headache and grogginess caused by drinking too much soon became a nationwide trend. According to Abbott Laboratories, the creators of Pedialyte, sales have gone up nearly 60 percent since 2012, around a third of which came from adults.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an underground movement in social media to drive word of mouth,\u201d explained Heather Mason, executive vice president at Abbott, as reported by National Monitor. \u201cWe saw increased use by adults.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mason, the drink\u2019s new campaign is aimed to take advantage of the product's potential for entering an adult market.\n\n\u201cWe have high electrolyte and lower sugar content than common [hydration] beverages,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThat combination caused us to say, \u2018We need to be part of this.\u2019\u201d\n\nGo get that diploma. #rehydrate pic.twitter.com/kYN22AHNvA \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Pedialyte US (@pedialyte) May 14, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Exactly A Miracle Cure\n\nPedialyte\u2019s hangover relief claims aren\u2019t unfounded, but the product falls short. While it may offer relief because it's infused with electrolytes, charged salts or ions, essential for replenishing the body from various bodily functions (excessive vomiting, diarrhea, or sweating), most symptoms of a hangover are not caused by dehydration and electrolyte loss. According to Michael Oshinsky, a neuroscientist at Thomas Jefferson University, the actual \u201changover headache\u201d experienced by many the night after drinking too much is actually caused by a buildup of waste from the metabolism of alcohol and has nothing to do with dehydration. The only cure for this symptom is giving the body enough time to efficiently filter out this excess waste.\n\nStill, the adult fans of Pedialyte argue that the drink does enough to relieve their hangover symptoms to warrant a place on their bedside cabinet every Sunday morning. However, others argue that despite Pedialyte\u2019s ability to relieve hangover symptoms, its association with children\u2019s medication may hinder it from effectively expanding into the adult market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like going out and having a headache and someone asks, \u2018Would you like children\u2019s Tylenol?,\u2019\u201d Robert Passikoff, founder and president of consulting firm Brand Keys, explained, as reported by the National Monitor. \u201cAbbott isn\u2019t going to be the only one doing this. Adults are going to feel they need a product of their own. The name becomes a barrier.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hangover, hangover cure, pedialyte", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The popular children's remedy for dehydration will now be marketed as an adult's hangover cure.", "title": "Pedialyte Reinvents Itself As The Hangover Cure We've All Been Waiting For", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hangover-cure-your-kids-medicine-cabinet-pedialytes-see-lyte-campaign-reinvents-drink-333810", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/18/graduation.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The popular children's remedy for dehydration will now be marketed as an adult's hangover cure.", "title": "Pedialyte Reinvents Itself As The Hangover Cure We've All Been Waiting For", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hangover-cure-your-kids-medicine-cabinet-pedialytes-see-lyte-campaign-reinvents-drink-333810", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/18/graduation.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/18/graduation.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-05-18T12:23:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T12:49:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The popular children's remedy for dehydration will now be marketed as an adult's hangover cure."}, "article_summary": "However, others argue that despite Pedialyte\u2019s ability to relieve hangover symptoms, its association with children\u2019s medication may hinder it from effectively expanding into the adult market.\nPedialyte's new campaign uses popular drinking occasions, such as graduation season and St. Patrick's Day, to promote its new product.\nStill, the adult fans of Pedialyte argue that the drink does enough to relieve their hangover symptoms to warrant a place on their bedside cabinet every Sunday morning.\n\u201cWe saw increased use by adults.\u201dAccording to Mason, the drink\u2019s new campaign is aimed to take advantage of the product's potential for entering an adult market.\nThe product\u2019s new \u201cSee the Lyte\u201d campaign cleverly reflects its shift from nursing toddlers back from a bout of a stomach bug to nursing 20-somethings back from a weekend bender."}
