Consumers and politicians, he says, must not focus on drug costs in isolation but should consider them in the context of national health spending \u2014 and the clinical benefits that drugs provide.\n\nThe pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more on federal lobbying than any other industry in 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks money in politics. Within that sector, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America led the list, with $18.4 million in spending on a wide range of health, trade and patent issues. Mr. Ubl\u2019s lobbying powerhouse has members that include giants like Amgen, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Pfizer.\n\nThe group reported total expenses of nearly $208 million in 2014, the most recent available filing with the Internal Revenue Service. Its 170 employees work at its headquarters here, as well as in nine offices in the United States and others in Tokyo and Dubai.\n\nSome of that money is used to cultivate strategic relationships through grants to doctor organizations and nonprofit advocacy groups representing patients with specific diseases like cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes and arthritis. And the organization multiplies its influence through more than 30 lobbying, consulting, communications and law firms.\n\nBut public outrage over drug prices is boiling. John C. Rother, who leads the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, backed by consumer, labor and physician groups, said Mr. Ubl was in an impossible position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe issue is prices,\u201d Mr. Rother said, and the lobby for drug makers, like other trade associations, \u201ccan\u2019t do much on prices without getting into trouble under the antitrust laws.\u201d Any efforts to control or suggest prices raise antitrust concerns, federal officials say.\n\nMr. Ubl (pronounced YOU-bul) said the drug lobby had been effective at beating back proposals like allowing the government to negotiate drug prices or import medicines from Canada. But, he said, it has not been as good at formulating and advancing a positive agenda. He hopes to change that.\n\nPhoto\n\nBrand-name drug companies and manufacturers of lower-cost generic drugs have historically been rivals. But Mr. Ubl said he wanted the government to speed the approval of generic drugs and approve more of them, reducing a backlog of generic drug applications. Increased competition, he said, would help hold down prices \u2014 and could perhaps avoid another outcry like the one over Daraprim, a drug to treat a life-threatening parasitic infection.\n\nTuring Pharmaceuticals, a start-up founded by a former hedge fund manager, Martin Shkreli, acquired Daraprim last year and immediately increased the price to $750 a tablet, from $13.50.\n\n\u201cPeople see a knucklehead like Martin Shkreli raised the price of a 62-year-old drug by 5,000 percent, and they connect the dots in a way that is not helpful or is highly misleading,\u201d Mr. Ubl said.\n\nGeneric drug makers remain wary. The national trade association may endorse swifter approval of generic drugs, but brand-name drug makers often go to court to block copies of their products, asserting that their patents have been infringed.\n\n\u201cSometimes actions speak louder than words,\u201d said Chip Davis, the chief executive of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, the lobby for makers of generic drugs.\n\nOther questions confront the industry\u2019s new chief lobbyist. Betsy M. Imholz, a lawyer at Consumers Union, said brand-name drug companies sometimes obtain patents for small changes or minor variations in their products, allowing them to charge higher prices even though the original versions work just as well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ubl said, \u201cWhat some call small changes are often important clinical advances.\u201d\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said some drug companies had been caught defrauding Medicare and Medicaid while reaping \u201cenormous profits as a result of federal research investments.\u201d\n\nMr. Ubl said drug companies and the government played \u201ccomplementary and collaborative roles,\u201d with drug makers pouring tens of billions of dollars into research and development each year.\n\nMr. Ubl, a Minnesota native, said he was the first person in his family to go to college. He started his Washington career as an aide to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and worked at the trade association for medical device manufacturers for 16 years, including 10 as chief executive of the group, the Advanced Medical Technology Association.\n\nIn recruiting a top lobbyist, drug companies said, they were impressed with Mr. Ubl\u2019s effort to undo a tax on medical devices imposed by the Affordable Care Act. The tax took effect in 2013, but Congress recently approved a two-year moratorium, suspending it until Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nMany Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the device tax, and Mr. Ubl said, \u201cI intend to take the same bipartisan approach at PhRMA.\u201d\n\nMr. Ubl said his interest in biomedical research was personal as well as professional. His 12-year-old son was found last year to have Type 1 diabetes. He is excited about efforts by a small California company to create an artificial pancreas for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes, using human embryonic stem cells.\n\nAs an example of the type of lobbying he admires, Mr. Ubl points to the drug industry\u2019s role in the creation of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare in 2003. Drug makers were initially skeptical but worked with Congress to shape the legislation and liked the final product so much they ran television advertisements supporting it.\n\n\u201cThat is a good analogy for where I want to take this organization \u2014 developing policies that we can advocate in support of, that enhance the private market and address the problem holistically,\u201d Mr. Ubl said. Medicare\u2019s outpatient drug benefit is managed entirely by private companies under contracts with the government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe pharmaceutical trade association supported the Affordable Care Act when it was adopted in 2010. But Mr. Ubl said he was concerned that \u201ctoo many patients\u201d have difficulty gaining access to the drugs they need because of high out-of-pocket costs, \u201cprior authorization\u201d requirements and other restrictions imposed by health plans sold on the insurance exchanges.\n\nMr. Ubl expresses interest in a new model of payment under which insurers pay drug companies based on how well their treatments work in patients. Payment might be linked, for example, to the effectiveness of a drug in preventing heart attacks or curing hepatitis, or its ability to control blood sugar levels in a person with diabetes.\n\nLilly and Anthem, a major insurer, recently announced a joint effort to devise such \u201cvalue-based pricing\u201d arrangements. Novartis, the Swiss drug maker, struck deals with Cigna and Aetna under which payments for a new heart drug would be linked to its effectiveness in reducing hospitalizations for heart failure.",
