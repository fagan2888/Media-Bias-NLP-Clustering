Add this amount to the previous years' donations and the total since the ABC Program's inception in 2001 is an impressive $80,829 for this area.\n\nMore than 300 schools across Kansas, Colorado and Missouri participated in the ABC Program this year, tallying $113,945 in donations from Sunflower Bank. Sunflower Bank has written checks totaling $934,238 to schools and students across the three-state region since 2001.\n\n\"We're excited to be able to donate over $7,700 to the schools and students in our bank's communities,\" said Larry Stringari, Market President Regional Director. \"As we see budgets being cut, and technology driving expenses up, we realize how important it is to invest in our schools and the next great leaders of our communities. We're proud of our amazing customers who partner with us and help us make a positive impact for our youth.\"\n\nDuring the course of the ABC Program, schools and students benefit in three ways:\n\n1. We engage students by drawing five winners from each Sunflower Bank location to receive $10 for every A on their report card, with a matching donation designated for their participating school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. We encourage our customers to designate a participating school which receives 5\u00a2 for every credit transaction completed with their debit card.\n\n3. Additionally, new customers participate by opening a qualifying checking account to earn $50 with a matching donation going to a participating school.\n\nThrough this program and others, Sunflower Bank and its local teams demonstrate their commitment to the communities they serve and their mission of \"Bringing out the best in the lives we touch...Creating Possibility.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28261865/sunflower-bank-donates-more-than-7-700-canon", "modificationDate": "2015-06-07T09:15:44-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0605/20150605__06DRSUNFLOWER~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-06-05T18:20:53-0600", "description": "Wrapping up the 14th year of the ABC Program, Sunflower Bank donated $7,713 to schools and students in the Ca\u00f1on City area.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28261865:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-07T09:15:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28261865/sunflower-bank-donates-more-than-7-700-canon", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0605/20150605__06DRSUNFLOWER~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Wrapping up the 14th year of the ABC Program, Sunflower Bank donated $7,713 to schools and students in the Ca\u00f1on City area.", "title": "Sunflower Bank donates more than $7,700 to Ca\u00f1on City schools, students"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Wrapping up the 14th year of the ABC Program, Sunflower Bank donated $7,713 to schools and students in the Ca\u00f1on City area.", "title": "Sunflower Bank donates more than $7,700 to Ca\u00f1on City schools, students", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28261865/sunflower-bank-donates-more-than-7-700-canon", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0605/20150605__06DRSUNFLOWER~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-07T09:15:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.title": "Sunflower Bank donates more than $7,700 to Ca\u00f1on City schools, students", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0605/20150605__06DRSUNFLOWER~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-06-07T09:16:23-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "article_summary": "(Courtesy Photo)Wrapping up the 14th year of the ABC Program, Sunflower Bank donated $7,713 to schools and students in the Ca\u00f1on City area.\nSunflower Bank has written checks totaling $934,238 to schools and students across the three-state region since 2001.\nMore than 300 schools across Kansas, Colorado and Missouri participated in the ABC Program this year, tallying $113,945 in donations from Sunflower Bank.\nDuring the course of the ABC Program, schools and students benefit in three ways:1.\nAdditionally, new customers participate by opening a qualifying checking account to earn $50 with a matching donation going to a participating school."}
