Flinn's Patient Centered Health Plan is a viable alternative for Obamacare that advocates principles like portability and insurance competition across state lines to lower costs.\n\n(Newswire.net -- April 11, 2014) Memphis, Tennessee --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Flinn Announces Bid for U.S. Senate\n\nDr. George Flinn is running for U.S. Senate to reform our healthcare system.\n\nDr. Flinn is focused on promoting the Patient Centered Health Plan, which can be viewed at http://www.patientcenteredhealthplan.com/. The plan is a viable alternative to Obamacare and advocates portability to eliminate the problem of pre-existing conditions and allows insurance companies to compete across state lines to lower premiums. Flinn believes that Obamacare and the insurance companies are destroying the United States\u2019 health care system. It directly results in job loss, increased health care costs, destroyed doctor/patient relationships, discrimination against married couples and the removal of the health care industry from our free market economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to fix health care,\u201d Flinn said Tuesday morning. \u201cMost people in Washington have given up on fixing it. Its current direction has taken us down the wrong road, in my view. I\u2019ve got a plan called Patient-Centered Plan that will fix our broken health care system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Flinn will take charge to bring accessible and affordable healthcare to all Americans without having the damaging effects of Obamacare. For thirty-five years, Dr. Flinn has dedicated his life to medicine and has improved the health of people in his own community while insisting on the best health care practices. He has treated thousands of patients, each with their own unique circumstances and believes that health care should attend to individualized needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sole focus is to fix our health care system,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not focusing on anything except presenting a plan to fix health care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFlinn For Senate\n\n\n\ninfo@flinnforsenate.com\n\nHttp://FlinnForSenate.com\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Flinn intends to make health care reform his sole election platform.
