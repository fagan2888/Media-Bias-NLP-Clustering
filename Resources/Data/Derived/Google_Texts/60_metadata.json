With American ships still smoldering in the water, Navy Secretary Frank Knox turned to a Texan, Chester Nimitz, to restore confidence in the Pacific Fleet.\n\nRollin Kirby\n\nNimitz was born in Fredericksburg in 1885. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1905 and then served in several command and staff positions, including the new Atlantic submarine fleet.\n\nIn the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, U.S. and Australian forces thwarted Japanese advances and Admiral Nimitz rolled across the Pacific, hopping from island to island including Guadalcanal, Saipan, Guam, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Once bombing attacks began on the Japanese homeland in 1945, a U. S. victory was inevitable.\n\nDespite his success, Nimitz was a modest man. Journalist Robert Sherrod said Nimitz \u201cconceived of war as something to be accomplished as efficiently and smoothly as possible, without too much fanfare.\u201d When the war in the Pacific was finally won, charismatic Army General Douglas MacArthur got the glory. Nimitz never wanted it. He said, \u201cBeing a part of the Navy is honorable and soul-satisfying work,\u201d and that was enough for him.\n\nAfter Nimitz\u2019s death in 1966, his grandfather\u2019s hotel in Fredericksburg became the Admiral Nimitz Museum, now part of the larger National Museum of the Pacific War. There, in a small, landlocked Texas town, visitors can learn more about one of the U.S. Navy\u2019s greatest commanders.\n\n| Houston Public Media\n\nSources:\n\nAmerican Experience: Admiral Chester W.
