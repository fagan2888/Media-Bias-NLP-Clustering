Five of these freshmen broke their campaign promises and voted \u201cyes\u201d on Tuesday to elect Boehner to a third term as Speaker of the House.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRepresentative Gary Palmer (R-AL) was the only one of these six Republican freshmen who honored his campaign promise and voted against Boehner. Palmer cast his vote for Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL). Under the rules of the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House is not required to be an elected member.\n\nIn addition to the six who promised their constituents they would vote against Boehner, incoming Republican freshman Alex Mooney (R-WV) broke a Madison Project Candidate Pledge he signed in December 2013 to vote against Boehner.\n\nAlso, Republican freshman Representative Mark Walker (R-NC) certainly left many of his constituents with the impression that he would vote against Boehner and for Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC). But, as his spokesperson told Breitbart News on Wednesday, Walker was careful to \u201ccontextualize\u201d his comments about his willingness to stand up against Boehner when it was in the interest of his constituents. (See this clip of Walker\u2019s \u201ccontextualizing\u201d in a candidate debate beginning around the 41 minute mark.)\n\nHeading the list of the fork-tongued freshman five is Representative Jody Hice (R-GA), a former evangelical radio talk show host. The Athens Banner-Herald reported that at a July 2014 debate with a primary opponent, \u201cHice said he would support \u2018new leadership, and new leadership with a backbone,\u2019 over Boehner.\u201d\n\nIn November, the Daily Caller reported that Hice was one of three out of 247 in the House Republican Conference who opposed Boehner in a voice vote. But on Tuesday, Hice cast a \u201cyes\u201d vote for Boehner as Speaker. Hice released a statement justifying his vote on Tuesday. \u201c[D]uring my campaign, I emphasized the need for strong conservative leadership in the House of Representatives,\u201d Hice said.\n\n\u201cThat is precisely why when the Republican Conference met in November to elect our Leadership for the 114th Congress, I voted against nominating John Boehner to be the Republican nominee for Speaker,\u201d Hice added. \u201cI was one of three out of 247 members of the Republican Conference to do so. I felt extremely disappointed that many of my conservative colleagues did not join with me in what was our only opportunity to nominate a conservative to represent us on the Floor in January \u2014 who could then marshal 218 votes against Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nSecond on the list of the forked-tongue five is Republican freshman Representative Barry Loudermilk (R-GA). In November, Loudermilk joined Hice as one of the three members of the Republican Conference Committee to oppose Boehner\u2019s re-election as Speaker.\n\nLike West Virginia\u2019s Mooney, Loudermilk signed the Madison Project\u2019s Candidate Pledge to vote against Boehner for Speaker. Further, Dan McLagan, a spokeserson for Loudermilk, plainly told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in February: \u201cHe will not support Boehner as speaker.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Loudermilk now tells Breitbart News, \u201cBarry Loudermilk said on the campaign trail that he felt like it was time for new leadership. He signed a pledge stating that he\u2019d vote against John Boehner at the first reasonable opportunity, which he did at the Republican Conference Committee in November. Congressman Loudermilk was one of only three to vote against Boehner in that conference election.\u201d\n\nThird on the list of the forked-tongue freshman five is Republican freshman John Ratcliffe (R-TX). As The Hill reported in March 2014:\n\nRatcliffe says he\u2019s \u201cnot a labels guy\u201d when asked if he\u2019s a Tea Party candidate but is positioning himself to the right of Hall. The challenger said that if elected, he\u2019d vote for someone other than Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) as Speaker. \u201cI would like to see better leadership at the top, so I would like to have some better choices,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cThere are other people I would support and think would be a better choice than John Boehner. A lot of our leadership, frankly, hasn\u2019t served us well.\u201d\n\nRick Allen (R-GA) is fourth on the list of the forked-tongue freshmen five.\n\nIn a primary debate, Allen stated \u201cyes\u201d when asked if he would vote for new leadership in the House.\n\nA spokesperson for Allen tells Breitbart News, \u201cCongressman Allen did not support Rep. Boehner in the election for Speaker held by the House Republican Conference in November, when Speaker Boehner ran unopposed and became House Republicans\u2019 nominee. Congressman Allen voted for Speaker Boehner in the vote by the full House because Speaker Boehner was the only Republican candidate for the position who articulated a vision for how he would work to advance conservative solutions and achieve the priorities Congressman Allen\u2019s constituents elected him to accomplish.\u201d\n\nThe last of the forked-tongue freshmen five is newly-elected Republican Representative Glenn Grothman (R-WI), who stated in an August 1 debate, \u201cI would have no problem looking for an alternative to Speaker Boehner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no problem standing up to Republican leadership,\u201d Grothman said at the time.\n\nBut after he voted for Boehner on Tuesday, Grothman told WTAQ, \u201cif the party wanted to replace [Speaker Boehner], the time for that should have been right after the November elections.\u201d\n\nUnlike Representatives Hice, Loudermilk, and Allen, Grothman did not vote against Boehner as speaker in November.\n\nRepresentatives Hice, Loudermilk, and Allen have offered only carefully crafted explanations for their changes from \u201cno\u201d votes in November to \u201cyes\u201d votes in January. That\u2019s especially puzzling since Speaker Boehner demonstrated his rejection of conservative principles with his support of 2015 funding for Obamacare and President Obama\u2019s executive actions granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens in the Cromnibus bill that passed a lame duck Congress in December, one month after their November votes and a month before their January votes.\n\nSupporters of limited government, however, can rest easy that despite their votes to re-elect Speaker Boehner, the forked-tongue freshmen five and fellow Boehner supporters Mooney and Walker have announced they will vigorously monitor Speaker Boehner\u2019s devotion to conservative principles.\n\nOn Tuesday, for instance, Representative Hice told his conservative constituents, \u201cI used what leverage I had to convey my principles directly to the Speaker while receiving his assurance that he would use the strength of our Majority to advance conservative solutions. I also received assurances from other conservative Members I was engaging with that if the Speaker does not fight with us, that they would join me in replacing him this Congress.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Walker issued this statement justifying his vote for Speaker Boehner:\n\nShortly after being inaugurated as the new Congressman from North Carolina\u2019s 6th District, Congressman Mark Walker voted to re-elect Speaker John Boehner. This was a difficult vote as I share the frustrations expressed by many of my constituents, but I cast my vote today with a sense of optimism,\u201d said Walker. \u201cToday, the focus needs to be on Republicans re-taking the Senate and the American people\u2019s rejection of President Obama\u2019s go-it-alone style. As a Congress, we are ready to pass sound, pro-growth legislation \u2013 many bills with bipartisan support \u2013 that will help our struggling economy. A change in House leadership, at this time and in this way, would have detracted from our conservative message. I plan to keep the Speaker, and the whole House leadership team, accountable \u2013 to encourage them to pass conservative legislation and not buckle under pressure from the White House or Senate. When I believe legislation is not in the best interests of the 6th District of North Carolina and the American people, I will have no problems voting against leadership. Finally, with respect to the other candidates for Speaker, I do not believe they possess the record of leadership and accomplishment necessary to be Speaker of the House. I cannot just vote for the most conservative candidate when considering a position that is this important to the country. We need a statesman and a full-vetting process. The House Republican conference made their selection in November and a last minute attempt to disrupt the process with insufficiently vetted candidates and minimal resolution strategy is not an earnest effort to bring about true change.\n\nNot to be outdone in expressing conservative principles, Representative Mooney issued this statement explaining his vote for Speaker Boehner:\n\nI made a commitment to my district to consistently support conservative principles in office. That commitment includes the promise to buck leadership\u2019s requests when West Virginia conservative principles call for it. While I take issue with many of Speaker Boehner\u2019s actions in the past there was no alternative candidate with a reasonable chance of success. I have spent my first week in Congress fighting for conservative priorities including co-sponsoring legislation to Audit the Fed, to slash Obamacare at the knees and to pass the Keystone XL pipeline. There may be times I will disagree with some Republican leaders but right now I am focused on uniting the Republican Party to fight the President\u2019s radical agenda and to pass true conservatives priorities.\n\nDespite these self-serving rationalizations from a group of already-compromised newly-elected Republicans, one disturbing fact remains. Representative Gary Palmer (R-AL) is the only incoming Republican freshman member of the House of Representatives who honored his promise to vote against John Boehner as Speaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Forked-Tongue Freshmen Five Who Told Constituents They Would Vote Against Boehner for Speaker Then Broke Their Promises", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Forked-Tongue Freshmen Five Who Told Constituents They Would Vote Against Boehner for Speaker Then Broke Their Promises", "title": "The Forked-Tongue Freshmen Five Who Told Constituents They Would Vote Against Boehner for Speaker Then Broke Their Promises - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP126326621549.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/08/the-forked-tongue-freshmen-five-who-told-constituents-they-would-vote-against-boehner-for-speaker-then-broke-their-promises/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Forked-Tongue Freshmen Five Who Told Constituents They Would Vote Against Boehner for Speaker Then Broke Their Promises", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP126326621549.jpg", "title": "The Forked-Tongue Freshmen Five Who Told Constituents They Would Vote Against Boehner for Speaker Then Broke Their Promises - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Alex Mooney, Barry Loudermilk, Gary Palmer, Glenn Grothman, Jody Hice, John Boehner, John Ratcliffe, Rick Allen,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Rick Allen", "published_time": "2015-01-08T12:17:36-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90e6\"", "article_summary": "In addition to the six who promised their constituents they would vote against Boehner, incoming Republican freshman Alex Mooney (R-WV) broke a Madison Project Candidate Pledge he signed in December 2013 to vote against Boehner.\nFive of these freshmen broke their campaign promises and voted \u201cyes\u201d on Tuesday to elect Boehner to a third term as Speaker of the House.\nLike West Virginia\u2019s Mooney, Loudermilk signed the Madison Project\u2019s Candidate Pledge to vote against Boehner for Speaker.\nSupporters of limited government, however, can rest easy that despite their votes to re-elect Speaker Boehner, the forked-tongue freshmen five and fellow Boehner supporters Mooney and Walker have announced they will vigorously monitor Speaker Boehner\u2019s devotion to conservative principles.\nA spokesperson for Allen tells Breitbart News, \u201cCongressman Allen did not support Rep.
