A central Kansas judge has ruled that a supposed confession by one of five people accused in the killing of a teenager is admissible as evidence during his scheduled May trial.

The Salina Journal reports a Saline County judge rejected 22-year-old Macio Palacio Jr.'s claim that his statements to investigators were improperly obtained.

Palacio is accused of fatally shooting 17-year-old Allie Saum of Salina in May of last year.

Prosecutors have said Saum was shot as she rode in a pickup truck that drove past a group of men who mistakenly thought the driver had been involved in an earlier confrontation.

Saline County Attorney Ellen Mitchell argued that all five men accused in the killing were equally responsible, even though two of the men have claimed they weren't present.
