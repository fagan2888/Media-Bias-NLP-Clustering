Jones III of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania sided with the federal government in dismissing the suit brought by Real Alternatives Inc.\n\nReal Alternatives is a non-profit which operates in Pennsylvania and several other states, providing alternatives to abortion, pregnancy support programs and abstinence education.\n\nIt has three full-time employees, all of whom are lawyers. Each receives health insurance through Real Alternatives that also covers their families.\n\nThe ACA requires employer-provided health plans to cover services including all government-approved contraceptive methods, including things such as birth control pills and the \"morning after\" pill.\n\nThe government views those services as \"preventive care,\" and contends they are \"shown to improve well-being\" while preventing or delaying other medical conditions.\n\nReal Alternatives argued the contraception mandate is, among other things, unconstitutional, and in violation of religious freedom.\n\nReal Alternatives had excluded contraceptive care from its health insurance plan since 2008, and was able to continue doing so until 2014 because its plan was \"grandfathered\" against requirements of the ACA. But the insurer eventually opted to discontinue the plan, and after 2014 Real Alternatives was unable to buy coverage that didn't include contraceptives.\n\nOne of the goals of the the Real Alternatives suit was to obtain a court order to allow it to obtain coverage that doesn't include contraceptives.\n\nOne of the Real Alternatives arguments dismissed by Jones was that the government has no legitimate purpose in mandating people to have benefits they don't want or won't use.\n\nJones wrote, \"Time and again, courts have found a government interest to be compelling even when it does not achieve a benefit for each and every member of the population. Not every person who pays into social security receives or desires its benefits. Not every person who pays taxes receives unemployment benefits, welfare, or a myriad of other services offered by the government through citizens' tax money.\"\n\nJones also addressed what he called an \"issue of great sensitivity\" \u2014 that an employee's health plan covers a whole family, and there might be disagreement within the family over contraception.\n\nHe wrote that if families with religious objections to contraceptive coverage are allowed opt out of such coverage, \"the collective decision could create untold tension and family strife should disagreement over contraceptive coverage arise, which is more likely now that children up to the age of twenty-six may be covered by their parents' plans.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Real Alternatives Inc, health-care, pennsylvania, politics", "title": "Pa. judge rules against anti-abortion-rights organization fighting Obamacare birth control mandate", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Pa. judge rules against anti-abortion-rights organization fighting Obamacare birth control mandate\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2015/12/obama_affordable_care_act_mand.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/nation-world/photo/15680221-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17618635\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-11T13:30:42Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstories\",\"health-care\",\"pennsylvania\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/nation-world/photo/15680221-standard.jpg", "creator": "@DavidRWenner", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "He noted there might be disagreement within a family over contraception."}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, December 11, 2015,  8:47 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/nation-world/photo/obama-contraception-ea3db55d503e4fa1.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Real-Time News from PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/news/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "He noted there might be disagreement within a family over contraception.", "title": "Pa. judge rules against anti-abortion-rights organization fighting Obamacare birth control mandate", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/news/2015/12/obama_affordable_care_act_mand.html", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/nation-world/photo/15680221-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, December 11, 2015,  8:30 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "He noted there might be disagreement within a family over contraception."}, "article_summary": "Each receives health insurance through Real Alternatives that also covers their families.\nReal Alternatives argued the contraception mandate is, among other things, unconstitutional, and in violation of religious freedom.\nJones also addressed what he called an \"issue of great sensitivity\" \u2014 that an employee's health plan covers a whole family, and there might be disagreement within the family over contraception.\nBut the insurer eventually opted to discontinue the plan, and after 2014 Real Alternatives was unable to buy coverage that didn't include contraceptives.\nOne of the goals of the the Real Alternatives suit was to obtain a court order to allow it to obtain coverage that doesn't include contraceptives."}
