Racism has never looked as corny as Michael Pape, a politician running for Kentucky’s first congressional district.

MORE: Donald Trump Releases First Ad — And Yup, He's Still Racist

The Conservative politico recently released an ad for his campaign, and its bigoted portrayals of Mexicans crossing the border into the U.S. is the cheesiest attempt for votes we've seen in a while.

In the video, three men cut through a chain link fence in an effort to bring down Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. One man, however, adds Pape to their list of adversaries, noting he's a "Conservative running for Congress who will help Trump build the wall." After learning that "this Mike Pape" will also help Cruz repeal Obamacare, the two men, with their "Stop Ted Cruz" and "Stop Donald Trump" t-shirts, agree to bring Pape down, too.

The Kentucky man then appears on the screen, ya know, "approving this message," before offering up his big announcement: "no one will stop me from standing up for you."

Interestingly, he wasn’t able to stop the Mexican immigrants, who can be seen running behind the politician in the night.
