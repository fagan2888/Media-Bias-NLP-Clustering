The salt flats are densely packed salt which over time flatten and give the land a glass look due to its smoothness.\n\nLast year's Bonneville races and this years have been canceled due to wet weather. But this cancellation is causing debate on whether or not it is the rain causing the issue or nearby mining depleting the slat flats.\n\nRacers say they\u2019ve worried for decades that mining is draining an aquifer that helps replenish the flats each year, leaving smaller amounts of the smooth, hard salt that makes for a nearly glass-like surface for cars racing across the landscape.\n\nBut Federal land managers who oversee the flats say they don\u2019t have any evidence that the salt is being depleted and point to the heavy rains around the time of the event this year and last year.\n\nThe race track used to be 13 miles in length, now it is only seven miles. These cars can get up to 400 miles per hour on this track and the world record for fastest land speed is held here.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
