The Kansas State Fire Marshal is investigating after firefighters found a woman's body during a fire at her southeast Kansas home.

Crawford County Sheriff Dan Peak says the body of 59-year-old Susan E. Montanye was found Friday in Mulberry.

Peak said Saturday the cause of death has not been determined. He says he doesn't expect the results of autopsy reports to be available until next week.

The Joplin Globe reports firefighters found Montanye's body after fighting the fire for several hours.

No one else was in the home at the time and no other injuries were reported.

The cause of the fire has not been determined.
