The lawsuits threatening to derail it were initially dismissed as ridiculous but became deadly serious by the time Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019s decisive fifth vote two years later barely upheld the law\u2019s individual mandate, while the Court\u2019s decisive 7-2 vote left the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion in tatters.\n\nLast month, the court struck a second blow to the ACA by allowing some for-profit corporations to opt out of offering contraceptive coverage they deemed religiously offensive. And even House Speaker John Boehner is joining in the litigation, using the administration\u2019s efforts to make the law more palatable by delaying implementation of one of its provisions as the centerpiece of his threatened lawsuit against the president.\n\nOPINION: The Supreme Court\u2019s subterfuge\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while Boehner\u2019s empty threat makes headlines, a far more serious threat could deliver the death blow that the law\u2019s opponents have been seeking. This new round of litigation attacks the health insurance exchanges at the heart of Obamacare. Congress designed the exchanges as markets to offer new, comprehensive, and often-subsidized insurance options to supplement the private market. The exchanges are the law\u2019s linchpin \u2014 its primary means of making quality insurance affordable for millions of Americans.\n\nThe ACA required each state to \u201cestablish\u201d an \u201cAmerican Health Benefit Exchange\u201d by Jan. 1. If a state didn\u2019t do so, the Department of Health and Human Services would step in to set up and run the exchange on the state\u2019s behalf. The ACA treats exchanges run by HHS the same as those run by the states themselves. That\u2019s crucial, because 36 states have deferred to HHS to set up their exchanges.\n\nOpponents claim that the 36 states where HHS has set up and operated an exchange don\u2019t have \u201cstate-established exchanges\u201d at all. They argue that those states instead have \u201cfederally established\u201d exchanges, even though that language appears nowhere in the law.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name? Everything, say the challengers. They point to one sub-sub-section of the ACA that refers to an \u201cexchange established by a state\u201d to argue that people buying insurance on federally-administered exchanges are ineligible for the tax credits the ACA provides to make insurance affordable for millions of lower-income Americans.\n\nDISCUSS: Is the ACA doomed?\n\nIf the challengers prevail, people of modest means in 36 states would be doubly damned. Besides being deprived of affordable care, they would also be subject to a tax penalty for not complying with the ACA\u2019s requirement that they buy insurance. That penalty was designed to work in tandem with the tax credit: a penalty if you don\u2019t buy insurance, but financial assistance to help you afford it. The challengers are trying to eliminate the carrot while keeping the stick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCongress almost certainly didn\u2019t intend this harsh result. In including the phrase \u201cexchange established by a state\u201d in the ACA, Congress probably meant to include those indirectly established by states that opted to pass to the federal government the burden of setting up and running these novel exchanges.\n\nChallengers argue that Congress actually wanted to create this strange distinction among the 50 states \u2014 that lawmakers aimed to hold each state\u2019s poorest residents hostage in order to pressure the state into creating and operating its own exchange. Ascribing that twisted view to Congress would offend core conservative principles of federalism. What\u2019s more, it might even be unconstitutional, since Congress cannot penalize people for failing to buy insurance they cannot afford \u2014 or penalize states for exercising their rights as sovereign.\n\nAlthough the ACA\u2019s latest challengers should lose the cases they are pressing in four different federal courts, it\u2019s uncertain whether the Supreme Court, which alone can finally resolve the issue, would agree.\n\nJustices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito passionately denounced the entire ACA as unconstitutional in 2012, and Scalia and Thomas famously pooh-pooh talk of congressional \u201cintent,\u201d insisting on reading statutes literally. Believing as a matter of constitutional principle that the ACA exceeded Congress\u2019s authority, they\u2019re unlikely to be troubled by knowing that the challengers\u2019 reading of the ACA would eviscerate its ability to achieve the law\u2019s aims of near-universal health care coverage.\n\nRELATED: After Hobby Lobby, time to face the real war on religion\n\nFour other justices \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan \u2014 have long believed in interpreting ambiguous statutes in a way that carries out their underlying purposes and makes them workable. Thus those four would almost certainly reject the challengers\u2019 reading of the ACA.\n\nSo, when this case ultimately reaches the court, the ACA\u2019s fate would again rest in the hands of Roberts, just as it did in 2012. If Roberts is true to his pragmatic judicial philosophy, he should find the challengers\u2019 reading unconvincing. He has repeatedly held that, where fairly possible, a court should interpret an ambiguous law in a way that avoids finding the law unconstitutional. It was that principle that led him to vote to uphold the individual mandate and should lead him to side with the Obama administration in this latest round of attacks.\n\nThe huge uncertainty is whether he would do so again or would conclude that, because Congress created the present problem by its careless drafting, it\u2019s up to Congress to fix it. Because Congress isn\u2019t likely to come to the rescue, the health care of millions of Americans hangs in the balance.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2022 Discuss: The outlook for the Affordable Care Act\n\n\u2022 Jeff Jacoby: The way to alter the Constitution is by amendment, not interpretation\n\n\u2022 Judge\u2019s blog on Hobby Lobby criticized\n\n\u2022 Supreme Court rulings jolt women\u2019s groups into action\n\n\u2022 After Hobby Lobby, time to face the real war on religion", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.296084003", "eomportal-id": 526273, "description": "A new round of litigation attacks the health insurance exchanges at the heart of Obamacare.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "A new round of litigation attacks the health insurance exchanges at the heart of Obamacare.", "title": "A death blow for Obamacare? - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/07/18/death-blow-for-obamacare/ilXv6eZOTsQoBzw0vGzq1I/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/07/17/BostonGlobe.com/EditorialOpinion/Images/0718oped_tribeCad.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Supreme Court,health benefit exchange,Congress,lawsuit, Laurence H Tribe, John A  Boehner, Antonin  Scalia, Anthony M  Kennedy, Clarence  Thomas", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 20:03:44 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Supreme Court,health benefit exchange,Congress,lawsuit, Laurence H Tribe, John A  Boehner, Antonin  Scalia, Anthony M  Kennedy, Clarence  Thomas, Samuel A Jr  Alito, Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, Stephen G  Breyer, Sonia  Sotomayor, Elena  Kagan, Barack  Obama,Senate,House of Representatives, Health and Human Services Department, Supreme Court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "c907cbcc-0dc1-11e4-9351-fb3e22086765"}, "article_summary": "This new round of litigation attacks the health insurance exchanges at the heart of Obamacare.\nOPINION: The Supreme Court\u2019s subterfugeAdvertisementBut while Boehner\u2019s empty threat makes headlines, a far more serious threat could deliver the death blow that the law\u2019s opponents have been seeking.\nCongress designed the exchanges as markets to offer new, comprehensive, and often-subsidized insurance options to supplement the private market.\nLast month, the court struck a second blow to the ACA by allowing some for-profit corporations to opt out of offering contraceptive coverage they deemed religiously offensive.\nThe ACA required each state to \u201cestablish\u201d an \u201cAmerican Health Benefit Exchange\u201d by Jan. 1."}
