Media outlets hunting down the outrage and publicizing it as a relatively cheap way to score hits from people who like to be outraged about the outrage of other people followed not long after. For the Coca-Cola commercial, reaction tweets were posted at USA Today, E! Online, the Daily Mail, Talking Points Memo, Mediaite, and likely others.\n\nIn each case, a handful of tweets are intended to serve as evidence as some sort of widespread attitude among a certain demographic, which will then subsequently be used to judge a much larger group of people. Thus, we had the infamous MSNBC Cheerios tweet that assumed right-wingers would hate an advertisement that featured a biracial family.\n\nBut is there any substantive evidence that this outrage actually existed to a degree large enough to justify multiple media reports? It certainly doesn\u2019t seem like it, but man, aren\u2019t those easy stories to put together? Toss a few search terms on Twitter and you can find all sorts of opinions! Reporters can put together \u201cman on the street\u201d stories without ever even leaving their desks or actually interacting with any other human beings at all!\n\n\u201cMan on the Street\u201d pieces were never all that interesting or useful to begin with, but at least it involved an actual person in an actual place who chose to share his or her opinions to a reporter for our evaluation. This nearly contextless sharing of random angry tweets illuminates even less. But it\u2019s good for stirring up a round of counteroutrage, isn\u2019t it? And that counteroutrage at some anonymous, undefined number of people behaving badly on the Internet makes some others feel more superior, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nBelow, the ad:\n\nI am outraged by how utterly pedestrian it is.
