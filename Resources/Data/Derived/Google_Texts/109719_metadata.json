The Atlantic has done our best to bust this myth, but there's no killing some summer earworms, and so, like a particularly terrible Top 40 DJ, here comes Mort Zuckerman, spinning the old track on the Wall Street Journal op-ed page.\n\nIt's impossible to briefly sum up Zuckerman's argument\u2014\"The Full-Time Scandal of Part-Time America\"\u2014which is a collage of bad stats and randomly drawn lines of causality. The gist is that the U.S. economy only makes part-time jobs now, and Obamacare is hastening the demise of full-time work.\n\nThe easiest way to fact-check the claim that part-time work is rising is to measure Americans working part-time who want to work full time\u2014i.e. \"for economic reasons.\" It turns out that the entire increase in part-time employment happened before Obamacare became a law in 2010. [Y-axis in 1,000s]\n\nThis Is 'Part-Time America': I\n\nFRED/BLS\n\nAs for the claim that involuntary part-time work is replacing full-time work? I think these two lines tell you all you need to know [Y-axis in 1,000s, again]:\n\nThis Is 'Part-Time America': II\n\nThree thoughts for the road:\n\n1) Most people working part-time want to work part-time because they're in school, or they're raising kids, or they consider themselves mostly retired. Don't pay attention to anybody who's using the number of stay-at-home dads and moms to argue that Obamacare is destroying full-time work.\n\n2) Last fall, the Fed produced a useful document explaining that \"current levels of part-time work are largely within historical norms, despite increases for selected demographic groups, such as prime-age workers with a high-school degree or less.\"\n\n3) If you insist on being a pessimist, here's a very smart way to express fear about the future of part-time work, also from the Fed. There are some industries, such as hotels, food service, and retail, that have historically had shorter workweeks and more part-time workers. If those sectors continue to grow faster than the overall economy (because other sectors, like government and manufacturing, are shrinking), then we should expect part-time work to remain elevated. Indeed, the relative strength of those industries today is one reason why part-time work hasn't declined even faster than it has.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president&#39;s critics love this talking point.
