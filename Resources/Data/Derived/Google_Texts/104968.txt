WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) â€” Former Kiss lead guitarist Ace Frehley has been hospitalized for exhaustion and forced to cancel a show in New York.

A post on his website and Facebook page says he was admitted to a hospital after Friday's show at the F.M. Kirby Center in Wilkes-Barre (WILKS'-ba-ree), Pennsylvania. The post says his symptoms are due to "exhaustion and dehydration."

Frehley's website says he "reluctantly" agreed to cancel Saturday night's sold-out show at The Chance in Poughkeepsie (poh-KIHP'-see).

The site says he had to cancel a show April 9 in New Hope, Pennsylvania, after a band member was sick.

The 64-year-old Frehley has been touring all month.
