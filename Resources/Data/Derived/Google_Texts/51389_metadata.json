REUTERS/Dominick Reuter (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS BUSINESS) - RTR3GTIN\n\n4401102\n\nInfamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber has parted ways with the firm Picwell, a government contractor set to analyze the health care choices made by Obamacare customers this enrollment season.\n\nGruber was previously touted as part of Picwell\u2019s expert team as it launches a major project to analyze all of the choices made by Obamacare enrollees during the open enrollment period that began on November 15. But now Gruber\u2019s photo and bio has been removed from the firm\u2019s website.\n\nPicwell is comprised of major Obamacare-world players, including former top UnitedHealthCare official Jay Silverstein.\n\nGruber once said that \u201cseniors do a terrible job choosing\u201d health care plans, so it would have been difficult for him to continue getting paid by the firm that will be advising the government on how to change plans based on customers\u2019 choices.\n\nAs The Daily Caller extensively reported, Gruber called the American people \u201cstupid\u201d when detailing the deceptions that he crafted with President Obama in the Oval Office during the writing of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cPicwell will utilize de-identified data provided by state exchanges to measure and analyze the choices made by enrollees during the 2014 open enrollment period,\u201d according to one of the first state exchanges to recently hire Picwell: Minnesota\u2019s exchange MNsure.\n\nMNSure CEO Scott Leitz said in October, \u201cWe are thrilled to work with Picwell on this groundbreaking study, the results of which will enable us to provide Minnesotans with the technology support needed to choose the right health plan with confidence.\u201d\n\nPicwell did not immediately return a request for comment as to whether Gruber was fired or resigned from the firm. The Daily Caller will update upon receiving comment.\n\nAn attempt to reach Gruber by phone at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was not successful.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "MIT professor infamously called the American voters \"stupid\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Infamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber has parted ways with the firm Picwell, a government contractor set to analyze the health care choices made by Obamacare customers this enrollment season.", "title": "Jonathan Gruber Canned By Firm That Tracks People\u2019s Obamacare Choices For Government", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/05/jonathan-gruber-canned-by-firm-that-tracks-peoples-obamacare-choices-for-government/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JonathanGruber.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Picwell will utilize de-identified data provided by state exchanges to measure and analyze the choices made by enrollees'", "title": "Jonathan Gruber Canned By Firm That Tracks People\u2019s Obamacare Choices For Government Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/05/jonathan-gruber-canned-by-firm-that-tracks-peoples-obamacare-choices-for-government/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JonathanGruber.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-05 22:15:16", "sailthru.title": "Jonathan Gruber Canned By Firm That Tracks People's Obamacare Choices For Government", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jonathan gruber,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Infamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber has parted ways with the firm Picwell, a government contractor set to analyze the health care choices made by Obamacare customers this enrollment season.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JonathanGruber.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd797\"", "article_summary": "REUTERS/Dominick Reuter (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS BUSINESS) - RTR3GTIN4401102Infamous Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber has parted ways with the firm Picwell, a government contractor set to analyze the health care choices made by Obamacare customers this enrollment season.\nDr. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the healthcare reform laws in Massachusetts and the American Affordable Care Act.\nEconomist Jonathan Gruber listens during a conference of the Workers Compensation Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, March 12, 2014.\nGruber was previously touted as part of Picwell\u2019s expert team as it launches a major project to analyze all of the choices made by Obamacare enrollees during the open enrollment period that began on November 15.\nAn attempt to reach Gruber by phone at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was not successful."}
