2016 Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Jeb Bush face off at dueling town hall events in New Hampshire, capping a day of campaigning in the early-voting state. His plan frames Walker’s solution as an alternative to Clinton’s positions on health care, and the digital ad follows the same framework as his written plan. “But Hillary Clinton buys two and weeps”.

I’ve encountered this a lot in politics where people think that the answer is a lot more complicated than it really is. The ad makes no mention of the back-and-forth, but asks, “Who will win the fight to repeal and replace Obamacare?” before showing the text of remarks made by conservatives praising a Walker’s plan.

“Somebody needs to explain to her that taking risks with American’s secrets when you’re the secretary of state is not a laughing matter”. After months of Clintonesque stonewalling, during which Hillary repeatedly misled the public and the media, the FBI has seized Clinton’s private email server and a backup storage device. Some conspicuous failures – among them Russian Federation, Libya, Syria – implicate Hillary.

So now we’re supposed to believe that not only did Hillary not know what it meant to wipe a server clean, but her communications director-who by the way uses computers to electronically communicate with supporters and the press-didn’t know either? Now, as she seeks the White House again, Clinton has tried to pull a few pages from Obama’s playbook.

Democrats are approaching RED-Alert panic.

Questions remain: Will President Barack Obama direct his politically-militarized Justice Dept.to protect Hillary? If Hillary escapes and wins, the Clintons will prevail. She has said, had she, she would have done it differently. Will an egocentric Obama accept a Clinton-centric Democratic Party?

Whenever she crashes, pre-primary, primary or general election, Hilary’s wholly-predictable wreck will be anticlimactic.
