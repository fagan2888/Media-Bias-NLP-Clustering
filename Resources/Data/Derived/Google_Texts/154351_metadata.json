Also, obesity levels among Asians in general are lower than the state averages, but Filipinos have a higher rate [of obesity] and double the diabetes rate.\u201d\n\nSimilar disparities in care and health crop up in the Latino population, too. Different subgroups experience the health care system differently, he said, depending on country of origin.\n\n\u201cTheir health needs are far from homogeneous,\u201d Grant said. \u201cAnd in terms of policy-making it\u2019s clear that different needs apply to different groups.\u201d\n\nOne bill dealing with the issue of ethnic subgroups was passed by the Legislature this year, but Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it.\n\nBrown called the bill \u201cunnecessary\u201d in his veto message for AB 176 by Assembly member Rob Bonta, D-Oakland.\n\n\u201cI am wary of the ever growing desire to stratify,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDividing people into ethnic or other subcategories may yield more information, but not necessarily greater wisdom about what actions should follow.\u201d\n\nTo researchers who believe more information better informs policy, them\u2019s fighting words.\n\n\u201cAs long as the state puts its head in the sand and fails to acknowledge these differences,\u201d Grant said, \u201cthey won\u2019t be able to address the disparities in health care within those groups.\u201d\n\nGrant said the October release of updated survey data could help inform the discussion, for example, about insuring the undocumented population in California or addressing health disparities of specific ethnic population subsets.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind the profiles is to highlight information for groups that don\u2019t have a lot of data associated with them,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really unique here is the detailed breakdown of the variety of Latino and other ethnic groups. The power of these data is that we can show \u2026 how the communities are different.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For starters, the obesity rate for Asians is lower than the state average, but for Filipinos specifically, it's much higher.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"UCLA Researchers Find Health Differences Within Ethnic Groups\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/11\\/ucla-finds-health-differences-within-ethnic-groups\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-11 15:50:57\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-11 15:50:57\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":106635,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Asian Health\",\"Latino Health\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/iStock_000017129026_Large-e1447285796406.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "For starters, the obesity rate for Asians is lower than the state average, but for Filipinos specifically, it's much higher.", "title": "UCLA Researchers Find Health Differences Within Ethnic Groups", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/11/ucla-finds-health-differences-within-ethnic-groups/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/iStock_000017129026_Large-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "asian health,latino health,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Different subgroups experience the health care system differently, he said, depending on country of origin.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really unique here is the detailed breakdown of the variety of Latino and other ethnic groups.\nThere are major differences in health care status among different types of Asians and Latinos in California \u2014 and yet the state so far has resisted treating those subgroups differently, according to UCLA researchers who released an updated version of health survey data last month.\n\u201cAnd in terms of policy-making it\u2019s clear that different needs apply to different groups.\u201dOne bill dealing with the issue of ethnic subgroups was passed by the Legislature this year, but Gov.\n\u201cLooking at different groups in the survey information busts a lot of myths,\u201d Grant said."}
