Nikki Haley (R-SC) urging Republicans to resist the temptation to follow the \u201csiren call of the angriest voices\u201d in her GOP response to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cOK, first of all Nikki, this afternoon said I\u2019m a friend of hers,\u201d he said. \u201cActually a close friend. Wherever you are sitting Nikki, I\u2019m a friend. We\u2019re friends. That\u2019s good. She did say there was anger. I\u2019m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our health care is horror show. ObamaCare \u2014 we\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. And I won\u2019t be angry when we fix it but until we fix it, I\u2019m very, very angry. I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn\u2019t offended. She said the truth. One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry. I said to myself, huh, she\u2019s right. I\u2019m not fighting that. I didn\u2019t find it offensive at all. I\u2019m angry because our country is a mess.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump to Nikki Haley: Yes, I'm 'Very Angry!' --- I Gladly Wear the 'Mantle of Anger'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump to Nikki Haley: Yes, I'm 'Very Angry!' --- I Gladly Wear the 'Mantle of Anger'", "title": "Trump to Nikki Haley: Yes, I'm 'Very Angry!' - I Gladly Wear the 'Mantle of Anger' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/trump-hale.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/14/trump-to-nikki-haley-yes-im-very-angry-i-gladly-wear-the-mantle-of-anger/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump to Nikki Haley: Yes, I'm 'Very Angry!' --- I Gladly Wear the 'Mantle of Anger'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/trump-hale.jpg", "title": "Trump to Nikki Haley: Yes, I'm 'Very Angry!' - I Gladly Wear the 'Mantle of Anger' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Trump to Nikki Haley - Yes, I'm 'Very Angry!'
