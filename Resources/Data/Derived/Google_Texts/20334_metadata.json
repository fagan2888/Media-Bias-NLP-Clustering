It led to an awkward slash role when deep down McNichols wanted to be a running back.\n\nThe debut to his sophomore season Friday night against Washington showed McNichols is capable of being the featured running option for the No. 23 Broncos.\n\n\u201cIt feels great they\u2019re featuring me,\u201d McNichols said after rushing for 89 yards and two touchdowns in Boise State\u2019s 16-13 season opening win. \u201cPlaying running back full-time is a lot better because I can put my mind to one thing and focus on it.\u201d\n\nHow Boise State was going to replace Jay Ajayi was one of the biggest questions heading into the season. Ajayi finished with 1,823 yards rushing and 28 touchdowns last year, numbers that would appear impossible for just one back to try and replicate.\n\nAnd it was clear from the start that it will be a group effort for the Broncos. McNichols was the workhorse with 24 carries, but Stanford transfer Kelsey Young and Devan Demas got their share of turns in the backfield.\n\nYoung finished with 48 yards on 13 carries, while Demas averaged 5 yards per carry in limited action.\n\n\u201cI thought all three of them had their moments in the game,\u201d Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said. \u201cWe will have learned something about our running backs after watching them play and watching them play in our offense this year and the style that we are playing with and what that means moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe advantage for whoever is carrying the ball for the Broncos is running behind an offensive line that started two seniors and two juniors against the Huskies and for a half dominating the line of scrimmage.\n\n\u201cThey get off the ball and make holes and that makes it easy for us,\u201d McNichols said.\n\nIf there was a frustration, it was Boise State\u2019s inability to sustain what was accomplished in the first half. McNichols ran for 70 of his 89 yards in the first two quarters. The Broncos had 152 yards rushing in the first half, but managed 33 yards in the second half. Boise State had four three-and-out drives in the second half after having scoring drives of 16, 13 and 11 plays in the first half.\n\nPart of that was a pass game that struggled and allowed Washington\u2019s defense to stack the line against the run. Ryan Finley was 16 of 26 for 129 yards, but the Broncos were unable to push the ball downfield.\n\nHarsin knows it won\u2019t be easy to become consistent on offense, and it won\u2019t get any easier with a game coming up this weekend at BYU.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be more balanced and that\u2019s a matter of watching and learning from what we did in this game,\u201d Harsin said, \u201cand coaches and players evaluating that and going back and improving in those areas.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeremy McNichols is thrilled to have only one position to worry about.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jeremy McNichols is thrilled to have only one position to worry about.", "title": "McNichols takes lead in No. 23 Boise State\u2019s running game", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/6/mcnichols-takes-lead-in-no-23-boise-states-running/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/9c650157e9ff1b27810f6a706700e905.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/9c650157e9ff1b27810f6a706700e905.jpg", "description": "Jeremy McNichols is thrilled to have only one position to worry about.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "McNichols takes lead in No. 23 Boise State\u2019s running game"}, "Author": "TIM BOOTH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca92c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI thought all three of them had their moments in the game,\u201d Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said.\nAs a freshman last season, Boise State tried to take advantage of his running and pass catching.\n\u201cIt feels great they\u2019re featuring me,\u201d McNichols said after rushing for 89 yards and two touchdowns in Boise State\u2019s 16-13 season opening win.\nBoise State had four three-and-out drives in the second half after having scoring drives of 16, 13 and 11 plays in the first half.\nThe debut to his sophomore season Friday night against Washington showed McNichols is capable of being the featured running option for the No."}
