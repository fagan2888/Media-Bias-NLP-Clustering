One in five organizations reported leveraging their benefits program to retain employees.\n\nHowever, several studies claim women are too busy putting the financial needs of others ahead of themselves to do more than sock money away as a way of planning for retirement. They are also supposedly more averse to investment risk than men, less engaged in investment decision-making and trade less often.\n\n[Also: The latest hospital C-suite titles]\n\nA 2013 Merrill Lynch study debunked these money differences, saying women and men invest similarly when they have the same financial knowledge.\n\nGetting women to the table to gain this knowledge is the challenge.\n\nA Fidelity Investments survey revealed 77 percent of women who work in healthcare are comfortable talking to a doctor, while only 47 percent feel comfortable talking to a financial advisor, according to Alexandra Taussig, senior vice president marketing and business strategy.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked,\u201d Taussig said.\n\nThe survey results point to a confidence mismatch between the sexes, she said.\n\n\u201c(Women think) \u2018I don\u2019t have the experience and I haven\u2019t done the research,\u2019\u201d Taussig said. \u201cIn the broader psyche, women are focusing on what they don\u2019t know; men are focusing on what they do know.\u201d\n\nTo reach women, the financial services firm partnered with hospitals to talk to nursing staff. The biggest challenge was finding a time and place to meet employees who are on the job at all hours. Financial counselors took to roaming hospital hallways and break rooms.\n\nWhat has worked even better has been a \u201cgirl\u2019s night out.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, BayCare in Florida held three of these sessions between September and December. The event of social hour, light dinner and speaker was an immediate hit, according to Barbara Wilson, BayCare\u2019s retirement manager.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nInstead of the 65 attendees expected, 200 showed up, she said. Women of all ages attended.\n\n\u201cEmployees came from hospitals 45 minutes away,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe thought we would mostly get women from our main office. The reality was, they were coming from everywhere.\u201d\n\nBayCare has a retirement plan that matches the first 6 percent participants put into it, said Wilson. The provider cannot offer advice, but it did provide the tools for guidance.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know how to ask the questions,\" Wilson said. \"I think that was the crux of the whole thing. We just kind of put it in front of them: here\u2019s an opportunity. They took advantage of it.\u201d\n\nThe sessions addressed topics including money within a marriage, the basics of stocks and bonds and retirement planning.\n\nBayCare expects to hold another workshop this year.\n\nWomen do worry about money and retirement, Taussig said. Most nurses are saving the 10 to 15 percent of salary Fidelity recommends. Those aged 20 to 29 years old are saving a bit less, she said.\n\n\u201cWomen want something that\u2019s relatively easy. They\u2019re looking for something that \u2013 they\u2019re so busy \u2013 they want something that\u2019s turn-key to help them feel on track,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cWe took the paralyzation away. There\u2019s nothing like being validated to get people to take action.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-staffers-focus-better-benefits-women", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/woman-doctor-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Providers find retirement, financial planning for women in healthcare has high importance.", "title": "Healthcare staffers focus on better benefits for women"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/woman-doctor-feature.png"}, "description": "Providers find retirement, financial planning for women in healthcare has high importance.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthcare staffers focus on better benefits for women"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In an industry three-quarters female \u2013 though still outnumbered by men in the C-suite \u2013 healthcare providers are looking to women\u2019s retirement needs as both a recruitment and retention tool.&#13; Retirement savings and planning is second only to healthcare benefits in recruiting highly-skilled employees, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.
