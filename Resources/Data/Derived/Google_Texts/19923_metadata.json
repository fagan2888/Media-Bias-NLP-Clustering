But it will not let them do their jobs.\n\n\n\nA National Park Service employee posts a sign closing access to the Lincoln Memorial following the government shutdown. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Ad Policy\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner says of his government shutdown: \u201cThis isn\u2019t some damn game.\u201d\n\nHe is right.\n\nWhen the federal government shuts down, as it has because of Boehner\u2019s decision to play politics with the traditionally perfunctory continuing resolution process, the people that Americans trust to serve the common good and the national interest are sidelined.\n\nYes, of course, politicians pick on federal employees in general and public workers in particular. But even the most over-the-top members of Congress recognize that a civil society is made possible by dedicated public servants who manage our parks, maintain our highways, process claims for pensions, keep job-training programs up and running, investigate civil rights violations and do their best to protect a fragile environment.\n\nGovernment workers form the human infrastructure that underpins a great deal of what is good and necessary in the American experiment. We the people care for one another, we take on great challenges, we achieve great things, and we do this by forming a more perfect union and asking some of our fellow citizens to do perform the tasks that are necessary to its maintenance.\n\nFederal workers are essential.\n\nThose workers take on responsibilities that are required by law, in positions established by the Congress, in fields that have been determined to be essential to the maintaining of the American enterprise. Yet, they are now deemed \u201cnonessential\u201d\u2014sent to the sidelines so that John Boehner can play what he certainly seems to be treating as a game.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t having a heart attack and don\u2019t need their wounds dressed, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that what we do over the long term makes an absolute difference to the quality of life in this country,\u201d Carolyn Federoff, an attorney with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Boston, explained after she was furloughed. \u201cI never doubt that.\u201d\n\nShe ought not doubt that.\n\nAnd she might be intrigued to learn that, while they may not say it in so many words, members of Congress agree. Even the members who are perpetuating the shutdown.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutdown_employees_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "John Nichols", "description": "The House votes 407-0 to guarantee back pay for federal employees after the government shutdown, but it will not let them do their jobs.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "The House votes 407-0 to guarantee back pay for federal employees after the government shutdown, but it will not let them do their jobs.", "title": "Yes, Federal Workers Are Essential", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/yes-federal-workers-are-essential/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutdown_employees_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T05:52:11+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The House votes 407-0 to guarantee back pay for federal employees after the government shutdown, but it will not let them do their jobs.", "title": "Yes, Federal Workers Are Essential", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/yes-federal-workers-are-essential/", "image": {"height": 400, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutdown_employees_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutdown_employees_ap_img.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "October 6th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "Yes, Federal Workers Are Essential", "keywords": "government shutdown, federal employees, congress, John Boehner, House of Representatives, Republicans, John Nichols, The Nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 108565, "sailthru.tags": "Budgets,Congress,Economy,Labor,Politics,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "The Nation", "published_time": "2013-10-06T12:05:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:52:11+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/JohnNichols/"}, "sailthru.description": "The House votes 407-0 to guarantee back pay for federal employees.
