Washington has one of the highest asthma rates countrywide, and the ones suffering from the disease live in the poorest communities of the city, where asthmatic children have ten times more chances of visiting the emergency room as compared to wealthy neighborhoods. Studies suggested that highly dangerous air in the communities for kids to breathe is laced with exhaust.

Thus advocates were deeply concerned when they heard about announcement made by officials this year that they are looking forward to come up with a new shelter meant for homeless families in the largest bus garage in the district, which has a length of that of football field, and is among the city’s largest exhaust producer, the component which is called asthma trigger.

Announced in February, the proposal belongs to a controversial plan of shutting down DC General Hospital, which used to serve as the city’s shelter for 247 homeless families, and send the occupants of the shelter into seven new facilities evenly spread citywide.

A few of the selected facilities would materialize in rich, green neighborhoods anchored by Whole Foods and Metro stops. However, the Ward 5 region is located at the back of barbed wire off Bladensburg Road near a concrete facility and gargantuan warehouse. The Environmental Protection Agency mentioned the facility two times in 2014 for improper management of dangerous waste.

The quality of the air surrounding the garage is the main concern of attorneys for the homeless and pediatricians, and the environmental health advocates.

According to the estimations of Elizabeth Gates, a Unity Health Care pediatrician who has carried out treatment of numerous children put up at DC General, one-third of them had asthma, an issue which as per her is generally more prevalent in homeless children.
