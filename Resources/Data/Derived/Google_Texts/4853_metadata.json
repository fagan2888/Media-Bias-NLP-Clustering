But they will need to work with a certified insurance agent, certified enrollment counselor, Covered California call center representative or county eligibility worker to complete their applications.

That's halfway between a revised goal of 6 million and the original target of 7 million. The first goal was scaled back after the federal website's disastrous launch last fall, which kept it offline during most of October.\n\nBut the system had seemed to right itself since then -- and in some ways, Monday's problems were the price of popularity. While many Republican politicians continue to demand a shutdown of the health care law and some applicants are seeing higher insurance bills, many others are getting cheaper, better health coverage -- or are able to afford insurance where they could not before.\n\nThe insurance markets -- or exchanges -- offer subsidized private health insurance to people who don't have access to coverage through their jobs. Much like the federal government's deadline reprieve announced last week, Lee said the new rules would operate on an honor system. Those who don't sign up by April 15 face a penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater.\n\nThe Covered California web site is being monitored so that during high volume periods, the web site will stop applications at the \"save\" juncture of the process, and alert them that their applications can be completed later.

Another hiccup in early afternoon temporarily kept new applicants from signing up, and then things slowed further. Overwhelmed by computer problems when it launched last fall, the system has been working much better in recent months, but independent testers say it still runs slowly .\n\n\"This is like trying to find a parking spot at Wal-Mart on Dec. 23,\" said Jason Stevenson, working with a Utah nonprofit group helping people enroll.\n\nAt times, more than 125,000 people were simultaneously using the federal government's insurance exchange HealthCare.gov, straining it beyond its capacity. For long stretches Monday, applicants were shuttled to a virtual waiting room where they could leave an email address and be contacted later.\n\nOfficials said the site had not crashed but was experiencing very heavy volume.\n\nIn California, as the hours crept by, those unable to make it online headed out to take advantage of the very solution Lee would recommend by early evening: certified insurance agents and enrollment counselors.\n\nAt an early Monday event at Berkeley City College, Sam Burd, a Covered California certified educator, was directing a health care sign-up organized by Volunteering for Oakland.\n\nHe said he expected about 70 people to sign up. An hour before the event closed, Burd said he was seeing more adults in the 18-34 age group and more Latinos enrolling than at previous events also hosted by the organization.\n\nBoth groups' enrollment numbers have been lagging, a concern to insurers who had hoped each demographic, which tend to be younger and healthier, would balance out the risk pool of sicker and older enrollees.\n\nGary Flaxman, 52, of Oakland, was among those happy to sign up for a plan under the landmark health care law, even though he said he doesn't need health insurance at the moment.\n\n\"Having said that, I'll probably get hit by a car when I walk out of here,\" joked Flaxman, an unemployed accounting consultant.\n\nStaff writers Matt O'Brien and Doug Oakley and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_25462673/obamacare-applicants-flood-health-insurance-web-exchanges-california", "sailthru.author": "By Tracy Seipel    tseipel@mercurynews.com", "ag": {"canon": "TheMercuryNews:article:25462673:view"}, "startDate": "2014-04-01T12:39:39-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "mercurynews.com", "description": "As a result of Monday's website problems, Covered California will allow anyone who was unable to create an online account an extension until April 15.
