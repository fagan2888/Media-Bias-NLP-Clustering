In 2009, End the Fed by former US Representative Ron Paul (R-TX) made it onto the New York Times bestseller list, and the \u201cEnd the Fed!\u201d rallying cry has become familiar to many.\n\nHowever, with Ron Paul\u2019s prominence fading (now out of office) and still no serious audit for the quasi-governmental institution, let alone its outright elimination, one wonders how the stream of heightened understanding can turn into an unstoppable wave. G. Edward Griffin and Murray Rothbard laid much of the historical groundwork with The Creature from Jekyll Island and The Origins of the Federal Reserve, respectively, but their laudable work has failed to captivate the wider public.\n\nThere remains a need for documentaries, books, and advocacy organizations with messages both accessible to the layman and resilient in the face of scrutiny from academics and policy specialists \u2014 along the lines of the Atlas Network\u2019s Sound Money Project, the Independent Review, and the Mises Institute. Consequent awareness will pave the way for the adoption of viable, non-governmental alternatives, such as bitcoin and digital currencies delineated in gold.\n\nCorbett to the Rescue?\n\nWith this reality at the forefront of my mind, I tuned in to James Corbett\u2019s documentary, Century of Enslavement: The History of the Federal Reserve, released in early July 2014. One can listen to it in audio form, which is what I did as I drove to and visited where it all began: Jekyll Island, Georgia \u2014 after handing over a few Federal Reserve notes to gain entry.\n\nCorbett is a podcaster and self-styled \u201copen source intelligence\u201d journalist, based in Japan and supported by audience donations. Once one gets past his distinct, techie voice, the painstaking depth of his research is the most striking feature of the film. He packs a lot of detail into the 90 minutes, and his website provides a 13,000-word transcript.\n\nHis website also offers brochures (see below), so people can easily spread the word, in addition to free video and audio downloads for offline storage. The lack of any user fees or paywalls affirms Corbett\u2019s desire not only to inform, but to motivate people to bring about change.\n\nThe gauge by which one can assess Century of Enslavement, then, is (1) whether it will bring awareness to new demographics and (2) whether it will motivate the choir into activism.\n\nSpeaking as a member of the choir, number two is where the film has value to offer. We can easily get wrapped up in popular topics of the day, while the Fed\u2019s problems fail to come up on the news radar \u2014 aside from gibberish about Open Market Operations. Corbett\u2019s film will awaken sympathetic viewers from their stupor, as it reaffirms the urgency and all-encompassing nature of the problem.\n\nAt the outset, there is a telling clip of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (1987-2006): \u201cThere is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take,\u201d and his successor Bernanke echoes the need for \u201cindependence.\u201d After all, the Fed is a cartel with a monopoly on the money supply in the United States and various other countries \u2014 \u201ca well-organized gang of crooks,\u201d in Corbett\u2019s words.\n\nIn particular, Corbett goes after the Fed\u2019s benign \u201chistory as told by the victors,\u201d and includes the story of the secretive 1910 meeting on Jekyll Island, with a cameo from G. Edward Griffin. Then, alongside the Fed\u2019s failure to stop business cycles, he presents the ramifications of its protected, beyond-crony status: how it promotes inordinate financial-industry influence over the US federal government, and the nation\u2019s tendencies towards excess spending and war \u2014 not to mention the redistributive inflation tax on all people who carry US dollars.\n\nThe Big But\n\nThe presence of loose, doomsday language, however, is immediate, pervasive, and likely to put many people off, particularly those unaccustomed to Corbett\u2019s brand of anti-establishment media. This is where Century of Enslavement falls short on the first criterion of appeal to new demographics.\n\nCorbett\u2019s own narration begins with the following: \u201cAll our lives, we\u2019ve been told that economics is boring; it\u2019s dull; it\u2019s not worth the time it takes to understand it; and all our lives, we\u2019ve been lied to\u201d \u2014 followed by a jarring explosion that cuts to a crying baby.\n\nNewcomers are likely to be less forgiving and simply dismiss him as a conspiracy nut.\n\nWhen I hear such sweeping statements, which are sensationalist and simply untrue in many instances, I sense the presence of a sophist. The Fed\u2019s story is compelling and can stand on its own, without such dramatic ploys. Newcomers are likely to be less forgiving and simply dismiss him as a conspiracy nut.\n\n\u201cWar, poverty, revolution; they all hinge on economics,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd economics all rests on one key concept: money.\u201d Corbett has yet to get past his third minute, and he has already turned off many in the economics profession. As Lionel Robbins explained in 1932, scarcity is the underlying principle of economics: the \u201crelationship between given ends and scarce means.\u201d\n\nWe are fortunate to have many outstanding free-banking economists in our era, including Lawrence White and George Selgin, who both blog and engage with popular media \u2014 yet they do not feature at all. Instead, Corbett presents nonspecialists such as Michel Chossudovsky of the less-than-credible, anti-capitalist Center for Research on Globalization and Andrew Gavin Marshall of the brazenly Marxist, \u201cworking-class\u201d Hampton Institute, both based in Canada.\n\nEven worse, some of Corbett\u2019s assertions exude condescension towards the wider public: \u201cNot one person in a hundred,\u201d he says, \u201ccould answer \u2026 basic questions about money.\u201d With barely a few YouTube clips as evidence, Corbett then seeks to explain why US Americans are purportedly so ignorant of the Fed and monetary economics, and to assert that the ignorance is planned.\n\nHad he looked for surveys on the matter, he would have found that 70 percent of US Americans support a public audit of the Fed, and 16 percent want it completely eliminated. In a 2010 Bloomberg poll, only 37 percent favored the Fed\u2019s status quo.\n\nRedeeming Qualities?\n\nThe challenge of a documentary on a topic as important and far reaching as the Fed is not an easy one, particularly given the potential to get lost in technical details and never-never land speculation. Although far more successful at generating attention, Aaron Russo\u2019s America: Freedom to Fascism (2006) fell prey to a lack of precision, and The Money Masters (1996), at 3.5 hours, was only appealing to the diehards.\n\nOne saving grace and advantage that Century of Enslavement has over earlier films and presentations is timing. Corbett\u2019s venture comes at a critical juncture: the tail end of the Great Recession and the budding of alternative currencies.\n\nCentral banking is not a permanent, unshakable fixture \u2026 there are profitable, practical alternatives available.\n\nAfter detailing the colossal bailouts to the financial industry, Corbett gives the final 10-15 minutes to the next step, mediums of exchange that can make central banking obsolete. This is where the film shines and conveys optimism, that central banking is not a permanent, unshakable fixture; rather, there are profitable, practical alternatives available.\n\nCorbett then poses the question to each of us: will the challenge \u201cbe answered by an informed, engaged, active population working together to create viable alternatives \u2026 or it will be answered by the same banking oligarchy that has been controlling the money supply \u2026 for generations\u201d?\n\nHe intends for this film to contribute to the former, but whether it will drive more people away than it will motivate and educate hangs in the balance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pernicious, unaccountable nature of the Federal Reserve is seeping into the mainstream, but how can the understanding can turn into an unstoppable wave?", "generator": "Give v1.4.5", "og": {"site_name": "PanAm Post", "description": "The pernicious, unaccountable nature of the Federal Reserve is seeping into the mainstream, but how can the understanding can turn into an unstoppable wave?", "title": "Hyperbole the Fatal Flaw of Corbett's New Anti-Fed Documentary", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4128, "identifier": "https://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/federal-reserve-jekyll-island.jpg", "height": 2034}, "updated_time": "2014-08-20T13:23:12-04:00", "url": "https://panampost.com/fergus-hodgson/2014/08/20/hyperbole-the-fatal-flaw-of-corbetts-new-anti-federal-reserve-documentary/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The pernicious, unaccountable nature of the Federal Reserve is seeping into the mainstream, but how can the understanding can turn into an unstoppable wave?", "creator": "@FergHodgson", "image": "https://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/federal-reserve-jekyll-island.jpg", "title": "Hyperbole the Fatal Flaw of Corbett's New Anti-Fed Documentary", "site": "@PanAmPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002447837660, "app_id": 272171646459645, "pages": 197511413705974}, "google-site-verification": "ypzV0RhKyEDAxsbXG0ThtpSGZ18ECcSk-fWHTlztAQQ", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/PanAmPost", "published_time": "2014-08-20T06:00:36-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FergHodgson", "section": "Cronyism", "modified_time": "2014-08-20T13:23:12-04:00", "tag": "Fed"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Corbett\u2019s film will awaken sympathetic viewers from their stupor, as it reaffirms the urgency and all-encompassing nature of the problem.\nEspa\u00f1olThe pernicious, unaccountable nature of the Federal Reserve System is gradually seeping into the mainstream.\nWith this reality at the forefront of my mind, I tuned in to James Corbett\u2019s documentary, Century of Enslavement: The History of the Federal Reserve, released in early July 2014.\nCorbett\u2019s venture comes at a critical juncture: the tail end of the Great Recession and the budding of alternative currencies.\nOne can listen to it in audio form, which is what I did as I drove to and visited where it all began: Jekyll Island, Georgia \u2014 after handing over a few Federal Reserve notes to gain entry."}
