Two emotions with which we\u2019re likely to become extremely well acquainted the longer we spend with the news are fear and anger.\n\nThe news leaves us in no doubt that there are a lot of things in the world which we should be very scared about: extraterrestrial objects, mutating viruses, office furniture, technology \u2026 In relation to these and many other ills, the news directs us to adopt a distinctive stance: one of timidity, panic and fragility. Our chances of surviving the difficulties facing humanity are deemed to be very slim \u2013 though slightly increased if we habitually keep up with the headlines.\n\n2. In its stoking of our fears, the news cruelly exploits our weak hold on a sense of perspective.\n\nIn the visual arts, having perspective means a capacity to see different things in their true spatial relations: what is far away looks distant and smaller, what is near looks closer and larger. It was surprisingly difficult for artists to learn how to achieve perspective on a canvas \u2013 which suggests that the manoeuvre may be equally challenging in other areas of our lives.\n\nApplied to the news, having perspective involves an ability to compare an apparently traumatic event in the present with the experiences of humanity across the whole of its history \u2013 in order to work out what level of attention and fear it should fairly demand. With perspective in mind, we soon realize that \u2013 contrary to what the news suggests \u2013 hardly anything is totally novel, few things are truly amazing and very little is absolutely terrible. The revolution will not mean the end of history; it will just change a lot of things in many different small and complicated ways. The economic indices are grim, but we have weathered comparable drops many times over the last century and even the worst scenarios only predict that we will return to a standard of living we had a few decades ago, when life was still possible. A bad avian flu may disrupt international travel and defeat known drugs for a while, but research laboratories will eventually understand and contain it. The floods look dramatic, but in the end they will affect merely a fraction of the population and recede soon enough. Cancers and heart attacks have multiple causes that we may never understand completely, but eternal life was never on the agenda. Rome fell, but 600 years later everything was almost back to normal again.\n\nOur capacity for calm ultimately depends on our levels of expectation: if we suppose that most things normally turn out to be slightly disappointing (but that this is OK); that change occurs slowly (but that life is long); that most people are neither terribly good nor very wicked (and this includes us); that humanity has faced crisis after crisis (yet muddled through) \u2013 if we are able to keep these entirely obvious but highly fugitive thoughts alive in our minds, then we stand to be less easily seduced into panic.\n\nBut we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if this kind of stoicism is of no interest whatsoever to the news, for it has sound commercial incentives for overemphasizing our vulnerability. Naturally the news badly needs its audience to feel agitated, frightened and bothered a lot of the time \u2013 yet we have an even greater responsibility to try to remain resilient.\n\n3. When news isn\u2019t frightening us, it is often busy enraging us. The ability to post comments at the end of online news stories has revealed a hitherto unimaginable level of anger in the population at large. To judge from the comments, it would seem that most of us are completely furious most of the time.\n\nBeneath the rage, one senses a touching belief that the problems of the world are basically solvable, it\u2019s just they aren\u2019t being dealt with swiftly or decisively enough for the simple reason, to which every new day provides fresh testimony, that we are ruled by crooks and idiots. The relevant insights are there, just in the wrong hands. Herein lies a central paradox of the news: it gives us the tools to develop views on serious and consequential decisions which have a direct impact on our lives. It invites us to the conference table and into the parliament, it introduces us to the key players, then it shows us nothing but inexplicable delays, strange compromises and maddening evasions. It can feel as though we are daily being invited to watch helplessly while a close friend drowns behind a plate-glass window.\n\nThe news routinely tantalizes us with the promise of drastic change and improvement. It anoints certain politicians as visionaries and expresses confidence that they can fundamentally transform the nation within a few months of attaining office. It breathlessly awaits the arrival of the new head of the central bank, who might liberate the slumbering energies of capitalism. It takes us to conferences and encourages us to believe that the delegates might in three days of horsetrading solve some of the major issues of the globe, relating to economics, African poverty or the warming of the atmosphere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anger is really a sign of hope -- and belief that the world can, and must, be better than it is", "title": "Outrage is actually optimism: We\u2019re mad because people should be better", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Anger is really a sign of hope -- and belief that the world can, and must, be better than it is", "title": "Outrage is actually optimism: We\u2019re mad because people should be better", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/22/outrage_is_actually_optimism_were_mad_because_people_should_be_better/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/outrage_screens-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anger is really a sign of hope -- and belief that the world can, and must, be better than it is", "title": "Outrage is actually optimism: We\u2019re mad because people should be better", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/outrage_screens-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alain de Botton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Media Criticism, Outrage, Woody Allen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd36f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Editor's Picks, Media Criticism, Outrage, Woody Allen, Technology News, Business News, Life News, News1.\nThe revolution will not mean the end of history; it will just change a lot of things in many different small and complicated ways.\nIn its stoking of our fears, the news cruelly exploits our weak hold on a sense of perspective.\nCancers and heart attacks have multiple causes that we may never understand completely, but eternal life was never on the agenda.\nIt breathlessly awaits the arrival of the new head of the central bank, who might liberate the slumbering energies of capitalism."}
