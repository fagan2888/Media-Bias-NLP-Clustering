Olivier Douliery/Getty Images\n\nPresident Barack Obama has been under his own type of quarantine \u2013 a political one that\u2019s kept him safely away from Democrats on the 2014 campaign trail.\n\nSo it had to be liberating for the shunned commander in chief to hop back on the hustings Tuesday night in Wisconsin for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke.\n\n\u201cThe folks on the other side, they\u2019re counting on you being cynical. They\u2019re figuring you won\u2019t think you can make a difference,\u201d a visibly animated Obama said at a Milwaukee high school in an area where he captured 99 percent of the vote in 2012. \u201cDon't be cynical. Be hopeful. Cynicism is a choice. And hope is a better choice.\u201d\n\nThe speech was a reprise of Obama's historic 2008 campaign theme of hope and change at a time when deep disillusionment and disappointment plague the sixth year of his presidency. Not a single Democratic U.S. Senate candidate has campaigned publicly with Obama this year, fearing the appearance would reinforce the central attack line Republicans are launching against them.\n\n\u201cAs President Obama appears with Mary Burke, voters must remember that the president\u2019s failed policies are on the ballot this November,\" Joe Fadness, executive director of the Wisconsin GOP, said ahead of the visit.\n\n[READ: Wisconsin's Amazing Race]\n\nBut Obama\u2019s re-emergence on the campaign trail in the final week before the 2014 midterms underscores that he remains a political utility \u2013 even if only a very limited one \u2013 as he drops into heavily urban areas to motivate his most fervent supporters to vote in a slate of key gubernatorial contests.\n\nObama will visit Portland, Maine, on Thursday and then make weekend stops in Detroit, Philadelphia and Bridgeport, Connecticut. Each trip is on behalf of a candidate for governor in a blue state he carried in the past two presidential elections.\n\nThe question that hangs over Obama\u2019s light, last-minute campaign jaunt is whether he can stir loyal Democrats to participate in midterm elections that Republicans are more enthusiastic about, according to polls.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Burke is essentially even with GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who is expected to pursue a 2016 presidential bid if re-elected Tuesday to a second full term. Because there are few undecideds remaining in the contest, Burke is essentially trying to drive up turnout among Democrats who powered Obama\u2019s two victories there.\n\nWith an approval rating of 46 percent, Obama is also more popular in Wisconsin than he is nationally and in most other states. Burke\u2019s political brain trust essentially calculated the polarizing president still could provide a boost in a race that will be determined by which party\u2019s base is more motivated.\n\n[ALSO: Enemy at the Executive Mansion Gates]\n\nBurke adviser Joe Zepecki said the decision to bring the president into the state was about \u201craising buzz and awareness\u201d for Burke, as only a president can do.\n\n\u201cBut it feels like the awareness is higher than I\u2019d thought,\u201d he said, taking measure of the mood in the room Tuesday. \u201cI was genuinely surprised by the number of times the \u2018Mary, Mary\u2019 chant broke out. They know her and know what she\u2019s about. We just gotta get \u2018em out.\u201d\n\nMoving just enough votes \u2013 perhaps even as few as a couple thousand \u2013 could make the difference in races in which the president is being welcomed to campaign.\n\nIn Maine, one poll taken last week showed Democratic Rep. Mike Michaud tied with GOP Gov. Paul LePage. In Connecticut, the latest Quinnipiac University survey found Republican Tom Foley knotted with Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy.\n\n[ALSO: Two Races Making the Right Nervous]\n\nObama isn\u2019t talking to Republican voters, or even trying to convince undecideds at this late point in the game. He\u2019s stoking issues like a minimum wage hike, pay equity for women and Medicaid expansion paid for by his Affordable Care Act to animate his own.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, Democrats lost the governor\u2019s race in Wisconsin by just 10 votes per ward. Ten votes,\u201d Obama said Tuesday night. \u201cTen votes could be the difference between an economy that works for everybody, or an economy that just works for the few. Your vote will decide the course that Wisconsin takes.\u201d\n\nObama undoubtedly will shoulder a considerable portion of the blame if his party turns over the Senate and sheds a significant amount of House seats.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Barack Obama Finds a Midterm Mission", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Wisconsin is the first stop in a last-minute campaign spree by the president.", "title": "Obama Finds a Midterm Mission", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/10/29/barack-obama-finds-a-midterm-mission", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/78/8e/89bb395c4ad9a7188d5c62688165/141029-obama-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wisconsin is the first stop in a last-minute campaign spree by the president.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Barack Obama Finds a Midterm Mission"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 29, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,Pulse,picks,2014 Congressional elections,Obama, Barack,campaigns,politics,elections,Walker, Scott,governors,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Wisconsin is the first stop in a last-minute campaign spree by the president."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca990\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI was genuinely surprised by the number of times the \u2018Mary, Mary\u2019 chant broke out.\nPresident Barack Obama returns to the White House after a campaign rally with Democrats in Wisconsin on Tuesday.\nTen votes,\u201d Obama said Tuesday night.\nIn Wisconsin, Burke is essentially even with GOP Gov.\nOlivier Douliery/Getty ImagesPresident Barack Obama has been under his own type of quarantine \u2013 a political one that\u2019s kept him safely away from Democrats on the 2014 campaign trail."}
