As soon as Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of a lawsuit against TABOR.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision, say activists involved in the case, will have huge implications \u2014 not just for Colorado and its budget, but also for the ability of all states to run their governments as they see fit.\n\n\u201cThe People of Colorado have chosen to maintain a direct voice in the state\u2019s tax policy and overall level of appropriations. Plaintiffs here challenge that choice and ask the federal courts to undo it,\u201d wrote attorneys for the state in their filings with the high court.\n\n\u201cWhether the federal judiciary can interfere in this sort of intrastate governance dispute is of fundamental importance,\u201d they added.\n\nAt the heart of the case is an unusual legal question that is \u2014 depending on the observer \u2014 either a novel approach to the law or a \u201ctoo cute\u201d reading of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nPlaintiffs in the anti-TABOR lawsuit, who include state Sen. Andy Kerr and House Speaker Dickey Lee Hullinghorst, have made the argument that the law robs state legislators and local government officials of their \u201cauthority to tax.\u201d\n\nThey contend that TABOR\u2019s requirement that all tax increases get the approval of Colorado voters is a violation of the constitutional mandate that each state have a \u201crepublican\u201d form of government \u2014 i.e., one in which elected officials make decisions instead the masses.\n\nBy forcing the legislature to get permission through a statewide ballot question each time it wants to raise taxes, Colorado\u2019s government is no longer republican, they argue. Instead, it\u2019s a direct democracy.\n\n\u201cColorado is the only state in the history of the Republic to strip its state and local elected officials of the power to tax and so limit their ability to spend,\u201d wrote the plaintiffs in their filing to the high court.\n\nWhile odd, even opponents admit the plaintiffs\u2019 strategy has been successful so far.\n\nFocusing on the \u201crepublican\u201d angle is not an argument that \u201ccomes up too often\u201d \u2014 at least not with \u201cserious plaintiffs,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute, one of several outside groups to file briefs last year in opposition to the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it is a serious (question) with good lawyers on both sides, and that (the lawsuit) has gone this far, is notable in itself,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking it to courtFirst filed in 2011, the lawsuit got a major break last year when the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the plaintiffs had the right to take legal action. That was a setback for Colorado officials and Gov. John Hickenlooper, who wanted the court to kill the lawsuit on the grounds that U.S. courts generally have steered clear of these types of political questions.\n\nIf the lower-court ruling stands, the state has argued, Colorado \u201cwill be the first state in the country to be required to prove, to a federal judge\u2019s satisfaction, that it is adequately republican.\u201d\n\nNow, Colorado is asking the Supreme Court to weigh in on that question \u2014 whether the courts should even intervene in this dispute \u2014 and the high court\u2019s response will go a long way in determining the future of the lawsuit.\n\nOn Friday, the justices were scheduled to consider the Colorado case, and an answer could come as soon as this week.\n\nState officials are hoping the high court agrees to hear that line of attack \u2014 as it would give them another shot at killing the lawsuit. If the Supreme Court declines, however, the plaintiffs are in a strong position to move ahead with their anti-TABOR lawsuit.\n\nEither way, a final decision will have a big impact on Colorado, as the TABOR restrictions have been a part of state canon for so long that any change would upend the way the budget works.\n\nAt the start of Colorado\u2019s legislative session last week, lawmakers already were arguing about what to do with money tied to TABOR.\n\nIn addition to its restriction on new taxes, the law also puts a cap on revenue raised by the state. If Colorado collects taxes above the TABOR limit, the state must either refund the money to residents or ask them for permission to spend it.\n\nAs much as $200 million could be on the line this year, and lawmakers are divided on whether to return the money or spend it on programs such as education.\n\nHickenlooper said last month that he supports a refund, but lamented the formula that allows TABOR to put a bind on Colorado\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should get rid of TABOR,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people should have the right to vote. But they need to have the facts. Inflation plus population growth doesn\u2019t solve all the fiscal challenges we need.\u201d\n\nMark K.
