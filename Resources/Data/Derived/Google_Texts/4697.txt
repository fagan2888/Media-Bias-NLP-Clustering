Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson told Fox News host Sean Hannity Thursday night that the main reason for the world’s turmoil is the absence of Jesus. Robertson reviews the five ideologies of the 20th century: Nazism, Shintoism, Communism, Islam, and Atheism–none of which include Jesus.

“No Jesus with Hitler, with the Nazis. No Jesus. They wanted to dominate the world and they were famous for murder. The Shintoists came along. No Jesus there, Sean. They were famous for murder. They wanted to conquer the world. Look at the blood that was spilled with those two. Then comes Communism. No Jesus with them either and they wanted to conquer the world and they slaughtered millions. So you have murder, murder, murder.”

Robertson went on to compare the patterns of these ideologies with Islamic terrorism.

“Then this latest crop pops their head up. It’s just an ideology under the guise of a religion. They want to conquer the world. There’s no Jesus with them either, and they’re famous for murder.”

The Duck Dynasty star cited the “no Jesus” and “murder” similarities with the political correctness crowd in the White House, Hollywood, and universities. “And they have killed about 55 million of their own children over the last 30 years.”

Robertson explained that people will substitute a theory or ideology when there is an absence of God.

“These materialists, these hedonists, these atheists, agnostics, it just goes on, idealism, determinism. There’s always an -ism or a theory that people expound on, Sean, when there is no Jesus.”

True to his faith, Robertson declared,“I’m sticking with Jesus, myself, man.”

Robertson quoted Patrick Henry regarding the founding of America.

Hannity wrapped up the interview by telling Robertson that he should be a pastor.

“I think you’re a pastor at heart. I think you have pastor written all over you.”
