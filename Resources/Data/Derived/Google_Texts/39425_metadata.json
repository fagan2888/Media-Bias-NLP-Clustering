Louie Gohmert. Hannity is a conservative pundit for Fox News. He\u2019s had Gohmert, an outspoken critic of Obama, on his show a number of times. The Tyler Republican has even filled in hosting Hannity\u2019s show on a few occasions.\n\nTurns out, Hannity may have his own political ambitions in the Lone Star state.\n\n\u201cThe answer is yes, I\u2019d think about it,\u201d Hannity said when a viewer asked via Facebook about his inclination to run for office eventually. \u201cIt would either be in Texas or Florida.\u201d Hannity, who has indicated he\u2019s leaving what he calls \u201canti-conservative\u201d New York, later contrasted the state with Texas.\n\n\u201cHow does Texas have a $12 billion surplus when they\u2019re in debt up to their eyeballs in Albany?\u201d he asked. He indicated Texas and Florida\u2019s lack of income tax were appealing lures.\n\nOther Texas conservatives have also invited high-profile guests to the president\u2019s big speech. Rep. Steve Stockman has invited Chad Henderson, the former Obama volunteer who told reporters in October about his success signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Later, he revealed he did not actually enroll.\n\n\u201cI look forward to giving Chad the opportunity to attend the State of the Union Address. Now when President Obama speaks about ObamaCare the media will have someone they can cut to,\u201d said Stockman in a statement. \u201cI encourage the President to acknowledge him and his story.\u201d\n\nStockman\u2019s no stranger to inviting controversial guests. Last year, he invited rockstar and gun advocate Ted Nugent. Nugent caused an outcry during the 2012 presidential elections when he said he would end up \u201cdead or in jail\u201d if Obama was re-elected.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMS9zZWFuLWhhbm5pdHktdG8tYXR0ZW5kLXN0YXRlLW9mLXRoZS11bmlvbi1hcy1yZXAtZ29obWVydHMtZ3Vlc3QtbWF5LXJ1bi1mb3Itb2ZmaWNlLWluLXRleGFzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Nick Swartsell", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The guest list for President Obama's upcoming State of the Union address just got more interesting.
