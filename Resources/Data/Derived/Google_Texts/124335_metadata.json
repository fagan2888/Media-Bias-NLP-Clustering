But herds can be spooked. . . . When that occurs, those who resisted the herd may find themselves rewarded. We believe that we are approaching such a point.\"As for the economy, Schiff notes that GDP growth decelerated to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 5 percent in the third. And several economic indicators, including consumer spending, have shown weakness in recent weeks.As for stocks, Robert Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which encompasses 10 years of earnings, shows the market is overvalued, Schiff says. The CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 27.9.So where should investors turn? Gold mining and energy stocks, Schiff says. \"The good news is that unloved assets may be attractively priced.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obama, regulations, economy, growth", "pubdate": "2015-03-04T06:00:05", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Obama's regulatory policies and poor economic incentives have cost the U.S. economy approximately $1.7 trillion of GDP per year, according to Investor's Business Daily editors.", "title": "Investor's Business Daily: Obama's Regulations Have 'Strangled' Economy", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Obama-regulations-economy-growth/2015/03/03/id/627965/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Obama-regulations-economy-growth/2015/03/03/id/627965/", "title": "Investor's Business Daily: Obama's Regulations Have 'Strangled' Economy", "description": "President Obama's regulatory policies and poor economic incentives have cost the U.S. economy approximately $1.7 trillion of GDP per year, according to Investor's Business Daily editors.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "epoch": 1425448805, "google-site-verification": "G8ES7h3vwQTlFRuKZLTkGYYr-GOyLKJVunu1JffVHbs", "keywords": "Obama, regulations, economy, growth", "article": {"section": "StreetTalk", "published_time": "2015-03-04T06:00:05"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Obama-regulations-economy-growth/2015/03/03/id/627965/", "description": "President Obama's regulatory policies and poor economic incentives have cost the U.S. economy approximately $1.7 trillion of GDP per year, according to Investor's Business Daily editors."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a5d\"", "article_summary": "\"As for the economy, Schiff notes that GDP growth decelerated to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 5 percent in the third.\nGold mining and energy stocks, Schiff says.\n\"But Obama's sweeping indictment of the financial advisory industry sounds like another 'us against them' assault on wealth and investment.\nThe CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 27.9.So where should investors turn?\n\"The good news is that unloved assets may be attractively priced.\""}
