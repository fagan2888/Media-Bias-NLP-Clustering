CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: 2014 Outlook: Nonprofit Continuing Care Retirement Communities: http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=726239

The 2014 outlook for U.S. nonprofit continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) is stable reflecting stable to improving occupancy levels, manageable expense bases, and continued access to affordable capital, according to Fitch Ratings in its outlook report for the sector.

'Consistent financial performance over past two years has been helped by an operating environment that has significantly improved since 2008, with residential real estate price gains driving much of the change' says Gary Sokolow, Director in Fitch's Non-Profit Health Care Group. 'Fitch believes the stable operating environment will continue in 2014.'.

Along with the housing market improvement, demand for services remained strong, which led to a further strengthening in occupancy gains seen in 2013. Expenses remained manageable, led by labor and insurance, two areas that have historically been concerns.

Despite a rise in interest rates in the latter half of 2013, Fitch expects capital spending to accelerate in 2014 as CCRCs look to remain competitive, meet demand, and address older sections of their campuses.

Fitch views an increase in the rate of unit turnover above actuarial predictions as an emerging challenge. This can weaken operating performance as communities incur elevated renovation and marketing costs, and realize lower monthly service fee revenues.

While CCRCs have little direct exposure to the changes under the Affordable Care Act, the emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions and delivering high quality post-acute and rehab care is expected to further benefit many CCRCs.
