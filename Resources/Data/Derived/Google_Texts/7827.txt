Fox News bloviator Bill O’Reilly keeps insisting that America has no problem with racism and with an increased scrutiny on the symbolism of the Confederate Flag, he’s gone into an even deeper defensive crouch.

During his show last night, O’Reilly took issue with Americans who insist on addressing institutional racism, arguing that America suffers from no endemic of racism.

“The world is being told by anti-American haters that we are a rank, racist society, and that is a lie,” O’Reilly yelled to Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers.

“I don’t think it’s an epidemic of racism, I don’t think it’s engrained in this society and every country on Earth has racist elements in it,” he continued.

When Powers mentioned that the U.S. has a legacy of slavery, O’Reilly retorted, “So what?”
