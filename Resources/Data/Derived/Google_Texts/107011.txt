Linebacker Brandon Marshall was disappointed he wasn’t chosen for the Pro Bowl on Dec. 22, but he received another honor Friday.

Marshall was selected as the 2015 recipent of the Darrent Williams Good Guy Award presented by the Denver chapter of the Pro Football Writers of America.

The annual award is voted on by the Denver media based upon the player who shows cooperation with the press in good and bad times.

“To me it means a lot because I was raised on integrity,” he said.

Marshall is the ninth straight defensive player to win the award. Former Broncos defensive tackle Terrance Knighton won the award last season.

Ward, Marshall questionable

No player has been ruled out for Sunday’s regular season finale against San Diego.

Safety T.J. Ward and Marshall are both listed as questionable with sprained ankles.

Coach Gary Kubiak said Ward should start, but may be on a snap count. Ward is only a week or two away from being 100 percent with no limitiations.

Kubiak also said Marshall “has a shot” to play Sunday after he practiced for the first time all week Friday.

Healthy bunch

The Broncos had 100 percent practice participation Friday for the first time since Sept. 24.

Peyton Manning was listed as probable for Sunday’s game and will be the No. 2 QB behind Brock Osweiler.

Safety Omar Bolden is expected to be available for the first time since Dec. 6.

Footnotes

With a win Sunday, Gary Kubiak would tie Red Miller (1977) for the most wins by a head coach in Broncos history.

Denver has beaten San Diego in eight of their last nine contests.
