His exploits had him climb Mt. Vesuvius, fly over Paris at night in a stolen plane and attend night Mass at the Vatican.\n\nComing down the stairs during a visit was Pope Pius XII and his entourage. People knelt, prayed and kissed the papal ring. The pope spoke to each person in his or her language.\n\nWhen it was his turn, Simmons thrust out his hand.\n\n\u201cPrivate James Simmons, Monongahela, Pennsylvania,\u201d the soldier barked.\n\n\u201cWhere is that?\u201d the pope responded.\n\nSimmons and two members of a heralded air squadron were inducted Saturday into the Tuskegee Airmen Memorial of the Greater Pittsburgh Region in Sewickley Cemetery. Honored were Lt. Martin M. Law of Donora and Sgt. Howard A. Tibbs of Salem, Ohio. All three men are deceased.\n\nAbout 70 people, including family members and veterans, attended the ceremony.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather, like many of these men, came back from the war and didn't talk about it,\u201d said Troy Simmons, 39, of South Orange, N.J. \u201cIf they were here, they would tell you that they were just trying to do their jobs. And a large part of that was staying alive and coming back.\u201d\n\nThe $300,000 memorial, the largest outdoor monument for Tuskegee Airmen in the country, opened in September 2013.\n\nIt features four mourning benches, a bronze relief of Western Pennsylvania airmen and a monument with an airplane tail sculpted from red granite flanked by two towers etched with 85 names of pilots, bombardiers, navigators and support crew from across the region.\n\nLaw, Simmons and Tibbs make Nos. 86, 87 and 88.\n\nOne day, the monuments could memorialize more than 100 men who hailed from Pittsburgh and across Western Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWe have a pool that we are double-checking. We are still looking for names and getting them verified,\u201d said Regis Bobonis Sr. of Sewickley, 89, senior founder and chairman of the memorial.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania set the record with 55 Tuskegee Airmen having roots here, Bobonis said.\n\n\u201cSo you can imagine an extraordinary number of men came out of Western Pennsylvania,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great part of history. This is a great group of men and a source of pride for our region.\u201d\n\nDuring World War II, the group became the first black pilots in American armed forces history.\n\nThe squadron served mainly in the Army Air Forces' 332nd Pursuit Group but also in the 447th Bombardment Group.\n\nThe Tuskegee name came from an all-black flight training program the Army established in Tuskegee, Ala. The group earned its nickname \u201cRed Tails\u201d from the paint on its signature P-51 Mustang fighter planes.\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen earned more than 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 714 Silver and Gold Cluster Air Medals. In 2007, President George W. Bush and Congress honored 350 Tuskegee Airmen and their families with the Congressional Gold Medal, the most prestigious award Congress can bestow.\n\nBlacks and others who endured less than full citizenship status but who fought for the United States in the Civil War and other conflicts need to be recognized, said Tibbs' son, Philip Tibbs, 58, of Newark, Ohio.\n\n\u201cHowever we consider ourselves, we are of one race,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is the human race.\u201d\n\nA field commander gave Law the nickname \u201cJohnny Come Lately,\u201d said his daughter, Iris Law Ivey, 57, of Atlanta. Law bounced around bases before landing at the Tuskegee training camp. The war ended before he reported to Europe.\n\nThough he never flew a mission, Ivey said, her father's love of his squadron and flying never waned. He owned two airplanes, belonged to a flying club and served as commander of the Donora Civil Air Patrol.\n\n\u201cMy father loved flying. We spent many a Sunday afternoon in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he was so proud of the Tuskegee Airmen.\u201d\n\nJason Cato is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
