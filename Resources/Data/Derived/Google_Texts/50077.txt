Written by Nick Field, Contributing Writer

State Treasurer Rob McCord announced the endorsement of Hershey’s Chocolate Workers in his bid for the Democratic nomination for governor.

The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers (BCTGM) Local 464 formally endorsed Rob McCord’s campaign today. An AFL-CIO affiliate, the Local 464 or “Chocolate Workers” represent more than 3,000 workers in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

“Since our historic strike in 1938, the Chocolate Workers Local 464 has been committed to serving the working families of Pennsylvania, and we know that’s a commitment Rob McCord shares,” said Local 464 Business Manager Dennis Bomberger. “Treasurer McCord has shown he has the experience and dedication we need to stand up for workers in Pennsylvania, and that’s why he’s the right person to lead this state through the challenges we face.”

“I’m honored to receive the support of the Chocolate Workers,” said McCord. “Their commitment to fighting for a living wage, good benefits, and improved workplace conditions for working families in Pennsylvania should serve as a model for the rest of the state. As governor, I’ll veto any anti-union legislation, and I’ll commit to protecting these organizations that are vital to our state’s success.”

This is McCord’s thirteenth union endorsement. Among the labor groups backing McCord’s campaign include five IBEW Locals, the Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters, and the Utility Workers Union of America.

Other Democratic candidates for Governor include, Rep. Allyson Schwartz, former DEP Secretaries John Hanger and Katie McGinty, Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski, and former Department of Revenue Secretary Tom Wolf.
