She recalled wanting \u201cto focus on a specific resource and the thought of being the protector of a river like this one was pretty exciting ... and daunting.\u201d\n\nIn a small organization, she served as both riverkeeper, the person overseeing program development and the organization\u2019s chief spokesman, and executive director, or chief manager and fundraiser.\n\nOver the years, the group grew from its Atlanta main office to satellite offices in Gainesville and LaGrange. The staff also grew, as did the annual budget, rising to $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cWe have worked to ensure clean water laws are enforced and, when necessary, go to court,\u201d Bethea said during an interview last week\n\nShe and Ulseth met recently with The Times of Gainesville at Aqualand Marina in southern Hall County, where the group\u2019s floating classroom, Chota Princess II, is anchored.\n\nUlseth joined the staff seven years ago, after a stint at the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission.\n\nThe Gwinnett County native, who developed a love of water after growing up fishing and boating on the Chattahoochee and Lake Lanier, said he had crossed paths with Chattahoochee Riverkeeper during his state work and \u201chad a very large respect for the organization.\u201d\n\nWhen his predecessor moved on to another job, he jumped at the opportunity to apply.\n\n\u201cHe was the best, most qualified candidate by far,\u201d Bethea said. \u201cIt turns out he can drive a boat, too, and that\u2019s very helpful.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Ulseth developed a program of monitoring community streams, including ones in neighborhoods and parks.\n\n\u201cThey rarely receive any monitoring or testing, so we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re posing public health threats,\u201d he said. \u201cThe program allows us to get long-term quality data on each of these streams and has enabled us to go out and find numerous sewer spills.\u201d\n\nThe program moved into Hall County in the past couple of years, where the group is checking 15 streams that flow into Lanier.\n\nUlseth\u2019s work with the group has been eye-opening at times, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really learned a lot about what the true threats are to the river,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to develop and implement programs [that have] been effective in monitoring our community\u2019s waterways and addressing industrial facilities that have been polluting for years without any consequence.\u201d\n\nBethea, 63, said she came to realize that, after two decades, she had done \u201cas much as I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for younger folks in charge who will bring new perspective and energy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just seems like the right timing.\u201d\n\nBethea now will serve as a \u201cvery part-time\u201d senior adviser to the group. She said she hopes to lend a hand in developing a floating classroom on West Point Lake near LaGrange.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s critical to educate kids on a boat like this one,\u201d she said.\n\nUlseth, 33, said Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, meanwhile, plans to embark on a three-year campaign to increase programs in the river\u2019s headwaters and Middle Chattahoochee region.\n\nThose plans include opening a storefront office on the Gainesville downtown square.\n\n\u201cWe have these great programs in metro Atlanta and on much smaller scale in our satellite areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know they\u2019re successful and that we can make an impact. We just need more resources to make a bigger impact.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/26348/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2014/12/15/river.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FLOWERY BRANCH \u2014 Chattahoochee Riverkeeper has worked the past 1\u00bd years on a \u201cseamless transition\u201d in top leadership, as one of Georgia\u2019s most recognizable faces in environmental advocacy heads into retirement.", "title": "Chattahoochee Riverkeeper: Environmental watchdog group\u2019s founder hands over reins"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Chattahoochee Riverkeeper: Environmental watchdog group\u2019s founder hands over reins"}, "article_summary": "The big change took effect Monday as Sally Bethea, the environmental watchdog group\u2019s founding riverkeeper and executive director, hands over reins to a couple of longtime, loyal employees.\nShe \u201cwas in the right place at right time\u201d as Laura and Rutherford Seydel founded Chattahoochee Riverkeeper in 1994.\nFLOWERY BRANCH \u2014 Chattahoochee Riverkeeper has worked the past 1\u00bd years on a \u201cseamless transition\u201d in top leadership, as one of Georgia\u2019s most recognizable faces in environmental advocacy heads into retirement.\nBethea\u2019s environmental passions actually extend into the 1970s, when she got caught up in the decade\u2019s big environmental push into more awareness and stricter federal laws.\nJason Ulseth, technical programs director, becomes riverkeeper, and Juliet Cohen, who had served as general counsel, will serve as executive director."}
