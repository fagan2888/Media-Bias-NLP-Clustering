Humana to exit individual plans in 2 more states

Louisville, Ky.-based Humana is going to stop offering individual plans in two more states in 2017: Kansas and Wisconsin, according to Louisville Business First.

Earlier this week, the insurer said it would exit the Affordable Care Act exchanges in Alabama and Virginia. Humana currently doesn't offer ACA plans in Wisconsin, according to the report.

Humana has sent letters to insurance regulators in each of the four states, claiming the decision was made "only after much careful thought and analysis," according to the report.

Overall, Humana's exit will affect approximately 26,000 people in individual plans across the four states.
