Here were some notable and not-so-notable moments from the Denver victory.\n\nSanders shines: Emmanuel Sanders fell into the Broncos\u2019 lap as a free-agent signee. They knew Sanders provided speed. His hands have been breathtaking. He made a diving grab in the second quarter that initially was ruled a touchdown. Instead of a 77-yard score it became a 30-yard gain, but didn\u2019t take away from the grab.\n\nVon superb: Linebacker Von Miller continues to provide relentless pressure. He netted a sack for the third consecutive game. He generally gave right tackle Bobby Massie fits and knocked Drew Stanton out of the game with a possible concussion.\n\nWelker record: Wes Welker set a record for most career catches by an undrafted free agent in NFL history, breaking Rod Smith\u2019s mark.\n\nWORSTS\n\nCampbell shines: Calais Campbell, who netted 57 career sacks and averaged 22 points a game as a senior at Denver South, haunted the Broncos in his return. Campbell, hurt later in the game on a chop block, made a remarkable read and athletic play to intercept a Peyton Manning screen pass. The bad news? Manning prevented the pick six, registering his 11th-career tackle.\n\nRunning game woes: The Broncos running game remained a rumor in the first half. Multiple no gains on first downs from Montee Ball elicited boos. The Broncos had four rushing yards in the first half.\n\nDropsies: The Cardinals dropped eight passes, helping out a Broncos\u2019 secondary that struggled in the first half.\n\n\n\nINTERACTIVE: Grade the Broncos\u2019 Week 5 performance\n\nTHUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN\n\nOffense: The Broncos entered the game determined to pass as a concession to the Cardinals\u2019 strong run defense. They knew they would get blitzed, and were prepared to take chances downfield. Peyton Manning finished with a career-high 479 passing yards. Ronnie Hillman breathed life into the ground attack following Monte Ball\u2019s groin injury. The Broncos set a franchise record with 568 yards. Grade: A\n\nDefense: If not for a blown coverage on Andre Ellington\u2019s 81-yard touchdown catch, it would have been a dominant performance. The Broncos also benefited from multiple dropped passes. However, the pressure from Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware forced early and inaccurate throws. Arizona finished 3-for-16 on third down. Grade: B\n\nSpecial Teams: Brandon McManus caused some anxious moments, but finished with an acceptable performance. McManus had eight touchbacks and went 2-for-3 on field goals, ricocheting a 41-yarder good off the left goal post. The Broncos contained punt returner Ted Ginn Jr. Grade: B\n\nCoaching: The Broncos decision to go with an empty backfield and throw the ball proved effective. It produced a battery of records for Manning, Demaryius Thomas and Wes Welker. Grade: A\n\nGAME BALLS\n\nPeyton Manning: 500 TD club, career-high in passing yards, Brett Favre\u2019s all-time TD mark up next.\n\nDemaryius Thomas: Finished with Broncos record 226 receiving yards.\n\nWes Welker: Is NFL\u2019s all-time leader in catches by an undrafted free agent, breaking Rod Smith\u2019s mark", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Arizona Cardinals,Broncos,Demaryius Thomas,NFL,Peyton Manning,Wes Welker", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Recounting the high points and low points of the Broncos' win over the Cardinals at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Sunday, Oct. 5.", "title": "Cardinals vs. Broncos: Highs, lows of Denver's Week 5 win", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/10/05/cardinals-vs-broncos-highs-lows-denvers-week-5-win/30011/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/sanders-495x307.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Recounting the high points and low points of the Broncos' win over the Cardinals at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Sunday, Oct. 5.", "creator": "@troyrenck", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/10/05/cardinals-vs-broncos-highs-lows-denvers-week-5-win/30011/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/10/sanders-495x307.jpg", "title": "Cardinals vs. Broncos: Highs, lows of Denver\u2019s Week 5 win", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Recounting the high points and low points of the Broncos' win over the Cardinals at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Sunday, Oct. 5."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05aa\"", "article_summary": "Welker record: Wes Welker set a record for most career catches by an undrafted free agent in NFL history, breaking Rod Smith\u2019s mark.\nWes Welker: Is NFL\u2019s all-time leader in catches by an undrafted free agent, breaking Rod Smith\u2019s mark\nIt produced a battery of records for Manning, Demaryius Thomas and Wes Welker.\nDemaryius Thomas: Finished with Broncos record 226 receiving yards.\nPeyton Manning finished with a career-high 479 passing yards."}
