How appropriate.\n\nThe losers wore out. How inappropriate.\n\nLast Monday, Billy Horschel chili-chunked a sixth iron on the last hole of the Deutsche Bank Championship and lost. Social media chumps labeled him a choker.\n\nOn a perfect Colorado Sunday that Monet would have painted, Horschel stifled the horde \u2014 and triumphed at the grand and glorious BMW Championship.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to get that victory and stick it to some of those people that had negative comments for me on Twitter,\u201d Horschel said, getting in the last words.\n\nMost of his rivals at Cherry Hills on Sunday played wretchedly, and had little to say.\n\nConsider The Mishaps of McIlroy, the world\u2019s greatest golfer, on the 12th of Never.\n\nAs he did Saturday, Rory McIlroy inexplicably four-jacked the par 3 No. 12. In two rounds he went six-five. Take away those two brain burps, and McIlroy might have prevailed.\n\nAt the Masters once, we asked Seve Ballesteros to describe how he four-putted. He paused, contemplated and replied: \u201cMiss \u2026 uh, miss, miss, make.\u201d\n\nRory Misstake!\n\nSergio Garcia, who was two strokes behind and one hole ahead of Horschel at No. 17, also had some \u201csplainin\u201d to do. His tee shot left him 251 yards to the pin on the pivotal island green. Sergio obviously didn\u2019t want to Hoganesque it \u2014 draw the ball back into the creek. He initially intended to go for the hole, then reconsidered and decided to lay up 70 yards shy. Then Garcia skipped the ball over the green. He bladed a wedge past the hole and had a splashdown. He reloaded from the same spot and eventually made an eight.\n\n\u201cIf I was mentally sharp, if I was rested, and really, the way I was at the beginning and middle of the year, I would have talked myself into going for the green,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, for some reason I was trying to, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSergio The Snowman was gone.\n\nRyan Palmer was tied with Horschel after a birdie at 11. He bogeyed that infamous 12 and did a \u201cshanks for the memories\u201d into the Little Dry Creek, which was wet, on No. 13 for a double bogey. Ryan\u2019s hope was over. Arnold Palmer invented the Arnold Palmer drink \u2014 half iced tea, half lemonade. Ryan Palmer might be responsible for the Ryan Palmer sandwich \u2014 half chicken salad, half, er, chicken parts.\n\nMartin Kaymer, in the trio with Palmer and Horschel, disappeared early and finished minus-5. Rickie Fowler hung around through nine, but a 35 on the backside did him no favors. Graham DeLaet got to 11-under, then slipped with a bogey and a triple, and evaporated.\n\nThen there was Bubba.\n\nThis year\u2019s Masters champion opened and closed the first nine with bogeys, but was attracting Horschel\u2019s attention after a birdie at 16. He was three back. Watson, who had reached the par-5 17 all week in two, needed a 3-3 conclusion to put the heat on. He was eagle-eyed on No. 17, but his putt was off, just as his birdie putt was awry on 18. He was what seemed like a distant two shots shy.\n\nMorgan Hoffman had begun the tournament 72-72. If there were a cut, he wouldn\u2019t have made the weekend.\n\nInstead, he blazed around Cherry Hills with a record 62 on Saturday. On Sunday he made eight birdies on 11 middle-of-the-round holes and acted like he might shoot 55. He ended up with a 63 (15-under in two incredible rounds) and probably would have passed Horschel if they played another nine holes. As it was, Hoffman was one of only three pros in double-digit numbers under par (an achievement never reached before in majors at the historic wonderland south of Denver.)\n\nMeanwhile, back at the front, Horschel played steady and solid, smart and sturdy.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have my great stuff,\u201d he said, but \u201cI was able to grind something out.\u201d\n\nNo gags.\n\nHe had two bogeys and two birdies in the first seven holes, then converted 11 consecutive pars. The guy from the University of Florida turned everyone else into Gator bait. He made back-to-back 7-footers for pars and, ultimately hit a splendid nine iron \u2014 not a six \u2014 to the center of the 18th green, where many majors have been won, and lost.\n\nHorschel sprinted up the hill, through the crowd and \u2014 really \u2014 to a portable toilet behind the grandstand. He was not going over to throw up. \u201cI had been holding it for way too many holes, and I could relax now,\u201d he said.\n\nHorschel returned to make his par and win by two \u2014 in orange and blue.\n\nAnd it was swell to have golf back.
