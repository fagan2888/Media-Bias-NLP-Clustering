In case you missed it, here are videos and stories from several groups ripping Common Core for it: Business Insider, IFLScience, Huffington Post and mom.me \u2014 and I\u2019m sure you can find many more as the photo of this kid\u2019s paper has gone viral.\n\nYou might also remember the photo of a check that went viral not that long ago \u2014 a man filled out a check to his son\u2019s school by attempting to write the check amount in ten frames. There have been countless other similar photos with accompanying derision that have gone viral via social media and email (more on these examples in a moment).\n\nIn the national discussion on America\u2019s perceived educational woes, the Common Core Standards have become a bit of a unifying punching bag, especially with respect to elementary school math. Everyone seems to love a photo of a test question, homework problem or corrected work that vilifies the Common Core. You know the type \u2014 the question asks the students to show a seemingly straightforward elementary math topic, but it requires the answer to be given in what seems to be an overly complicated way. We look at it and say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just do it the normal way?!?\u201d We are alarmed at the representation of something that we see as so basic and elementary in a new and unfamiliar arrangement, and we are outraged when we see a student\u2019s work marked down when it appears to be correct.\n\nThe vast majority of the comments and coverage of these viral images and stories has been highly critical of the Common Core. Here\u2019s the thing though \u2014 all of these criticisms boil down to a fundamental misunderstanding of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).\n\nVirtually every example of one of these attacks on the Common Core fall into one of two categories:\n\nThe people who spread the example (and trash it) missed the point of the Common Core Standard in question The educator responsible for the example missed the point of the Common Core Standard in question\n\nConsider the ten frames check (which falls into the first category) \u2014 the father was frustrated by a representation of numbers with which he wasn\u2019t familiar and it fit nicely into his preconceived notion that the Common Core is terrible, serving only to confuse students and parents. Here is an article that does a more elaborate job of skewering his response, but in short, this father is upset because he doesn\u2019t immediately recognize and understand a concept being taught to his second grader. Rather than try to make sense of it and understand the purpose, he ridicules it, and other similarly frustrated parents jump on board.\n\nIn fact, ten frames are a way of visually modeling our counting system that help kids to better understand it. They were never meant to replace our current way of writing numbers \u2014 they are designed as a supplemental aid to assist in deeper understanding. It can be frustrating to parents, to be sure, to be initially stumped by your kids\u2019 homework, especially when they\u2019re in the earliest grades. Certainly, there are teachers out there who don\u2019t always hit the mark with an assignment, or who fail to provide resources for parents to understand something that may be new to them, but in the end, let\u2019s not forget that we\u2019re all looking for the best educational outcomes for our kids. And let\u2019s be honest, the way we\u2019ve been teaching math for generations in America has not worked for everyone, which is why we have a very sizeable segment of our population who simply says, \u201cI can\u2019t do math.\u201d So then why are we closed off to considering new ways of conceptualizing the foundational ideas of mathematics?\n\nNow consider the 5 x 3 question. According to IFLScience (which I love, by the way), Reddit and Imgur commenters expressed outrage at \u201cthe overly pedantic \u2018by-the-book\u2019 thinking.\u201d The whole thing reads as an incrimination of Common Core as stifling mathematical thinking in favor of stringent and arbitrary definitions and algorithms. And yet, this is a completely wrong-headed interpretation of Common Core. The outrage is warranted, it\u2019s just misplaced \u2014 this example is of the second type I mentioned above, in which the educator has misunderstood and misapplied the standards with an overly narrow literal reading of them.\n\nThe standard in question says, \u201cInterpret products of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 5 \u00d7 7 as the total number of objects in 5 groups of 7 objects each.\u201d This teacher obviously read this standard as saying that the only way to view 5 x 7 (or in the case of the paper in question, 5 x 3) is as 5 groups of 7 objects each. So for 5 groups of 3 objects, that might look like 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. And yet, \u201ce.g.\u201d means \u201cfor example,\u201d not \u201cThis is the only valid interpretation.\u201d A reasonable reading of the standard by a mathematically literate person should allow for interpreting 5 x 3 as 5+5+5, or 3 groups of 5 objects each, especially when you consider that four standards down on the list is the one about commutation (along with other properties) in multiplication, e.g., 5 x 3 is equal to 3 x 5 (note, the e.g. I just used means that this is just one example; the property applies to infinitely many other pairs of numbers as well \u2014 see how that works?). The ultimate goal of these standards is to help our children to develop their foundational understandings of our number system and of basic arithmetic, and so if a student intuitively knows that 5 x 3 is equal to 3 x 5 and that they can both be represented as 3 rows of 5 items or 5 rows of 3 items or 3 stacks of 5 pennies or 5 piles of 3 apples or \u2026 well, you get the picture, then we\u2019ve accomplished our goal!\n\nInterpreting multiplication in the way described above is not remotely new; rather, it\u2019s pretty standard fare for understanding what multiplication is. Perhaps the idea of making students show the example on paper is more of a new phenomenon, and yes, the Common Core definitely advocates that educators encourage students to interact with ways of modeling the mathematical concepts they are learning so as to better master them. It does not, however, require stringent adherence to narrow, arbitrarily chosen interpretations of these models, and educators who focus their teaching in that way are doing it wrong.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Common Core problems go viral, the steps seem complicated, unnecessary.
