MASONVILLE â€” A man who was killed Saturday morning in a vehicle accident near Masonville has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Fisher of Littleton, according to Josh Lewis, public information officer with Colorado State Patrol.

Lewis said that state patrol got the call at about 11:40 a.m. Saturday morning to respond to an incident in the 10000 block of Buckhorn Road, about two miles northwest of the Masonville Mercantile.

The accident involved a 2010 Toyota 4Runner, driven by 57-year-old Pauline Morrow of Bellvue, and a 2009 Yamaha motorcycle driven by Fisher.

After the initial investigation, Lewis said it looks like Fisher, who was heading northbound on Buckhorn Road, took a right hand curve too fast. The bike laid almost flat, which is when Fisher appears to have flown off the motorcycle and went under the SUV in the southbound lane.

Fisher was pronounced dead at the scene.

Morrow and a 58-year-old male passenger, were not injured.

"Speed is considered a factor, but no drugs or alcohol," Lewis said.
