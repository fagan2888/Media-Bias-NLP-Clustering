(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nThis morning, a hole opened up in Paul Ryan\u2019s hammock.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler has checked out the anecdote Paul Ryan offered at CPAC yesterday, which was the perfect distillation of what you might call the Hammock Theory of Poverty. In case you missed it, Ryan opined that the left is offering people \u201ca full stomach and an empty soul,\u201d and referenced an anecdote supposedly passed along to him by a Wisconsin public official:\n\n\u201cShe once met a young boy from a very poor family, and every day at school, he would get a free lunch from a government program. He told Eloise he didn\u2019t want a free lunch. He wanted his own lunch, one in a brown-paper bag just like the other kids. He wanted one, he said, because he knew a kid with a brown-paper bag had someone who cared for him. This is what the left does not understand.\u201d\n\nThis seems to harken back to Ryan\u2019s infamous claim that the safety net is a \u201chammock\u201d that lulls people into \u201cdependency and complacency.\u201d In this tale, the boy\u2019s mother seems to be the person swaying back and forth in the hammock. The larger idea here has already been addressed by Jonathan Chait and Paul Krugman. Both point out that if anything, the anecdote underscores the need for free lunches; after all, if the boy\u2019s mother isn\u2019t giving him a brown-paper-bag lunch, whatever the reason for that, a school lunch is the next best immediate option.\n\nNow Kessler finds that the anecdote is fiction \u2014 the creation of a misstatement by the official who originally offered it.\n\nTwo additional points here. While the original purveyor did botch the tale, the failure to vet it before presenting it to a national audience seems like more of the \u201clazy mendacity\u201d Jonathan Bernstein talks about. Lawmakers get so used to saying whatever they want unchallenged inside the Conservative Media Entertainment Complex that claims go increasingly un-vetted.\n\nMore important, the idea behind the story is central to Paul Ryan\u2019s larger bamboozlement. Ryan is set to offer up a budget. As of now, his stated goals \u2014 balancing the budget in 10 years; not cutting defense to #Obummer levels; preserving the Medicare benefits Republicans want to attack Dems for cutting \u2014 would seem to leave no option other than deep cuts to programs for the poor, as in previous budgets. At the same time, Ryan has embarked on a campaign to prove the GOP cares deeply about poverty. The only way to make all of this work is to argue that slashing programs for the poor is the way to help them \u2014 hence anecdotes like the one above that are designed to give that notion a philosophical gloss.\n\nRyan\u2019s anecdotal effort to do that may have earned him a sound fact-check thrashing. But he is still basically functioning in a media environment where he is greeted great deference as a serious wonk, even as the truly draconian nature of his fiscal vision and its fundamentally absurd pretentions to caring about poverty \u2014 not to mention its violence to mathematical reality \u2014 escape serious press scrutiny.\n\n* A SOMEWHAT BETTER JOBS REPORT: The February jobs numbers are in:\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 175,000 in February, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 6.7 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment increased in professional and business services and in wholesale trade but declined in information.\n\nRevisions of the December and January jobs numbers were negligible; a total of 25,000 more jobs was added for the two months. Time for those infrastructure repair programs to create jobs that Republicans used to support before Obama was president!\n\n* WHAT THE JOBS REPORT MEANS: Joe Weisenthal flags the two key takeaways from the new jobs numbers:\n\nThe Non-Farm Payrolls report was solid. This suggests that the economy was a bit stronger than we thought. there was a big gain in average hourly earnings (+0.4%), the strongest in a long time. This is a sign of a tightening labor force, which is something markets have been talking about lately, that the market is tighter than people realize. Bottom line: A solid, goldilocks report that the market will like. But the average hourly earnings is a big story.\n\n* THE LATEST ON THE FLORIDA SPECIAL ELECTION: The Tampa Bay Times takes a look at the wild card in the race: The libertarian candidate, who could draw as much as seven percent of the vote, and could help tip the race to Dem Alex Sink by siphoning votes away from Republican David Jolly. It\u2019s also possible, though less likely, that he could take votes from Sink. This is another reminder that the outcome will be determined by quirky and unpredictable factors and should not be interpreted as any kind of harbinger for this fall.\n\n* NATIONAL REPUBLICANS ANGRY AT FLORIDA GOP CANDIDATE: Meanwhile, Politico reports that national Republican strategists with the NRCC are now anonymously dumping on David Jolly as anger erupts over strategic differences:.\n\nWashington Republicans have described Jolly\u2019s campaign\u2026as a Keystone Cops operation, marked by inept fundraising, top advisers stationed hundreds of miles away from the district in the state capital and the poor optics of a just-divorced, 41-year-old candidate accompanied on the campaign trail by a girlfriend 14 years his junior\u2026It is rare for party officials to criticize one of their own candidates, even anonymously, days before an election. One explanation may be so they can point to Jolly \u2014 as opposed to the national political mood or the ineffectiveness of attacks against Sink over her support for Obamacare \u2014 if he loses.\n\nSuch an outcome will be widely interpreted in national terms by the press, but if Jolly does lose, truthfully it won\u2019t tell us much about how Obamacare will impact particular red state Dem Senators\u2019 reelection campaigns.\n\n* KEEP AN EYE ON NORTH CAROLINA GOP SENATE PRIMARY: Greg Brannon, the Tea Party candidate against expected GOP Senate nominee Thom Tillis, has just picked up the endorsement of senior Tea Party Senator Mike Lee. This will be worth watching.\n\nRemember, Tillis is struggling to articulate his position on Obamacare: He knows he can\u2019t be for full repeal and nothing else, but he also can\u2019t embrace any specific alternatives \u2014 so he\u2019s endorsing Obamacare\u2019s general goals, which alone is getting him hit from the right by Brannon. It\u2019s another way in which the politics of Obamacare are more complicated for Republicans than they allow.\n\n* RUBIO TRIES TO MAKE AMENDS WITH RIGHT: With Republicans criticizing Obama \u201cweakness\u201d for creating the Ukraine crisis, Jonathan Martin reports that Marco Rubio is trying to repair relations with conservatives still furious over his immigration apostasy by calling for a more aggressive American military posture in international affairs. Note this:\n\nThat posture stands in contrast with other members of his party, notably Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who argues that the United States should be wary of foreign intervention and retreat from the policies of the George W. Bush era. The divergent national security views of the two ambitious, first-term senators offer an early preview of a debate sure to play out in the Republican presidential primary in 2016.\n\nCan Rubio make sufficient amends for his heretical exercise in bipartisan problem solving by vowing to restore the foreign policy luster of the Bush years? We\u2019ll soon find out.\n\n* MITCH McCONNELL PUNCHES BACK AT CONSERVATIVES: ABC News reports that Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign is up with a new ad hitting back at Tea Party challenger Matt Bevin. The ad, interestingly, also hits his leading outside-group antagonist, the Senate Conservatives Fund, which has funded ads against him. The spot decries \u201cout of state\u201d interests, which is interesting given McConnell\u2019s defense of the Koch brothers.\n\nBeyond that, this is a reminder that McConnell, while likely to win his primary, could enter into the general election after a bruising fight with the right, which Dems hope will depress the conservative enthusiasm he needs to win.\n\n* AND PAUL RYAN\u2019S \u2018HAMMOCK FALLACY': Related to my lead item: Paul Krugman does a real demolition job on Paul Ryan\u2019s critique of federal anti-poverty programs, citing all the research that demonstrates why the safety net does not function as a \u201chammock\u201d that lulls people into \u201cdependency\u201d at all. Indeed, we need more hammock, not less:\n\nThe reason so many Americans remain trapped in poverty isn\u2019t that the government helps them too much; it\u2019s that it helps them too little\u2026It is, in a way, nice to see the likes of Mr. Ryan at least talking about the need to help the poor. But somehow their notion of aiding the poor involves slashing benefits while cutting taxes on the rich. Funny how that works.\n\nIt\u2019s worth restating that Ryan\u2019s worldview isn\u2019t shared by all Republicans. Many non-Tea Party Republicans are much more in line with the mainstream on these matters. But the GOP agenda is dictated by the Tea Party worldview.\n\nWhat else?", "article_metadata": {"description": "His \"brown bag\" anecdote crashes and burns.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "His \"brown bag\" anecdote crashes and burns.", "title": "Morning Plum: There\u2019s a hole in Paul Ryan\u2019s hammock", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/03/07/morning-plum-theres-a-hole-in-paul-ryans-hammock/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/03/National-Politics/Images/Budget_Economy-0f621-4675.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/03/07/morning-plum-theres-a-hole-in-paul-ryans-hammock/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "paul ryan, cpac, conservative political action conference. paul ryan budget, medicare advantage cuts,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "paul ryan, cpac, conservative political action conference. paul ryan budget, medicare advantage cuts,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc756\"", "article_summary": "Scott Applewhite)This morning, a hole opened up in Paul Ryan\u2019s hammock.\n* AND PAUL RYAN\u2019S \u2018HAMMOCK FALLACY': Related to my lead item: Paul Krugman does a real demolition job on Paul Ryan\u2019s critique of federal anti-poverty programs, citing all the research that demonstrates why the safety net does not function as a \u201chammock\u201d that lulls people into \u201cdependency\u201d at all.\nMore important, the idea behind the story is central to Paul Ryan\u2019s larger bamboozlement.\nMany non-Tea Party Republicans are much more in line with the mainstream on these matters.\nThe Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler has checked out the anecdote Paul Ryan offered at CPAC yesterday, which was the perfect distillation of what you might call the Hammock Theory of Poverty."}
