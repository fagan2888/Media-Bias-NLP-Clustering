The retired nurses from Northwood, N.H., planned many more active years together.\n\n\u201cWe thought we would have a wonderful retirement, doing many things, enjoying a fantastic quality of life, having our health,\u201d said 68-year-old Young.\n\nBut two years ago, Chalmers was diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s, and Young assumed a new role, that of caregiver. After six months of wrestling with what she called daily grief, Young realized she was suffering from depression.\n\nMany such baby boomers will cope with depression later in life, when the illness can present symptoms and challenges specific to that age group.\n\nSeniors who are depressed are more likely than those who are not to die or have serious complications after a major medical event. While s eniors are less likely to be depressed than younger people, the size of the baby boom population will demand new strategies to care for them.\n\nDepression in seniors is often misunderstood.\n\n\u201cThe public thinks, \u2018Well, if I was losing my ability to walk or losing my vision or hearing or people that I love, that it\u2019s normal to be depressed when you get older,\u2019 and that\u2019s just not true,\u201d said Stephen Bartels, director of the Centers for Health and Aging at Dartmouth College.\n\nThe most important misconception about seniors and depression is the assumption that a person who has never had it won\u2019t develop it, said George Alexopoulos, a professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College.\n\nWhen Judy Young, a retired psychiatric nurse and psychotherapist, experienced her bout of depression \u2014 it was her first \u2014 she was 65.\n\nDepressed older adults can have different symptoms from those of younger people. Rather than seem sad, they might be unable to experience pleasure.\n\nThey\u2019re also more likely than younger people with depression to lose weight and to feel worse in the mornings. Delusions can be more frequent. Social withdrawal, irritability and loneliness can be more prominent as well, said James Ellison, director of the geriatric psychiatry program at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.\n\nWhereas some gradual cognitive slowness may be normal with aging, the despair and withdrawal of depression can spark a rapid, functional decline, including problems with concentration. Depressed seniors are more likely to fall, Bartels said. Poor sleep coupled with memory loss can impair reaction times in such tasks as driving and cooking.\n\nIf you suspect a decline in function due to depression in yourself or loved one, Ellison recommends that you consult a health-care professional.\n\nThanks to the support she\u2019s received, Judy Young is feeling better. She takes each day as it comes, enjoying her 23-foot motor home and time in New Hampshire and Florida. She has a busy life coordinating her partner\u2019s enrollment in an Alzheimer\u2019s drug trial with a schedule of concerts, trips and visits with new and old friends.\n\n\u201cYou have to be proactive about getting help for yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s difficult for all of us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/hfaging06.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "For more than 40 years, Judy Young and her 75-year-old spouse, Meg Chalmers, shared so much: camping, antiquing, traveling.\nWhen Judy Young, a retired psychiatric nurse and psychotherapist, experienced her bout of depression \u2014 it was her first \u2014 she was 65.\nThey\u2019re also more likely than younger people with depression to lose weight and to feel worse in the mornings.\nAfter six months of wrestling with what she called daily grief, Young realized she was suffering from depression.\nThanks to the support she\u2019s received, Judy Young is feeling better."}
