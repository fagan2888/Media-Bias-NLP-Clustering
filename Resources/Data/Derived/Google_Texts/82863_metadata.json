That\u2019s the message the hospital\u2019s CEO gave to Governor Steve Bullock Thursday afternoon.\n\nTeton Medical Center is one of the state\u2019s Critical Access Hospitals. It has ten hospital beds, just over three dozen nursing home beds, and an emergency room.\n\nLouie King is the center\u2019s CEO. He told Governor Bullock the medical center provides good jobs and brings in $15 million a year to Teton County.\n\n\"Our facility, although small around 75 employees saves lives,\" said King. \"We\u2019re there for that golden hour after a heart attack, a stroke, major trauma or car wreck. We stabilize the patient and they\u2019re transported to the appropriate follow-up care.\"\n\nBut King says Teton Medical Center is struggling financially. Last year it provided $265,000 in uncompensated care for patients.\n\n\"A lot of them are hard-working single parents, single moms,\" said King, \"and their kids can get on Medicaid but they can\u2019t, they\u2019re between. They\u2019re caught right there in the middle. And they\u2019re the ones that are delaying treatment and finally coming into the ER when things blow up on them.\"\n\nKing says that\u2019s why expanding Medicaid is crucial for Critical Care Hospitals like Teton Medical. He says currently the facility is in talks with Benefis Health System about a possible sale.\n\nSo King was asked would these talks be going on if the amount of uncompensated care weren\u2019t so high. He says the reality is its is getting harder to be an independent rural hospital and mergers are happening across the state, but the burden of providing medical care for the uninsured is an issue.\n\n\"If we were making $1 million a year would we be in talks with Benefis? Maybe not today but we would be a couple of years down the road.\"\n\n\"But if you were receiving almost $300,000 of uncompensated care?\" askedd Gov. Bullock.\n\n\"It would help,\" said King.\n\nRepresentative Christy Clark left the Capitol for home to attend this tour and community meeting.\n\n\"Stay in touch with me,\" said Clark. \"I have absolutely committed to finding a solution. As far as I\u2019m concerned our failure of the last session was that we did not find a solution and I\u2019m not willing to come back after this session and say, sorry we tried and couldn\u2019t come up with anything.\"\n\nShe reminds the group, however, Medicaid expansion is an issue of dispute within the Republican party.\n\n\"As a Republican I don\u2019t like federal programs,\" said Clark. \"I don\u2019t like increasing federal programs but I don\u2019t like the reality of living in a community that doesn\u2019t have a hospital.\"\n\nWhile Republicans have the majority in both the House and Senate, Clark is part of a sub-group known by the moniker \u201cResponsible Republicans.\u201d Instead of voting strictly party line, in past sessions they\u2019ve worked with their colleagues across the aisle.\n\nClark says they are absolutely committed to finding a solution even though the pressure in and out of the party is against Medicaid Expansion as part of ObamaCare. Clark also says that pressure is even being applied at home in Choteau.\n\n\"There will be people out there contacting you,\" said Clark. \"Americans for Prosperity will be telling you how I should vote but I want you to tell me how we should solve this. I don\u2019t want Americans for Prosperity a dark money group from Kansas telling me that you need to give me a petition.\"\n\nAs for Governor Bullock, he says his Healthy Montana Plan was put forth to start the talking.\n\n\"I\u2019ve said to legislators across the board that I am more than willing to meet you half way and have discussions as long as we take the steps we need to ensure our tax dollars are not going to states like North Dakota, Arizona, New Jersey or Ohio.\"\n\nBullock agrees with Clark that Montana can\u2019t wait another two years for some solution. He says the viability of communities, like Choteau, is at stake.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Montana News", "description": "Just over 40 percent of the patients who get care at Teton Medical Center in Choteau are uninsured and can\u2019t pay their medical bills.
