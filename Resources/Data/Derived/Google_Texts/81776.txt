21 Frightening Food Waste Facts [Infographic]

We’ve written a lot about food waste recently, and the facts are staggering. This infographic from A-Z Solutions lays out the frightening facts about our food waste. Shocking! I learned a few new stats, including the fact that since 1974, our per capita waste has increased by 50%. Wow. And would you have guessed that meat is the most wasted food, making up 33% of the average American’s food waste? I would’ve thought fruits and veggies or dairy products. But no — it’s meat, followed by seafood at 25%, vegetables at 20%, grains at 18%, diary products at 17%, and fruit at 15%. Very interesting indeed.

This is not the first time we’ve written about a wicked good infographic from A-Z Solutions. (They’re the folks that published the fantastic comparison of factory versus sustainable farming.) Their team helps businesses develop effective, sustainable, socially responsible logistics solutions. It promotes conscious capitalism, social responsibility, and nutritional transparency — which is described on the A-Z Solutions web site as “an approach of providing nutrition information which allows you to select from various food options to help you change the way you eat.” Since you read this blog, that’s obviously something you care about too. Thanks for joining us.
