Stand Up To Cancer\n\nStand Up To Cancer (SU2C), an initiative that works to fund \u201cdream team\u201d cancer researchers, is set to host a star-studded telethon Friday, Sept. 5. Thanks to the support of major cable networks, such as ABC and Showtime, the event will air on more than 12 networks.\n\nThe telethon kicks off at 8 p.m. and will feature performances from The Who, Jennifer Hudson, Lupe Fiasco & Common, Ariana Grande, and Dave Matthews. Additional celebrities set to appear are Gwyneth Paltrow, Reese Witherspoon, Will Ferrell, the leading men of ABC\u2019S Modern Family, Jon Hamm, and Jennifer Aniston.\n\nInstead of the traditional phone bank staffed by the celebrities, tomorrow\u2019s broadcast swaps in a digital lounge where stars can personally get in touch with those who donated via phone, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media. Visit werecallingyou.org to see exactly how you can receive one of these shoutouts.\n\n\u201cSince we started [SU2C] in 2008, social media has exploded, creating a whole new way to connect,\u201d Katie Couric, anchorwoman and SU2C co-founder, said in a press release. \u201cSo in an unprecedented way, we\u2019ll have plenty of stars reaching out to donors via social media, thanking them through Facebook messages, digital shout outs, Instagrams and tweets. In other words, this year, we are so 2014!\u201d\n\nOne hundred percent of donations received by SU2C will go directly to their collaborative cancer research programs. Since they were founded, the website reported \u201cover 140 clinical trials have been launched by SU2C scientists, in which more than 4,000 cancer patients have been enrolled.\u201d\n\nAll of this is an effort to change the current odds of the one in two men, and one in three women, who will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. It\u2019s why the telethon\u2019s tagline is, \u201cWhen we all come together, cancer doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stand, cancer, telethon, 2014, brings, together, celebrities, and, major, cable, networks", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This year, viewers can donate and sign up to receive a special shout-out from their favorite celebrity.", "title": "Cancer Sucks, But The Media-Backed 'Stand Up To Cancer' Telethon Won't", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stand-cancer-telethon-2014-brings-together-celebrities-and-major-cable-networks-301292", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/su2c-logo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This year, viewers can donate and sign up to receive a special shout-out from their favorite celebrity.", "title": "Cancer Sucks, But The Media-Backed 'Stand Up To Cancer' Telethon Won't", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stand-cancer-telethon-2014-brings-together-celebrities-and-major-cable-networks-301292", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/su2c-logo.gif", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/su2c-logo.gif"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-04T15:20:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T15:48:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This year, viewers can donate and sign up to receive a special shout-out from their favorite celebrity."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd992\"", "article_summary": "Stand Up To CancerStand Up To Cancer (SU2C), an initiative that works to fund \u201cdream team\u201d cancer researchers, is set to host a star-studded telethon Friday, Sept. 5.\nThanks to the support of major cable networks, such as ABC and Showtime, the event will air on more than 12 networks.\nIt\u2019s why the telethon\u2019s tagline is, \u201cWhen we all come together, cancer doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\n\u201cSince we started [SU2C] in 2008, social media has exploded, creating a whole new way to connect,\u201d Katie Couric, anchorwoman and SU2C co-founder, said in a press release.\nThis year, viewers can donate and sign up to receive a special shout-out from their favorite celebrity."}
