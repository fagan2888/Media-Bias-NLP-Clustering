Most of the party\u2019s financiers and top strategists are sitting on the sidelines. Many are reluctant to spend money against Trump after watching others fumble as they tried to handle his counter-punches. Others, citing past elections, remain confident that the race will eventually pivot away from him early next year.\n\nThey should just repeat \u201cserenity now, serenity now\u201d to themselves over and over.\n\n* Francis Wilkinson explains why even the first Thanksgiving was political.\n\n* Jonathan Cohn reports on what Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid leave plan will probably look like and how she\u2019ll pay for it.\n\n* Ezra Klein interviews political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who makes the case that Donald Trump actually could win the GOP nomination.\n\n* Jim Dwyer offers a definitive debunking of Donald Trump\u2019s fantasy that crowds of people in Jersey City were celebrating the 9/11 attacks.\n\n* Amanda Marcotte argues that there\u2019s no way Trump could say something too racist for his supporters, since his support comes so strongly from the xenophobic.\n\n* Heather Digby Parton argues that fascistic tendencies have been present in American politics for a long time, and Trump is just bringing them to the surface.\n\n* Jonathan Chait examines how we\u2019re handling the threat of terrorism in the age of Trump.\n\n* At The Week, I argued that Trump is running the most transparently racist campaign since George Wallace in 1968, or maybe Strom Thurmond in 1948.\n\n* Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s presidential campaign is getting almost no attention these days. But Dan Diamond argues that his health care plan actually does deserve some attention, and tells us why. \u2014 gs\n\n* Marco Rubio tells Pat Robertson\u2019s Christian Broadcasting Network that if there\u2019s a conflict between the law and what you believe God\u2019s law to be, \u201cGod\u2019s rules always win.\u201d\n\n* And have you ever said to yourself, \u201cWhat America needs is a little more of a Cultural Revolution vibe\u201d? Well Trump agrees:\n\nGOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump said late Tuesday that everyday Americans should monitor their neighbors for questionable behavior. \u201cThe real greatest resource is all of you, because you have all those eyes and you see what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told listeners in Myrtle Beach, S.C. \u201cPeople move into a house a block down the road, you know who\u2019s going in,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou can see and you report them to the local police. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart, right?\u201d he asked his audience. \u201cWe know if there\u2019s something going on, report them. Most likely you\u2019ll be wrong, but that\u2019s OK. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way. Everybody\u2019s their own cop in a way. You\u2019ve got to do it. You\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d\n\nLike my life isn\u2019t busy enough already, now I have to start informing on my neighbors? Just think of the paperwork involved. And my favorite part is, \u201cMost likely you\u2019ll be wrong, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/25/happy-hour-roundup-741/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/23/National-Politics/Images/Congress_Benghazi-01bc9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/25/happy-hour-roundup-741/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "plum line", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "plum line"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff98\"", "article_summary": "Well Trump agrees:GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump said late Tuesday that everyday Americans should monitor their neighbors for questionable behavior.\n* Ezra Klein interviews political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who makes the case that Donald Trump actually could win the GOP nomination.\n* Amanda Marcotte argues that there\u2019s no way Trump could say something too racist for his supporters, since his support comes so strongly from the xenophobic.\nMany are reluctant to spend money against Trump after watching others fumble as they tried to handle his counter-punches.\nMost likely you\u2019ll be wrong, but that\u2019s OK. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way."}
