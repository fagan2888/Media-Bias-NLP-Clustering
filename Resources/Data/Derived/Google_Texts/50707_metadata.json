Almost half said they had lived in the past year in a property affected by damp (44%) or mould (48%) \u2013 both of which can cause conditions such as asthma and eczema.\n\nNearly a fifth had been in a property with electrical hazards (19%), and one in six families (18%) reported living with vermin infestations, including mice, ants and cockroaches, which also put their health at risk.\n\nMore than 120,000 renting families \u2013 the equivalent to one in 10 of Britain\u2019s renters \u2013 have suffered health problems in the last year because rogue landlords failed to deal with the poor environment conditions in their properties, according to the research, while more than 60,000 families were threatened with eviction by their landlords after complaining about the state of their homes.\n\nShelter said it was releasing the figures as part of its campaign to change the law to protect renters from being thrown out of their homes by a small but dangerous minority of rogue landlords who don\u2019t want to repair dangerous or inadequate properties.\n\nOn 28 November, politicians will have the chance to vote for the tenancies (reform) bill, to protect renters from unfair evictions.
