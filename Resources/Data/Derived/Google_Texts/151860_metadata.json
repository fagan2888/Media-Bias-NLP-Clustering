It is, of course, a homecoming of sorts with so many familiar faces and friends. Yet there is one major difference since I last sat among you:\n\nI am a year older with a few more grey hairs.\n\nTo say that the last month has been an eye opener would be an understatement, as all the former governors here will understand. But it\u2019s not so much about being overwhelmed as it is about being invigorated and challenged. And we have a mountain of challenges to climb.\n\nAnd so I hope we can climb it together\u2014because as I said at my inauguration: Alone, it is a daunting and overwhelming task.\n\nBut I have always been an optimist and a believer in people and the power they hold within them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always looked to others for help with answers; why I\u2019ve always sought to harness the power of collaboration.\n\nWhen I met with my cabinet during a retreat recently I asked them, what does Hawaii mean to them? What drove them? What directed their actions? While there were many different answers and perspectives, one word kept coming up over and over again:\n\nHome.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment I intimately understand.\n\nAfter I graduated from the University of Hawaii, I was fortunate enough to be offered a number of jobs. But only one was located in Hawaii and that\u2019s the one I accepted. To this day, I know it was the right choice because this is my home.\n\nFor me, that one word brings everything\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Civil Beat News", "description": "Mister Speaker, Madame President, former governors, distinguished justices of the courts, representatives of our congressional delegation, members of the Hawaii State Legislature, other elected officials, honored guests, family and friends, Aloha.
