It\u2019s creating frustration and anger among people that really need access,\u201d Krauss estimates that\u2019s half a million people statewide, 117-thousand in Philadelphia more than 60 percent of the uninsured here.\n\nThe governor recently applied for a waiver to expand Medicaid but it would cut benefits and impose new conditions, even for current recipients.\n\nAs more people apply for health insurance by this month\u2019s deadline, more are learning they can\u2019t get it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The problem has cropped up from the beginning of sign up.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/03/10/medicaid-gap-takes-root-in-pennsylvania/", "image": {"width": 830, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/3-on-your-side.jpg?w=830", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/3-on-your-side.jpg?w=830", "height": 469}, "type": "article", "description": "The problem has cropped up from the beginning of sign up.", "title": "Medicaid Gap Takes Root In Pennsylvania"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/3-on-your-side.jpg?w=830", "description": "The problem has cropped up from the beginning of sign up.", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Medicaid Gap Takes Root In Pennsylvania"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "kyw news 1060, pat loeb heard on, local, news, philadelphia, syndicated local, syndicated sports, watch + listen", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "kyw news 1060, pat loeb"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd278\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act expected Medicaid would expand to cover all low income people but the Supreme Court ruled states could decide whether to expand medicaid and Pennsylvania didn\u2019t.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had people cry because they need health care so bad and they thought they were going to be able to get it.\nThe governor recently applied for a waiver to expand Medicaid but it would cut benefits and impose new conditions, even for current recipients.\nAntoinette Krauss of the Health Access Network says the impact is becoming clearer as more people try to sign up.\nAs more people apply for health insurance by this month\u2019s deadline, more are learning they can\u2019t get it."}
