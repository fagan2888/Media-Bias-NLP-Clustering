Stringari won the 300-meter hurdles state championship. (Brandon Hopper/Daily Record)\n\nLakewood \u2014 Trenton Stringari had a little extra motivation Saturday. Although, it's not like the Ca\u00f1on City junior needed it when it came to the state title race.\n\nThe standout finished his 300-meter hurdle run of 38.20 with a emphatic double fist pump to beat slightly favored Glenwood Springs junior Kaden Weller's 38.56.\n\n\u201cIt's the most amazing feeling ever,\u201d Stringari said after the race. \u201cI'm just giving God the glory. This is awesome.\n\n\u201cMy start was so much better this time. I got an early lead on him. When people get an early lead on me it kinda gets me mentally. I think that might've happened to him.\u201d\n\nWeller and Stringari had been fairly even the entire season, and the Glenwood Springs junior came in with a slight edge. Stringari said Weller wasn't shy about his previous-best time, either.\n\n\u201cHe was kinda bragging to me and a couple others in the tent today, kinda rubbing it in that he had the highest seed time,\u201d Stringari said. \u201cHe's got so much talent, there's no need to be cocky about it, he can be humble.\u201d\n\nStringari got off to a good start, but Weller's was anything but. Weller said he hit the first hurdle with his knee and sported a big red mark on his right knee after the race.\n\nWith 80 meters to go, Stringari had about a one-half step lead on Weller, and a bit more comfortable length ahead of Palmer Ridge seniors Evan Malin and Thomas Busath.\n\n\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d Tigers coach Jordan Gilge said. \u201cThat was finally the best race he's run all year, best time, hit every hurdle well.\u201d\n\nThe lead stayed about the same as the two came down the straightaway, and Weller clipped the last hurdle as Stringari had already landed.\n\n\u201cIt's a state championship,\u201d Weller said. \u201cEverybody's going to do their best. He had a cleaner race.\n\n\u201cI wish I had a clean race. A clean race would've had an, I'm guessing sub-38. I just kinda screwed it up.\u201d\n\nJuniors Stringari, Weller and Dustin Ethridge from D'Evelyn were the only non-seniors in the race. Ethridge took ninth place.\n\nStringari also took third place in the 110-meter hurdles earlier in the day.\n\nStringari joined a small group of track and field state champions from Ca\u00f1on City in the past few years. Two years ago, Andrea Tuck won the triple jump and Zac McCoy won the 400-meter run. Last year, McCoy won the 400- and 200-meter runs.\n\n\u201cI had one goal,\u201d Stringari said. \u201cI kept telling myself that I wasn't going to let anybody pass me. This is all I've been working for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25781602/ca-city-tigers-junior-trenton-stringari-wins-state", "modificationDate": "2014-05-17T18:05:10-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0517/20140517_031148_20140517-6-DSC_6993_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By BRANDON HOPPER   hopperb@ canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Lakewood \u2014 Trenton Stringari had a little extra motivation Saturday.
