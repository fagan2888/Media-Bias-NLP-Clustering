John Boozman, R-Ark. in the 2016 general election. In his remarks, Eldridge criticized both parties in their response to the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare and other issues like the federal debt.\n\nEldridge said the debt, at $18 trillion, \u201chas more than tripled since my opponent took office.\u201d\n\nThe remarks drew a strong response from Boozman campaign manager Chris Caldwell.\n\n\u201cIt is rich that an Obama appointee wants to lay blame somewhere else for the President\u2019s almost doubling of the debt in six years,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cSenator Boozman has continually worked to reduce the debt that Obama has wracked up. He supports the Balanced Budget Amendment, authored an appropriations bill that reigns in spending at rogue agencies like the IRS and voted in favor of the Republican Senate-passed budget that balances in ten years without raising taxes.\u201d\n\nOn issues like healthcare and Obamacare, Eldridge said the political debate seeks to pigeonhole lawmakers in one camp or the other. Eldridge said he believes Republicans are wrong \u201cfor wanting to get rid of it without offering a solution\u201d and Democrats are wrong \u201cto say that the law is perfect and should not be fixed.\n\nEldridge said he supports expanding increasing tax credits for small businesses in order to get health insurance but shied away from specifics. He also supports the Private Option in Arkansas, saying it has improved access for people in need like cancer patients.\n\nEldridge was asked by reporters after the announcement about Obamacare. He said he was opposed to repealing the law and would not answer how he would have voted if he had been in the Senate at the time.\n\n\u201cI am focused on today,\u201d Eldridge said.\n\nCaldwell said Boozman\u2019s views on the issue are clear.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, Senator Boozman has consistently voted to repeal Obamacare. He will always put the needs of Arkansans before the wishes of President Obama,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\nEldridge also criticized Boozman for being in public office since 2001, saying Boozman was beholden to party leaders and \u201cbig money\u201d politics. Caldwell responded that Boozman is in tune with the public.\n\n\u201cSenator Boozman is only beholden to the people of Arkansas who he relentlessly fights for everyday, as opposed to someone who has spent the last five years serving President Obama in Arkansas.\u201d\n\nOTHER ISSUES\n\nEldridge said he would offer leadership, initiative and action if voters send him to Washington, D.C. next fall. Eldridge grew up in Augusta and Lonoke, saying the values he learned from his family would be a focus of his campaign.\n\n\u201cFamily means so much to me,\u201d Eldridge said, noting he was asking for votes and help next year. \u201cAre you with me?\u201d\n\nThe filing period goes from noon Nov. 2 until noon Nov. 9.\n\nThe primary is March 1, while the general election is Nov. 8, 2016.\n\nELDRIDGE BACKGROUND\n\nBefore becoming U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, Eldridge worked with businesses across southwestern, central, and other parts of Arkansas while serving in several roles with Summit Bank and Summit Bancorp Inc. in Arkadelphia. Eldridge held the positions of vice president and assistant general counsel, president of the Arkadelphia region, and CEO during his time at Summit Bank.\n\nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English from Davidson College and gained his Juris Doctor from the University of Arkansas.
