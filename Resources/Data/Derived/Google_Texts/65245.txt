LINCOLN – Bernie Sanders says that he and Republican Donald Trump have one thing in common: Many of their supporters are angry, middle-class Americans who are struggling financially.

The difference is whom they blame for the decline of the middle class, said Sanders on Thursday as he made a campaign appearance in Nebraska before the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses Saturday.

Trump is turning their anger against “scapegoats” such as Latinos and Muslims, Sanders said, while he believes the problem lies with “corporate greed and Wall Street.”

“Here is the reality. The American people have a right to be angry,” he said during an interview before the start of his 1:30 p.m. rally.

“What Trump is doing is what demagogues have done before – scapegoat another group of people,” said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who is running an insurgent bid for the Democratic nomination.

Thousands of Nebraskans lined up early in the morning outside the Lied Center for Performing Arts to hear Sanders. The line extended for blocks. In the end, about 2,500 were let into the auditorium; another 1,500 were turned away.

Those inside roared and chanted “Feel the Bern” as they waited for more than two hours for Sanders to take the stage.

It was clear that even though Sanders lags behind his rival, Hillary Clinton, in the delegate count, his backers remained enthused and committed to him.

He said in the pre-rally interview that his revolution was picking up steam. Turnout is rising in each state, Sanders said, just as it did in 2008 when enthusiasm for Barack Obama swept him into the White House. Still, Clinton outpaced Sanders this week in the Super Tuesday contests, winning more states and more delegates.

“I’m not here to tell you we can transform the election in 10 months,” said Sanders, arguing his revolution needs more time to reach its peak.
