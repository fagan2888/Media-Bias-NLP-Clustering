The board must consider the impact on the overall budget that these insurance costs are causing.\"\n\nThe board said it would instead offer Aetna Freedom1525 in the third year of the contract, which would increase certain doctor copays, such as for specialists.\n\nHowever, a week ago Congress passed a bill to push the \"Cadillac tax\" back to 2020, so Beatty said he hopes the district and association can come to an agreement where teachers can keep their current health insurance plan and also receive more than a \".74 percent\" salary increase.\n\n\"The issue is now over the board's need to come back and offer a deal without the insurance issue in mind,\" Beatty said.\n\nBeatty said the association originally tried to settle on a two-year contract to avoid the issue for now, but the district rejected it.\n\nThe contract will again be discussed at the next Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School Board meeting on Jan. 13.\n\nLindsay Rittenhouse may be reached at lrittenhouse@njadvancemedia.com.
