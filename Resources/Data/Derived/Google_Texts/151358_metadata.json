But before long it was a flood of thousands upon thousands, he said, and they told some of the saddest stories ever.\n\nFor more information about Daybreak Youth Services, which has clinics in Vancouver, visit its website.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through hell and no one knows,\u201d is what they said. But in \u201cBeautiful Boy: A Father\u2019s Journey Through His Son\u2019s Addiction,\u201d they said, Sheff told their stories. Except that some of those tales had a different ending than his hopeful one \u2014 with a young man in real recovery, with years of hard-won sobriety now under his belt.\n\n\u201cOur beautiful boy didn\u2019t make it,\u201d they said. \u201cHe died.\u201d\n\nSo much sadness, desperation, grief and confusion, Sheff marvelled, \u201cand no one was talking about it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why addiction is \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest tragedy,\u201d Sheff told an audience at Clark College on Wednesday night: because it is so stigmatized. Because the people who suffer what is clearly a genetic predilection and a brain disease are hit with moral judgment and punishment instead of loving kindness and appropriate treatment, he said.\n\nSheff said 112,000 Americans die of addiction every year, and that there\u2019s a heroin or prescription medication overdose death every 20 minutes. Overall, he said, there are 23 million people who are addicted in the U.S.; add in their families and Sheff figures that some 100 million Americans are directly impacted by addiction.\n\nAnd yet, addiction is mostly seen as a joke by media that laughs at celebrity misadventures and cycles of detox, he said. When he wrote a magazine piece following the overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in February, the negative and \u201cvitriolic\u201d reaction was swift: What do you mean he was ill? He was a selfish person who wanted to get high and didn\u2019t care about taking care of his kids or about anything else. That\u2019s addiction: a personal failure.\n\n\u201cAddiction is the only disease that carries shame and blame and guilt,\u201d Sheff said. \u201cWe have this image of what a drug addict looks like.\u201d It\u2019s someone passed out in a doorway, someone whose teeth are falling out \u2014 someone who\u2019s a major mess.\n\nThe fact is, Sheff said, an addict \u201ccan look like any one of us.\u201d\n\nAddiction is caused by some combination of genes, brain wiring and situational stress, Sheff said. There\u2019s a reason why 10 kids can go get drunk or high after school and most of them still grow out of the habit while one or two just can\u2019t, Sheff said. It\u2019s not their fault.\n\nBad system\n\nSheff sketched out the tale of \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d: He first caught his son drinking and smoking pot at age 12. He took the problem straight to teachers and counselors, but they told him \u201cwhat I wanted to hear: He\u2019s a great kid, don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s fine. But he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Sheff said.\n\nStill, it took years for the real trouble to surface: the three-day stretch when his son disappeared, finally called for help, and looked emaciated and ready to die when Sheff rescued him.\n\nSheff started making phone calls in search of help. The advice he got, he said, was \u201cappalling.\u201d Throw the boy out. Send him to boot camp. Use \u201ctough love.\u201d\n\nEventually Sheff took his son to a 28-day treatment program in San Francisco. His son emerged clean and sober, clear-eyed and excited about a new life.\n\nBut 28 days is nothing, Sheff discovered; what\u2019s really needed is months. His son promptly vanished again. Eventually Sheff received a call from an emergency room doctor who said the boy\u2019s needle-ruined arm might have to be amputated. That didn\u2019t happen, but it was the beginning of a cycle of ups and downs, treatment and relapse, that lasted for a decade. The boy got into crime and nearly died more than once, Sheff said.\n\nOne thing it all proves, Sheff said: \u201cWhat we call the treatment system in this country is a disaster. Any other disease, we\u2019d know what to do, who to call.\u201d With addiction, he said, insurance has been insufficient and even the best-meaning professionals sometimes fall back on old-fashioned treatments that do not work, including the just-say-no philosophy.\n\n\u201cThat never worked and it never will work,\u201d Sheff said. \u201cAddiction is not a choice. But it looks like a choice. It doesn\u2019t look like a disease.\u201d\n\nThat results in widespread misunderstanding and stigma, he said. But it also means there\u2019s hope.\n\n\u201cAddiction is preventable and treatable,\u201d he said, and it\u2019s also so widespread that a political movement is now building around it. The Affordable Care Act should help on the treatment end, he said, but people have to hold the government accountable for making sure the law does what it\u2019s supposed to do.\n\nAnd he said Daybreak Youth Services, the treatment clinic that sponsored his visit to Vancouver, is doing it right.\n\nSheff added that he is in favor of marijuana legalization because keeping it under wraps has done more harm than good; but it needs to be accompanied by an \u201cintensive\u201d educational campaign aimed at young people, he said. It\u2019s a myth that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive and has no harmful side effects, he said.\n\n\u201cJust because marijuana is legal, does not mean it\u2019s safe,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "After journalist David Sheff's heartbreaking memoir about his son's struggles with addiction &#8212; and with the American health care system", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "After journalist David Sheff's heartbreaking memoir about his son's struggles with addiction &#8212; and with the American health care system &#8212; came out in 2008, the author sta", "title": "Author slams stigma surrounding addiction", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/sep/17/addiction-beautiful-boy-sheff-author-daybreak/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "creator": "_ScottHewitt", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "Author slams stigma surrounding addiction"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Carousel,Charities and nonprofits,Health,Latest News,Life,Local News,News", "published_time": "2014-09-17 17:00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But in \u201cBeautiful Boy: A Father\u2019s Journey Through His Son\u2019s Addiction,\u201d they said, Sheff told their stories.\nFor more information about Daybreak Youth Services, which has clinics in Vancouver, visit its website.\nA AFor more information about Daybreak Youth Services, which has clinics in Vancouver, visit its website.\nAfter journalist David Sheff\u2019s heartbreaking memoir about his son\u2019s struggles with addiction \u2014 and with the American health care system \u2014 came out in 2008, the author started getting letters.\nSheff said 112,000 Americans die of addiction every year, and that there\u2019s a heroin or prescription medication overdose death every 20 minutes."}
