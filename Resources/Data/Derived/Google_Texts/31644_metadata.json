The assessment on Berry\u2019s home in Harter Heights, an older neighborhood southwest of the Notre Dame campus, grew from $109,000 to $180,000.\n\n\u201cBased on what?\u201d Braue said. \u201cI didn\u2019t do any upgrades. It\u2019s the same home it\u2019s been the last 12 years or so.\u201d\n\nThey are just two of the thousands of St. Joseph County property owners who are seeing big increases in their assessments this year. Assessed values in some neighborhoods of Granger, in both Harris and Clay townships, jumped by more than 20 percent.\n\nCounty Assessor Rosemary Mandrici insists there\u2019s nothing sinister going on. There are four reasons assessments can change dramatically, she said:\n\n\u2022 The state can issue a new cost scale, a formula that factors an area\u2019s changes in the prices of labor and materials involved with home construction and renovation, which happened this year. Mandrici said she didn\u2019t know what effect this year\u2019s cost scale might have had on assessments.\n\n\u2022 A \u201ctrending factor\u201d can be imposed, either positively or negatively, if enough home sales in an area occurred over the prior 14 months. This area is called a \u201cneighborhood\u201d by the assessor\u2019s office, and it\u2019s an area typically larger than a person\u2019s street or even subdivision.\n\n\u2022 The area\u2019s land value increases according to annual reassessment, which is performed on a quarter of the county\u2019s properties each year, on a rotating basis.\n\n\u2022 Mistakes made during the assessment process in recent years are corrected.\n\nMandrici said her office this year \u201cstratified\u201d the Harter Heights area, redrawing some neighborhood boundary lines because some properties had been placed in the wrong neighborhoods in the past. Berry said his neighborhood number did change this year. And while Mandrici could not say specifically if that was the reason for Berry\u2019s increase, she said land values vary among neighborhoods.\n\nIn another example, a Harris Township neighborhood had been assessed too low for years because the wrong base rate had been used in the 2012 assessment, but was corrected this year, resulting in a larger increase, Mandrici said.\n\nThe likely culprit for most increases, however, seems to be the area\u2019s recovering housing market. The National Association of Realtors in May reported that the South Bend-Mishawaka area was the country\u2019s third-hottest real estate market during the first quarter of this year. (The federal government defines the South Bend-Mishawaka metropolitan area as Cass County, Mich., and St. Joseph County, Ind.) The report, which the Wall Street Journal covered, said the median price for homes sold in this area during the first three months of 2015 was up 19 percent compared with the same period in 2014.\n\nThis year there were eight assessment neighborhoods in Harris Township, containing a combined 2,545 properties, whose assessed values increased an average of 19 percent, according to data that Mandrici has printed up and made available to the public in binders sitting on the counter of her third floor offices in the County-City Building.\n\nTwelve neighborhoods in Clay Township, containing a total of 2,160 properties, had a 61 percent average increase.\n\nBy contrast, five neighborhoods in Portage Township, located largely in urban areas of South Bend, saw their assessed values decline by an average of 88 percent. Those areas contained 5,485 properties.\n\nCountywide, Mandrici said about 60 percent of the county\u2019s 120,000 properties saw their assessments decline this year, for taxes payable next year, while 21 percent stayed the same and 19 percent increased.\n\nRepublican County Council member Jamie O\u2019Brien, who represents parts of Granger, said he\u2019s heard complaints from about a dozen constituents. He\u2019s also experiencing it firsthand. The assessment on his Knollwood Quail Ridge South home rose about $60,000, from $400,000 to $460,000.\n\nAssessed values are supposed to reflect a property\u2019s market value. O\u2019Brien said he paid a little less than $400,000 for his home about five years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not confident my house has appreciated much, if any, but it could have,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nHe said he has hired an appraiser to estimate the market value of his home, and said he was still deciding whether to appeal his assessment. Braue and Berry said they certainly plan to appeal.\n\nThe deadline for filing petitions for review with Mandrici\u2019s office is Oct. 29. With a little less than a month to go, her office had received 742 petitions as of Friday, and typically receives 3,000 to 3,500 each year, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this since 2006 and it\u2019s not new,\u201d Mandrici said. \u201cTaxpayers, in their minds, think their taxes are never going to change. That\u2019s the purpose of the appeals.\u201d\n\nTo discuss the assessments with taxpayers, Mandrici\u2019s staff has been staying open later, until 6:30 p.m., on select days, and plans to do so one more time on Oct. 27.\n\nProperty tax rates vary by township, but generally speaking, a property owner\u2019s annual bill increases by a little more than $100 for every increase of $10,000 in assessed value, O\u2019Brien said. For Berry, a retired Notre Dame electrical engineering professor, that could increase his bill by about $700.\n\nBerry and his wife, Lois, live on a fixed income, but they have more resources than some of their retired friends and neighbors who also have seen large increases, he said.\n\n\u201cThis will be difficult for some of them to pay,\u201d Berry said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "19 percent of the county\u2019s 120,000 properties saw their assessments increase this year; 60 percent decreased", "title": "St. Joseph County homeowners alarmed by assessment hikes", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/st-joseph-county-homeowners-alarmed-by-assessment-hikes/article_cde70843-5a3e-5df0-bfba-379d8b922ed3.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/ef/8ef02c83-191c-5171-bc00-cc219d8caf68/5610b80594006.image.jpg?resize=760%2C507", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/ef/8ef02c83-191c-5171-bc00-cc219d8caf68/5610b80594006.image.jpg?resize=760%2C507", "description": "19 percent of the county\u2019s 120,000 properties saw their assessments increase this year; 60 percent decreased", "site": "@sbtribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "St. Joseph County homeowners alarmed by assessment hikes"}, "description": "19 percent of the county\u2019s 120,000 properties saw their assessments increase this year; 60 percent decreased", "Published Date": "2015-10-04T05:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "keywords": "#loc,st. joseph county,appeal,assessor,rosemary mandrici,property tax,assessment,local,featured", "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "news_keywords": "#loc,st. joseph county,appeal,assessor,rosemary mandrici,property tax,assessment,local,featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda346\"", "article_summary": "Assessed values in some neighborhoods of Granger, in both Harris and Clay townships, jumped by more than 20 percent.\n(The federal government defines the South Bend-Mishawaka metropolitan area as Cass County, Mich., and St. Joseph County, Ind.)\nThe assessment on Berry\u2019s home in Harter Heights, an older neighborhood southwest of the Notre Dame campus, grew from $109,000 to $180,000.\nAssessed values are supposed to reflect a property\u2019s market value.\nThe assessed value of Braue\u2019s home in Springwood, a newer, upscale Clay Township subdivision northwest of University Park Mall, shot up from $229,000 last year to $319,000 this year."}
