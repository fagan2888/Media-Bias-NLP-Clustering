Pam Hauck said it's been about a week since Gulf County crews rescued her from her home in Wewahitchka.

"It was very scary because the river seemed so unpredictable," Hauck said. "There was no way to know if it was going to continue to rise, or how high it was going to get. When Search and Rescue came, of course I didn't want to be evacuated because I'm disabled, and thought that would be very challenging to have my needs met."

But ever since she came to the Honeyville Community Center last Thursday, she said volunteers have helped make it close to home sweet home.

"The shelter is 100 percent accessible," Hauck said. "They not only meet the needs of us, but many other ones."

While volunteers are helping residents like Hauck recover, Gulf County Search and Rescue teams are continuing to roll along by covering miles of land to help others who've been displaced from their homes.

"Basically from the Calhoun-Gulf county line all the way to the Intracoastal Waterway at White City," Don Minchew of Wewahitchka Search and Rescue said. "It's almost impossible to predict, but it does look like we may have some additional flooded areas."

While flooding is expected to rise in some areas, crews say they'll continue to rise to the challenge of helping those who need it most.

"We'll get the people out to where they can transport them, or do whatever they need to do," Minchew said.

County emergency officials said while the Chipola River is expected to rise, the Apalachicola River appears to be stabilizing.

With more than three dozen roads closed, County School officials say they'll meet Monday to evaluate road conditions, and make a decision concerning any changes in transportation.
