Gary Peters and gubernatorial hopeful Mark Schauer, Clinton said that the two stood up for Michigan in Congress.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThey could have lined up with those saying, \u2018Let Detroit go bankrupt. Let manufacturing just wither away,\u2019\u201d Clinton said at the event at Oakland University in Rochester. \u201cThey could have been on the side of those who were criticizing what they called Government Motors.\u201d\n\nRomney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, wrote a November 2008 op-ed in The New York Times titled, \u201cLet Detroit Go Bankrupt,\u201d arguing against the government bailout of the auto industry. \u201cIf General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye,\u201d Romney said in his now-famous opening. Several critics of the bailout also derisively termed the emergency taxpayer ownership of GM in 2008 \u201cGovernment Motors.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Scoring Hillary Clinton's politics)\n\nOn the stump in 2012, President Barack Obama slammed Romney for the comments, as did former President Bill Clinton, a key supporter for the president during his reelection campaign.\n\nRomney has since defended the op-ed, noting that he didn\u2019t write the headline. The phrase \u201clet Detroit go bankrupt\u201d didn\u2019t appear in the text of his column. In the 2012 campaign, he said that he was calling for a \u201cmanaged bankruptcy\u201d and restructuring of GM and that the bailout represented \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t mention Romney by name on Thursday, she did call out other Republicans. \u201cThey were willing to walk away from the people of this state \u2014 the jobs, the auto industry, the future,\u201d Clinton said of incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land.\n\n\u201cThere are some choices that define careers and define what people are made out of,\u201d she continued, in reference to Schauer and Peters\u2019 support for the bailout as freshmen congressmen. \u201cThere are choices that shape your whole life. This was a choice that would change the future of an industry, a state and a nation.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Clinton adversary has change of heart)\n\nClinton\u2019s speech was heavily partisan in tone, and her implicit criticism of Romney comes as the former Massachusetts governor has faced increasing pressure from Republicans to run for president in 2016. Recent polls show Romney leading the Republican field in early presidential nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThursday\u2019s speech showed Clinton in attack mode, slamming Republicans on issues important to the Democratic base \u2014 paid leave, equal pay, raising the minimum wage and reproductive rights for women. And whether or not Romney ends up running in 2016, the attack on Republicans for opposing the auto industry bailout remains effective for Democrats, particularly in Michigan.\n\nLand, whom recent polls have running firmly behind Peters, said in 2012 that she was \u201cwith\u201d Romney in opposing the bailout. Weeks ago, her campaign said that she would have supported Obama\u2019s auto industry takeover. That comment drew criticism from Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin, who accused the Republican candidate of \u201ctrying to rewrite history \u2026 despite overwhelming evidence that she stood with Mitt Romney to oppose the auto rescue and gratuitously called GM \u2018Government Motors.\u2019\u201d\n\nLevin was in attendance at Thursday\u2019s event. Others at the Oakland University rally included fellow Democratic Rep. John Conyers and Debbie Dingell, the wife of retiring congressman Rep. John Dingell and the favorite to win his seat in November.\n\nRomney\u2019s father, George, was chairman and president of the American Motors Co. before serving as the governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969. In a campaign speech to the United Auto Workers conference in 2012, Bill Clinton slammed Romney and called Obama\u2019s decision to rescue the auto industry the most important he had made as president.\n\n\u201cThis was not about the factory workers,\u201d Clinton said of Romney\u2019s opposition to the auto industry rescue. \u201cEvery time I hear Mr. Romney talking about this, I think his daddy must be turning over in his grave.\u201d\n\nDemocrats ran heavily on the issue in 2012, with Vice President Joe Biden saying at the Democratic National Convention: \u201c[Osama] bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.\u201d\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama visited Detroit last week to campaign for the two Democrats. Both Bill Clinton and President Obama will travel to Michigan in the coming weeks to campaign for the Senate and gubernatorial candidates.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She slams those who wanted to \u201clet Detroit go bankrupt,&quot; which was the title of a Romney op-ed.", "title": "Clinton takes a shot at Romney", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/hillary-clinton-mitt-romney-111960.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/16/141016_hillary_clinton_mitt_romney_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Mitt Romney,Mark Schauer,Hillary Clinton,2016 Elections,Gary Peters,Michigan", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She slams those who wanted to \u201clet Detroit go bankrupt,&quot; which was the title of a Romney op-ed.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photos Clinton takes a shot at RomneyHillary Clinton on Thursday in Michigan took a veiled swipe at Mitt Romney as she criticized those who would have \u201clet Detroit go bankrupt\u201d following the financial crisis in 2008.\n\u201cThis was not about the factory workers,\u201d Clinton said of Romney\u2019s opposition to the auto industry rescue.\nWhile Clinton didn\u2019t mention Romney by name, she did call out other Republicans.\nWeeks ago, her campaign said that she would have supported Obama\u2019s auto industry takeover.\n\u201cThey were willing to walk away from the people of this state \u2014 the jobs, the auto industry, the future,\u201d Clinton said of incumbent Republican Gov."}
