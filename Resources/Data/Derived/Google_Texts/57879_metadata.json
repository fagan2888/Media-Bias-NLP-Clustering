The study claims to be the first to analyze how sleep impacts 24-hour fatty acid levels in the blood, and finds that lack of sleep can disrupt fat metabolism, impairing insulin\u2019s ability to regulate blood sugar.\n\n\u201cAt the population level, multiple studies have reported connections between restricted sleep, weight gain, and type 2 diabetes,\u201d Dr. Esra Tasali, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cExperimental laboratory studies, like ours, help us unravel the mechanisms that may be responsible.\u201d\n\nSleep deprivation is a common problem in the modern world \u2014 especially among people who are highly stressed, or are struggling with insomnia or depression. While many factors are involved in people developing obesity (such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and genetic predisposition), lack of sleep can also increase a person\u2019s risk for obesity.\n\nIn the study, the researchers found that when the 19 male participants got only four hours of sleep for three nights, their blood levels of fatty acids remained high from 4 a.m. to 9 a.m. During the period of time that the fatty acid levels were high, insulin\u2019s efficacy was reduced. They compared that to the participants spending 8.5 hours in bed over the course of four nights. They measured their levels of free fatty acids, glucose, insulin, and the stress hormones noradrenaline and cortisol.\n\nOverall, they found that lack of sleep caused a 15-30 percent increase in late night and early morning fatty acid levels, which correlated with a rise in insulin resistance, which is a sign of pre-diabetes. This lasted five hours.\n\n\u201cIt definitely looks like a packaged deal,\u201d Josiane Broussard, a former graduate student at the University of Chicago and the lead author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cCurtailed sleep produced marked changes in the secretion of growth hormone and levels of noradrenaline \u2014 which can increase circulating fatty acids. The result was a significant loss of the benefits of insulin. This crucial hormone was less able to do its job. Insulin action in these healthy young men resembled what we typically see in early stages of diabetes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obesity epidemic, lack of sleep, diabetes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study finds that lack of sleep can increase a person\u2019s risk for diabetes, by impairing insulin and increasing the levels of fatty acids.", "title": "Can Sleep Battle The Obesity Epidemic?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/can-sleep-battle-obesity-epidemic-sleep-deprivation-disrupts-fat-metabolism-and-322712", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/18/lack-sleep.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study finds that lack of sleep can increase a person\u2019s risk for diabetes, by impairing insulin and increasing the levels of fatty acids.", "title": "Can Sleep Battle The Obesity Epidemic?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/can-sleep-battle-obesity-epidemic-sleep-deprivation-disrupts-fat-metabolism-and-322712", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/18/lack-sleep.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/18/lack-sleep.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-02-19T10:40:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T10:40:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study finds that lack of sleep can increase a person\u2019s risk for diabetes, by impairing insulin and increasing the levels of fatty acids."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca4f\"", "article_summary": "A new study finds that lack of sleep can increase a person\u2019s risk for diabetes, by impairing insulin and increasing the levels of fatty acids.\nThey measured their levels of free fatty acids, glucose, insulin, and the stress hormones noradrenaline and cortisol.\n\u201cCurtailed sleep produced marked changes in the secretion of growth hormone and levels of noradrenaline \u2014 which can increase circulating fatty acids.\nThe study claims to be the first to analyze how sleep impacts 24-hour fatty acid levels in the blood, and finds that lack of sleep can disrupt fat metabolism, impairing insulin\u2019s ability to regulate blood sugar.\nWhile many factors are involved in people developing obesity (such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and genetic predisposition), lack of sleep can also increase a person\u2019s risk for obesity."}
