She also asked the State Department to make all her emails available to the public, giving \"unprecedented insight\" into a high government official's daily duties.\n\nHayes said the voluntary release \"doesn't seem like any kind of transparency\" due to the lack of independent oversight on the choice of emails released.\n\nThe 30,000 unshared emails, characterized by Clinton as private, were allegedly deleted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton said her use of a personal email account while secretary of state followed State Department regulations and was a matter of convenience.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Hillary Clinton said her use of a personal email account while secretary of state followed State Department regulations and was a matter of convenience.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Private email server 'a matter of convenience'", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/03/10/Hillary-Clinton-Private-email-server-a-matter-of-convenience/5091426014547/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/5091426014547/2015/3/d822114c2727e04dc0d98d443411d70b/v2.1/Hillary-Clinton-Private-email-server-a-matter-of-convenience.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton said her use of a personal email account while secretary of state followed State Department regulations and was a matter of convenience.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Private email server 'a matter of convenience'", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5091426014547/2015/upi/a5f903d808035314ef22bf4bd6a67e62/v2.1/Hillary-Clinton-Private-email-server-a-matter-of-convenience.jpg?lg=4", "creator": "@Rafael_Bernal_", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Edward Snowden, Wikileaks, Chelsea Manning", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Edward Snowden, Wikileaks, Chelsea Manning"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5fe0\"", "article_summary": "Professor Darren Hayes, director of cybersecurity at Pace University's Seidenberg School of Computer Science, questioned the idea of operating a private email server.\nWASHINGTON, March 10 (UPI) -- Hillary Clinton said her use of a personal email account during her time as secretary of state followed State Department regulations and was a matter of convenience.\nPersonal email accounts of government officials are bound by privacy laws, while correspondence among .gov accounts immediately becomes public record.\nClinton has faced harsh criticism from Republicans as well as some Democrats for her use of a personal account on the clintonemail.com domain operated from a private server shared with former President Bill Clinton.\nThe 30,000 unshared emails, characterized by Clinton as private, were allegedly deleted."}
