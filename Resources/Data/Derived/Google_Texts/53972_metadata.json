Details below on that and a whole lot more to look for this week.\n\nRecent campaign activity\n\nOn Sunday, Governor Andrew Cuomo was following up on his quick trip to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico by holding two events with Hispanic leaders in the Bronx and Washington Heights. Cuomo was \"joined by leaders in the Hispanic community for campaign rallies at Hostos Community College in the Bronx and the Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Center in Washington Heights,\" according to his public schedule.\n\nCuomo had jetted to the Caribbean to impress Hispanic New York voters and announced plans to increase trade between New York and those two places.\n\nOn Saturday, Cuomo's lieutenant governor running mate Kathy Hochul was back on the Women's Equality Express, this time without Cuomo. Together they announced their endorsement (via Saturday press release) of Justin Wagner, who is a Democrat running for State Senate in the Hudson Valley and was aboard the Express on Saturday, and incumbent Democratic State Senator Cecilia Tkaczyk.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuomo's two main opponents, Republican Rob Astorino and the Green Party's Howie Hawkins have continued traversing the state attempting to pick up on or create anti-Cuomo sentiment and offer their policy proposals to voters.\n\nCuomo, Astorino, Hawkins, and Libertarian Party candidate Michael McDermott are set to debate on Wednesday night.\n\nAlso this week\n\nAlong with anticipating the big debate, we'll be watching this week to see how much of a push Cuomo makes for these Democratic Senate candidates and others. And for the two (of the three) ballot proposals he has expressed support for: Cuomo has said New Yorkers should vote \"yes\" for Prop 1 (redistricting reform) and Prop 3 (Smart Schools Bond Act). Hochul expressed support for all three ballot measures (Prop 2 moves the state Legislature toward e-bills as opposed to printing them at all times).\n\nOn Monday, Cuomo will be hosting Vice President Joe Biden, for \"an event to discuss infrastructure modernization, where the Governor will make an announcement.\" The event will take place at 11 a.m. in Flushing, Queens at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, according to a release from the governor's office. Word is Biden is also due in Syracuse for a campaign rally on Monday with U.S. Rep. Dan Maffei, according to Syracuse.com\n\nBack to election news: as we approach the two weeks until Election Day mark, incumbent Republican Rep. Michael Grimm and his Democratic challenger Domenic Recchia debated on Friday (and aired on ABC-7 Sunday morning). The debate was a contentious one, with each candidate accusing the other of lying on numerous occasions and quite a bit of arguing and interrupting. There was some substance involved, too, as the two do differ starkly on a good deal of policy - things like the Affordable Care Act, taxes, and immigration policy. Despite Grimm being under indictment, Recchia is having a hard time capitalizing, leaving many unimpressed and questioning his candidacy.\n\nThe Mayor, the Comptroller, and the Speaker\n\nLast week was a quiet one for Mayor Bill de Blasio, as was this weekend - on Sunday the mayor's public schedule did include (only) a closed-press meeting with \"Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon of Likud in Manhattan.\" The Mayor continues to work his way through (or around) the controversy surrounding Rachel Noerdlinger, the top aide to his wife. On Monday morning, \"Mayor de Blasio will host a press conference in Broad Channel [Queens] to make an announcement related to Hurricane Sandy recovery...[in the] afternoon, the Mayor will hold a public hearing at City Hall on Int. 466-A, in relation to the speed limit reduction, and Int. 295-A, related to transportation benefits.\" On Tuesday night the mayor is a featured guest at a fundraising event for incumbent Comptroller Tom DiNapoli.\n\nMeanwhile, Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke on Sunday at a rally \"with local elected officials and tenants against rent de-stabilization\" at 545 Prospect Place in Brooklyn, according to his public schedule. And on Monday, Stringer is set to testify at the city council hearing on the controversial Astorica Cove development project.\n\nCity Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito joined for the Cuomo-Hochul rally in the Bronx on Sunday, speaking at Hostos in support of the ticket. On Monday, Mark-Viverito will deliver opening remarks at a city council joint committee hearing on domestic violence and run a participatory budgeting event in her district.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Council will hold a full-body Stated Meeting at which it will vote on several bills and send them to the mayor for approval, while also seeing the introduction of others. As always, the stated meetings are full of legislative action.\n\nCouncil members like Mark-Viverito who are running the program are in full participatory budgeting swing. See below for more details.\n\nAs always, there's a whole bunch of interesting political and civic events this week, including at the end of the week this year's annual Municipal Arts Society (MAS) conference on Thursday and Friday, featuring many interesting speakers and panels dealing with city innovation, infrastructure, and more.
