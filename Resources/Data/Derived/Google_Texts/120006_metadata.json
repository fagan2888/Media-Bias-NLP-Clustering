And investigation revealed that Callery moonlighted on other jobs, which sometimes presented a conflict of interest with his work for the state of Delaware.\n\nState Sen. Greg Lavelle, a Republican from the 4th District, says Callery\u2019s poor oversight has hurt Delaware\u2019s ability to build solid criminal cases in some instances.\n\nLavelle said he wondered if those problems could have been caught sooner.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s an additional failure, if the AG\u2019s office and others knew that this office was not performing its responsibilities -- rather than chatting amongst themselves for years about these failures and shortcomings, they should have brought that to our attention,\u201d Lavelle said.\n\nCountering that claim, a spokesman for the attorney general said the office has a years-long record of speaking out about issues in the medical examiner\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cAny insinuation that we have been silent about problems with the medical examiner\u2019s office is not supported by the facts,\u201d Joe Rogalsky said by email. He also listed \u201cpublicly discussed\u201d concerns dating back to 2007.\n\nCallery was appointed to a 10-year term that offered him lots of autonomy \u2014 and made it complicated for Delaware to fire him.\n\n\u201cThe independence that was designed to ensure independence of scientific results but really created an independence that resulted in a lack of oversight,\u201d Schiliro said.\n\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office was housed within the Department of Health and Social Services headed by Landgraf.\n\n\u201cShe certainly has a role to play in that,\u201d Lavelle said. \u201cI\u2019m a little more disappointed, quite frankly, in the criminal justice system side of state government \u2014 the attorney general\u2019s office and others, who worked in this day to day, who again said, \u2018We all knew there was a problem here,\u2019 but they never communicated it to us.\u201d\n\nLandgraf said the office shuffle under way is the right remedy.\n\n\u201cThe criminal justice system has the expertise in terms of chain of custody and security. With the transfer of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to the Department of Safety and Homeland Security and through the oversight of the Commission of Forensic Science, we will know about problems sooner rather than later,\u201d Landgraf said.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "It took a new state law index php/local/delaware/69637 delaware governor signs bill to abolish medical examiners office to engineer the ouster of Richard Callery but now the Delaware medical", "title": "Suspended Delaware medical examiner out as state officials regroup", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "It took a new state law to engineer the ouster of Richard Callery, but now the Delaware medical examiner is out of a job."}, "twitter": {"description": "It took a new state law to engineer the ouster of Richard Callery, but now the Delaware medical examiner is out of a job.", "creator": "@taunyaenglish", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_", "title": "Suspended Delaware medical examiner out as state officials regroup", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-14", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/delaware/70392-suspended-delaware-medical-examiner-out-as-state-officials-regroup", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "author": "Taunya English", "keywords": "office, state, medical, callery, delaware, letter, department, examiner\u2019s, about, security, schiliro, termination, landgraf, lavelle, oversight, \u201cthe, criminal, independence, there, problems", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0331\"", "article_summary": "Under a reshuffled job chart, the medical examiner\u2019s office is now within his department.\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office was housed within the Department of Health and Social Services headed by Landgraf.\nCountering that claim, a spokesman for the attorney general said the office has a years-long record of speaking out about issues in the medical examiner\u2019s office.\n\u201cAny insinuation that we have been silent about problems with the medical examiner\u2019s office is not supported by the facts,\u201d Joe Rogalsky said by email.\nIt took a new state law to engineer the ouster of Richard Callery, but now the Delaware medical examiner is out of a job."}
