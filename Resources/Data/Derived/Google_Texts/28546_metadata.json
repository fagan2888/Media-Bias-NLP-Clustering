Now, it\u2019s hoping to help advertisers sell products too.\n\nBuzzFeed this week debuted its first foray into e-commerce-enabled branded content with a L\u2019Oreal USA sponsored post that features a click to buy button for readers to purchase the cosmetics and beauty company\u2019s products referenced in the post.\n\nThe post \u201c11 Vintage Hairstyles Anyone Can Pull Off,\u201d sponsored by L\u2019Oreal\u2019s Makeup.com, features animated GIFs, tutorial links and Makeup.com illustrations of different types of buns, braids and blowouts for women to try. Below each GIF or illustration is a blue button that says \u201cLove it? Buy It!\u201d that directs readers to a L\u2019Oreal retail page where they can buy the product used to construct that particular hairstyle.\n\nAs marketers question if sponsored content is really working, an e-commerce capability can help BuzzFeed better quantify the business impact of sponsored content. BuzzFeed is providing the technology integration but all revenue through the e-commerce test goes to L\u2019Oreal. BuzzFeed said it is too early to share statistics for the L\u2019Oreal partnership yet.\n\nBuzzFeed has been successful in producing and distributing highly viral content: the site attracted about 69 million unique visitors in the U.S. in August, according to comScore, and BuzzFeed says it gets about 75% of its traffic from social media sources. BuzzFeed said it wanted to experiment with whether consumers would use its site to not only read entertaining content but to also buy products for brands they like.\n\n\u201cFrom an engagement and sharing perspective, beauty tends to do very well,\u201d said BuzzFeed Chief Revenue Officer Andy Wiedlin, adding that the site has found that \u201chow to\u201d and \u201cdo it yourself\u201d posts tend to get shared at a higher rate than other pieces of branded content. \u201cIf you look at e-commerce consumption, health and beauty are a popular category.\u201d\n\nL\u2019Oreal USA\u2019s Vice President, Digital Innovation, Content and New Ventures Rachel Weiss said the e-commerce integrated posts helps create a more seamless experience for a customer that wants to know how to get a particular look.\n\n\u201cWe want to make beauty fun and accessible for everyone and create content that they care about for beauty,\u201d Ms. Weiss said. \u201cBuzzFeed can help us do it at scale like we\u2019ve never done before.\u201d\n\nL\u2019Oreal is BuzzFeed\u2019s first beauty advertiser for the site\u2019s beauty channel in a partnership that runs through February 2015. Other L\u2019Oreal sponsored posts on BuzzFeed include articles such as \u201cDefinitive Proof Hairspray Gives You Superpowers\u201d and \u201c15 Signs You Should Be A Makeup Artist\u201d and \u201c10 Items From Our Childhood Closet That Never Went Out Of Style.\u201d\n\nNot all of L\u2019Oreal\u2019s sponsored posts with BuzzFeed will be e-commerce enabled, but BuzzFeed said it will experiment with different types of posts to carry the \u201cLove It? Buy It!\u201d button. There are currently no plans to test the e-commerce capability with other partners, but if it proves to be successful the click to buy button could be extended to other brands, Mr. Wiedlin said.\n\n\u201cWe have high confidence that this e-commerce test will work,\u201d Mr. Wiedlin said.\n\nCORRECTION: L\u2019Oreal USA\u2019s Vice President, Digital Innovation, Content and New Ventures Rachel Weiss said of the company\u2019s partnership \u201cWe want to make beauty fun and accessible for everyone and create content that they care about for beauty.\u201d An earlier version of the post misquoted Ms. Weiss.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "BuzzFeed has long pitched to advertisers the power of its technology to make branded content go \"viral\" among the millions of users who share the site\u2019s quizzes and listicles with their friends.
