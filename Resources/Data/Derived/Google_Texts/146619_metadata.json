She is not only a leader in caregiving advocacy, education, research and support, but knows firsthand the joys and challenges of caregiving. Mrs. Carter first became a family caregiver at age 12 when her father was diagnosed with terminal leukemia, and went on to care for other family members over the years. Today she stands as a powerful voice for family caregivers as president of the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving.\n\nThis is why it is such an honor for AARP to receive the 2015 Rosalynn Carter Leadership in Caregiving Award for outstanding work performed in caregiving research, public awareness, and advocacy. Two key components of this work are AARP\u2019s commitment to:\n\nHonoring and recognizing the vital work family caregivers do every day to help their parents, spouses and other loved ones live independently at home\n\nFighting in states across the country for more support, help at home, workplace protections, training and more\n\n\n\n\n\nI Heart Caregivers\n\nTo recognize family caregivers and all that they do, AARP launched an initiative in 2014 called I Heart Caregivers with a goal of shining a bright light on family caregiver stories. I\u2019ve shared my story about caring for my parents \u2014 Mom and Pop \u2014 and invite you to do the same. Our stories are the road map to change and more support for family caregivers.

So far in 2015, 30 state legislatures have taken action to help family caregivers and the loved ones for whom they care. Here are some of the ways:\n\nThe Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act, to support family caregivers when their loved one goes into the hospital and to provide instruction on medical tasks they will need to perform once their loved one returns home\n\nCaregiver employee leave, so family caregivers don\u2019t have to worry about losing pay \u2014 or their jobs \u2014 when they need to take time off to care for a loved one\n\nRespite care, to give family caregivers a much-needed break\n\nCutting through red tape to give nurses more authority to help\n\nMaking sure caregivers have access to the right resources in the community, such as home care and adult day care\n\nHelping family caregivers navigate financial challenges by making sure power of attorney and adult guardianship laws are consistent and honored from state to state\n\nand more!\n\n\n\nContinuing our work to improve the lives of family caregivers, their loved ones and all older Americans, the AARP Foundation will use the award money from the Rosalynn Carter Institute recognition to support work on senior isolation.\n\nCaregiving affects us all\n\nAARP believes supporting family caregivers and their loved ones is a top priority for all of us because, in the words of Mrs. Carter,\n\n\u201cYou have either been a caregiver, you are a caregiver, you will be a caregiver, or someone will care for you.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a family caregiver, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTo stay up to date or to get involved with AARP\u2019s caregiving advocacy in the states, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page.\n\nFor tools and resources, visit aarp.org/caregiving.\n\nTo share your story and connect with others, visit aarp.org/iheartcaregivers.\n\nTo find out how AARP is fighting for you, check out aarp.org/SupportCaregivers.\n\n\n\nElaine Ryan is the vice president of state advocacy and strategy integration (SASI) for AARP.
