That\u2019s an effective income tax rate of 20.4 percent.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, as a result of his policies, the president was subject to limitations in tax preferences, as well as additional Medicare and investment income taxes, for high-income earners,\u201d Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a blog post on the White House website.\n\nThe Obamas aren\u2019t affected by the higher marginal tax rates that took effect in 2013, because their taxable income is less than $450,000. He proposed a $250,000 threshold for higher rates before compromising with Republicans.\n\nThe Obamas donated $59,251 to charity in 2013, down from $150,034 the year before. As a percentage of adjusted gross income, their donations declined to 12.3 percent from 24.6 percent.\n\nThey gave $4,000 to the American Red Cross, $1,500 to the University of Hawaii Foundation and $5,000 to Sidwell Friends School, which their daughters attend. Their largest donation of $8,751 went to the Fisher House Foundation, which provides temporary housing for families near military and veterans\u2019 hospitals.\n\n\u2018Pretty Sterile\u2019\n\nThe Obamas\u2019 return is \u201cpretty sterile,\u201d said Anthony Nitti, a partner at Withum, Smith + Brown PC in Aspen, Colorado.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s decent-sized dollar amounts, but it\u2019s a very, very basic return,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president, 52, made less in 2013 than he did in any year since 2004, the year he gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention that made him a national figure.\n\nObama\u2019s income peaked in 2009, his first year as president, when he reported adjusted gross income of $5.5 million. His $1.8 million tax bill that year is more than three times his income this year.\n\n\u201cApparently, the books are not selling like they once were,\u201d said Dorothy Brown, a law professor at Emory University in Atlanta who has written about the Obamas\u2019 tax returns.\n\nBefore 2004, even with high incomes, the Obamas were one financial emergency away from serious problems, Brown said.\n\nNow, she said, \u201cThey have a reserve that\u2019s liquid that they can draw on.\u201d\n\nThe White House also released the 2013 tax returns for Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill.\n\nThe Bidens reported adjusted gross income of $407,009, the most since at least 1997. The Bidens paid $96,378 in taxes, including $1,497 because of the Obamacare increases, for a tax rate of 23.7 percent.\n\nThe Bidens donated $20,523 to charity, including $15,300 to the USO and $2,400 to the Catholic Diocese in Wilmington, Delaware.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Rubin", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reported adjusted gross income of $481,098 for 2013, down 21 percent from last year, according to tax returns released today by the White House.", "title": "Obamas Paid 20.4% in Taxes on $481,098 of Income in 2013", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-11/obamas-paid-20-4-in-taxes-on-481-098-of-income-in-2013", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSj45vXcDEEM/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Richard Rubin", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Taxes", "news_keywords": "Taxes", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-11/obamas-paid-20-4-in-taxes-on-481-098-of-income-in-2013", "parsely-title": "Obamas Paid 20.4% in Taxes on $481,098 of Income in 2013", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-04-11T19:59:48.055Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reported adjusted gross income of $481,098 for 2013, down 21 percent from last year, according to tax returns released today by the White House.", "parsely-tags": "Taxes,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-04-11T19:59:48.055Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reported adjusted gross income of $481,098 for 2013, down 21 percent from last year, according to tax returns released today by the White House.", "title": "Obamas Paid 20.4% in Taxes on $481,098 of Income in 2013", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-11/obamas-paid-20-4-in-taxes-on-481-098-of-income-in-2013", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSj45vXcDEEM/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reported adjusted gross income of $481,098 for 2013, down 21 percent from last year, according to tax returns released today by the White House."}, "parsely-post-id": "N3VPPS6JTSES01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iSj45vXcDEEM/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda65\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s income peaked in 2009, his first year as president, when he reported adjusted gross income of $5.5 million.\nThe Obamas paid $98,169 in federal taxes, including $2,310 imposed by the 2010 Affordable Care Act that he signed.\nThe Bidens reported adjusted gross income of $407,009, the most since at least 1997.\nAs a percentage of adjusted gross income, their donations declined to 12.3 percent from 24.6 percent.\nThe Bidens paid $96,378 in taxes, including $1,497 because of the Obamacare increases, for a tax rate of 23.7 percent."}
