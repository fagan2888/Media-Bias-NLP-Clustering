Let’s go ahead and say that the entire world would lovingly embrace a full-length movie starring Beyonce and Jay Z. As far as we know, such a thing isn’t in the works, but we got one step closer today, as the power couple released the first of a three-part trailer for their upcoming HBO “On the Run” concert special.

Dubbed “Bang Bang,” the sultry black and white clip opens with the two primping before heading out into the desert. It’s a “Bonnie and Clyde” homage, set to Ennio Murricone’s “Il Vizio di Uccidere,” where guns are drawn (to shoot out mailboxes) and quick meals at roadside diners are the main attraction. But if there was any doubt that these two mean business, it comes towards the end, as they leave the restaurant. Jay takes the moment to stub out his cigar into a patron’s hamburger – one of his bigger disses in recent memory.

HBO’s “On the Run” special premiers this Saturday, September 20.
