Which Ohio Senate Candidate Is Actually an ‘Insider’?

Ohio U.S. Senate candidates Democrat Ted Strickland and Republican Rob Portman are hoping their opponent gets stuck with the dreaded “political insider” label.

Supporters of Strickland’s and Portman’s media team each released a political ad that used the same attacks against each other. And if you weren’t paying close attention, you might think the ads are attacking the same candidate.

Is Rob Portman a D.C. Insider…

The Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC working to elect Democratic senators, launched an attack ad against Republican Senator Rob Portman – labeling him a “D.C. player for 30 years,” a “lobbyist,” a “trade czar,” and did we say “lobbyist?”

The group will air “The Insider” on Ohio television sets from now until May.

… Or Is It Ted Strickland?

Senator Rob Portman’s media team released the ad “DC Insider Ted Strickland” claiming that Strickland is “everything that is wrong with Washington.”

The ad claims Strickland “turned his back on Ohio” to lobby for anti-gun, anti-coal, pro-Obamacare special interests.

The Portman campaign will air this ad in Ohio as part of a six-figure ad buy.

But Will the Political Insider Attack Be Effective?

Strickland and Portman both advanced from their parties’ primaries and will face a tough campaign leading up to Election Day on November 7, 2016.

Polls show the two in a tight race – with Strickland ahead of Portman by less than 2 points.
