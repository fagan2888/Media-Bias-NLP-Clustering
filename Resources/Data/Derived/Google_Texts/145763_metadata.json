See the full list here.\n\nWriting in Reason\u2019s April 2007 issue, Matt Welch delved into the frightening mind of authoritarian maverick John McCain:\n\nMcCain\u2019s dazzling r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014war hero, campaign finance Quixote, chauffeur of the Straight Talk Express, reassuring National Uncle\u2014tends to distract people from his philosophy of government, and his chumminess with national journalists doesn\u2019t help. There is a more useful key to decode how he might behave as president. McCain\u2019s singular goal in public life is to restore citizens\u2019 faith in their government, to give us the same object of belief\u2014national greatness\u2014that helped save his life after he gave up hope as a POW in Vietnam.\n\nAlthough Bill Kristol and David Brooks coined the phrase \u201cnational-greatness conservatism\u201d in a 1997 Wall Street Journal op-ed piece, the sentiments they expressed and the movement forefathers they chose would have been right at home in one of the Chamber of Commerce speeches about the virtues of patriotism that McCain gave in the 1970s. Kristol and Brooks wrote that \u201cwishing to be left alone isn\u2019t a governing doctrine\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s missing from today\u2019s American conservatism is America.\u201d McCain, then an ambitious pol-to-be working the rubber chicken circuit as a famous ex-POW, would deliver inspiring sermonettes about the value of public service and restoring America as an international beacon. All three men would eventually come together on such National Greatness projects as the \u201cforward strategy of freedom\u201d in the Middle East, trying to drive money out of politics, and, not least or last, getting John McCain elected president.\n\nLike Kristol and Brooks, McCain regards Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln as political idols; like them, he never hesitates in asserting that government power should be used to rekindle American (and Republican) pride in government. Unlike most neoconservative intellectuals, however, McCain is intimately familiar with the bluntest edge of state-sponsored force. A McCain presidency would put legislative flesh on David Brooks\u2019 fuzzy pre-9/11 notions of \u201cgrand aspiration,\u201d deploying a virtuous federal bureaucracy to purify unclean private transactions from the boardroom to the bedroom. And it would prosecute the nation\u2019s post-9/11 wars with a militaristic zeal this country hasn\u2019t seen in generations.\n\nView this article.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "For 45 days, we'll be celebrating&nbsp;Reason's 45th anniversary by releasing a story a day from the archives\u2014one for each year of the magazine's history.", "title": "45 Years, 45 Days: Be Afraid of President McCain", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/09/02/45-years-45-days-be-afraid-of-president", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/2013_09/McCain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For 45 days, we'll be celebrating&nbsp;Reason's 45th\nanniversary by releasing a story a day from the archives\u2014one for\neach year of the magazine's history.
