The rescue operation allowed enrollment to surpass expectations by topping 8 million people.\n\nPark's focus in California will be on recruiting skilled technology experts into government roles, the White House said.\n\n\"From launching the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, to opening up troves of government data to the public, to helping spearhead the successful turnaround of HealthCare.gov, Todd has been, and will continue to be, a key member of my administration,\" Obama said.\n\nPark was named in 2012 to be U.S. chief technology officer in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nReports of his departure for California, which the White House said was due to his family's desire to return to their home in time for their children to start school there, first surfaced last week but were not officially confirmed.\n\n(Reporting By Mark Felsenthal; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The White House announced on Thursday that Todd Park, a technology and innovation policy adviser to President Barack Obama, is relocating to California to advise the president on technology from there.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140828&t=2&i=968422751&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA7R0YQ", "title": "White House says technology policy aide Park to take new role", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
