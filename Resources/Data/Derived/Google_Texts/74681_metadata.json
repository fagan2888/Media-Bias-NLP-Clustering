Jim Stevenson said.\n\nStevenson, who represents the city on the Calgary Regional Partnership, figures if the province sees municipalities playing nicely together, that will unlock further funding.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more money that will come from the province ... money always motivates people to work together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s already in place. The province has the money sitting there.\u201d\n\nBut waiting with hands out might be a tad optimistic, Coun. Shane Keating said.\n\nKeating noted Calgary council blew through its Municipal Sustainability Initiative funding in one go and it\u2019s not clear how long it will take until more is offered.\n\nIt should not be up to the city to find every penny, he said, but until there\u2019s a plan, it is.\n\nMaybe the answer is taxes or usage fees or thinking outside the box, he said, pointing to U.S. municipalities.\n\n\u201cThey have things called employment taxes, if you do not live in the municipality but work inside it,\u201d Keating explained. He\u2019s open to exploring it.\n\nOfficials from the city and surrounding communities are set to lobby the provincial government to legislate the Calgary Metropolitan Plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working fine except we have to have it legislated and it\u2019s on the desk of the new minister,\u201d Stevenson said.\n\n\u201cSo we really have to be patient until he does that and hopefully he\u2019ll do it soon.\u201d\n\nIn the works for a decade, the plan will serve as a framework for how Calgary and 14 surrounding municipalities will grow, Stevenson said.\n\n\u201cIt provides us with a boot print of how we carry on developing the whole region, from Banff to Strathmore, down to Nanton and up to Airdrie,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral communities around Calgary have annexed land and started large developments in recent years, the most significant being a 2,500 acre project in Chestermere, which will essentially quadruple its population of 17,000.\n\nAirdrie has a plan to grow to 90,000 over the next 20 years and developments are underway in Strathmore, Canmore, Cochrane, Langdon, and Okotoks.\n\n\u201cWhen we have all this growth on our borders, we have a demand for infrastructure that we have to provide but we don\u2019t have the tax dollars for it, those tax dollars are going to adjacent municipalities,\u201d Stevenson said.\n\nLack of consensus from some communities delayed the plan, Stevenson explained, until former Municipal Affairs Minister Doug Griffiths ordered them into mediation.\n\nStevenson said the framework was handed over to the government in August.\n\nMunicipal elections delayed efforts to legislate it; then Griffiths was shuffled out of the portfolio in December, replaced by Ken Hughes.\n\nMunicipal Affairs spokesman Cam Traynor said the new minister is aware of the issue and open to discussions, but added no time frame has been established for a decision.\n\nChestermere:\n\nChestermere is looking to grow in a big way.\n\nFour new developments are awaiting final approval, which will effectively quadruple the town\u2019s population in the coming years.\n\nAt 2,400 acres, Waterbridge is the largest of the four, proposed to butt up against Calgary\u2019s eastern edge, running from the Trans-Canada Hwy. south to Peigan Tr.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d said Mayor Patricia Matthews, noting an open house to discuss the master area structure plan was held earlier this week.\n\nThe proposed development will be divided into six communities with residential and commercial use.\n\nSchools will be added and several parks.\n\nThe land was annexed in 2009, which officials thought at the time would last about 25 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved to a master area structure plan because of the size of the development \u2014 we want to ensure we fit this in properly with our existing boundaries and we plan the entire area out when it comes to road networks and pathways and drainage,\u201d said Matthews.\n\nPlans call for ground to be broken in 2015, \u201cif everything goes without a hiccup or without a hitch,\u201d said Matthews.\n\nChestermere\u2019s population now sits at about 17,000 and Waterbridge will triple it, adding another 45,000 when complete.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that will be over the next 20 years,\u201d said Matthews.\n\nThe mayor notes however, when the town last annexed land in the late 1990s, officials thought it would be enough for 25 years. It filled up in just 12.\n\nOnce Waterbridge is complete, Calgary\u2019s border will end on one side of the street \u2014 Range Rd. 284 \u2014 and Chestermere\u2019s will start on the other.\n\nBut Matthews said the town has no intention of one-day becoming a suburb of Calgary.\n\n\u201cNo more than Calgary thinking they\u2019re going to be taken over by Chestermere,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe reason we\u2019re putting so much time and effort into this is to ensure our independence and autonomy.\u201d\n\nThe demographic of Chestermere is young families, said Matthews.\n\n\u201cA third of our population is under 21,\u201d she said.\n\nGrowing at such a rate presents challenges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s primarily keeping up with the infrastructure,\u201d said Matthews.\n\n\u201cWe get our water from the City of Calgary through an agreement, so it\u2019s less about actual water and more about being able to keep up putting pipes in the ground.\u201d\n\nAnother development \u2014 Edgewater \u2014 sits directly south of the current.\n\n\u201cI anticipate they\u2019ll get going imminently, if the snow ever stops,\u201d said Matthews.\n\nAnother development \u2014 Bayfield, near Hwy. 791 and Hwy. 1 \u2014 will comprise mostly light industrial and commercial land.\n\n\u2014 Dave Dormer\n\nAirdrie:\n\nAnnexing a large, horseshoe-shaped swath of land west, north and east of Airdrie in 2012 should allow the city to grow for another half century.\n\n\u201cWhy the city decided to do that size of a land base was to limit the incremental annexations, which ends up resulting in a lot of uncertainty between the city and (Rockyview County)\u201d said Tracy Corbett, manager of planning for the City of Airdrie.\n\n\u201cThe intention was a 50-year land supply and it would buy us time to do a number of studies to develop what the vision for that area will be.\u201d\n\nThat work is underway, said Corbett, and includes a number of servicing studies along with a master transportation plan for the area.\n\nA master stormwater plan was recently completed and a new municipal develop plan is expected to be finished soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the growth management criteria in it and we\u2019ll look at what the goals and objectives are, what we\u2019re aiming for, and we\u2019ve built a density strategy into it,\u201d said Corbett.\n\nAirdrie\u2019s current population is about 50,000 and the pre-annexed lands \u2014 development currently underway \u2014 will allow it to grow to about 75,000.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing Airdrie is keeping up with the pace of growth, said Corbett.\n\n\u201cLast year, our growth rate was over 8.6% and we\u2019ve been staying very high for very long,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn 2009, it was 11%. In 2005 we were half the size we are now. It is mind boggling.\n\n\u201cInitially we were thinking we\u2019d get to about 90,000 (population) by 2040, but there\u2019s a really good chance we\u2019re going to hit 90,000 at about 2030 \u2014 it really changes things.\u201d\n\nA number of developers have bought land in the annexed area and plans are starting to be formed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re champing at the bit because they\u2019re building through their lands in the pre-annexation boundary at a much faster rate than they anticipated,\u201dsaid Corbett.\n\n\u201cAnd it takes time to start an area structure plan, deal with the servicing and that sort of thing. We\u2019re hoping to have all our plans and all our servicing strategies completed by 2015.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dave Dormer\n\nStrathmore:\n\nGrowing at an annual rate of 7% to 12% through the late 1990s and early 2000s, officials with the Town of Strathmore knew they would soon run out of land.\n\nSo in 2010, 18.5 quarter sections \u2014 about 1,416 hectares \u2014 were annexed in to the municipality.\n\n\u201cWe were saying, we need 50 years of growth,\u201d said town spokeswoman Tracy Simpson.\n\n\u201cWhat we did to prepare for that is upgraded our wastewater treatment plant so we\u2019d have more capacity and we brought in a water line from Calgary.\u201d\n\nAnd those upgrades were essential, said Simpson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at serving a population of 50,000,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prime for development.\u201d\n\nThe town\u2019s population is about 13,000 right now.\n\nA number of area structure plans have already been approved and ground was broken on several projects fall 2013.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re different sizes \u2014 one is a commercial development and they\u2019ll be going by spring, just north of Hwy. 1, immediately adjacent to the existing Ranch Market,\u201d she said.\n\nA number of area structure plans for residential developments have been approved, which will be known as Westcreek, Wildflower Ranch and Lakewood Meadows.\n\nAnother residential area, Grandview Gardens, is targeting older, affluent Albertans.\n\n\u201cThis is for snowbirds. It\u2019s a gated community for adult living,\u201d said Simpson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to exclude anybody but the people who it attracts will be people who are retired and like to go south for the winter and have their places taken care of while they\u2019re away.\u201d\n\nWell-known Calgary businessman W. Brett Wilson is behind another pair of residential developments, Prairies Edge and Prairies View, and both have already had their area structure plans approved.\n\n\u2014 Dave Dormer\n\nLangdon:\n\nGrowth in Langdon is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\n\u201cWe just approved the last phase of Boulder Creek, which is near the Boulder Creek Golf Course on Hwy. 9 south,\u201d said Rolly Ashdown, who represents Langdon on the Rockyview County council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last of 10 phases and it\u2019s all pretty much built out now that this one is full.\u201d\n\nAnother phase of the ongoing development, Hanson Park, was approved last month and another neighbourhood \u2014 Mornington is expected to start soon.\n\n\u201cI think that one will be 130 houses,\u201d said Ashdown, noting no timeframe has yet been established.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s market driven,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce the economy comes to a point where there\u2019s desire for additional housing, the developer will get started.\u201d\n\nAn even larger proposal, Langdon Meadows, will feature 242 single-family homes, 51 multi-family and 24 mixed-use lots.\n\nMost residents of Langdon work in Calgary, said Ashdown, with the attraction to the area being larger lot sizes and lower taxes.\n\n\u201cYoung families,\u201d he said on Langdon\u2019s demographic.\n\n\u201cI would say predominantly people in their mid-20s to mid-40s, a lot of people with kids.\u201d\n\nA new K-5 school recently opened and Ashdown said plans call for a high school to be built by 2018.\n\n\u201cCurrently (students) go to Chestermere High and it\u2019s bursting at the seams,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd like officials in Chestermere, Ashdown said he doesn\u2019t anticipate Langdon ever becoming part of Calgary.\n\n\u201cJust the distance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCalgary would have to annex that far and Langdon is pretty much the end of Rockyview (County) so if that ever happened it would mean that Rockyview doesn\u2019t exist any longer and I can\u2019t see that happening.\u201d\n\nSitting with a population of about 5,000 Landgon is the third largest hamlet in the province \u2014 behind Sherwood Park and Fort McMurray.\n\n\u2014 Dave Dormer\n\nOkotoks:\n\nWater \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 has long been a thorn in the side of Okotoks developers.\n\nUntil recently, plans called for the town\u2019s population to be capped at about 35,000, but the possibility of a water-sharing agreement with the City of Calgary could change that.\n\n\u201cIt was the town\u2019s policy, written right into the municipal plan,\u201d said Steve Hanhart, team leader of the town\u2019s planning department.\n\n\u201cIt was more of a growth boundary, we defined an area we thought we could grow into, approximately the size of our water supply.\n\n\u201cAlso built into that philosophy was the thinking that the community didn\u2019t want to tie into Calgary (water) for a bunch of reasons, the loss of autonomy and those kinds of things.\u201d\n\nWith the population now sitting about 27,000, Hanhart said a shift in thinking could allow Okotoks to growth significantly.\n\n\u201cRecently the town adopted a continued growth model,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt signals a shift from the old plan to a new plan.\u201d\n\nAs part of the \u201cnew plan,\u201d the town has submitted an application for annexation to the province, including just over 2,000 hectares, which will allow for the current population to triple to about 82,000 over the next 50 or so years.\n\n\u201cThe second thing we\u2019ve done is received direction from council to pursue a water supply from the City of Calgary,\u201d said Hanhart.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is a process and won\u2019t happen quickly.\u201d\n\nPublic consultation will be necessary before the annexation is approved, which could take up to a year.\n\n\u201cIt also requires we negotiate with the rural neighbour we\u2019re proposing to take the land from,\u201d said Hanhart.\n\nCommercial development, said Hanhart, has been the largest sector of growth, and 2013 was one of the strongest on record.\n\nLike Chestermere, Okotoks isn\u2019t looking to become a part of Calgary in the future.\n\n\u201cThe current thinking is no,\u201d Hanhart said.\n\n\u201cThe current thinking of just about every municipality in the region is we should collaboratively work together but we would remain autonomous.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dave Dormer\n\nCanmore:\n\nWith its proximity to the Rocky Mountains and the City of Calgary, Canmore has long been a popular destination for permanent residents and those wanting a home-away-from-home.\n\nAlong with revitalizing the downtown area, there are a few major projects on the go in Canmore, including the redevelopment of a former mobile home and RV park.\n\n\u201cIt was called Restwell Trailer Park and now it\u2019s Spring Creek Mountain Village,\u201d said Alaric Fish, manager of development and planning.\n\n\u201cIt was a mobile home park and now it\u2019s a medium density, more of a mountain community, which is quite close to downtown.\u201d\n\nTwo other developments \u2014 Three Sisters Mountain Village and Silvertip \u2014 are also underway, which could mean more than 4,000 new residents when complete.\n\nWhen they\u2019ll be done, however, really depends on the economy, said Fish.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so-called resort developments,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith a downturn in the economy, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of activity on those sites in the last four years.\u201d\n\nThree Sisters Mountain Village is found on the south side of the valley, stretching from the Nordic Centre almost to Deadman\u2019s Flats, and includes some commercial property along with residential, said Fish, while Silvertip is on the north side of the valley and includes a golf course along with residential properties.\n\n\u201cSilvertip is probably in the order of 1,700 commercial and residential units,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThree Sisters is more along the lines of 2,500 units.\u201d\n\nMostly made up of Calgarians, with a sprinkling of U.S. and U.K. expats, Canmore saw explosive growth during the boom years in Alberta and today the town is home to roughly 12,300 permanent and 6,000 semi-permanent residents.\n\n\u201cIn the short-term we are seeing things pick up,\u201d said Fish.\n\n\u201cWe were really busy in 2006 and 2007 but I don\u2019t think anyone is really desiring to get back to that level of development.\n\n\u201cSomething a little bit slower and more thoughtful is desired by the community but it\u2019s tough to control market forces.\u201d\n\nThe flooding in June 2013, said Fish, has caused planners to re-think some future projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got us looking at some areas we previously thought were OK for development and now we have a higher level of scrutiny on those lands,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNone of them were imminently about to be developed, but we\u2019re re-assessing some of that now.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dave Dormer\n\nCochrane:\n\nRevamping their development strategy and keeping growth in check means Cochrane has lots of room to grow in the coming decades.\n\n\u201cWe (annexed land) about 12 years ago that was supposed to last for about 35 years but the way we\u2019re now developing, our density goals are eight to 10 units per hectare now, so even after 12 years, we still have a 50-year land supply,\u201d said Mayor Ivan Brooker.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean development isn\u2019t booming in Cochrane.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this year, once everybody announces their growth rates, we will likely be the fastest growing municipality in all of Canada again,\u201d said Brooker, noting the town grew by 7.4% last year.\n\n\u201cWe used to have that recognition for quite a few years and we\u2019ll probably be back there again.\u201d\n\nAlong with being \u201ca great place to live,\u201d Brooker said its location makes Cochrane so desirable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the good corridor heading to the west, everybody likes to recreate out that direction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have a community that now has a lot of housing options, we didn\u2019t have a lot of diversity before which was one of our downfalls.\u201d\n\nThe construction of high-end homes pushed land values up, said Brooker, putting the economic squeeze on some looking to relocate there.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have necessarily a great variety of entry-level (homes), and we have a lot now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can go into any community in town and get into a starter home, condo or apartment.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s changing the demographic of who is moving there.\n\n\u201cCochrane is one of the municipalities that has a larger income base,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have a very intellectual community and a very affluent community, but in the last few years we\u2019ve increased the density of apartments. townhouses and even duplexes so we\u2019re getting a lot greater variety \u2014 we\u2019re targeting all areas of affordability.\u201d\n\n\u2014
