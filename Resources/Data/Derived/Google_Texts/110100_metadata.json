For Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney Animation, it\u2019s an accomplishment 20 years in the making.\n\nCatmull, who has a Ph.D. in computer science and five Academy Awards, and previously worked at companies like Boeing and LucasFilms, dreamed of being a Disney animator ever since he was a kid watching \u201cThe Wonderful World of Disney\u201d on television. The successful completion of \u201cToy Story\u201d stirred mixed emotions. The movie soared at the box office, and forever changed the face of animated film. But Catmull was left with a sense of \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nCatmull\u2019s new book, \u201cCreativity, Inc.,\u201d is a candid look at Pixar: its practices, successes and surprising near-failures \u2014 not to mention its iconic co-founder, Steve Jobs. In an interview earlier this week, Catmull spoke with Salon about Silicon Valley, the secret to innovation, the evolution of Pixar and more. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\u201cToy Story\u201d came out in 1995.\n\nNext year will be 20 years.\n\nWatching it, it still seems new and relevant and visually compelling. That\u2019s to an untrained eye, though. As somebody who is a computer animator, it must look different so many years later.\n\nWell, the way we viewed it then \u2014 which I think was the correct way \u2014 is whatever the innovation process is, it is actually secondary. I will say that not everybody got that. And what happens then is, you\u2019ll look at a lot of movies you\u2019ll say, \u201cThe movie looks fantastic, but the story isn\u2019t very good.\u201d So it\u2019s clear one can focus on making it look good, and actually lose sight of the real goal, which is to make a movie that affects people.\n\nI believe one of the things, which we started off with, was we never got confused about that. If we didn\u2019t make a good movie none of this mattered. And I think that\u2019s a thing we keep coming back to. By the end of the book, we say, \u201ckeep making this stuff better and cheaper and faster and do all that.\u201d It\u2019s not the real goal, though. The real goal, in our case, is to make movies that are going to touch the culture in a positive way.\n\nYou discuss in the book how important candor is \u2014 that people working on these creative projects should not be afraid to speak their minds. Why do you think that\u2019s so important?\n\nOne of the points I always want to make is that all of our films start out as disasters. And it took us a while to really understand that this is the way it\u2019s going to be. So the issues of, \u201cAre people candid or are they holding back what they think?\u201d \u2014 that still exists. It would be misleading for people to think, \u201cWell, somehow Pixar has figured out how to be candid.\u201d When actually what we\u2019ve figured out is that we always have a problem with people saying what they think \u2014 it\u2019s human nature \u2014 and, therefore, we always have to work at it.\n\nI was curious if you have a favorite animated movie or, more specifically, a favorite Pixar movie \u2014 either from the standpoint of actually viewing it or the process of it coming together.\n\nOK, so I\u2019ll give you some examples, although I can\u2019t put it in terms of favorites. The real issue which I think you are articulating is that the making of the film gives me a point of view or an experience which is different than the film itself. So I can\u2019t look at \u201cWALL-E\u201d or \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d or \u201cUp\u201d and look at in the same way as people outside of the company would look at it. Each one of them had angst.\n\nWhen I see a film, I\u2019ll remember that there was a time when it wasn\u2019t working and there was some pain and angst in order to get it to work. Then there are these events that happen \u2014 they usually happen once per film, sometimes twice per film. Every once in a while, magic happens and it\u2019s the hardest thing to describe, and that is when [our brain trust] is all of a sudden focused on the problem itself and you just feel it.\n\nI remember one time it happened on \u201cFrozen\u201d when we had added a director. We had one of these meetings, which we don\u2019t record because they\u2019re meant to be spontaneous. There\u2019s something about recording which alters the dynamic. But I was in this meeting when we hit one of these magical points when all of a sudden problems were being solved. And there was an intensity. If you looked around the room and the way everyone was thinking and the way they were engaged \u2014 it was stunning.\n\nI was taken by it and that I went back the next say and said, \u201cThat was so magical, I wish we had recorded\u201d \u2014 but we didn\u2019t, but we do take notes. And I said, well, I\u2019d like to look at the notes. And when I read the notes, it didn\u2019t capture anything that took place in the room. And I was so disappointed. And I asked the directors and they said, \u201cAll we do is use those notes to remind us one or two days later, because it never catches what\u2019s in the room.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pixar president Ed Catmull talks to Salon about Steve Jobs and his company's early struggles", "title": "Pixar chief: \u201cAll of our films start out as disasters\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pixar president Ed Catmull talks to Salon about Steve Jobs and his company's early struggles", "title": "Pixar chief: \u201cAll of our films start out as disasters\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/06/pixar_chief_all_of_our_films_start_out_as_disasters/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/ed_catmull.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pixar president Ed Catmull talks to Salon about Steve Jobs and his company's early struggles", "title": "Pixar chief: \u201cAll of our films start out as disasters\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/ed_catmull.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, cool culture, ed catmull, innovation, Movies, Pixar, Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1227\"", "article_summary": "One of the points I always want to make is that all of our films start out as disasters.\nI was curious if you have a favorite animated movie or, more specifically, a favorite Pixar movie \u2014 either from the standpoint of actually viewing it or the process of it coming together.\nIn an interview earlier this week, Catmull spoke with Salon about Silicon Valley, the secret to innovation, the evolution of Pixar and more.\nFor Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney Animation, it\u2019s an accomplishment 20 years in the making.\nTopics: cool culture, ed catmull, innovation, Movies, Pixar, Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs, Innovation News, Entertainment NewsPixar released \u201cToy Story\u201d nearly 24 years ago \u2014 the first full-length film created entirely with computer animation."}
