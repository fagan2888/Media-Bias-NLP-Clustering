In 2013, Towers Watson surveyed 320 large employers about their “health care and total rewards strategies” in light of health care reform. Nearly half expected voluntary benefits and services to become more important over the next five years. A majority of employers offered disability (80 percent) and accident (68 percent) insurance benefits, and critical illness was cited as one of the top offerings being considered over the next two years. The next generation of employees expects coverage options that enhance their work-life balance, improve their overall quality of life and safeguard their financial future. In the race for qualified candidates, a well-designed benefits package will become increasingly useful to employers in recruiting and retaining top talent.
