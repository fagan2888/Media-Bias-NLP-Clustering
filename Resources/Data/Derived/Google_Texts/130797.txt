Remember that scene in Spaceballs where President Scroob pulls a can of Perri-Air out of his desk drawer and cracks it open? You can recreate that scene now, thanks to a Canadian company.

Minus the pull tab and signature crack of opening an aluminum can, anyway. Vitality Air uses aluminum bottles to package their wares, and they’re packaging at an increasingly rapid pace these days. That’s because the company is doing a very brisk trade in China, which doesn’t come as a complete surprise. Their next shipment is expected to be around 4,000 bottles.

The air quality in China has been a major problem for its residents for decades. Some of its more well-off citizens have, like President Scroob, discovered the delights of artisinal fresh air. How well-off? Presumably these are folks with plenty of disposable income, because Vitality charges around $14 for a vial that contains just three liters of compressed Alberta air.

They say that’s enough for 80 breaths. While at rest, the average adult takes between 12 and 20 breaths every minute. Presumably you’re not supposed to just suck it all up in one go like Scroob does, but if you did you’d burn through your $14 purchase in just four minutes. Fortunately, smog sufferers can cut their pre-breath costs by buying in bulk. A 7.7-liter bottle goes for about $23.

Vitality doesn’t sell just any old air. They’re bottling up the same pure, Rocky Mountain air from Banff and Lake Louise that native Albertans and tourists from around the globe have been enjoying for ages. Not mixed, mind you. They’re two separate products, because the discerning respiratory system demands it.
