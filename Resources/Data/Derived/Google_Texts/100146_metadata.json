For the first time in memory, there is no obvious early favorite \u2014 no candidate with wide appeal who has run before, no incumbent president or vice president, no clear establishment pick.\n\nMeanwhile, an enormous number of potential contenders are looking at the race, including, perhaps, a return of virtually everyone who ran in 2012. Come this time next year, 15 or more of them could be traveling the early primary states, jockeying for attention and money.\n\nThe Republican National Committee is doing its best to prevent a replay of the spectacle of 2012, which saw one candidate after another pop up as a mortal threat to the front-runner. Late last month, the RNC began putting into place rules that would shorten the primary season and make it begin later.\n\nThis is a party that used to pick its standard-bearer in a relatively orderly fashion, notwithstanding the occasional slip on the ice of Iowa or New Hampshire. \u201cTypically, Republicans have a front-runner, and the front-runner wins,\u201d said Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman.\n\nBut two years out from the Iowa caucuses, the Democrats are the ones who are closing ranks. The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll shows presumed contender Hillary Rodham Clinton already holding the support of 73 percent of those likely to vote Democratic. In the poll\u2019s 30-year history, no one has ever had such a strong grip on the party at this early point.\n\nOn the Republican side, things are so wide open that even 2012 nominee Romney is getting another look, although the former Massachusetts governor himself recently told The New York Times: \u201cOh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.\u201d\n\nThat, apparently, was not definite enough for some. \u201cI\u2019ve had one or two semi-serious conversations about whether it could happen,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, Romney\u2019s former policy adviser, who noted the recent release of a documentary showing Romney in a new light. \u201cThe overwhelming consensus is \u2018probably not,\u2019 but it\u2019s not completely far-fetched.\u201d\n\nRomney\u2019s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), is expected to stay in the House in the coming years, with the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee or the speaker\u2019s gavel on the horizon. But he told CNN: \u201cI\u2019m not closing my options.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Christie's Star Fades, Ryan Moves Ahead in GOP Race\n\nNor, it seems, is anyone else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something I\u2019m looking at very seriously,\u201d said real estate developer and reality TV star Donald Trump. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have an interesting field, with a lot of people moving up and down in the race.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cI\u2019m a popular guy because I have popular ideas, talking about how China is ripping us off and about how Obamacare is a disaster. Those are the big issues where people want to see leadership.\u201d\n\nFor all the uncertainty the Republicans face, there is also plenty of opportunity \u2014 if they can find the right champion. History suggests that after giving one party two terms in the White House, voters are usually restless for a change. And if the midterm elections go badly for the Democrats, the political landscape may suddenly look much more favorable for the opposition party \u2014 potentially setting off a stampede of candidates to claim the GOP nomination for what would look like a thoroughly winnable race.\n\nThe next presidential election is expected to be a testing ground for a new generation of Republican leaders \u2014 senators who might include the charismatic Marco Rubio (Fla.), libertarian Rand Paul (Ky.) and tea party gladiator Ted Cruz (Tex.), and much-mentioned governors such as Chris Christie (N.J.), Bobby Jindal (La.), John Kasich (Ohio), Rick Snyder (Mich.), Scott Walker (Wis.) and Mike Pence (Ind.).\n\nRelated: Christie Scandal Opens Door to Far-Right GOP Hopefuls\n\nThen there is the potential for a parade of formers and also-rans. Former Texas governor Rick Perry is preparing for another race, a do-over after his 2012 debacle. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who took the Iowa caucuses in 2008, has said he is thinking about it, too, as is former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), who won Iowa in 2012.\n\nAsked whether he has ruled out another run, former House speaker Newt Gingrich \u2014 busy these days with a CNN show and selling a new book \u2014 was hardly Shermanesque. \u201cProbably,\u201d he replied by e-mail.\n\nEven former pizza magnate Herman Cain, who briefly led the GOP primary polls in late 2011, is keeping the door open. \u201cAs for me, I would never say never,\u201d Cain said. \u201cPeople call up my radio show every day asking me to consider running again. Nobody from the establishment is calling, but there are some people in the grass roots who are reaching out saying, \u2018Herman, get back in.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRounding out the field may be a battalion of backbench congressmen, tea party darlings and conservative media stars, including Maryland neurosurgeon Ben Carson, whose fiery speech at the National Prayer Breakfast last year made him a conservative celebrity, and John Bolton, the former U.N. ambassador, who has raised more than $700,000 for his political action committee. Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), another hawk on foreign policy, is eyeing a run as well.\n\nOf all those being talked about \u2014 or talking themselves up \u2014 there is only one who could enter the race and immediately be declared The Man to Beat.\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush has a stature that gives him the luxury of waiting, knowing that he could upend the contest the moment he took the plunge. \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it later,\u201d Bush said during a school tour Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m deferring the decision to the right time, which is later this year, and the decision will be based on, can I do it joyfully, because I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty pessimistic country right now \u2014 and is it right for my family? So I don\u2019t even want to think about that till it\u2019s the right time, and that\u2019s later on.\u201d\n\nA high profile can be a dangerous thing in the preseason, as Bush\u2019s fellow Floridian Rubio can attest.\n\nBarely a year ago, the cover of Time magazine hailed Rubio as \u201cThe Republican Savior.\u201d But he flubbed his attempt at a star turn delivering the GOP response to the 2013 State of the Union address, and more significantly, he enraged some conservatives in his party by lending his wattage to the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration overhaul bill.\n\nRubio subsequently assumed a lower profile, and by November, the cover of Time was proclaiming: \u201cHow Chris Christie Can Win Over the GOP.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s landslide 2013 reelection, however, has been his high mark thus far. As the New Jersey governor battles a scandal surrounding a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge last year, he stands at third behind Ryan and Bush in the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nChristie still has heavy backing among major Republican donors, including Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, who hosted a large reception for the governor in Florida last month.\n\nMore than 200 financiers attended, sipping cocktails and extolling Christie\u2019s blue-state success. Several promised support for a super PAC that is being put together on his behalf. In 2012, that kind of outside funding became crucial.\n\n\u201cThese other guys, they all have presidential aspirations. And guess what? They go away if Christie becomes the clear leader,\u201d Langone said.\n\nAs for the impact of the bridge controversy on Christie\u2019s prospects, Langone said: \u201cOne good beating makes you more likely to withstand the next beating. This is a growth experience for him.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are hoping to bring order out of chaos with a new set of rules to govern the nominating process.\n\nThe new rules \u2014 if enforced \u2014 would tighten the primary season and delay its launch until February. (The 2012 Iowa caucuses took place in mid-January.) The RNC would prohibit \u201cbeauty contests\u201d such as Iowa\u2019s straw poll, which saps campaign resources and provides a jolt of temporary buzz but usually proves to be meaningless in picking the ultimate nominee. The party also hopes to sharply limit the number of debates and expects to move its convention up to late June or early July, which would give its nominee a jump on the general election season.\n\nYet there is always the possibility that an ill-timed breakout moment could catapult one of the less-viable candidates to the nomination, said Republican consultant Mike Murphy, who mentioned Cruz as a potential \u201cpoison pill in a general\u201d election.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats had their McGovern,\u201d Murphy said, referring to the 1972 landslide election. \u201cHopefully, we won\u2019t have ours.\u201d\n\nThat is why any real solution to the party\u2019s problems lies in the candidates, many senior Republicans argue.\n\n\u201cI thought we had a weak field in 2012,\u201d said Barbour, who is one of the most influential voices in the GOP establishment. He predicted that 2016 will see \u201ca large field, like in 2012, but a much higher-quality field.\u201d\n\nIf Republicans win back the Senate, in addition to holding the House, they can also help clarify the party\u2019s message, giving voters a clearer picture of what the GOP stands for, Barbour said.\n\n\u201cWe will be able to get more passed,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cA lot of people would feel better about the Republican Party\u2019s direction.\u201d\n\nMore from the Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Republicans look ahead to the 2016 presidential race, they are hoping to avoid the", "title": "2016: Hillary vs. Rand, Marco, Ted, Scott, Paul, and\u2026", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/02/2016-Hillary-vs-Rand-Marco-Ted-Scott-Paul-and", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02022014_Christie_Question.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/02/2016-Hillary-vs-Rand-Marco-Ted-Scott-Paul-and", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02022014_Christie_Question.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As Republicans look ahead to the 2016 presidential race, they are hoping to avoid the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1710\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTypically, Republicans have a front-runner, and the front-runner wins,\u201d said Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman.\nIn the poll\u2019s 30-year history, no one has ever had such a strong grip on the party at this early point.\nThe latest Washington Post/ABC News poll shows presumed contender Hillary Rodham Clinton already holding the support of 73 percent of those likely to vote Democratic.\nLate last month, the RNC began putting into place rules that would shorten the primary season and make it begin later.\nBut two years out from the Iowa caucuses, the Democrats are the ones who are closing ranks."}
