The FTC has questioned at length the merger of the only in-patient hospital on the South Coast with the largest physician practice in the region.\n\nThrough those talks, the sale of the outpatient facility became an option that would address some of the biggest FTC issues about market concentration. \u201cWhat\u2019s become very clear to us is that their focus has been on outpatient surgery, Cottage CEO Ron Werft said in a phone interview. \u201cUnless we find a way to continue competition in this area, it will be very difficult for us to move forward.\u201d\n\nCottage has enlisted investment banking firm Cain Investments to sell the operation. Cottage would likely retain ownership of the Pueblo Street facility that houses the outpatient surgery suites, Werft said.\n\nOnce a buyer is identified, the sale would be contingent on the Sansum-Cottage merger being closed. The sale of the centers and closing of the Sansum-Cottage merger would likely happen in a fairly quick sequence, Werft said.\n\nSansum operates its own outpatient surgery centers, including a suite at its new facility on Foothill Road, said Kurt Ransohoff, CEO of Sansum. He likened the sale of the outpatient suites to an airline selling gates at a large airport to allow for more competition.\n\nIronically, the Sansum-Cottage merger is designed to produce an integrated health care system which is one of the stated goals of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe FTC knows the landscape,\u201d said Werft. \u201cThey want the same level of competition or more\u201d in outpatient surgery after the merger closes.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pacific coast business times,sansum clinic,cottage health system,affordable care act,ron werft,kurt ransohoff,,health care,latest news,real estate,south coast,top stories", "og": {"site_name": "Pacific Coast Business Times", "description": "The possible sale is an effort to smooth out any wrinkles with the Federal Trade Commission over the proposed merger with Sansum Clinic.", "title": "Cottage looks to sell surgery center, Sansum merger delayed six months", "url": "http://www.pacbiztimes.com/2015/04/13/cottage-looks-to-sell-surgery-center-sansum-merger-delayed-six-months/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "In a move that will push the South Coast\u2019s biggest health care merger back by six months or more, Cottage Health System is looking to sell its Santa Barbara", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-13T23:32:56-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T23:38:45-06:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd362c\"", "article_summary": "In a move that will push the South Coast\u2019s biggest health care merger back by six months or more, Cottage Health System is looking to sell its Santa Barbara Outpatient Surgery Center operations.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s become very clear to us is that their focus has been on outpatient surgery, Cottage CEO Ron Werft said in a phone interview.\n\u201cThey want the same level of competition or more\u201d in outpatient surgery after the merger closes.\nSansum operates its own outpatient surgery centers, including a suite at its new facility on Foothill Road, said Kurt Ransohoff, CEO of Sansum.\nCottage would likely retain ownership of the Pueblo Street facility that houses the outpatient surgery suites, Werft said."}
