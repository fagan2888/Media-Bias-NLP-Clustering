For example, Omar Abdelkafi, who recently mocked the killings of French satirical writers at Charlie Hebdo and called the terrorist attack in Paris \u201cthe sequel to the comedy film of 9/11,\u201d spoke at the QF\u2019s mosque. Another esteemed speaker said that \u201cJews and their helpers must be destroyed.\u201d\n\nIn April, the foundation\u2019s Twitter feed touted another appearance by Abdelkafi, who also once stated that \u201cMuslims should not shake hands with Christians, or wish them well on Christian holidays, or walk on the same sidewalk with them.\u201d The feed has openly promoted Salman al Alodah, who has has accused Jews of using \u201chuman blood\u201d in their religious ceremonies, hosted Abdulaziz al-Fawzan, a Saudi preacher who called on Muslims to \u201chate\u201d Christians.\n\nRyan Mauro, a national security analyst and adjunct professor at the Clarion Project, called the Qatar Foundation \u201can ideological factory for terrorism, anti-Semitism, Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cA reasonable argument can be made for using Islamist platforms to confront their own extremism, but that requires holding them accountable,\u201d Mauro said. \u201cFirst Lady Obama is right to call for a sweeping changes in the Muslim world for women\u2019s rights, but we must avoid positioning the so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d Islamists as the spearhead of that movement.\u201d\n\nMauro noted that the Qatar Foundation\u2019s Faculty of Islamic Studies has a think tank that is named the Al-Qaradawi Center for Islamic Moderation and Renewal, which bears the name of the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and most influential advocates of Hamas, suicide bombing and other acts of terrorism. \u201cHis Eminence\u201d Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi, as the faculty site refers to him, said the Holocaust was Allah\u2018s punishment of the Jews and that he hopes that Allah uses Muslim hands for the next judgment.\n\n\u201cQaradawi is the leader of a network of terrorism-linked charities called the Union of Good,\u201d Mauro added. \u201cThe charities have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department because they were \u2018created by Hamas leadership to transfer funds to the terrorist organization.'\u201d\n\nThe Qatari government, which the Obama administration continues to see as a \u201cmoderate\u201d partner against Islamic extremism, has been the target of significant bipartisan criticism from Capitol Hill lawmakers for their role in funding terrorist groups such as Hamas. Yet, Qatar remains a top U.S. ally and is sold billions of dollars worth of American arms.\n\nThe White House declined to comment for this article.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Michelle Obama, Qatar, Qatar Foundation, World Innovation Summit for Education, Islamic terrorism, Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama gave a speech on women's rights at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar, which was hosted by radical Islamists.", "title": "Michelle Obama Gives Speech on Women\u2019s Rights at Summit\u2026 Sponsored by Radical Islamists", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Michelle-Obama-Qatar-Reuters.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2015-11-09T17:53:12-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/world/2015/11/09/michelle-obama-gives-speech-on-womens-rights-at-summit-sponsored-by-radical-islamists/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "First Lady Michelle Obama gave a speech on women's rights at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar, which was hosted by radical Islamists.", "creator": "@LauraBaris", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Michelle-Obama-Qatar-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Michelle Obama Gives Speech on Women's Rights at Summit...
