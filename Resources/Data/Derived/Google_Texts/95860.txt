This week, the U.S. Senate's Finance Committee held a hearing on tax reform — with "corporate inversions" at the center of their agenda.

"Corporate tax-dodging" would be a more appropriate term. A corporate inversion is when a corporation moves its headquarters to a "low-tax haven" country while continuing business as usual in the country where it reaps most of its profits.

Senator Grassley, who sits on the Finance Committee, said in 2002 that this gimmick equates to a corporation setting up a filing cabinet and mailbox overseas.

Fast forward 12 years and a Great Recession, and our country has yet to rein in these corporate tax-dodgers. Walgreens, Iowa's largest drugstore chain, is considering such a move to Switzerland in the coming weeks.

Walgreens, which profits handsomely from Medicaid and Medicare, will be able to dodge more than $4 billion in taxes over five years should it decide to set up a mailbox and filing cabinet overseas.

Enough is enough. Everyday Iowans and the American people are upset by this hypocrisy. And our elected officials are starting to take notice.

Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced the "Stop Corporate Tax Inversions Act of 2014". Senator Grassley, who in 2002 said that "these expatriations aren't illegal… but they're sure immoral", should sign on as a co-sponsor to Levin's bill immediately.

Corporate inversions are immoral, unpatriotic, and straining our public services and basic government functions. It's time for Senator Grassley, the Senate Finance Committee and the rest of Congress to put an end to them now.
