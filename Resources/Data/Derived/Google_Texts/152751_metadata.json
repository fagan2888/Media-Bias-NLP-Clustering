Yet, one in 13 American pregnant women admitted to drinking alcohol in the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study. The effects of this early alcohol exposure are the subject of a new study, which found that children born to these mothers grew up with developmental brain deficits.\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of conditions that arise after a child has been exposed to alcohol in the womb. To put it simply, when a pregnant mom drinks alcohol, so does her child \u2014 a result of the alcohol passing from the mom\u2019s blood through the umbilical cord. Too much alcohol, and the baby can be born with any one of the FASD conditions: fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, or alcohol-related birth defects. Each one of these causes the baby to be born with abnormal facial features, small head sizes, growth problems, and problems in the central nervous system and the brain.\n\nThe researchers of the current study were interested in seeing how FASD affected the development of brain function in 7- to 14-year-old kids over an extended period of time. \u201cFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to observe brain activity during mental tasks in children with FASD, but we are the first to utilize these techniques to look at brain activation over time,\u201d study author Dr. Prapti Gautam said in a press release. \u201cWe wanted to see if the differences in brain activation between children with FASD and their healthy peers were static, or if they changed as children got older.\u201d\n\nMost normally developing children experience a boost in cognitive function, particularly working memory and attention, as they go from elementary school to middle school. In order for this to occur, they first need to undergo improvements in visuospatial attention, or the way our brain focuses on things and processes them further. But the researchers found that the brains of children with FASD couldn\u2019t activate as fast as healthy children.\n\nFor the study, the researchers enlisted 31 kids with FASD and 30 without it to undergo an overall total of 122 fMRI scans over the course of two years. While they underwent the scans, they also completed tasks meant to activate parts of their brains responsible for visuospatial attention, among other things. Although their performance on the tasks was comparable, the researchers found that there were \u201csignificant differences in development brain activation over time between the two groups,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Sowell, director of the Institute\u2019s Developmental Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory, in the release. \u201cWhile the healthy control group showed an increase in signal intensity over time, the children with FASD showed a decrease in brain activation during visuospatial attention, especially in the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s these problems, among so many others that children with FASD develop, that have caused some people to mistake FASD for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). According to a study from April, this happens because so many teachers look for signs of ADHD, but rarely FASD. Unfortunately, the best way to treat kids with FASD \u2014 there is no cure \u2014 is to catch it with early intervention, which can improve their development.\n\nNot every woman who drinks while pregnant will give birth to a child with FASD (But why take a chance?), and there are no exact figures on how many children are born with FASD. The CDC estimates that as many as two children per 1,000 are born with fetal alcohol syndrome, and about three times that many have FASD.\n\nSource: Gautam P, Nunez SC, Sowell ER, et al.
