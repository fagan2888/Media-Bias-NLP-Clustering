Too many funerals lately. Too many moons.On Saturday morning, at Phillips-Robinson Funeral Home, I saw many friends from my Stratford High School days. Naturally it was a bittersweet reunion.\n\nBefore heading back across the river, I decided to take the long way home. I drove through the parts of town I remember best from my youth: Rosebank and Inglewood, then Eastland and Edgefield, to Lockeland Springs and Martin\u2019s Corner and to what people now call \u201cFive Points.\u201d\n\nBack in the day, some of these were tough parts of town. As a young police beat reporter for this newspaper, I remember some of these mostly as crime scenes.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon I caught up with Bill Martin Sr., who turns 95 next month. He remembers late nights in the 1980s when Metro police would alert him to break-ins at his store at Eleventh and Fatherland.\n\nLast weekend as I walked along these same street corners, the scenes I saw were no longer pictures of decay and demise but of freshness and renewal. The air smelled of cherry blossoms and tulip trees, of redemption and new hope.\n\nMany young adults were about, heading in and out of a new generation of shops and restaurants. Other 20- and 30-somethings were holding babies or doing chores on the front porches of colorful Victorians and charming bungalows along Woodland and Fatherland, Russell and Boscobel. One young couple stopped at a for-sale sign in front of a bungalow with a picket fence. On the next block, a young man was repairing a chair.\n\nMy grandmother lived at the corner of Sixteenth and Holly. Last weekend, I noticed across the intersection that our family church, Lockeland Baptist, is getting a fresh coat of paint. The historic Holly Street fire hall has a gleaming new fire engine.\n\nIn the revived commercial district at Eleventh and Fatherland, I spoke with many young owners and managers of new retail \u2014 a bead store, coffee shop, bookstore, dress boutique and the cool antique vendor who also provide props to ABC\u2019s \u201cNashville.\u201d\n\nEast Nashvillians, including former Mayor Bill Purcell, will tell you the progress here \u201cdidn\u2019t just happen.\u201d It took willing property owners, supportive zoning overlays and determined entrepreneurs like Meg and Bret MacFadyen, natives of North Carolina and Pennsylvania. They established The Idea Hatchery across Woodland from the post office, birthing eclectic new shops, and the Art & Invention Gallery, and the annual Tomato Art Festival, which has become huge.\n\n\u201cI have never lived in a community,\u201d Bret told me, \u201cwhere people were so interested in each other\u2019s success.\u201d\n\nAround the corner, on a spot that once could have been called \u201cNeedle Park,\u201d a hip restaurant now flourishes. In June, Margot McCormack will celebrate 15 years of her Margot Cafe & Bar. She described her pioneering, early years when the sidewalks were empty and you had to wear gloves when clearing brush lest you grab a used syringe.\n\nIn my lifetime, the biggest difference on the east side has been the arrival of a new generation of Nashvillians. They have reactivated these old neighborhoods with their numbers and new life. It also has taken the tenacity and perseverance of their elders.\n\nOver the past century, in the hundred years since the day of the Great East Nashville Fire (March 22, 1916), Bill Martin Sr. is one who has seen the bad times and now the good. Steadfast, he will tell you about the good fight.\n\n\u201cI love East Nashville,\u201d the grocer said as I sat with him on Sunday afternoon, a gleam in his striking blue eyes. \u201cIt used to be terrible here. Now it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\nKeel Hunt is a Tennessean columnist and the author of \u201cCoup: The Day the Democrats Ousted Their Governor.\u201d Reach him at Keel@TSGNashville.com.
