"We believe this (the peace talks) is a necessary condition," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with journalists.

"The need to continue this dialogue and maintain the ceasefire regime was stressed yesterday during the telephone conversation between President Putin and President Obama."

The Western-backed opposition High Negotiations Committee said in a letter to rebel fighters that government military advances meant a ceasefire was effectively over and it was calling a postponement in the talks.
