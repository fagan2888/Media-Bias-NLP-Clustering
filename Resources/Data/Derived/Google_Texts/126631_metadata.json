Bush, Iraq, Republican Party, News, Politics News\n\nUnder the presidency of George W. Bush, the so-called \u201cDaddy Party\u201d failed spectacularly on all major adult-male-gender-stereotyped fronts.\n\nOn the economic front, its record was terrible, even before it brought us the worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression; on the military/national security front, its failure to prevent 9/11\u2014the worst foreign attack on American soil since the War of 1812\u2014was only compounded by its fighting-fire-with-gasoline response, turning both Iraq and Afghanistan into incubators for new generations of jihadists. On the science front, it presided over a widening war on science. In short, the entire framework of the \u201cDaddy Party\u201d construct fell into disrepute by the time Bush left office in 2008.\n\nBut now\u2014thanks to the terrorist attacks in Paris\u2014there\u2019s a full-on rush to try to resurrect it. Only of course it\u2019s an incoherent mess, with more focus on spreading fear than countering it. Donald Trump has benefited most on the GOP side, with his quick-draw tough talk, but it was similarly mindless, fact-free tough talk that made such a mess of things post-9/11 in the first place, and this time there\u2019s not even a hint of an actual plan\u2014it\u2019s all just heated bluster, and denouncing Democrats for not frothing at the mouth just like them.\n\nThe panic over Syrian refugees is particularly revealing in this regard. Not one American has died at the hands of a refugee either during or since 9/11, although there have been 745,000 of them. Yet, irrational fear of these refugees has defined the only \u201ccoherent\u201d policy response the GOP has come up with\u2014both among myth-driven governors and in the shutdown-happy Congress. But when it comes to actually confronting ISIS, they\u2019ve got nothing unified except a PC rampage against Democrats not using the phrase \u201cradical Islam;\u201d aside from that it\u2019s a smorgasbord of proposals ranging from basically endorsing Hillary Clinton\u2019s position (John Kasich) to cutting off their money (Paul and Fiorina) to grandstanding in Congress (Cruz), to reinvading Iraq, with a side of Syria (Bush, Graham and Santorum), to total war (\u201cdestroy them\u201d\u2014Carson) or multi-front bellicosity (Trump).\n\nOverall, it skews heavily toward an amped-up front-line war, which is exactly what the terrorists want. It\u2019s what they wanted from the 9/11 attacks, and it\u2019s just what we gave them, and we only got a vastly stronger terrorist enemy as a result. So the \u201cDaddy Party\u201d script is already a proven failure. It\u2019s done. It has no foundation in the adult world of facts, only in infantile, fear-filled imaginations, which is why there\u2019s been so much GOP focus on circulating discredited scare stories.\n\nIn fact, the only time that such an all-out-war strategy genuinely has worked in modern American history was World War II\u2014in part because our enemies were ruled by the same kind of flawed hypermasculine ideology, and in part because we made a just peace afterwards with the surviving populations, so that the enmities that led to war in the first place were not reborn.\n\nIt\u2019s the remarkable post-war peacemaking process we need to pay far more attention to\u2014and a truly adult attitude, male and/or female, would clearly recognize that. But what stands in our way most dramatically now, like an 800-pound gorilla, is the GOP\u2019s wild-eyed phantasy of omnipotent male power. And if we want to understand that, we need to dig deep into early childhood psychology, exemplified by the work of Melanie Klein, who used that spelling\u2014\u2019phantasy\u2018 with a \u2018ph\u2019 to distinguish unconscious cognition from conscious daydreams. That phantasy world is profoundly dichotomous\u2014me/not-me, omnipotence/powerlessness, bliss/despair, or even terror\u2014and ruled by its own internal logic, confused and contradictory as it may appear to us, that has nothing to do with the outside world, and everything to do with managing imaginary hopes and fears.\n\nAs Kleinian therapist Chris Minnick writes, \u201cIt is often said that if Freud discovered the \u2018child\u2019 in the adult human personality, then Klein discovered the \u2018baby\u2019 in Freud\u2019s child.\u201d The tendency for fearful conservatives to posture as strong and attack liberals as weak is sometimes seen as an example of projection, a Freudian defense mechanism where an unwanted feeling or quality is defended against by projecting it onto another. But Klein\u2014discovering the \u201cbaby\u201d in Freud\u2019s child\u2014uncovered something more primitive, what she called \u201cprojective identification,\u201d which is not directed onto another, but into them, opening the doorway to a much deeper, richer, more complex world of psychodynamic relationships. Minnick\u2019s website contains a wealth of information about Klein\u2019s approach, but before delving into it, it\u2019s helpful to review some other findings first.\n\nI\u2019ve written before about advances in understanding liberal/conservative differences in terms of conservatives\u2019 higher levels of threat sensitivity or \u201cnegativity bias\u201d at the physiological level, summarized in the paper \u201cDifferences in negativity bias underlie variations in political ideology,\u201d by lead author John R. Hibbing of the University of Nebraska. According to this line of research, liberal/conservative differences represent a normal range of human cognition, which has proven itself through evolution.\n\nI quoted part of the paper which advanced the notion that population mixtures of different sensitivity levels had a group adaptive purpose, similar to how \u201cgroups of spiders benefit from having a mix of social and asocial members and virtually all species benefit from having individuals with different immune systems.\u201d Consequently, \u201cIf this were true, the polarization that afflicts many modern democracies may be a vestige of the mixes of the behaviorally relevant, biological predispositions that worked well in small-scale societies.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that ideological polarization today is similarly benign, much less helpful. Threat level responses that may be in a normal range when surrounded by a diverse mix of people can quickly become pathologically abnormal if a group is surrounded by others who are equally sensitive to threat, and who feed off of each other\u2019s fears, creating a dynamic based on shared phantasy, rather than any actual real-world threat. Something akin to this is clearly at play in societies where racial or ethnic hysteria breaks out into sustained episodes of mass violence, ethnic cleansing, or genocide, and while political leaders in such situations doubtless posture as strong protectors, their actual base of support is wildly out-of-control fear, fear of a sort that is normally only found in helpless infants who have no ability at all to provide for their own needs.\n\nIn America today, this is where \u201cDaddy Party\u201d politics now stands. Which is why Kleinian insights need to be drawn into our discussions in order to fully grasp what\u2019s going on. Gone are the days of actual policies, however deeply flawed they might have been, and we only further confuse ourselves by insisting on trying to understand things in policy terms, when something much darker and more primitive is actually going on.\n\nMinnick\u2019s website is called \u201cMinnick\u2019s Klein Academy: Melanie Klein\u2019s Models for Understanding the BabyCore of Personality,\u201d and a subsection, \u201cThe \u2018Baby Core\u2019 of the Personality,\u201d takes us right to the heart of what all the \u201cDaddy Party\u201d posturing desperately tries to avoid: \u201cAlthough most adults behave much of the time in a \u2018mature and rational manner,\u2019 ALMOST NOTHING WE ADULTS THINK, FEEL, OR DO IN THE COURSE OF OUR DAILY LIFE IS LEFT UNTOUCHED BY \u2018BABY\u2019 STATES OF MIND.\u201d Minnick isn\u2019t normally given to the use of all caps. He really wants to drive that point home. So what are \u201cbaby\u201d states of mind? For one thing, they\u2019re something we\u2019d rather not think about:\n\nBeing helpless, understanding almost nothing, being utterly dependent on of others for one\u2019s very survival (which depends on these \u201cothers\u2019\u201d willingness and capacity to \u201csacrifice\u201d on behalf of an infant) hardly represents a state of affairs that anyone would stand in line for a chance to experience again.\n\nAs a result of this painful state, Minnick notes, there is \u201ca need in early infancy to bring order to the chaos of life outside the womb. This order is achieved by trying to hold \u2018good\u2019 experience (i.e. pleasurable) separate and apart from \u2018bad\u2019 experience (i.e. painful).\u201d This is where the most basic psychological processes emerge: \u201cThis separation leads to a division or partitioning of \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018objects\u2019 (in psychoanalytic parlance, \u2018objects\u2019 refers to people, not things), in which self and object are quite literally divided into \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 aspects or \u2018parts\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis process, commonly referred to as \u201csplitting,\u201d is one of two terms often associated with Klein\u2014along with projective identification. Minnick goes on to say:\n\nThis division into \u2018parts\u2019 that are generally held separately in the mind, will usually include the evacuation of the \u2018bad\u2019 versions of self and object, into the outside world, on a semi-permanent basis, via projective processes, and this whole process will continue to be active throughout the lifespan.\n\n\u201cProjective processes\u201d is Minnick\u2019s preferred alternative for projective identification, which he calls \u201csimultaneously the single most important concept in all of psychoanalysis and simultaneously the most confusing and misunderstood.\u201d In fact, \u201cprojective processes\u201d include introjection (imagining another\u2014or aspects of another\u2014inside oneself) as well as projection\u2014or even both, simultaneously.\n\nAs Minnick points out, the first example Klein herself ever gave of projective identification was precisely along these lines, in a case of \u201cenvious reversal.\u201d Elsewhere he explains:\n\nIn this envy driven \u201crole reversal\u201d (or \u2018envious reversal\u2019 for shorthand), two processes take place instantaneously and simultaneously. The first is that the projector rids himself of the unwanted baby state, by projecting it into the \u2018container\u2019 [the recipient of the projection]. Simultaneously, the projector steals the desirable state of affairs (i.e. some aspect of the \u201ccontainer\u2019s\u201d identity) from the container and takes it in for himself.\n\nSituations like this, in which \u201cthe projector\u2019s unconscious motive has a large component of a desire to exchange positions in life with the container,\u201d are \u201calso so common in infancy with mom,\u201d Minnick notes\u2014an indication of their primal power.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the situation of the \u201cDaddy Party\u201d post-Bush. Everything they once pretended to be had gone bust. The first time since Herbert Hoover that they controlled the White House, Congress and the Supreme Court had ended in utter disaster\u2014disaster so bad that they no longer even knew what conservatism was. On the theory that \u201cconservatism cannot fail, it can only be failed,\u201d many conservatives simply stopped counting Bush as one of their own. And yet, although they adopted that conscious dodge, a deeper part of them, subconsciously, could not escape the sting. Which is part of why there was so much animosity toward Obama, and such eagerness to lay blame on him for things that were actually Bush\u2019s responsibility, or the fault of conservatism more broadly, such as rising debt/GDP ratios, a trend dating back to Ronald Reagan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The party of security tanked the economy and unleashed Middle East disaster.
