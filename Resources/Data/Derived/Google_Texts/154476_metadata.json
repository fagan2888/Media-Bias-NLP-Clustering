The government needs to lead in the creation of a standardized process for hospitals to define, measure and report healthcare-acquired infections (HAI) and healthcare-acquired conditions (HAC). Kiani called for Congress to require hospitals to publicly report HAI and HAC rates to facilitate quality comparisons. Create incentives and disincentives. He suggests Congress suspend payments to hospitals that don't have evidence-based strategies for prevention and shield hospitals that do implement evidence-based practices from malpractice lawsuits through an affirmative defense and limits on damages. Establish a \"patient data super highway\" so hospitals can openly share data with each other, patients and all parties that can use the information to improve patient safety. Extend legal safe harbor to medical technology companies to encourage reporting of adverse events. Assign a patient advocate to every hospital so patients and their families have someone to turn to if they experience a lack of empathy or problems with communication related to their care.\n\n\"Creating a culture of safety begins with one solution, one commitment, one hospital, one act of kindness and love, and one patient at a time,\" Kiani wrote, adding, \"We have it in our power to do the right thing and take steps to eliminate preventable patient deaths, starting now.\"\n\nFor more:\n\n- read Kiani's full testimony (.pdf)\n\n- here's the U-T San Diego opinion piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTeamwork leads to better hospital safety, care quality\n\nHospital-acquired infections rack up $9.8B a year\n\nPatient education may be key to reducing hospital-acquired infections\n\nCoalition wants more funding for infection control tracking system\n\nMultidisciplinary approach drives down C. diff infections, associated deaths\n\nHHS updates infection-prevention action plan\n\nHospital-acquired infections rarely reported", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although hospitals have put in place patient safety programs aimed to reduce hospital-acquired infections, further steps are necessary to prevent avoidable patient deaths, a leading patient safety advocate urged in an opinion piece in U-T San Diego.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although hospitals have put in place patient safety programs aimed to reduce hospital-acquired infections, further steps are necessary to prevent avoidable patient deaths, a leading patient safety advocate urged in an opinion piece in U-T San Diego.", "title": "5 steps to create a culture of patient safety", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/5-steps-create-culture-patient-safety/2013-10-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,healthcare-acquired  infections,healthcare-acquired conditions,Joe Kiani,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,Preventable Deaths,The Patient Safety Movement Foundation", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "He suggests the following five steps to create a culture of patient safety and prevent avoidable patient deaths:Develop a system of transparency.\nAlthough hospitals have put in place patient safety programs aimed to reduce hospital-acquired infections, further steps are necessary to prevent avoidable patient deaths, a leading patient safety advocate urged in an opinion piece in U-T San Diego.\nEstablish a \"patient data super highway\" so hospitals can openly share data with each other, patients and all parties that can use the information to improve patient safety.\nJoe Kiani, founder of The Patient Safety Movement Foundation, recently appeared before the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, recommending steps Congress can take to encourage transparency, best practices and the development of a \"patient data super highway\" to reduce preventable deaths.\n\"Creating a culture of safety begins with one solution, one commitment, one hospital, one act of kindness and love, and one patient at a time,\" Kiani wrote, adding, \"We have it in our power to do the right thing and take steps to eliminate preventable patient deaths, starting now.\""}
