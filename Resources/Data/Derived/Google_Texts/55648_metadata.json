In a conversation with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, the host and Carson were debating the similarities between the Civil Rights struggle of the 20th century, and the LGBT community\u2019s current fight for equality.\n\nDuring the discussion Carson said, \u201cPeople have no control over their race, for instance.\u201d Cuomo then asked, \u201cYou think they have control over their sexuality?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Carson said without hesitation.\n\n\u201cYou think being gay is a choice,\u201d the host replied. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Carson answered. When asked to explain his opinion, Carson said, \u201cA lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d\n\nAppearing on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show later Wednesday, Carson claimed the CNN interview was chopped down significantly to emphasize his controversial comments about homosexuality.\n\nLate Wednesday, Carson apologized on Facebook for his choice of words, but not for the content of what he said. \u201cI do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation. I regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive. For that I apologize unreservedly to all that were offended,\u201d the post reads.\n\nRELATED: Ben Carson: \u2018I deeply regret\u2019 saying homosexuality is a choice\n\n\n\nThe statement goes on to say, \u201cSome of our brightest minds have looked at this debate, and up until this point there have been no definitive studies that people are born into a specific sexuality.\u201d\n\nThis is far from the first time that Carson has courted controversy with things he\u2019s said. Here\u2019s a chronological look at five of his most eyebrow-raising remarks during his relatively short time in the political limelight.\n\n1. Redefining marriage played a role in the \u201cfall of the Roman Empire\u201d - January 22, 2013\n\nWith the publication of his book, America the Beautiful, Carson was able to give his thoughts on a range of issues including marriage equality. Under a chapter entitled, \u201cFreedom to Mind Our Own Business,\u201d Carson wrote \u201cif we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman\u2026 [that] is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending, as witnessed in the dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.\u201d\n\nWriting for Slate months later when Carson\u2019s book got renewed attention, reporter Dave Weigel pointed out gay marriage had been named a \u201clegal deviance\u201d 100 years before the fall of Rome.\n\n2. No one can redefine marriage, \u201cbe they gays, be they NAMBLA\u2026\u201d - March 26, 2013\n\nWhile appearing on the FOX News Channel in late March of 2013, Carson was asked about impending Supreme Court action on marriage equality. Carson stated he believes that marriage is \u201cbetween a man and a woman\u201d before adding that no one can change the definition of marriage, \u201cbe they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality.\u201d\n\nAppearing later that week on msnbc, Carson told Andrea Mitchell that \u201cif anyone was offended, I apologize.\u201d The neurosurgeon said his intent was not to equate the gay community with pedophiles or those who practice bestiality.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me for an apple and I give you an orange you would say, that\u2019s not an orange,\u201d Carson explained. \u201cAnd I say, that\u2019s a banana. And that\u2019s not an apple either. Or a peach, that\u2019s not an apple, either. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m equating the banana and the orange and the peach. In the same way I\u2019m not equating those things.\u201d\n\nThe controversy around these remarks eventually led to Carson stepping down as the commencement speaker at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\n3. Obamacare is \u201cworst thing\u201d to happen to America since slavery - November 11, 2013\n\nSpeaking at the Value Voter Summit in November of 2013, Carson said to applause that \u201cObamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d He continued his analogy saying that the Affordable Care Act was \u201cmaking all of us subservient to the government.\u201d\n\nCarson said the law was never about health care but was instead about control likening the Obama administration\u2019s health care law to the tactics of Soviet Russia.\n\n4. The United States is \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany\u201d - March 12, 2014\n\nIn Spring of 2014, Carson made more headlines for an interview he gave to Breitbart News. Carson was asked a question about his claim Americans are living in a \u201cgestapo age.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery much like Nazi Germany - and I know you\u2019re not supposed to talk about Nazi Germany but I don\u2019t care about political correctness - you had a government using its tools to intimidate a population,\u201d Carson answered. \u201cWe now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.\u201d\n\nCarson blamed this on the \u201cPC police,\u201d politicians and the media. Carson claimed \u201ca horrible schism\u201d is being created that is threatening to \u201cdestroy our nation if we don\u2019t fix it.\u201d\n\n5. Obamacare is worse than 9/11\u2026 except it isn\u2019t - June 5, 2014\n\nFast forward to summer of 2014, Ben Carson is giving an interview to The Daily Beast. The reporter questioned Carson about his claim that Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d and asked: how is Obamacare worse than 9/11?\n\nCarson explained Obamacare is worse \u201cbecause 9/11 is an isolated event,\u201d in audio published along with the The Daily Beast article. The reporter then asks what caused families more pain: Obamacare or Osama bin Laden?\n\n\u201cThings that are isolated issues as opposed to things that fundamentally change the United States of America and shift power from the people to the government,\u201d Carson told The Daily Beast. \u201cThat is a huge shift.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed again about his stance, Carson can be heard saying on the audio recording, \u201cYou have to take a long-term look at the ascent of something that fundamentally changes the power structure in America.\u201d\n\nThe very next day, Carson issued a statement saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think Obamacare is worse than 9/11. The two things aren\u2019t comparable and I never intended to compare them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Nazis, and NAMBLA, and 9/11.
