David Freedlander on what it means for 2016.\n\nSo goes Ohio, so goes the nation.\n\nAt least that\u2019s how every presidential election has gone since 1964, as both Democrats and Republicans have fiercely fought over this purplest of the purple states before it sided with the eventual winner.\n\nBut as Republicans look to take back the White House in 2016, the Buckeye State does not appear to be cooperating. Instead, Republicans in Ohio have slipped into an all out civil war, with a Tea Party faction threatening to break away from the GOP machinery.\n\nTheir complaints? A Republican senator, Rob Portman, after campaigning last year on his support for marriage being defined as between a man and a woman, abruptly reversed course once his son came out as gay. A Republican governor, John Kasich, pushed to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, despite remaining a vocal supporter of repealing the entire bill. An executive director of the Ohio Republican Party, elected after a bitter intraparty dispute, once worked as a lobbyist for Equality Ohio, a gay-rights group formed after the state voted to outlaw same-sex marriage. And never mind that House Speaker John Boehner, long a scourge of Tea Party types, is also an Ohioan, representing a southwest slice of the state.\n\n\u201cDisappointment would be an appropriate word about where the Tea Party is today,\u201d said Seth Morgan, a former state lawmaker who now works for Americans for Prosperity-Ohio, a Koch brothers\u2013backed group that has helped bankroll numerous Tea Party challenges. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t get involved to elect individual candidates. They wanted to save the country, and they still do, but there is a high level of frustration here.\u201d\n\nTo hear Tea Partiers tell it, the trouble reached a crescendo in the spring, when Gov. Kasich installed an ally, Matt Borges, as executive director of the Ohio GOP over Tom Zawistowski, a local Tea Party leader. \u201cThe leaders of the Republican Party in Ohio have chosen to separate themselves and the party from the wishes and values of their support base,\u201d Zawistowski said in a statement signed by more than 70 conservative leaders from around the state. \u201cWith this letter we put the party bosses on notice that we reject their betrayal of the party platform and our conservative values. We will not support them going forward but will instead support those who are true to our cause.\u201d\n\nThat was after Kasich had worked to expand Medicaid coverage, a key component of the Affordable Care Act. Kasich rode into office on a wave of conservative anger at the bill, attending a Tea Party rally the night before the election and proclaiming at the start of his campaign, \u201cI was in the Tea Party before there was a Tea Party.\u201d His move on the Medicaid expansion could save the state $4 billion by 2025 and expand coverage for 300,000 Ohioans. It also has brought him warm profiles in such outlets as The Wall Street Journal, which suggested that Kasich\u2019s approach could \u201crebrand the Republican Party by refashioning what it means to be a conservative in the 21st century.\u201d But for conservatives, the expansion has brought nothing but anger, not least because Kasich has defended his actions in biblical, moralistic terms, describing the move as something demanded by his Christian faith.\n\n\u201cIn our Bible, compassion means the money comes from you,\u201d Zawistowski told The Daily Beast. \u201cMedicaid is for single women with children and for the elderly, for people who can\u2019t work. What they are calling Medicaid expansion is health insurance for people who don\u2019t want to work. You are not expanding Medicaid. This is a whole new program and it is with borrowed money.\u201d\n\nAmong Kasich\u2019s other offenses, according to Tea Partiers, are not going far enough to push for charter schools and vouchers, increasing spending, and taxing the energy industry for fracking on Ohio farmland. Kasich has framed that issue, one conservative blogger wrote, \u201cas if the natural resources in citizens\u2019 property belong to the State of Ohio.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried to do a severance tax on the energy industry,\u201d said Zawistowski. \u201cYou know why? He said it was because they could afford it. That sounds very liberal to me, when you decide what someone else can afford. And he made it sound as if those lines somehow belong to the state of Ohio and we are owed some of the money they generate. Well, guess what, governor\u2014those are private lines, and the people who own the land they are on owe you nothing, comrade.\u201d\n\nTea Partiers say they won\u2019t support Kasich\u2019s reelection effort in 2014 as a result of his recent moves and that they are throwing their support behind Charlie Earl, a libertarian, if no primary challenger emerges.\n\n\u201cJohn Kasich is going to lose in 2014,\u201d Zawistowski said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care who else wins.\u201d\n\nAs for Portman, his reversal of his marriage stance was cheered as landmark decision by same-sex marriage advocates. If a Republican senator can change his mind, especially one who was on the short list to be Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate, then the debate on the issue will soon be over, they say. But to conservatives in Ohio, Portman\u2019s switch was a flip-flop of the worst order, especially as Portman boasted of his opposition to same-sex marriage when he ran in 2010.\n\n\u201cThis was a very developed policy position,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we are talking about the drone debate, where it is a developing issue. How can he just change his mind on this position because of his son, when he spent years courting social conservatives?\u201d\n\nAs the Tea Party roils Republican politics, Ohio stands a little bit apart. Not only is it the quintessential swing state, but it boasts both a highly organized Republican Party and a highly organized Tea Party, one that is organized under a statewide umbrella group and holds frequent coalition meetings. In 2011, Ohio voters resoundingly defeated a Kasich-backed bill that would have limited the collective-bargaining rights of public-sector unions, but they also approved a bill that would forbid the federal government from forcing Ohioans to participate in the health-care system.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

It is the same thing happening all over,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some effort that was circulated [by Tea Partiers] to gain control of the party, and I think they ended up with six votes. We have plenty of Tea Partiers on the state committee, and many of them supported me.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, Borges said, have to be united if they want to keep the Democrats from taking over and doing further damage to the economy.\n\n\u201cOur work isn\u2019t done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be vigilant, and that to me is the most important reason that we have to be united, because if we are divided our government will go back to the Democrats, who we agree with about zero percent of the time.\u201d\n\nNeil Clark, a Republican lobbyist in Columbus, echoed Borges, noting that in a state so divided, Kasich and others were right to ignore the extremes of the party.\n\n\u201cI guess for some people in Ohio, unless you are a card-carrying Nazi you can\u2019t be a Republican,\u201d he said. And he pointed to polls that showed more and more Ohioans support Kasich, who is now a legitimate contender in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "Freedlander"}, "keywords": "Ohio, United States, Google, Republican Party, u.s. poli, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201309040845, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Tea Partiers threatening to break away from the state GOP machinery.
