A winter storm is expected to arrive Sunday night and most of the day on Monday and its effects will cause travel to become difficult.

The City of Wichita has spent nearly 24 hours spreading salt and sand on main driving routes.

"Since midnight, we went ahead and deployed all 60 snow plows. The idea being that without the precipitation, we can actually do some good," said Alan King of the City of Wichita.

King says that drivers need to be on the lookout for slick spots as wet roads transition to icy roads. He also wants drivers to use caution around other drivers and the cities snow plows.
