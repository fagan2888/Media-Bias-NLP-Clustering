Another $483,000 will come out of a fund that is usually used to invest in new positions and $446,000 will come from a reduction in spending on energy, equipment replacements, research awards and external consultants, according to an email Kalikow sent to campus employees.\n\nKalikow said the university is anticipating cutting $12.5 million next year in order to pass a balanced fiscal year 2016 budget.\n\n\u201cWe will, as a community, continue to make hard choices that position this university for the future and provide a first-class, affordable education for our students,\u201d wrote Kalikow.\n\nReducing the shortfall \u201cwill necessarily include faculty and staff layoffs, more restructuring for administrative savings, and strategic choices about programs.\u201d\n\nThe elimination of three USM programs \u2014 American and New England studies, arts and humanities at the Lewiston-Auburn campus, and geosciences \u2014 will go forward, she said.\n\nLast month, the University of Maine System\u2019s board of trustees voted to pass a $529 million budget for fiscal year 2015 that cut 157 jobs and pulled $11.7 million from the system\u2019s rainy day fund for the first time since the fund\u2019s creation.\n\nThe budget accounts for $22.7 million worth of cuts that were made across all seven of the system\u2019s universities. Presidents and financial administrators worked with the system office throughout the year to figure out where to make those cuts.\n\nUMS administrators have said that the cuts are an effort to mitigate a systemic budget shortfall caused by flat funding from the state and frozen in-state tuition rates, paired with rising costs and a declining student population in Maine. Last fall, the board of trustees was presented with the fact that if the system did not make changes, it would be up to $90 million in debt by fiscal year 2019, according to system documents.\n\nUSM was tasked with finding $14 million in savings this year, or about 10 percent of its budget. When the budget passed, $2.5 million of USM\u2019s cuts had yet to be determined because the administration decided to give the faculty a chance to weigh in.\n\nIn March, 12 faculty members received notice that they would be laid off as part of Kalikow\u2019s plan to cut USM\u2019s budget. Students and faculty responded by organizing rallies and engaging lawmakers in an effort to reverse the cuts.\n\nAt a Faculty Senate meeting in April, Kalikow announced the 12 faculty layoffs would be rescinded and implored the faculty to come up with an alternative plan to find the savings.\n\nMembers of the Faculty Senate presented their alternative plan in late May, which included $1.6 million in administrator compensation cuts and $2.1 million in voluntary early retirements from faculty members.\n\nKalikow said Friday that some of the faculty\u2019s recommendations were accepted, including the retirements, though not all those savings would be realized in fiscal year 2015. Other recommendations could not be implemented immediately and would be considered in the coming years, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reasonably pleased and comfortable with it,\u201d Jerry LaSala, chairman of the USM Faculty Senate, said Friday of the fiscal year 2015 budget. \u201cAlmost all savings were found in places other than faculty.\u201d\n\nNow, Kalikow will go to the UMS board of trustees for approval of this most recent proposal of cuts. She will send her proposal to the trustees on Monday, she said.\n\n\u201cI think we have gotten to a good place,\u201d Kalikow said on Friday. \u201cWe are going to try to continue to collaborate in FY \u201816, because we have a big fat challenge for \u201816, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 University of Southern Maine President Theodora Kalikow announced Friday the final phase of cuts needed to pass a balanced fiscal year 2015 budget, though more cuts are expected in the coming years.The bulk of the savings \u2014 $1.56 million \u2014 will come from 16 faculty retirements and [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 University of Southern Maine President Theodora Kalikow announced Friday the final phase of cuts needed to pass a balanced fiscal year 2015 budget, though more cuts are expected in the coming years.
