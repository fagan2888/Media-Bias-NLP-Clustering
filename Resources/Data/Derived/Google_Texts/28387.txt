UNC rising junior Chandler Kania has been charged for a car accident Sunday morning that killed three people and injured a fourth.

The N.C. Highway Patrol's preliminary investigation found that Kania was traveling the wrong way on Interstate 85 near mile marker 163 in a 2005 Jeep Wrangler when he crashed head-on with a 2007 Suzuki carrying four passengers on Sunday at 3 a.m.

Driver Felecia Harris, 49, of Charlotte; Darlene McGee, 46, of Charlotte; and Jahnice Baird, 6, of Brooklyn, N.Y., were all killed upon impact.

The fourth passenger, Jahnia King, 9, of Charlotte, is currently in critical condition at UNC Hospitals.

Kania suffered injuries that were not life-threatening.

So far, Kania has been charged with driving while impaired, careless and reckless driving, possession of an open container of alcohol, possession of alcohol by a person under 21 and driving as a person less than 21 after consuming alcohol.

N.C. Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon said in a statement that additional charges are expected.

Because alcohol is suspected to have been involved, Alcohol Law Enforcement is working with the N.C. Highway Patrol in investigating the incident.

Kania is a board member of Tar Heel Beginnings and a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
