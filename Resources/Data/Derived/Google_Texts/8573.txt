SPENCERPORT, N.Y. — An 88-year-old World War II veteran who loved to fly died today when his single-engine plane crashed in the upstate New York airfield that bore his name, authorities said.

Norman Hasman, a tail gunner who was shot down twice in combat and was a prisoner of war in Germany, was pronounced dead at the scene after his plane’s left wheel caught a patch of tall grass, causing the Cessna 140 to veer to the left and flip on its back, according to Sgt. Bob Murphy of the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office.

Hasman had been flying touch-and-go exercises throughout the morning. He crashed as he descended from the north for either a touch-and-go or a landing at Hasman Field just northwest of the Greater Rochester International Airport, Murphy said.

“He was doing what he loved,” Murphy said. “He loved to fly.”

Gusty winds may have contributed to the crash, but authorities have yet to officially determine the cause, Murphy said. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.

A nearby business owner who saw the longtime pilot flying earlier called 911 just before 1 p.m. after noticing the plane turned upside down, Murphy said.

The veteran’s family was notified and was comforted that Hasman died flying, which was his passion, the sergeant said.

Elsewhere in New York, a 79-year-old man near Buffalo was airlifted to a hospital after a single-engine plane he was flying crashed while taking off, authorities said.
