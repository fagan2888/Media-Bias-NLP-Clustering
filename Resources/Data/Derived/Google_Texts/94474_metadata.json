CC By 2.0\n\nGone are the days of joyriding in the bed of a speeding pickup down a country road, tossing soda cans surreptitiously overboard in childhood rebellion \u2014 in most places. Twenty mostly rural states \u2014 including Vermont, New Hampshire, and Alabama \u2014 permit passengers to ride in the back of pickup trucks, with age restrictions for minors. In Massachusetts, home to world-class emergency hospital care, children ages 12 and older are permitted to ride thusly, so long as they\u2019re not hanging off the side or otherwise alarming other motorists.\n\nStill, many safety experts point to successes in the continued reduction of traffic fatalities in the United States, especially among children. A combination of improved technology and safety regulation has brought increasingly lower death rates on the nation\u2019s roads and highways, falling annually by nearly 15 percent. On a per capita basis, the death rate has fallen between 1979 and 2005 by more than 35 percent.\n\nDespite the strides, car crashes remain a leading cause of death for children ages one to 13. In 2012, car crashes killed 444 American childen ages one to four, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Worldwide, some 260,000 children die annually in car crashes, with 10 million injuries.\n\nHoping for greater improvement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety this month suggested the use of child booster seats until age 12, well beyond the age required in most states. The organization says such safety devices lower risk of injury during crashes by 45 percent among children ages 4-8.\n\nAlthough most states prohibit passengers from riding in the bed of a pickup truck, one state--Massachusetts--allows children as young as 12 to do so. CC By 2.0\n\nMost parents might balk at requiring their pubescent son, for example, to use a child booster seat, however. Others say they agree with the recommendations. \u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Jessica Benitez told CBS News. \u201cAs many wrecks as there are, as congested as the roadways are, people texting and driving, all that stuff, the safer we can keep the kids, the better.\u201d\n\nYet, some experts say that while state laws might be helpful in improving safety the size, rather than age, of the child might be a better metric. Shelli Stephens-Stidham, with the Injury Prevention Center of Greater Dallas at Parkland Hospital, recommends pushing the limits with pre-teens.\n\n\u201cKids need to stay in a booster seat until they can adequately fit in a seat belt and ride for a long period of time with their backs against the seat, their feet on the floorboard and their bottom near the bite of the seat,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can keep your kid in a booster seat until they\u2019re 12 years old, then do that.\u201d\n\nEvery day in America, 89 people \u2014 children and adults \u2014 die in car crashes. In 2011, more than 32,000 Americans died while traveling in a motor vehicle, the lowest level in 62 years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "child car safety, child booster seats, automobile fatalities", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety now recommends the use of child booster seats in automobiles for children up to age 12, well beyond most state requirements.", "title": "Child Booster Seats Recommended Until Age 12", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/child-booster-seats-recommended-until-age-12-insurance-institute-highway-safety-raises-bar-262485", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/experts-recommend-booster-seats-until-age-12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety now recommends the use of child booster seats in automobiles for children up to age 12, well beyond most state requirements.", "title": "Child Booster Seats Recommended Until Age 12", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/child-booster-seats-recommended-until-age-12-insurance-institute-highway-safety-raises-bar-262485", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/experts-recommend-booster-seats-until-age-12.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/experts-recommend-booster-seats-until-age-12.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-11-09T23:11:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-10T11:44:05-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety now recommends the use of child booster seats in automobiles for children up to age 12, well beyond most state requirements."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e5a\"", "article_summary": "Some safety experts now recommend parents require children up to age 12 to use child booster seats in the car.\nCC By 2.0Most parents might balk at requiring their pubescent son, for example, to use a child booster seat, however.\nHoping for greater improvement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety this month suggested the use of child booster seats until age 12, well beyond the age required in most states.\nIn 2012, car crashes killed 444 American childen ages one to four, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\nDespite the strides, car crashes remain a leading cause of death for children ages one to 13."}
