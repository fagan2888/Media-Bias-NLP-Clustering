LOUIS \u2014 The verdict is still out about the Avalanche being an above-average NHL team, but the Avs unquestionably have been great against the league\u2019s best division, the mighty Central. After Sunday\u2019s 3-1 victory against the mighty St. Louis Blues at the Scottrade Center \u2014 where goalie Semyon Varlamov was stellar in a 42-save performance \u2014 Colorado is 6-2 against divisional opponents.\n\n\u201cThese division games are so important, and this is not an easy road trip,\u201d said Avalanche captain Gabe Landeskog, who returned to the lineup after missing two games with back spasms. \u201cWhether tonight was an ugly one or not, it was a playoff-type game and I think the guys did a good job. Obviously, Varly was our best player again.\u201d\n\nLandeskog used the word \u201cugly\u201d because the Avs were outshot 43-18. But after getting first-period goals from Jack Skille and John Mitchell to forge a 2-0 lead for the second consecutive road game, the Blues naturally began to press. Still, Colorado had a handful of glorious chances to blow the game open in the second and third periods.\n\n\u201cIt was the first period, the key. Both teams were on a back-to-back (set), and we scored two goals,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cWhen a team is down by two, they\u2019re pressing. That\u2019s why they had a lot of shots; they opened up the game and certainly put a lot of pressure on us.\n\n\u201cBut I thought we defended well and when they had really good chances, obviously our goalie made some great saves. Varly was our best player tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Avs, who began their three-game road trip with a 3-2 win Saturday at Nashville, improved to 10-9 on the road during a stretch that has them playing outside Denver in 18-of-25 games.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s game against Chicago at the United Center, the Avs hope to dramatically improve their 4-7-1 home record with 9-of-10 games at the Pepsi Center.\n\nThe Blues got within 2-1 on Vladimir Tarasenko\u2019s power-play goal at 12:55 of the third period. Alex Tanguay was in the penalty box for hooking \u2014 Colorado\u2019s first infraction of the game. In the final minute and with Jake Allen on the bench for a sixth attacker, Avs center Carl Soderberg iced the game with an empty-net goal.\n\nSkille and Mitchell scored at 6:09 and 11:50 of the first period, with Mikhail Grigorenko and Tanguay getting the primary assists.\n\nGrigorenko made a slick \u201carea pass\u201d to spring Skille through the St. Louis blue line, and Skille beat Allen with a wrist shot. Tanguay, from behind the net, fed Mitchell, who tapped the puck past Allen while falling to the ice.\n\nMitchell\u2019s goal came right after Varlamov stoned Dmitrij Jaskin from the doorstep at the other end.\n\nThe Avs had a glorious chance to go up 3-0 when the Blues\u2019 Scottie Upshall joined teammate Ryan Reaves in the penalty box, but on the brief 5-on-3 advantage Erik Johnson had a shot clang off the left post.\n\nSt. Louis beat Central Division-leading Dallas 3-0 at home Saturday. The Blues are 6-3 in the division.\n\n\u201cWe had some great legs early in the first period. It felt good to see every line buzzing. They were a little flat, and we took advantage of it,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a battle when you come in here and play these guys. We knew what we were getting ourselves into and certainly prepared in the first period when we played really well.\n\n\u201cWe have to play 60 minutes. Varly, he played a full 60.\u201d\n\nThe Avs next face Patrick Kane and the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks on Tuesday. Kane extended his points streak to 26 games Sunday, the NHL\u2019s longest in more than 20 years.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche\u2019s Semyon Varlamov stellar again in victory over St. Louis", "title": "Avalanche\u2019s Semyon Varlamov stellar again in victory over St. Louis", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/avalanches-semyon-varlamov-stellar-again-in-victory-over-st-louis/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151213__avs-varlamovp1.jpg", "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151213__avs-varlamovp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T18:44:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:28:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After Sunday\u2019s 3-1 victory against the mighty St. Louis Blues at the Scottrade Center \u2014 where goalie Semyon Varlamov was stellar in a 42-save performance \u2014 Colorado is 6-2 against divisional opponents.\nBut after getting first-period goals from Jack Skille and John Mitchell to forge a 2-0 lead for the second consecutive road game, the Blues naturally began to press.\nVarly, he played a full 60.\u201dThe Avs next face Patrick Kane and the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks on Tuesday.\nGrigorenko made a slick \u201carea pass\u201d to spring Skille through the St. Louis blue line, and Skille beat Allen with a wrist shot.\nObviously, Varly was our best player again.\u201dLandeskog used the word \u201cugly\u201d because the Avs were outshot 43-18."}
