If you need to buy health insurance for 2014 through the federal government's web site, Healthcare.gov, you may already know this drill. The site has famously had a variety of technical failures during its rollout.

Whether you started an application already and got stuck along the way, or you want to give it another try, here are some tips to get you enrolled.\n\n1. Reset your application. You can erase old applications. The federal government says you might especially want to do this if you visited the site in October or early November when it was having a huge number of problems. You can also erase an old application if the web site seems to be stuck. Here's how: Once you log in, check if the Healthcare.gov site tells you that you already have an application \"in progress.\" If so, select the application and click the \u201cremove\" button. Then quit your browser. Reopen it and start a new application. If you still have problems, call the Customer Call Center at 800-318-2596. You can also continue an application online if you started it offline with a paper application or phone call. Get details here.\n\n2. Create a new account.
