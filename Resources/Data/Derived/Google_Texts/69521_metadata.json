The other candidates are unequal to do so.\u201d\n\nWhy just him, given that Ohio Gov. John Kasich finished in front of him in New Hampshire and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush finished just a smidgeon behind?\n\nMr. Cruz argued establishment candidates have no chance because Mr. Trump will beat them up on issues like immigration reform. \u201cYou cannot beat Donald Trump from the left,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Cruz said he would use the issue of health-care reform to bludgeon Mr. Trump, who he claimed backed \u201cBernie Sanders socialized medicine.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was exploring a run for president around 2000 on the Reform Party ticket, he made several statements in favor of universal health care. In his 2000 book, \u201cThe America we Deserve,\u201d for instance, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a conservative on most issues but a liberal\u201don health and he backed universal health care.\n\nBut since then, Mr. Trump has rejected those positions and now says he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, as would Sen. Cruz.\n\nPolitifact, the political fact-checking website, looked into a similar charge against Mr. Trump made by then candidate Rick Perry, a former Texas governor. Since 2000, Mr. Trump has occasionally made statements that indicated sympathy for a big government role in health care. Overall, Politifact rated the charge against Mr. Trump as \u201chalf-true.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Cruz repeated the charged about a half-hour later during his rally, the audience roared its approval. Afterwards, Phyllis Maloni, who co-owns an elevator installation business in Myrtle Beach, says she had been convinced to vote for Mr. Cruz by his rousing speech. Part of the reason, she said, is that she believes Mr. Cruz will be able to repeal Obamacare.\n\nMore\n\nFocus in GOP Nominating Contest Will Soon Shift to South Carolina\n\nDonald Trump Bounces Back With Broad Support in New Hampshire\n\nChris Christie Expected to Suspend Campaign", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Ted Cruz has a simple message for South Carolina: His third place finish in New Hampshire made it clear \u201cthe only candidate who can beat Donald Trump is me.
