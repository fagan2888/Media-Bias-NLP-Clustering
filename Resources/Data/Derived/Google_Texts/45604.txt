Using comedy, “The Daily Show” is again furthering the conversation about America’s sexism with a segment on the double standards of sexual health in America. Under Obamacare, insurance companies have to cover women’s healthcare — including contraceptives — which has become a hotly debated issue in Congress.

Meanwhile, “Medicare funds penis pumps at $360 a piece, which has never been debated once,” Samantha Bee learned in an enlightening discussion with NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue.

Bee, mocking the conservatives who argue against women’s health coverage, said that Hogue “just didn’t understand that women’s selfish desire for sexual health and gynecological exams pales in comparison to men’s need to deal with erectile dysfunction.”
