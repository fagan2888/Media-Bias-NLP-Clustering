The Post reports the Clintons first paid Bryan Pagliano $5,000 to set up computer systems before he even joined the State Department, and then kept paying him.



The State Department hasn't clarified whether it knew about or officially sanctioned the private management.



Though in August, a State Department rep said the agency had "found no evidence that he ever informed the department that he had outside income."

The newly released emails show Russia-linked hackers tried at least five times to pry into Clinton's private email account while she was secretary of state. It is unclear if she clicked on any attachment and exposed her account. Clinton received the infected emails, disguised as speeding tickets, over four hours early the morning of Aug. 3, 2011. The emails instructed recipients to print the attached tickets, which would have allowed hackers to take control of their computers. Security researchers who analyzed the malicious software have said that infected computers would transmit information from victims to at least three server computers overseas, including one in Russia.

Pagliano has since told a congressional committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks he'll invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination rather than testify.



Clinton, meanwhile, sat down Friday to discuss the email situation. "I was not thinking a lot when I got in," Clinton said. "There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world. I didn't really stop and think 'what kind of email system will there be?'"



Clinton also acknowledged the server wasn't "the best choice" and said she was, "sorry that this has been confusing to people and has raised a lot of questions."
