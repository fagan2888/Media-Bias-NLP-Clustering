Andrea LaFontaine, R-Columbus, said she noticed faith-based adoption agencies that refused to violate their religious beliefs were closing in other states.\n\nShe wanted to be \u201cproactive\u201d about preventing that from happening in Michigan.\n\nLaFontaine said the legislation makes clear that if an agency rejects prospective adoptive parents on religious grounds, the agency must refer them to another agency that can serve them.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t shut a door in anyone\u2019s face,\u201d she said.\n\nLaFontaine said the legislation is intended to \u201cpreserve the existing legal process.\u201d\n\nShe noted the Michigan state government has a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with faith-based agencies, which is one of the reasons why Michigan has an 80 percent adoption placement rate.\n\nLaFontaine said that of the 62 adoption agencies in Michigan, 17 are faith-based.\n\n\u201cWe want the most options to find children a forever home,\u201d LaFontaine said.\n\nState Rep. Eric Leutheuser, R-Hillsdale, told The Daily Signal state funding for faith-based adoption agencies should not be questioned.\n\n\u201cThese agencies do valuable work for cents on the dollar,\u201d Leutheuser said. \u201cFor the state to duplicate it would be impossible.\u201d\n\nLeutheuser added that agencies receive funding only after a child is placed with a family.\n\nTherefore, there is no financial benefit to a faith-based agency that refers parents to a secular agency.\n\nBoth Leutheuser and LaFontaine stressed that the legislation \u201ccodifies\u201d the current adoption process in Michigan.\n\nCritics of the legislation say that the bills would allow agencies to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that gay and lesbian parents are more likely to adopt special needs children. And in states that are gay-friendly, the number of adoptions is higher than in states that are gay-unfriendly, which is what Michigan is,\u201d state Rep. Marcia Hovey-Wright, D-Muskegon, told MLive.com.\n\nRyan Anderson, the William E. Simon fellow in religion and a free society at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal that any good adoption policy puts \u201cthe best interests of children first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed legislation would protect a diversity of private providers and their ability to operate according to their values\u2014and with families that share those values,\u201d Anderson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good public policy,\u201d he added. \u201cIt makes it more likely that the greatest possible number of children will be connected with permanent, loving families. Provided agencies meet basic requirements protecting the welfare of children, they should be free to operate according to their values, especially their religiously informed beliefs about marriage.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Michigan\u2019s Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, told MLive that she supports the legislation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe want the most options to find children a forever home,\u201d Rep.
