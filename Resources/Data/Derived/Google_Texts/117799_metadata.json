The overall leader was aggregator IndividualHealthQuotes.com, which spent more than $4.4 million.\n\nDo a Google search for Anthem health insurance, and the health quote aggregation site comes up in paid search above Anthem's own website.\n\nTwo health insurance exchange websites--HealthCare.gov ($1.6 million) and Delaware's ChooseHealthDE.com ($748,000)--also made the top 20 list of health insurance advertisers, AdGooroo found.\n\nThe top 20 keywords, which were particularly competitive and averaged 171 advertisers per keyword, included terms like healthcare insurance, Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield as well as healthcare reform-related terms like Obamacare, Affordable Care Act and HealthCare.gov.\n\nLast year, insurers, state exchanges and the federal government spent $194 million on local television advertising between Oct.1 and Nov. 10. And WellPoint (NYSE:WLP) spent as much as $100 million last year on multi-media ads focusing on young adults, FierceHealthPayer noted previously.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCigna rebrands to emphasize community, expand reach in international markets\n\n3 ways CMOs can help insurers be more consumer-centric\n\nAnti-reform ad fail: Negative campaigns increased ACA enrollment\n\nUse social media to actively influence consumers\n\nRising costs, unknowns await payers in 2015\n\nPayers launch ad blitz to win new customers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Humana\u00a0led all health insurers on online health insurance advertising spending, shelling out $4.2 million for paid search ads in the first six months of 2014.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Humana\u00a0led all health insurers on online health insurance advertising spending, shelling out $4.2 million for paid search ads in the first six months of 2014.", "title": "Humana, Anthem, UnitedHealth lead the pack in online keyword ad spend", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/humana-anthem-unitedhealth-lead-pack-online-keyword-ad-spend/2014-09-16", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "advertising,Google AdWords,Humana,marketing,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,UnitedHealth", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Marketing & Consumer Engagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f89\"", "article_summary": "Two health insurance exchange websites--HealthCare.gov ($1.6 million) and Delaware's ChooseHealthDE.com ($748,000)--also made the top 20 list of health insurance advertisers, AdGooroo found.\nHumana (NYSE:HUM) led all health insurers on online health insurance advertising spending, shelling out $4.2 million for paid search ads in the first six months of 2014.\nDo a Google search for Anthem health insurance, and the health quote aggregation site comes up in paid search above Anthem's own website.\nHowever, when you add UnitedHealth's online ad spend with that of its distribution partner AARP, the total comes to $6.9 million.\nAmong insurers who spent big this year, Anthem took second place, spending $1.5 million, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) spent $1.3 million, Aetna (NYSE:AET) spent $1.2 million and Cigna (NYSE:CI) came in fifth with $1.1 million."}
