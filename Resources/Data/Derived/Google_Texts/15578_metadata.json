The art ranges from comics approaching realism, such as Heavy Metal magazine artist John Findley\u2019s beautiful, glowing work \u201cTwo Wolves,\u201d to the highly stylized contemporary comic look of Maliseet artist Tara Audbert\u2019s \u201cA Prehistoric Race,\u201d not to mention the flat-out cartoony style of Indian Country Today Media Network\u2019s own Marty Two Bulls, Sr. in the illustrations of the humorous poem \u201cI\u2019m Wildcat Bill From Grizzle Hill.\u201d It shows the wide variety of voices, styles and techniques that come from the many individual artists and writers who help make up Native America.\n\nEureka Production\u2019s Graphic Classics series is a modern take on the old Classics Illustrated comics that were popular in the mid 20th century. But rather than creating a graphic version of a single novel that fits into a comic book, Eureka puts out multiple works by an author (such as short stories by Edgar Allan Poe or O. Henry) in a single paperback. The texts in Native American Classics are primarily stories, poems and folklore taken from 19th- and early 20th\u2013century texts, reformatted by contemporary teams of writers and artists.\n\nThe work\u2019s centerpiece is the story \u201cOn Wolf Mountain,\u201d by Santee Sioux author Charles Eastman (Oh\u00edye S\u2019a) from his book Red Hunters and The Animal People (Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1904). The story is adapted by Joseph Bruchac, and the art is the last work completed by the late Robby McMurtry, who was shot and killed last year in a tragic incident at his home. The book is dedicated to McMurtry, who was known for his romantic style.\n\nRELATED: Native Artist Robby McMurtry Fatally Shot by Deputy\n\nThere are traditional Indian stories in the book, like the one about how the turtle wins races with other animals, by Wyandot poet Bertrand N.O. Walker (Hen-Toh), and \u201cThe Story of Itsikamahidish and The Wild Potato\u201d as told to anthropologist Gilbert Wilson by the Hidatsa storyteller Buffalo Bird Woman (Maxidiwiac). However, a number of the pieces are reactions to contact with European culture. By the end of the volume it is obvious that reaction has left such a scar on the Native imagination that it becomes more of a focal point than the traditional stories. Unfortunately that\u2019s not a criticism of the book, but more of a statement of fact for a culture that the U.S. government tried to eradicate.\n\nChristianity is also dealt with in an allegorical story by Sioux writer Zitkala-\u0160a (Gertrude Simmons Bonnin). \u201cThe Soft-Hearted Sioux\u201d mirrors the balance of the author\u2019s own life between white and Native culture, and in \u201cHow The White Race Came to America,\u201d by the Seneca religious leader Handsome Lake (Sganyad\u00e1i:yo\u02c0,) who shows Hanisse\u2019ono, the Evil One, sending cards, liquor and money with Columbus on his infamous voyage.\n\nNative American Classics is a very rewarding book that features too many fine Native writers and artists to name here. Suffice to say it is an excellent anthology that shows the state of the art in Native American art and narrative.\n\nRELATED: Picture Perfect: The Graphic Novel as Vehicle for Nonfiction", "article_metadata": {"description": "This graphic novel, edited by\u00a0Tom Pomplun,\u00a0is an anthology that combines traditional stories, myths, historGraphic novel Native Classics is partly an homage to slain Native artist Robby McMurtry.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/graphic-novel-potpourri-traditional-stories-myths-histories-jokes-and-poetry-152498", "type": "article", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Graphic Novel Is a Potpourri of Traditional Stories, Myths, Histories, Jokes and Poetry"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-01T10:30-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Graphic Novel Is a Potpourri of Traditional Stories, Myths, Histories, Jokes and Poetry"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/graphic-novel-potpourri-traditional-stories-myths-histories-jokes-and-poetry-152498", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Books, Bookshelf, Native Writers, Native Authors, Graphic Novel, Robby McMurtry", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Graphic Novel Is a Potpourri of Traditional Stories, Myths, Histories, Jokes and Poetry"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ac1\"", "article_summary": "By: Wilhelm MurgThis graphic novel, edited by Tom Pomplun, is an anthology that combines traditional stories, myths, histories, jokes and poetry, illustrated by some of the finest graphic artists in Indian Country.\nEureka Production\u2019s Graphic Classics series is a modern take on the old Classics Illustrated comics that were popular in the mid 20th century.\nRELATED: Picture Perfect: The Graphic Novel as Vehicle for Nonfiction\nNative American Classics is a very rewarding book that features too many fine Native writers and artists to name here.\nSuffice to say it is an excellent anthology that shows the state of the art in Native American art and narrative."}
