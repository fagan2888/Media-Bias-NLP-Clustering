They denounced the move as \"retrograde\" and \"environmental vandalism.\"\n\nThey can fume all they want, but Australia's action, combined with Europe's floundering cap-and-trade program, signals that \"mitigation\" strategies\u2014curbing greenhouse gases by putting economies on an energy diet\u2014are not winning or workable.\n\nAustralia leapfrogged from being an environmental laggard (initially refusing to even sign the Kyoto Protocol) to a leader when its Green Party-backed Labor prime minister imposed a tax two years ago. It required Australia's utilities and industries to pay $23 per ton of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBut the tax was an instant debacle.\n\nAustralia has the highest per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the world and the main reason is that it's even more coal-dependent than America. Coal supplies 75 percent of its energy needs (compared to 42 percent in America). But contrary to green expectations, the tax didn't prompt companies to rush toward renewable sources, because they are far costlier.\n\nRather, utilities passed their costs to households\u2014whose energy bills soared by 20 percent in the first year. Other industries that face hyper-competitive environment such as airlines suffered massive losses. (Virgin Australia alone reported $27 million in losses in just six months.) The tax also made Australian exports globally uncompetitive, deepening the country's recession economic slump.*\n\nThis spawned a backlash that brought down the Labor government and catapulted into office the Liberal Party's Tony Abbott, who made a \"blood promise\" to ditch the tax, which he did promptly once elected, despite warnings that Aussie lowlands are more vulnerable to rising sea levels and other dire consequences of global warming than other countries.\n\nEurope's cap-and-trade program has managed to hang on, but only by neutering itself. The program hands companies an annual emission allowance. If they exceed it, they have to buy more on the open market or invest in clean technologies.\n\nBut the program handed out far too many allowances for free initially, causing their price to repeatedly crash. Worse, the European Parliament last year refused to scale back the allowances as planned for fear of prolonging the recession.\n\nThe upshot is that despite spending $287 billion, Europe has little to show for it. (Australia's tax at least reduced its carbon emissions 1.5 percent in the first year). According to a study by UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank the program has had \"almost zero impact\" on emissions\u2014challenging the much more rosy assessments of the European Commission.\n\nEnvironmentalists blame Europe's failure on \"design flaws\" like basing its initial allowance cap on companies' own projections of what they need and then handing them these allowances for free.\n\nHence, California, which implemented its own version of cap and trade in 2010, set its cap based on independent projections and auctioned a portion of the allowances.\n\nIt's too early to tell if the Golden State's program is cutting emissions. But its economic pain is beginning to kick in, especially for the poor. If applied as written, it will cause California's gas prices, already 50 cents above the national average, to rise another 40 cents.\n\nThis prompted 16 state senate Democrats\u2014Democrats!\u2014earlier this month to ask emissions czar Mary Nichols to neuter\u2014I mean, \"redesign\"\u2014the program.\n\nBut the \"redesign\" can't change the fundamental conundrum of mitigation strategies whether carbon taxes or cap-and-trade: In order to work, they have to administer bitter economic medicine. But when the do, the public revolts.\n\nThat's why even gung-ho global warming warriors are beginning to have second thoughts about emission cuts. Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011. Japan retreated from its pledges last year. And South Korea's finance minister is hinting that his country will delay its cap-and-trade program. (This ensures that next year's Paris summit to discuss even more ambitious reductions will be a complete waste of time and emissions.)\n\nBut even if the whole world kept its Kyoto pledges, the global temperature would come down by a grand total of 0.11 to 0.20\u00b0F by 2100. Clearly, this is too much pain for too little gain.\n\nSo what should enviros do?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Putting economies on an energy diet is not the way to fight climate change.", "title": "Lessons from the Death of the Aussie Carbon Tax", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/29/lessons-from-the-death-of-the-aussie-car", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_07/global-warming-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_07/global-warming-1.jpg", "title": "Lessons from the Death of the Aussie Carbon Tax", "description": "Environmentalists had a global meltdown\nlast week after Australia scrapped its carbon tax.
