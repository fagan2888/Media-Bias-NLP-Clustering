The average net worth in Congress is a bit more than $6 million, while the median net worth is $1 million. To put that in context, $4 million in net worth is enough to put someone in the top 1 percent, and $660,000 is enough to put an individual in the top 10 percent. Meanwhile, the median family wealth for whites is $134,000 and for blacks is $11,000. Emerging political science research suggests that the implications of this class bias are profound and important.\n\nPolitical scientists have long debated the importance of \u201cdescriptive representation\u201d or \u201creflective democracy.\u201d Reflective democracy means that representatives share salient characteristics with their constituents. Most political scientists now agree that reflective representation leads to better substantive representation: that the interests of constituents are being reflected by legislator choice.\n\nIt\u2019s increasingly clear that descriptive representation matters, particularly as related to race and gender. Political Scientists Robert R. Preuhs and Eric Gonzalez Juenke find that black and Hispanic legislators are more responsive to the interests of black and Hispanic constituents than white legislators, after controlling for party. Legislators of color also serve an important veto function \u2014 preventing laws from passing that would disproportionately harm communities of color. Daniel Butler and David Broockman find that politicians are more responsive to letters from constituents of the same race. This is confirmed by a study that finds legislators that support voter ID laws are less likely to respond to inquiries from Latino constituents. Further, black legislators are also more likely to hire black staffers. In addition, Economist Ebonya Washington finds that having a daughter makes a congressperson more liberal, particularly on reproductive rights. Some studies suggest that female representatives are more likely to set an agenda around women\u2019s issues.\n\nGiven this, should we worry that more than half of all members of the House of Representatives are millionaires? Further, while two-thirds of the population don\u2019t have a college degree, only two House members (Robert Brady of Pennsylvania and Stephen Fincher of Tennessee) and one senator (outgoing Mark Begich of Alaska) lack one.\n\nNicholas Carnes of Duke University has recently taken up the question of how class affects votes. In a 2012 paper, he finds that \u201crepresentative from working-class occupations exhibit more liberal economic preferences than other legislators, especially those from profit-oriented professions.\u201d Other research has confirmed this. Christopher Witko and Sally Friedman find that \u201cHouse members with business backgrounds have closer relationships with business interests\u2026 and demonstrate more probusiness roll call voting.\u201d\n\nWhile descriptive representation of women and people of color has increased dramatically, the descriptive representation of working-class people has remained stubbornly flat (see chart).\n\nAs Carnes writes,\n\nIf millionaires were a political party, that party would make up roughly 3 percent of American families, but it would have a super-majority in the Senate, a majority in the House, a majority on the Supreme Court and a man in the White House. If working-class Americans were a political party, that party would have made up more than half the country since the start of the 20th century. But legislators from that party (those who last worked in blue-collar jobs before entering politics) would never have held more than 2 percent of the seats in Congress.\n\nThose data end in 1998, but Carnes maintains his own database using similar metrics that picks up again in the mid-2000s. He finds that the line has remained flat, or if anything declined. At the state and local level, the picture isn\u2019t much better. According to the National Council of State Legislators, the share of legislators who worked in business in a non-managerial position (i.e., workers) has declined from 4.4 percent in 1976 to 2.8 percent in 2007.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Congress gets richer and richer, research proves that it's leaving the rest of us behind", "title": "The death of working-class politics: How the wealthy conquered Congress and abandoned blue-collar America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As Congress gets richer and richer, research proves that it's leaving the rest of us behind", "title": "The death of working-class politics: How the wealthy conquered Congress and abandoned blue-collar America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/22/the_death_of_working_class_politics_how_the_wealthy_conquered_congress_and_abandoned_blue_collar_america/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/boehner_norma_rae.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Congress gets richer and richer, research proves that it's leaving the rest of us behind", "title": "The death of working-class politics: How the wealthy conquered Congress and abandoned blue-collar America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/boehner_norma_rae.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Congress, Editor's Picks, elections, Income inequality, The 1 Percent, The working class, Wealth inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If working-class Americans were a political party, that party would have made up more than half the country since the start of the 20th century.\nIt\u2019s increasingly clear that descriptive representation matters, particularly as related to race and gender.\nFurther, black legislators are also more likely to hire black staffers.\nTopics: Congress, Editor's Picks, elections, Income inequality, The 1 Percent, The working class, Wealth inequality, News, Politics NewsCongress is rich.\nThis is confirmed by a study that finds legislators that support voter ID laws are less likely to respond to inquiries from Latino constituents."}
