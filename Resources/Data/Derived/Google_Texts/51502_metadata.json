North Dakota\u2019s outlook leads all states at 3.6 percent job growth.\n\nEconomists said the higher growth rate is a return to the norm for Arizona, which routinely ranked among the top states before being hammered in the recession.\n\n\u201cIf you were to look at states over the last 30 or 40 years, you would typically find Arizona among the top \u2013 certainly among the top 10, and typically among the top three, four, five,\u201d said Lee McPheters, a research professor at Arizona State University\u2019s W.P. Carey School of Business.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not unusual for Arizona to be one of the leading growth states,\u201d said McPheters, who said the state has averaged 4 percent job growth over the last 30 to 40 years.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics generates job growth forecasts each month, using a model that accounts for numerous economic factors including state population growth, business-sector growth trends and proprietary information.\n\nDaniel Culbertson, an economist with Moody\u2019s Analytics, said Arizona\u2019s strong job growth in the latest report is \u201cnothing out of the ordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cArizona is still going to outpace the U.S., as it has the last two years,\u201d he said, adding that it has a lot to gain from the economic recovery because of its diversified economy.\n\nArizona\u2019s strengths lie in the finance, health-care and retail sectors, McPheters said.\n\nThese observations were echoed by Sapna Gupta, senior policy analyst at ASU\u2019s Morrison Institute for Public Policy. She said more hiring in the construction industry \u2013 both residential and commercial \u2013 and in health-care fields will continue to provide Arizona with an edge in job growth.\n\n\u201c(Arizona\u2019s) expected job growth in 2014 will certainly get a boost thanks to high-tech companies like Apple opening a plant in Mesa,\u201d Gupta said in an email. \u201cBut the high-tech sector does not account for the entire projected job growth. Other sectors of the economy have also been picking up steam, which has led to more hiring.\u201d\n\nMcPheters said the recession had hit Arizona harder than the U.S. as a whole, noting that \u201cthe U.S. lost about 6 percent of all jobs while Arizona lost about 12 percent.\u201d Now that the state is in \u201crecovery mode\u201d the job growth figures should be returning to normal, he said.\n\nCulbertson said Arizona is likely to see its job growth forecast drop slightly in the next Moody\u2019s report, due in March, because of less-than-anticipated population growth. But Arizona will still be among the top states in 2014, he said.\n\nMcPheters agreed that Arizona will likely be near the top, but wondered if it would end up as No. 2 for the year given gains in some other states.\n\n\u201cThe big question is: Would that be enough to put Arizona in the 2 position?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just not 100 percent sure that Arizona would beat\u201d states such as Florida and Texas.\n\nThe U.S. Regional Outlook 2014 by Moody\u2019s Analytics predicts Arizona will see a 3.1 percent increase in jobs this year, compared to a national average of just under 1.9 percent.
