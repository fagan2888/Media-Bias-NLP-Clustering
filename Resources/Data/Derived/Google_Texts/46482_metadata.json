However, a majority\u201353%\u2013of registered Latino voters in California also answered that they believe that, \u201c\u2026we should require borders to be secured before providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, when asked, \u201cWhich of the following is your major concern or complaint about the Republican Party?\u201d, only ten percent of those surveyed named Republican opposition to immigration reform.\n\nThe number one gripe was that Republicans \u201ccare mostly about corporations and big business\u201d (17%). Other concerns, in order, were that Republicans: care only for themselves (17%), favor the rich (14%), are against immigration reform (10%), don\u2019t stand up strongly for their beliefs (7%), \u201cdon\u2019t understand people like me\u201d (6%), and favoring white people not minorities (5%).\n\nThe survey also asked Latino voters in California their opinions about the Affordable Care Act, and while the survey found that 65 percent supported the ACA, more than 40% cited increased health care costs, high deductibles, and reduced work hours as concerns.\n\n\u201cLatinos are focused on pocketbook issues. They want to know how a proposition or legislation is going to affect them financially, \u201d said Hector Barajas, a partner at the Revolvis political consulting firm, and a leading expert on Latino issues.\n\nBarajas advises those seeking to make Obamacare an issue not to attack the program itself, but instead to focus on the costs.\n\nTo illustrate how to communicate with Latino voters, Barajas singled out legislation authored by State Senator Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima) that would ban plastic grocery bags and mandate that store owners charge a 10-cent fee on every paper bag.\n\n\u201cWhile a 10-cent-per-bag mandate may not seem like much to some, when you\u2019re barely making ends meet on minimum wage, it all adds up quickly,\u201d Barajas. told Breitbart News.\n\nSome other interesting tidbits from the survey data include the fact that fully 28% of California\u2019s Latino voters are millennials (ages 18-34); that 61% of respondents most closely identified with the Democrat Party and only 15% identified themselves as being Republican; and that 6% of Latino households are Spanish-speaking only, 30% are English-only, and 64% are bilingual.\n\nThe survey, commissioned by Univision, was conducted by Moore Information. 400 interviews were completed statewide, with an additional 100 interviews later conducted in the Central Valley specifically. The margin of error in the poll is +/- 4%.\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Services, Univision is one of the largest audiences of Spanish-language television viewers in the world, with local stations in over 50 markets with large Hispanic and Latino populations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Univision Survey: Immigration Low Priority for Latino Voters in California", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Univision Survey: Immigration Low Priority for Latino Voters in California", "title": "Univision Survey: Immigration Low Priority for Latino Voters in California - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/gop-immigration-citizenship-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/08/08/univision-poll-immigration-low-priority-for-latino-voters-in-california/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Univision Survey: Immigration Low Priority for Latino Voters in California", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/gop-immigration-citizenship-ap.jpg", "title": "Univision Survey: Immigration Low Priority for Latino Voters in California - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Crime,Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "Crime", "published_time": "2014-08-08T05:40:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd05e\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERImmigration is only the 6th-most-important issue for Latino voters in California when casting a vote for a candidate for U.S.\nSenator or for U.S. Congress, according to a statewide survey conducted by Univision.\nTo illustrate how to communicate with Latino voters, Barajas singled out legislation authored by State Senator Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima) that would ban plastic grocery bags and mandate that store owners charge a 10-cent fee on every paper bag.\nThe survey also asked Latino voters in California their opinions about the Affordable Care Act, and while the survey found that 65 percent supported the ACA, more than 40% cited increased health care costs, high deductibles, and reduced work hours as concerns.\nThe survey, commissioned by Univision, was conducted by Moore Information."}
