Kathy Castor's District 14 is now overwhelmingly Democratic \u2014 it was drawn to take in as many Democrats as possible to keep the surrounding districts Republican. It almost certainly will become less Democratic after the redrawing.\n\nFlorida Veterans Affairs director Mike Prendergast, a Republican who in 2010 mounted the strongest challenge to Castor since she's held the office, confirmed this week that he could be interested in taking another shot.\n\n\"If everything lined up, I would have to entertain it,\" said Prendergast, who was Rick Scott's first chief of staff.\n\nSeveral other prominent Republicans \u2014 state Reps. Shawn Harrison and Dana Young, county Commissioner Sandy Murman and former Commissioner Mark Sharpe \u2014 all expressed pessimism or comparative lack of interest.\n\nThe district isn't likely to end up encouraging for a Republican, but may be less discouraging.\n\nIt now has about 205,000 Democrats, 102,000 Republicans, and 114,000 minor party or no-party voters. About 38,000 of its Democrats and 9,000 Republicans are in south St. Petersburg, and the court said it must lose those voters \u2014 the district can't cross the bay.\n\nMany of those 38,000 Democrats are likely to be replaced by Republicans; for example, the district could shift east toward Plant City, or south, possibly taking in Sun City Center. It would still have a strong Democratic majority, but could look less daunting for a Republican.\n\nIn 2010, Prendergast noted, he got 40 percent against Castor even after starting his campaign late \u2014 he retired as an Army colonel Oct. 1, 2009 \u2014 and being outspent by Castor $680,000 to $501,000.\n\nThose results, however, also came while Castor was a major target for Republicans bitter about her support of the Affordable Care Act. That controversy has cooled somewhat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From the latest William March column:", "application-name": "Tampa Bay Times", "og": {"image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.tampabay.com/iwov-resources/images/og-default.png", "height": 600}, "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "description": "From the latest William March column:", "title": "Former Rick Scott chief of staff eyeing run for Congress"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TB_Times", "image": "http://www.tampabay.com/iwov-resources/images/og-default.png", "description": "From the latest William March column:", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Former Rick Scott chief of staff eyeing run for Congress"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#115220", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=988277045", "msapplication-TileImage": "/iwov-resources/images/ie10TBTpin.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\"If everything lined up, I would have to entertain it,\" said Prendergast, who was Rick Scott's first chief of staff.\nThose results, however, also came while Castor was a major target for Republicans bitter about her support of the Affordable Care Act.\nIt now has about 205,000 Democrats, 102,000 Republicans, and 114,000 minor party or no-party voters.\nRep.
