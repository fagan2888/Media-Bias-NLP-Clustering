He endorsed birtherism, said the nation's credit rating would actually be better if the United States defaulted on its debt, and called Obamacare racist toward white people. Yoho also opposed giving furloughed workers back pay during last fall's government shutdown, doubted the constitutionality of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and said allowing in-state tuition for undocumented students would reward \"bad behavior.\"\n\nBut Yoho's lament about voting isn't original. Tea Party Nation President Judson Phillips said in 2010 that returning to 19th century voting laws \"makes a lot of sense.\"\n\n\"If you\u2019re not a property owner, you know, I\u2019m sorry but property owners have a little bit more of a vested interest in the community than non-property owners,\" Phillips said.\n\nWatch the video of Yoho above.\n\n(h/t TPM)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Curious Campaign Ads Curious Campaign Ads\n\n1 of 23 Motorcycle To Change Candidate: Jon Huntsman Race: 2012 Republican Presidential Primary Share this slide:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Yoho strikes again.\n\nSpeaking at the Berean Baptist Church in Ocala, Fla., during his 2012 campaign, the first term Republican congressman appeared...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-05-21 15:59:27 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Ted Yoho strikes again.\n\nSpeaking at the Berean Baptist Church in Ocala, Fla., during his 2012 campaign, the first term Republican congressman appeared...", "title": "GOP Congressman Suggested Limiting Voting To Property Owners", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/20/ted-yoho-voting_n_5360208.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1807213/images/o-TED-YOHO-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Yoho strikes again.\n\nSpeaking at the Berean Baptist Church in Ocala, Fla., during his 2012 campaign, the first term Republican congressman appeared...", "creator": "igorbobic", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1807213/images/o-TED-YOHO-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "GOP Congressman Suggested Limiting Voting To Property Owners", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-20 15:59:27 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5360208", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "tea party movement,Politics News,video,judson phillips tea party,ted yoho,ted yoho florida,Ted Yoho voting,florida,judson phillips,tea party,Ted Yoho voting laws", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "tea party movement,Politics News,video,judson phillips tea party,ted yoho,ted yoho florida,Ted Yoho voting,florida,judson phillips,tea party,Ted Yoho voting laws", "published_time": "2014-05-20 15:59:27 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-05-20 16:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7fc\"", "article_summary": "\"If you\u2019re not a property owner, you know, I\u2019m sorry but property owners have a little bit more of a vested interest in the community than non-property owners,\" Phillips said.\nThe tea party congressman has made quite a name for himself in the last two years.\nTea Party Nation President Judson Phillips said in 2010 that returning to 19th century voting laws \"makes a lot of sense.\"\nSpeaking at the Berean Baptist Church in Ocala, Fla., during his 2012 campaign, the first term Republican congressman appeared to speak fondly of limiting voting to property owners -- laws not seen since the days of the Founding Fathers.\n\"I\u2019ve had some radical ideas about voting and it\u2019s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,\" Yoho said in unearthed footage uploaded on Tuesday by Right Wing Watch."}
