The estimated 9.1 million dual-eligibles accounted for about 35% of total spending by Medicare and Medicaid in 2011, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.The GAO specifically suggests that the CMS develop and require organizations participating in the demonstrations to report comparable core data measures.
