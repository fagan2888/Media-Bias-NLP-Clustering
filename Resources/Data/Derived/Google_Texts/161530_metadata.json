Lakers coach Mike D\u2019Antoni fumed, then shot back through the media that Gasol should keep those comments in-house.\n\nD\u2019Antoni wasn\u2019t fully familiar with the Laker Way, where speaking your mind isn\u2019t out of bounds. Gasol has lived it the past seven seasons.\n\nNuggets coach Brian Shaw grew up in that environment. He played for and coached with Phil Jackson, whose public flogging of his players through the media became the stuff of legend and at times rubbed his stars the wrong way. Of all of the traits that were examined upon Shaw\u2019s arrival as the head coach of the Nuggets last summer, brutal honesty wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nIt is now.\n\nIn the past two weeks, in the aftermath of the Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl loss and the Avalanche being sidelined during the Olympics, the Nuggets were in the white-hot media spotlight. Though he had been candid after every loss before that, a new audience was just focusing in. And after the Nuggets\u2019 lopsided loss at Chicago on Feb. 21, those new eyes got to see Shaw was in rare form.\n\n\u201cI told our team I wish paychecks were predicated on night-to-night performance,\u201d he said that night. \u201cSo, if you play like a star on a given night, then you get paid like a star. If you play like an uninspired player, then either you don\u2019t get paid or you get paid like an uninspired player. And you can\u2019t just pick and choose when you want.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent radio interviews, Shaw raised more eyebrows, detailing instances when he had players go back on the plane to clean it.\n\n\u201cMy mother used to always tell me that my mouth was going to get me in trouble,\u201d Shaw told The Denver Post. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been one \u2026 I say it like it is. Whether it\u2019s to them, or (media) or whatever.\u201d\n\nAnd, he\u2019s not about to change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not on my agenda to say I\u2019m going to send a message through this avenue to get the point across,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI cut out the middleman. I\u2019m going to tell them, and then if you guys ask me, \u2018What was the vibe?\u2019 I\u2019m going to come out and tell you guys. And if you guys go back and say, \u2018Coach said this,\u2019 they are going to say, \u2018Yeah, he told us that too.\u2019 \u201c\n\nShaw\u2019s policy of not telling the media anything he hasn\u2019t told a player, or the team, is the main reason his players seem to accept it.\n\n\u201cHe says the same thing to us,\u201d Nuggets guard Ty Lawson said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d\n\nForward Wilson Chandler has had many of Shaw\u2019s harshest criticisms expressed through the media brought back to him by friends who wants to know if it rubs him the wrong way.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t get mad when he speaks the truth.\u201d\n\nShaw has not been told to tone it down by Nuggets management. And none of the players has expressed concern or frustration over it.\n\n\u201cNo one has come back and said, \u2018Coach, I really don\u2019t appreciate you saying this,\u2019 \u201d Shaw said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018This particular guy left trash on the plane, and I made him go back on and get it.\u2019 I said as a team we do that, and I hold the whole team accountable when one guy does it.\u201d\n\nThe one rule Shaw lives by is not singling out any player. That\u2019s not a rule Jackson always adhered to.\n\n\u201cMy last four years with Phil Jackson, he called players out by name,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cAnd our team was that way. If you recall, Kobe (Bryant) used to call Shaq (O\u2019Neal) fat and out of shape. Phil would say as big as Shaq is, he should get more rebounds. I just believe in brutal honesty. And I don\u2019t think that I have particularly called out anybody by name. When I\u2019m saying it, I\u2019m saying it as a group \u2014 us as a team. And it starts with the little things, building the right habits.\u201d\n\nAsked if he will consider a softer approach, Shaw said: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I can. If I make a strategic mistake during a game, I\u2019m open to the criticism that comes from the mistake that I made, because I made it; nobody else did. And our guys have to be, to a certain extent, be willing to be open to the criticism that they receive. Not from having a bad game, because everybody has bad games. But we\u2019re talking, again, about effort. And just competing.\n\n\u201cWhich, just like worrying about cleaning up a locker, we shouldn\u2019t have to worry about. We shouldn\u2019t have to worry about competing. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets coach Brian Shaw will be honest even when it hurts", "title": "Nuggets coach Brian Shaw will be honest even when it hurts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/01/nuggets-coach-brian-shaw-will-be-honest-even-when-it-hurts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140301_093058_brian-shaw-nuggets-030114-3.jpg", "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140301_093058_brian-shaw-nuggets-030114-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-01T19:23:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:55:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m going to tell them, and then if you guys ask me, \u2018What was the vibe?\u2019 I\u2019m going to come out and tell you guys.\n\u201cMy mother used to always tell me that my mouth was going to get me in trouble,\u201d Shaw told The Denver Post.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not on my agenda to say I\u2019m going to send a message through this avenue to get the point across,\u201d Shaw said.\nNuggets coach Brian Shaw grew up in that environment.\nAnd after the Nuggets\u2019 lopsided loss at Chicago on Feb. 21, those new eyes got to see Shaw was in rare form."}
