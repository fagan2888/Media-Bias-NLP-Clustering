After a query from Barnicle questioning why a replacement is even necessary, Tillis said its \u201cfiscally unsustainable,\u201d adding that the law could \u201cthreaten what you can do for the very people\u201d it is intended to help.\n\nMike Barnicle: Senator, in your first few weeks, months in the Senate beginning in the next session in January, what will you consider a larger priority \u2014 finding a place for the underemployed and the unemployed to get work or repealing Obamacare?\n\nThom Tillis: Well, I think you have to have several tracks going. There\u2019s been inaction over the past several years that you\u2019re going to have to have several things moving at the same time. There has to be a solution to replace Obamacare, solve the problem\u2026\n\nBarnicle: Why?\n\nTillis: Because it\u2019s fiscally unsustainable. We need to remember that we\u2019re talking about something is going to add to the debt, nearly a trillion dollars. It\u2019s going to threaten future reimbursements for doctors and hospitals to the tune of $700 billion out of Medicare. And you\u2019ve also got enrollment numbers and a number of other things that raise questions about whether or not it\u2019s fiscally sustainable. And that could potentially threaten what you can do for the very people that we\u2019re trying to provide a solution to.\n\nAt the same time, there are dozens of bills that I understand that have come from the House that are job-creating bills, regulatory reform, tax reform. Things that can get business back on track. The more we\u2019re able to create economic activity, the easier the problems become to fix the economy and start retiring the debt.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Al Weaver", "description": "'It's fiscally unsustainable'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Responding to whether repealing Obamacare or finding a place for the underemployed and unemployed, North Carolina Republican Senator-elect Thom Tillis told panelist Mike Barnicle that while both need", "title": "Thom Tillis: Obamacare Hurts Exact Same People It\u2019s Supposed To Help", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/12/thom-tillis-obamacare-hurts-exact-same-people-its-supposed-to-help/", "image": {"width": 476, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-2.13.06-PM-e1415819839359.jpg", "height": 202}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It's fiscally unsustainable'", "title": "Thom Tillis: Obamacare Hurts Exact Same People It\u2019s Supposed To Help Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/12/thom-tillis-obamacare-hurts-exact-same-people-its-supposed-to-help/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-2.13.06-PM-e1415819839359.jpg"}, "creator": "@@alweaver22", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-12 14:24:36", "sailthru.title": "Thom Tillis: Obamacare Hurts Exact Same People It's Supposed To Help", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,thom-tillis,al-weaver", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare,thom tillis", "sailthru.description": "Responding to whether repealing Obamacare or finding a place for the underemployed and unemployed, North Carolina Republican Senator-elect Thom Tillis told panelist Mike Barnicle that while both need", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-2.13.06-PM-e1415819839359.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Tillis: Because it\u2019s fiscally unsustainable.\nThom Tillis: Well, I think you have to have several tracks going.\nIt\u2019s going to threaten future reimbursements for doctors and hospitals to the tune of $700 billion out of Medicare.\nAfter a query from Barnicle questioning why a replacement is even necessary, Tillis said its \u201cfiscally unsustainable,\u201d adding that the law could \u201cthreaten what you can do for the very people\u201d it is intended to help.\nThere has to be a solution to replace Obamacare, solve the problem\u2026Barnicle: Why?"}
