Since each plan shows how it is linked to Common Core, Selle said she knows the lesson is addressing that, so she can focus more on how it meets new science standards.\n\nJim Hurley, Lesson Planet founder and chief executive officer, said he started the company as a way to help teachers find quality educational resources out of the flood of things posted online.\n\nFor example, a teacher on Lesson Planet can go to the Common Core standards for math, select fourth grade, select the standards on fractions, click the first standard and be directed to nearly 40 reviewed resources, including printable work sheets, PowerPoint presentations, lesson plans and videos. Links then take teachers to those resources.\n\nHelping teachers\n\nTeachers are often thinking about their classes day and night and never feeling really done, said Judith Smith-Meyer, Lesson Planet\u2019s education communications specialist. Creating lessons from scratch or digging through Google searches can take hours, while Lesson Planet can bring up a good idea that\u2019s soundly integrated into a lesson plan in much less time, she said.\n\n\u201cWhat we can do helps teachers live their lives in a more humane way, a more balanced way,\u201d she said.\n\nFarrell Thomas, a fifth-grade science teacher in Greenville, South Carolina, started using Lesson Planet this year for more inquiry-based science lessons.\n\nThomas said he spends about three hours every Sunday planning for the week ahead and using Lesson Planet helps him better balance the time he has for planning and time for family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really, really insightful and really, really helpful for me,\u201d he said. As team leader for his grade level, he said he has recommended the site to other teachers, particularly those early in their teaching careers.\n\nTeachers pay about $40 to $100 a year for a subscription or are provided group memberships through their schools or districts.\n\nAround 2004, Lesson Planet shifted from a free site with advertising to a subscription-based site, allowing Lesson Planet to grow the site, add more reviews and avoid any pressure from advertisers or other funding sources on the site\u2019s content.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really excited to kind of continually grow the kinds of resource types as well as different services for the teachers,\u201d Hurley said.\n\nThat included addressing Common Core standards early on.\n\n\u201cThe Common Core creates a lot of new demands for teachers to modify their curriculum in new and challenging ways,\u201d he said.\n\nThere also is more demand for integrating technology into the classroom.\n\nLesson Planet has gone beyond lesson planning to address professional development needs for teachers and districts. The site now offers training videos for how to use iPads in the classroom or make the most of Instagram or Google Docs.\n\nHurley said the site\u2019s courses are constantly reviewed and updated.\n\nTeachers who use the site say those videos create added value for them as members, as does the free online community added in 2014 where teachers can read articles, share ideas and talk about how they used or modified plans in their own classrooms. They like how user-friendly it is and that they can save the materials they like so they are easy to find when they need them.\n\nAdditions planned\n\nThe site should grow even more user-friendly when Lesson Planet introduces its new collections and curriculum manager viewer this year. Teachers will be better able to organize the materials they like and plan their curriculum on the site. They can upload and organize their own information \u2014 and can choose whether to share their own lesson plans with other teachers on the site or keep them private.\n\nVida Long, a middle school teacher and part-time administrator in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, said Lesson Planet has helped her make the most of her limited time.\n\n\u201cHaving access to the site has made things a little easier,\u201d she said.\n\nWorking part-time as an administrator takes up a lot of time before and after school that Long once had for planning. She also moved from teaching eighth grade to sixth grade language arts this year.\n\n\u201cI find it a great resource, because I\u2019m not having to invent everything,\u201d Long said, adding that she likes that the plans have been created by teachers and tested and tried in the classroom.\n\n\u201cI have confidence what we\u2019re going to try is going to be something that works,\u201d she said.\n\nLesson Planet has a current subscriber membership of more than 80,000, Smith-Meyer said. The site has more than 1 million free members, who can access a limited range of what\u2019s on the site, such as the articles and community posts.\n\nThe professional development courses should drive additional growth. The bulk of the membership is still individual teachers, but school and district memberships are expected to increase, particularly as districts trim back budgets but continue to need professional development for their teachers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking at what is happening in classrooms, what is happening with school budgets and assessing what people are going to need in the next couple of years,\u201d Smith-Meyer said.\n\nHurley said Lesson Planet will continue adding lesson plans, professional development tools and other resources to help save teachers time and inspire students.\n\n\u201cLesson Planet is really dedicated to helping teachers,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cWe feel like there is a lot more for us to do.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of an occasional series on how Ventura County technology companies are impacting people.
