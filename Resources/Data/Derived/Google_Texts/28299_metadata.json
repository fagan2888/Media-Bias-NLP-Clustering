Some of the French sculptor\u2019s work even shows the ravages of disease and disfigurement. A Stanford University professor and surgeon who noticed these realistic details was inspired to incorporate Rodin into his teaching using a curriculum that combines Rodin\u2019s sculpture with medical science and computer technology.\n\nSuperimposing scans of patients\u2019 hands into Rodin\u2019s hands to show 3-D anatomy.\n\nDr. James Chang first noticed certain details of Rodin\u2019s sculptures when he was a medical resident at Stanford studying hand surgery. He used to relax on the grass at the sculpture garden of the school\u2019s Cantor Arts Center. \u201cThe more I looked at the Rodin sculptures \u2026 and I focused on the hands, and if you look at each hand \u2026 they\u2019re exactly like the actual medical conditions I was treating.\u201d\n\nThe works include some of Rodin\u2019s most famous pieces, like the Burghers of Calais, a group of defeated noblemen. Chang noticed that one of the Burghers had fused fingers. \u201cWe have children with Apert syndrome that have a similar fusion of the fingers and an open thumb, and we release the fingers to put [them] into a more natural condition,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen he finished his residency in 1998, Chang joined the Stanford faculty in plastic surgery, and he decided to consult an expert on Rodin. He went to Bernard Barryte, the curator of European art at the Cantor. Barryte says what made Rodin a revolutionary artist is that he broke from the classical traditions of idealizing the human form.\n\n\u201cHe wants to render it warts and all,\u201d Barryte says. \u201cSo if a hand is the result of an accident, that sort of enhances and enriches its meaning for him, and he uses that to render figures much more expressive and much more powerful.\u201d\n\nBarryte says that as a student, Rodin also liked to visit the Mus\u00e9e Dupuytren in Paris, a museum filled with pictures of diseases and human deformities.\n\nInitially, Chang used Rodin in his classes by having his students diagnose what they saw. He says Rodin was kind of a gateway for his students to gain an appreciation of the importance of the hand.\n\n\u201cSo many patients come and tell me, \u2018Oh, I wish I could do this, or I\u2019d love doing this with my hands,\u2019 and I want the hand surgery trainee to understand that a patient\u2019s emotions are very much tied into their hands,\u201d Chang says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what Rodin does in his art. He expresses lots of emotions from his hands.\u201d\n\nBut a couple of years ago Chang had another idea. He consulted with Stanford\u2019s Division of Clinical Anatomy, where researchers have been creating a library of 3-D scans of human bodies with various diseases. Chang gave them CT scans of his patients who had the same conditions Rodin had sculpted. \u201cAnd they would superimpose my patients\u2019 own CT scans into the hands,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m able to show the anatomy in three dimensions underneath or inside Rodin\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nExactly how this is done can be seen now at Stanford\u2019s Cantor Arts Center. Chris Crowe, a medical student who works in Chang\u2019s lab, moves the camera lens of an iPad around a display with one of Rodin\u2019s hands. From every angle, the iPad shows what would actually be underneath the skin. One of the hands has a lump near the wrist.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at just the sculpture we see the cyst, and we don\u2019t know where really the cyst is sitting in relation to other structures,\u201d Crowe says. \u201cSo using the CT of a real patient you can see that the cyst lies very close to an artery.\u201d\n\nCrowe says for aspiring surgeons like himself, seeing the cyst in three dimensions actually helps him understand how to make choices about surgery. \u201cGenerally speaking, these cysts lie under arteries and makes it a difficult thing, and that might not be appreciated until you see the CT showing the artery running over the cyst.\u201d\n\nAlthough this has largely been a project about teaching, it\u2019s gotten many of the participants imagining further uses for the technology. Matt Hasel is the project manager at the division of anatomy who has been thinking with his colleagues about ways to use this on real patients.\n\n\u201cWe would take your scan data, drop it in on the iPad,\u201d he says, \u201cand actually a doctor could sit with you and demonstrate what\u2019s going on in your own anatomy.\u201d For example, if you had a broken hand you could see the fracture and all the anatomy around it.\n\nHasel says there is still a lot of work to do before researchers could make this happen with a live human being, but he says this project has inspired them to find a way to make the technology work in the doctor\u2019s office or in the operating room.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stanford's Dr. James Chang combines sculpture and 3-D technology to help surgeons envision human anatomy.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"At Stanford, Using Rodin's Sculpted Hands to Teach Anatomy\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/24\\/at-stanford-using-rodins-sculpted-hands-to-teach-anatomy\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-24 09:36:54\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-26 12:56:37\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19708,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/3_D_scan_St_Pierre_hand_alone.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Stanford's Dr. James Chang combines sculpture and 3-D technology to help surgeons envision human anatomy.", "title": "At Stanford, Using Rodin\u2019s Sculpted Hands to Teach Anatomy", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/24/at-stanford-using-rodins-sculpted-hands-to-teach-anatomy/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/3_D_scan_St_Pierre_hand_alone-640x426.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda36b\"", "article_summary": "Superimposing scans of patients\u2019 hands into Rodin\u2019s hands to show 3-D anatomy.\nChris Crowe, a medical student who works in Chang\u2019s lab, moves the camera lens of an iPad around a display with one of Rodin\u2019s hands.\nDr. James Chang first noticed certain details of Rodin\u2019s sculptures when he was a medical resident at Stanford studying hand surgery.\nChang gave them CT scans of his patients who had the same conditions Rodin had sculpted.\nHe consulted with Stanford\u2019s Division of Clinical Anatomy, where researchers have been creating a library of 3-D scans of human bodies with various diseases."}
