So glad to hear from you. But you and so many others are making a big assumption of something I did not say. I have never suggested a parent give any money to an adult child they deem less fortune. Because as you indicate less fortunate is in the eye of the beholder. What I was addressing and what the original person asked in this very forum was how to NOT feel slighted if a parent or parents give to siblings making less or in jobs not making as much as he did. Or rather how not to feel hurt if same siblings are spendthrifts.

So what's on the table is this. What if your parents give more to your siblings for whatever reason? What if those siblings don't appear to deserve the money when you have worked so hard to be a good saver and money manager? How do you respond.

That is where my advice came in. You feel grateful for what you have.

Because we can't control what others do. I never said what anybody is "entitled to."

Sure parents should be fair in their handouts. But what if they aren't? And frankly they don't have to be fair in your eyes. It's there money.

Do you sulk? Whine? Complain?

You keep doing what you are doing, which is the right thing with your money and not worry about what they are getting fair or not fair.
