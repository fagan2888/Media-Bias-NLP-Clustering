While the initiative promises a transformation in drug effectiveness for treating disease, the reality is that only a minority of patients respond to genetically targeted therapies, and they tend to be those with less complex cases and fewer genetic abnormalities, he argued.\n\nFurthermore, \"overselling [precision medicine] as a harbinger of a medical revolution threatens public confidence in the value of science when these promises fail to be delivered,\" he added.\n\nBut even if implementing the Precision Medicine Initiative will be a slow, difficult process, some providers remain optimistic about its potential.\n\nCharles Sawyers, M.D., who directs the human oncology and pathogenesis program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, told the New York Times he thinks the initiative will not only expand the sequencing of human genomes, but also lead to more drug discoveries.\n\n\"No matter what tumor type you have, a certain percentage of patients, often a small percentage, have mutations that would likely result in a treatment that would work and that we never would have thought of,\" he said.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic also has high hopes for precision medicine, according to the Post Bulletin, given that it runs one of the country's largest biobanks that has been collecting samples from volunteers since 2009. The Mayo Clinic biobank also is unique in that it doesn't focus on just one disease, but rather collects information from large numbers of patients regardless of health history, possibly making it a prime target for funding from the Obama administration, the publication reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Pacific Standard piece\n\n- here's the MedCity News post\n\n- check out the New York Times report\n\n- read the Post Bulletin article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhat will 'precision medicine' mean for providers?\n\nObama to request $215M for precision medicine plan\n\nMoores Cancer Center among precision medicine pioneers\n\nObama touts cybersecurity, personalized medicine efforts in State of the Union address\n\nResearchers offer guidance on clinical use of genomic tests\n\nNext-gen gene sequencing a 'radical' approach\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite all the optimism surrounding President Barack Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative--including\u00a0excitement from providers who already use patients' genetic data to treat disease--the ambitious proposal is not without its skeptics.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Despite all the optimism surrounding President Barack Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative--including\u00a0excitement from providers who already use patients' genetic data to treat disease--the ambitious proposal is not without its skeptics.", "title": "Will the promise of precision medicine live up to the hype?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/will-promise-precision-medicine-live-hype/2015-02-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "cancer care,Care Delivery,genomics,Health Information Technology,precision medicine,State Of The Union Address", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3ed\"", "article_summary": "Obama to request $215M for precision medicine planMoores Cancer Center among precision medicine pioneersObama touts cybersecurity, personalized medicine efforts in State of the Union addressResearchers offer guidance on clinical use of genomic testsNext-gen gene sequencing a 'radical' approach\nLike the fight against cancer, \"precision medicine isn't going to be a revolution--it will be a slow, medical evolution,\" he wrote.\nBut even if implementing the Precision Medicine Initiative will be a slow, difficult process, some providers remain optimistic about its potential.\nDespite all the optimism surrounding President Barack Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative--including excitement from providers who already use patients' genetic data to treat disease--the ambitious proposal is not without its skeptics.\nHe then requested $215 million for various agencies to pursue a wide-reaching effort to use patients' genetic profiles to map out specialized treatments."}
