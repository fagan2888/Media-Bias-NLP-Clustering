They\u2019re babies, and they\u2019re toddlers, and gradually at school age, they can begin to tell us how they\u2019re feeling,\u201d said Linda Goldstein, a pediatrician with Friendship Pediatrics in Chevy Chase, Md.\n\nBy adolescence, the expectation is that the child will begin to do most of the talking.\n\nOnce their child enters puberty, parents are encouraged to leave the exam room to allow the patient time alone with the pediatrician. Elizabeth Alderman and her colleagues at Children\u2019s Hospital at Montefiore in New York introduce this idea with a conversation and handout when the child is 11 years old.\n\nPediatricians recommend annual wellchild exams, and at the next year\u2019s visit, she said, the pediatrician will tell parents, \u201cI want to talk to your child about some behaviors that hopefully he or she isn\u2019t doing \u2014 and that I hope you discuss with your child, too \u2014 but would like to talk about it in private.\u201d\n\nPediatricians reassure parents that they will be informed of dangerous situations. If children or adolescents reveal they are homicidal or suicidal, the parent must be told, Alderman said. If they tell the doctor they are being abused, child protection services must also be informed. It would be up to the doctor to determine what to do if an adolescent reports taking drugs or drinking, she said.\n\nExactly when a child is ready to spend time alone with the doctor varies, Goldstein said. While some are ready quite young, others \u201clook like they\u2019re scared out of their minds\u201d to be alone with a doctor, she said. If time alone with the doctor hasn\u2019t happened by a child\u2019s 14th birthday, Goldstein will be fairly blunt and ask the parent to leave the room.\n\nAn adolescent\u2019s private time in the exam room could include frank talk about mental health, substance abuse and sexual activity. A 1977 Supreme Court decision established a minor\u2019s right to privacy regarding contraception, and details vary by state.\n\nMinors, in general, have some legal rights to seek sexually transmitted disease treatment and prenatal care. Minors may also be able to consent to some types of outpatient mental health, drug or alcohol treatment.\n\n\u201cStates have adopted policies to allow minors to consent to certain services because it has been recognized that minors need this care and sometimes they can\u2019t talk to their parents about it,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nOnce teens reach age 18, doctors cannot share their health information with parents without the patient\u2019s permission, according to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. But when faced with serious illness or hospitalization, young people may need parental help. It\u2019s therefore a good idea for them to sign documents such as a health-care proxy authorizing parents to intervene in an emergency, Goldstein said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/hfyouth23.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa58\"", "article_summary": "Once their child enters puberty, parents are encouraged to leave the exam room to allow the patient time alone with the pediatrician.\nThe partnership between parents and pediatrician evolves as a child grows.\nThey\u2019re babies, and they\u2019re toddlers, and gradually at school age, they can begin to tell us how they\u2019re feeling,\u201d said Linda Goldstein, a pediatrician with Friendship Pediatrics in Chevy Chase, Md.\nIt\u2019s therefore a good idea for them to sign documents such as a health-care proxy authorizing parents to intervene in an emergency, Goldstein said.\nOnce teens reach age 18, doctors cannot share their health information with parents without the patient\u2019s permission, according to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."}
