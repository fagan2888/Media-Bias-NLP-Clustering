Baird Invests in Clearwater, Following Digi-Star Exit

The Milwaukee firm buys U.K.-based Clearwater as it continues to focus on cross-border deals

Baird Capital has picked up a majority stake in Clearwater Group, a water treatment business.

Clearwater, headquartered in Camberley, England, provides water treatment, hygiene, engineering and pump services to customers in the U.K. Terms of the investment were not disclosed.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Baird made the deal through its U.K. arm, which focuses specifically on lower middle market companies in the business services, industrial and health care sectors. The firm is the private equity arm of investment bank Robert W. Baird & Co. On March 23, the company announced it exited Digi-Star, an electronic equipment supplier, in a sale to Topcon Positioning.

Baird has been involved with a few cross-border transactions recently. Earlier in March, the firm invested in Carsing, a Shanghai-based car-auction business. Baird sold Frontage Laboratories Inc. to Hangzhou Tigermed Consulting Co. Ltd. in July.
