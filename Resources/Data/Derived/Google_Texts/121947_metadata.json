It\u2019s such a target-rich environment that it challenges the restrictions of fair use and copyright law, but so ludicrously entertaining that it rises to must-read level. Stiehm uses the issuance of a very temporary stay by Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the case of the Little Sisters of the Poor to argue that Catholics have seized control of the Supreme Court \u2014 and really should be excluded from any position of power at all:\n\nEt tu, Justice Sonia Sotomayor? Really, we can\u2019t trust you on women\u2019s health and human rights? The lady from the Bronx just dropped the ball on American women and girls as surely as she did the sparkling ball at midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve in Times Square. Or maybe she\u2019s just a good Catholic girl. The Supreme Court is now best understood as the Extreme Court. One big reason why is that six out of nine Justices are Catholic. Let\u2019s be forthright about that. (The other three are Jewish.) Sotomayor, appointed by President Obama, is a Catholic who put her religion ahead of her jurisprudence. What a surprise, but that is no small thing.\n\nLet\u2019s test that hypothesis. How many key decisions have been made by the Supreme Court on a 6-3, Catholic/Jewish basis? After all, if Catholicism is the deciding factor in American jurisprudence, then that\u2019s the kind of split we\u2019d most often see, no? Either that or nothing but 9-0 decisions, since Catholics and Jews share a common basis for faith, philosophy, and moral law.\n\nAnd what has Stiehm so steamed? Not an actual decision by Sotomayor, or even an opinion. Sotomayor issued a temporary stay in enforcing the HHS contraception mandate on Catholic nuns, who would otherwise have to facilitate birth-control insurance coverage or face ruinous fines. Apparently, even an interruption in this mandate rises to the level of gender treason and theocracy. Temporary injunctions in cases of this kind are hardly earth-shaking, nor do they mean much for the eventual disposition of the case \u2014 or even the injunction itself. Gabriel Malor e-mailed me this reminder:\n\nSotomayor is still considering the Little Sisters\u2019 stay request. She put a temporary hold on the requirement that they complete the accommodation form and then asked for briefing from both parties. So, she could either refer the issue to the full Court or issue her own decision on the stay request. That could happen at any time. That\u2019s not a decision on the merits, just a decision on whether the accommodation form requirement should be stayed pending appeal at the circuit court level.\n\nStiehm doesn\u2019t allow facts and law to stop her rant, however. She declares, in laughable fashion, that theocracy is imposing religious rule while the mandate itself \u2014 which forces people to provide free birth control whether they want to do so or not \u2014 is somehow benign:\n\nMore than WASPS, Methodists, Jews, Quakers or Baptists, Catholics often try to impose their beliefs on you, me, public discourse and institutions. Especially if \u201cyou\u201d are female.\n\nLike the nuns? Stiehm writes this without a hint of irony:\n\nShe blocked the most simple of rules \u2013 lenient rules \u2013 that required the Little Sisters to affirm their religious beliefs against making contraception available to its members.\n\nDoes Stiehm know that nuns are celibate and therefore don\u2019t require birth control, free or otherwise? And that they clearly don\u2019t want birth-control coverage? A mandate that requires nuns to sign a waiver that facilitates coverage of birth control is farcical on its face. Talk about imposing beliefs. The nuns (and other plaintiffs against the mandate with stronger cases) aren\u2019t attempting to prevent employers from providing birth control; they\u2019re trying to stop the government from forcing them to distribute and pay for it, directly or indirectly.\n\nStiehm leaps from there to argue that Catholics should be excluded from public life, or at the very least discouraged, implying that Catholics aren\u2019t loyal Americans:\n\nCatholics in high places of power have the most trouble, I\u2019ve noticed, practicing the separation of church and state. The pugnacious Catholic Justice, Antonin Scalia, is the most aggressive offender on the Court, but not the only one. Of course, we can\u2019t know for sure what Sotomayor was thinking, but it seems she has joined the ranks of the five Republican Catholic men on the John Roberts Court in showing a clear religious bias when it comes to women\u2019s rights and liberties. We can no longer be silent about this. Thomas Jefferson, the principal champion of the separation between state and church, was thinking particularly of pernicious Rome in his writings. He deeply distrusted the narrowness of Vatican hegemony.\n\nAnd who is at the vanguard of Vatican hegemony in the US? Stiehm can\u2019t even be bothered to educate herself on that point:\n\nThe seemingly innocent Little Sisters likely were likely not acting alone in their trouble-making. Their big brothers, the meddlesome American Roman Catholic Archbishops are bound to be involved. They seek and wield tremendous power and influence in the political sphere.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that Stiehm can\u2019t tell the difference between a bishop and an archbishop, but let\u2019s put that aside for the moment. What, exactly, is the \u201cAmerican Roman Catholic Archbishops\u201d? As an organization, it doesn\u2019t exist. There is the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), which represents all of the Catholic dioceses in the US. And in answer to the question, the difference between a bishop and an archbishop is that the latter heads an archdiocese; Minneapolis-St. Paul is an archdiocese with an archbishop (and auxiliary bishops), while Duluth, New Ulm, Winona, St. Cloud, and Crookston are dioceses with bishops. Both have authority over their local \u201cchurch.\u201d Both are represented in the USCCB. Its current treasurer is the Bishop of Dallas, for example.\n\nWith that level of ignorance, Stiehm manages to stumble to her ultimate point \u2014 that Sotomayor is apparently part of a grand conspiracy to reverse Roe:\n\nIn one stroke with ominous implications, there\u2019s no such thing as Catholic justice or mercy for women on the Supreme Court, not even from a woman. The rock of Rome refuses to budge on women\u2019s reproductive rights and the Supreme Court is getting good and ready to strike down Roe v. Wade, which became the law of the land 40 years ago.\n\nWell, it did \u2026 \u201cin one stroke\u201d from the Supreme Court. I\u2019m not aware of a Roe-level challenge on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket, either, although those Catholics might use anything to overturn it, even though they\u2019ve passed numerous times on doing so. And I won\u2019t be holding my breath for Sotomayor to vote to overturn it even when the opportunity does appear.\n\nAnyway, be sure to read the whole thing. Not only is it a great return to Know-Nothingism on several levels, it\u2019s also a pretty good indicator of the level of editorial judgment at US News. On that point, let\u2019s give the floor to one of the commenters on the piece: \u201cThe author could have saved space by simply writing, \u201cWho has two thumbs, knows nothing about preliminary injunctions, and is too lazy to do the research necessary not to look like a complete idiot?\u201d\u201d\n\n@gabrielmalor From the comments: pic.twitter.com/lMZDwAeaMh \u2014 Brian Faughnan (@BrianFaughnan) January 8, 2014\n\nUpdate: Like I said, there\u2019s too much nonsense in Stiehm\u2019s bigotry to categorically address all of it, but commenter Radjah Shelduck points out something that I did miss, and deserves more attention:\n\nYes, TJ, like a lot of the Framers, did \u201cthink of pernicious Rome\u201d in his writings, but that was the Roman Empire they warned of, not the much later Vatican Rome. This author doesn\u2019t seem to know the difference between the Rome of Christ\u2019s time and that which came centuries later. Anyway, when Jefferson developed his ideas of separation of church and state he was far more troubled by the Anglican Church imposing its will in Virginia\u2013not by the Catholics, who were a tiny minority there.\n\nUpdate: More from my friend Deacon Greg Kandra at Patheos:\n\nRather than taking issue with one justice\u2019s opinion, or attempting to dissect the legal thinking behind it, Stiehm takes the bigot\u2019s way out: it\u2019s because she\u2019s Catholic, dammit, and you know how those Catholics are. I find Jamie Stiehm\u2019s essay objectionable and offensive\u2014as a Catholic, but also as a journalist. It comes perilously close to hate speech, and betrays an attitude toward Catholicism that harkens back to the crude cartoons of Thomas Nast and the anti-Catholic nativism of the 19th century. Stiehm should be ashamed. So should U.S. News & World Report.\n\nIndeed.\n\nUpdate: Be sure to also read Michael Potemra and Michael Sean Winters.\n\nUpdate: The Anchoress provides a thorough fisking as well.\n\nUpdate: Thanks to Instapundit for linking this.\n\nUpdate: More from my friend Father Z. The Catholic League is calling for the Creators Syndicate to terminate Stiehm, but I\u2019m a little tired of the fire-\u2019em demand. I\u2019m more curious as to why anyone would have run this particular column, and US News should be made to answer that.\n\nUpdate: Jeff Dunetz: \u201cis she now claiming that Rush Limbaugh is a Catholic woman?\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Know-nothingism.", "title": "US News: Catholics have taken over the Supreme Court, or something", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/08/us-news-catholics-have-taken-over-the-supreme-court-or-something/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-08T17:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-08T20:06:29+00:00"}, "keywords": "birth control, Catholic Church, contraception, HHS mandate, Know-Nothing, media bias, Sonia Sotomayor, Supreme Court, U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd920e\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court is now best understood as the Extreme Court.\nHow many key decisions have been made by the Supreme Court on a 6-3, Catholic/Jewish basis?\nWell, it did \u2026 \u201cin one stroke\u201d from the Supreme Court.\nEither that or nothing but 9-0 decisions, since Catholics and Jews share a common basis for faith, philosophy, and moral law.\nSo, she could either refer the issue to the full Court or issue her own decision on the stay request."}
