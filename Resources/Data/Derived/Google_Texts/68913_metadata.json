Eden Road within moments, lowering the family to safety. Lewis described the ordeal Tuesday at the Peoria County Sheriff\u2019s Office, where he and his wife, Laurie, accepted two $250 gift cards from the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 157.\n\n\u201cI did this for so many years, and I never understood what it meant to people to be rescued,\u201d Lewis, 38, said. \u201cI am forever blessed. I can never repay these guys. We went from having everything to having nothing in 30 minutes. \u2026 The family of emergency personnel has been critical in rebuilding our lives.\u201d\n\nA wailing fire alarm shocked Lewis awake a few minutes before midnight, when the smoke was bright white. He grabbed his phone, dialed 911 and headed to his son\u2019s room. Laurie, a nurse, wasn\u2019t home at the time.\n\n\u201cAfter the first few seconds, I knew I was in trouble,\u201d said Lewis, who served as a Limestone firefighter more than 10 years until he was hurt on the job in 2004. \u201cThe house went to uncomfortably hot in 30 seconds.\u201d\n\nThe smoke darkened. Lewis remembers screams and scrapes \u2014 his children yelling for help, his dogs\u2019 paws scrambling on hard floor downstairs as the animals collapsed.\n\nThree-year-old Ted didn\u2019t want to let go of his dad when he became the first Lewis child thrust through a kicked out window onto the roof.\n\n\u201cHe was screaming at me, \u2018Daddy, don\u2019t leave me here,\u2019 \u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe smoke by then was black. The father crawled to 5-year-old Taylor\u2019s room and put her out on the roof with her little brother. Lewis plunged back into the murk, guessing from the sound of 6-year-old Jessie\u2019s last scream that she had gotten out of bed and moved to the front of her room.\n\nHe was correct: Jessie had opened her window and passed out from the rush of smoke seeking any way to escape. Her father found her on the floor by feel.\n\n\u201cI remember grabbing her and just trying to go, but that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t remember carrying her out onto the roof,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBy the time I got out and looked at the back of my house, all I saw was orange.\u201d\n\nThe pets perished. Insurance is covering the Lewis family\u2019s stay at a Peoria hotel as they plan how to rebuild. But donors like the sheriff\u2019s deputies and others who have set up an account for the family at Farmington Bank have immediately brought back some semblance of holiday spirit, if not normalcy.\n\n\u201cMy kids will have Christmas,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey\u2019re just so young to be dealing with all this.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHow to help\n\nAn account to benefit the Lewis family, who lost their rural Hanna City home to fire last week, has been opened at Bank of Farmington. Donations can be sent to the bank or call 245-2441 for more information.\n\nBank of Farmington\n\n1620 N. Main St.\n\nP.O.
