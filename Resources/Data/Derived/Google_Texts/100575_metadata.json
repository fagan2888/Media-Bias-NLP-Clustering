The most recent was a 2013 case in which the court struck down a federal law denying benefits to married same-sex couples.\n\nDuring oral arguments in the gay marriage case on April 28, Kennedy posed tough questions to lawyers from both sides but stressed the nobility and dignity of same-sex couples.\n\nThe healthcare decision is tougher to call. Chief Justice John Roberts, the swing vote when the court upheld Obamacare in 2012, said little during the March 4 oral argument to indicate how he will vote.\n\nThe court will issue some rulings on Monday, with more likely later in the week.\n\nFor the justices, the pressure is on to have the rulings ready. That can be difficult as the cases in which they are closely divided are generally the ones left until the end.\n\nOutside the court, those with a stake in the outcome of the rulings are left anxiously waiting.\n\nJim Obergefell looks at his mobile phone as he walks out of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington. A ruling on Obergefell v. Hodges, and whether the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law covers a right to same-sex marriage, is expected from the Court by month's end. (CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS)\n\nJames Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the gay marriage case, said he will be at the court for all the remaining decision days.\n\nObergefell sued Ohio, challenging its ban on same-sex marriages, after the state refused to acknowledge his marriage to John Arthur on Arthur's death certificate. They were married in Maryland, a state that allows gay marriages, just months before Arthur died in 2013.\n\nThe Supreme Court does not announce in advance which rulings will be issued on any given day.\n\n\"It's nerve-racking, it's exciting, but it's also scary,\" Obergefell said while waiting in line to enter the courtroom on Thursday.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian group that opposes gay marriage, will have at least two attorneys in the courtroom, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nAs for the closed-door deliberations at the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hinted during a June 12 speech at the turmoil to come. \"Sharp divisions, one can confidently predict, will rise in the term's final weeks,\" Ginsburg said.\n\nPrior to June 15, the court was split 5-4 in only seven of the 46 cases decided at that point. But last week alone, four of the nine rulings were 5-4 decisions. In the rulings, several justices wrote separate opinions in which they aimed pointed comments at their colleagues.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
