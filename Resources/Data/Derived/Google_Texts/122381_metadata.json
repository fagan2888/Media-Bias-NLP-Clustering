Otherwise, their health care services would be suspended on the 30th of the same month. The government sent out around 300,000 letters in both, English and Spanish stating these deadlines but authorities from the US Department of Human Health & Services have reported an extremely low response rate. Out of the initial letters sent, over 239,000 have yet to respond, therefore are now getting final notices.\n\nImmigrant defendants claim sending the letters out in just two languages doesn\u2019t really cover all the languages immigrants speak and therefore some have not understood the gravity of the situation, or think they have complied with the requirements and have everything in order. Amy Jones of the Southeast Asian Mutual Assistance Associations Coalition Inc. in Philadelphia, said the letters included a number where individuals could call to get the letter translated for them. However, she suspects, \u201cpeople have been getting them and throwing them away.\u201d Her agency helped 450 immigrants get health insurance and has been reaching out to all enrollees.\n\nUnder the health care law, immigrants who are in the country illegally are not eligible for the program and Florida and Texas are the states with the highest number of health insurance applications with information that conflicts with the immigration and citizenship information on file with the government. Around 100,000 of the letters sent out were to immigrants in Florida, yet two of the largest health advocacy groups in South Florida said they\u2019ve received very few calls to get help.\n\nUsers have reported that they continue to receive the letter even though they\u2019ve sent out proper documentation, and worry that they might lose coverage if the government fails to process it on time.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/themes/lt/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "health care immigrants, illegal immigrants health care, obamacare immigrants, immigration citizenship documents, legal documentation health care services, health care services, president obama health,", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Times", "description": "Around 300,000 immigrants could lose health insurance from Obamacare initiative.
