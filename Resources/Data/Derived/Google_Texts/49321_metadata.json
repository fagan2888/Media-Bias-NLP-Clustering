What if President Obama put Hank Paulson in charge of regulating the banks, and he quickly implemented a litany of substantive reforms? What if the neocons who pushed us into the war in Iraq organized our second (third? fourth?) military adventure in the Fertile Crescent, but this time they brought on an era of lasting peace and democracy in the region? What if Exxon Mobil were charged with enacting a nationwide moratorium on fossil fuels, and in short order Americans had fully embraced renewables?\n\nIf such a state of affairs seems unlikely or highly naive, consider briefly the news that Starbucks will offer education assistance to roughly 135,000 eligible employees, who will now have the opportunity to complete unfinished degrees or enroll in college for the very first time. That\u2019s right, Starbucks \u2014 the unofficial mascot of the \u201covereducated, underemployed\u201d crisis in America \u2014 is encouraging more of its staff to foam milk with a bachelor\u2019s degree, a little morsel of tragicomedy we won\u2019t examine too deeply here today.\n\nBy offering its employees access to online education, Starbucks joins a long list of U.S. corporations \u2014 Amazon, Uber, Airbnb, Zappos, etc. \u2014 eagerly exploiting the stress caused by our stagnant economy, what CEO Howard Schultz accurately described as the \u201cfracturing of the American Dream.\u201d See, like much of the rest of the food service industry, Starbucks struggles with lightning-fast turnover. Offering tuition assistance \u2014 contingent, of course, on continued employment \u2014 is a fairly brilliant tactic to address this problem. Sharon Zackfia, an analyst for William Blair & Co. who studies the coffee brand, is quoted in an L.A. Times writeup noting that labor costs are the coffee chain\u2019s biggest expenditure: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s competitive at any level to get good talent. And [Starbucks\u2019] belief is this is another benefit they could provide to ensure consistency and continuity in the level of service.'\u201d The revelation that this initiative isn\u2019t actually intended solely to help workers shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise: the legal structure of most public corporations makes such altruism tacitly illegal.\n\nOf course, Starbucks is hardly responsible for the state of the American economy, so perhaps their attempt to help employees gain an education without debt merits some measure of praise. But there\u2019s more going on here than the simple desire to help their staff: There\u2019s a cynical, free-market ideology at work, and it\u2019s hardly encouraging for the future of jobs or education in this country. Asking publicly traded companies to provide \u201cmarket-based\u201d solutions to the economic crises facing this country is akin to asking Bill Kristol to explain what went wrong in Iraq, or asking Lloyd Blankfein how we can better regulate the financial services industry \u2014 which is to say, both criminally insane and completely uncontroversial.\n\nThis new initiative, billed the \u201cStarbucks College Achievement Plan,\u201d and announced with much fanfare at a press release featuring Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, has been praised nearly universally in the press as a \u201cbold act of \u2018conscious capitalism,\u2019\u201d \u201ca potential game-changer,\u201d \u201cgenerous\u201d and \u201csweet.\u201d None of these glowing reports bothered to note that Starbucks is currently one of the largest employers of minimum wage workers in America, or that the benefits of online college are dubious at best, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that these writeups also fail to examine the underlying ideology at play. Put plainly, we cannot hope to fix a broken system within the confines of that very same system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With labor costs the mega-chain's biggest expenditure, here's its diabolical answer for how to retain staffers", "title": "Starbucks\u2019 demented politics: Why its ballyhooed \u201ccollege\u201d offer helps them \u2014 not you", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With labor costs the mega-chain's biggest expenditure, here's its diabolical answer for how to retain staffers", "title": "Starbucks\u2019 demented politics: Why its ballyhooed \u201ccollege\u201d offer helps them \u2014 not you", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/23/starbucks_demented_politics_why_its_ballyhooed_college_offer_helps_them_not_you/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/graduates_starbucks.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With labor costs the mega-chain's biggest expenditure, here's its diabolical answer for how to retain staffers", "title": "Starbucks\u2019 demented politics: Why its ballyhooed \u201ccollege\u201d offer helps them \u2014 not you", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/graduates_starbucks.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tim Donovan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, College, corporations, Editor's Picks, Education, Employment, Higher education, Labor, Retail, Starbucks, Unemployment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd487\"", "article_summary": "Topics: College, corporations, Editor's Picks, Education, Employment, Higher education, Labor, Retail, Starbucks, Unemployment, Business News, Politics NewsWhat if all our institutional problems could be solved by the people who caused them?\nBy offering its employees access to online education, Starbucks joins a long list of U.S. corporations \u2014 Amazon, Uber, Airbnb, Zappos, etc.\nAnd [Starbucks\u2019] belief is this is another benefit they could provide to ensure consistency and continuity in the level of service.\nOf course, Starbucks is hardly responsible for the state of the American economy, so perhaps their attempt to help employees gain an education without debt merits some measure of praise.\n'\u201d The revelation that this initiative isn\u2019t actually intended solely to help workers shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise: the legal structure of most public corporations makes such altruism tacitly illegal."}
