Brookings, SD

US Representative Paul Ryan recently announced his bid to become the next House Speaker.

The Wisconsin lawmaker and Republican revealed a bold to-do list with his announcement to run. He says he has plans to help fix the country's tax code, rebuild the military, and lift people out of poverty. US Representative Kristi Noem works with Ryan, and the South Dakota representative says he would be a great fit for the job.

"So I really have been able to see him work up-close and personal. I've seen how he tackles problems, tries to build consensus, tries to work across the aisle, I believe he'll be the speaker that continues that kind of process," Representative Noem said.

If Ryan is elected, he would replace John Boehner as House speaker. Speaker elections will start next Thursday in Washington DC.
