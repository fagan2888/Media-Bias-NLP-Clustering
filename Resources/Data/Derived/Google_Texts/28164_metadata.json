A new video series from Project UROK, called AskADoc, explores how meditation can help the mind and simultaneously improve the body. But there's a right way to maximize the benefits.\n\nDr. Andrea Letamendi, psychologist and scientist, explains how powerful just 20 minutes of meditation can be for a person\u2019s mental state. Studies show people who regularly meditate have experienced improvements with their memory, social relationships, academic performance, attention, empathic awareness, and better stress regulation. Meditation can also reduce anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and anger.\n\n\"It\u2019s not just think positively or ignoring bad things,\" Letamendi said. \"It\u2019s turning into your feelings and thoughts without judgment, whether they\u2019re good, bad, positive, or even painful. Mindfulness is an amazing tool for emotional and physical health.\"\n\nMeditation is a type of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy used in hospitals and rehabilitation facilities throughout the world. By paying attention and listening to your heart and honing in on your surrounding environment, the body is able to reduce levels of stress hormones, redirect attention to the present instead of being held captive in past or future thoughts, which is what ultimately allows the mind to be calmed. Letamendi asks viewers to take a deep breath, look around the room, and test it out for themselves.\n\nWatch the video above for more on how you can improve mental health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mindfulness, meditation, may, be, enough, manage, stress, improve, memory", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Learning how to be more mindful can help improve mental and physical states.", "title": "Improve Mental Health In Just 20 Minutes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/mindfulness-meditation-may-be-enough-manage-stress-improve-memory-366200", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/20/practicing-mindful-meditation-20-minutes-may-be-enough-manage-stress-improve-memory.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Learning how to be more mindful can help improve mental and physical states.", "title": "Improve Mental Health In Just 20 Minutes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/mindfulness-meditation-may-be-enough-manage-stress-improve-memory-366200", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/12/20/practicing-mindful-meditation-20-minutes-may-be-enough-manage-stress-improve-memory.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/20/practicing-mindful-meditation-20-minutes-may-be-enough-manage-stress-improve-memory.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-12-20T17:15:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-20T17:24:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Learning how to be more mindful can help improve mental and physical states."}, "article_summary": "A new video series from Project UROK, called AskADoc, explores how meditation can help the mind and simultaneously improve the body.\nStudies show people who regularly meditate have experienced improvements with their memory, social relationships, academic performance, attention, empathic awareness, and better stress regulation.\nMeditation is a type of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy used in hospitals and rehabilitation facilities throughout the world.\nDr. Andrea Letamendi, psychologist and scientist, explains how powerful just 20 minutes of meditation can be for a person\u2019s mental state.\nClosing your eyes and focusing on the world around you is one of the ways to experience the benefits of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy."}
