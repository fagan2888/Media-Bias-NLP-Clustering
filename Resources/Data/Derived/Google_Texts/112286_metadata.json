R. Bard Inc., headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J., focuses on medical technologies in the fields of vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products.\n\nLiberator's revenue comes from supplying urological catheters, ostomy supplies, mastectomy fashions and diabetic supplies directly with patients and their physicians, on a recurring basis.\n\nNational expenditures within the durable medical equipment market are projected to increase from $45.8 billion in 2015 to $71.3 billion in 2023, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates cited by Bard.\n\nThe merger is subject to customary closing conditions, approval of shareholders and regulatory approvals. The company expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 and add approximately $70 million to 2016 net sales.\n\nThe company estimates that in 2017 this acquisition will increase the organic revenue growth rate of the company and contribute between 5 and 10 cents of adjusted cash earnings per share.\n\n\"This acquisition is a key building block in our strategy to access faster growing markets. As the population ages and more healthcare is expected to occur outside of the hospital setting, we believe that having direct access to the patient in the home is strategically important,\" said Bard Chairman and CEO Timothy M. Ring.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cr-bard-acquire-liberator-medical-181-million", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/bard.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Acquisition represents a strategic fit for Bard as it enhances its position in the home care market.", "title": "C.R.
