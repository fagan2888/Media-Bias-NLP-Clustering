Dan Vandal (St. Boniface) on Saturday.\n\nBack in July, Steeves announced if elected he would sell off four city-owned golf courses and redevelop the land in hopes of raising $100 million for infrastructure.\n\nHowever, Chipman calls the plan short-sighted and a short-term solution.\n\n\"There might be other alternatives, sell the golf course as it is to private interests and let them run it and try and create a profit,\" he said. \"Just the fact of selling the golf courses to fix potholes doesn't ring well with us.\"\n\nLast year, a plan to lease city-owned golf courses was narrowly defeated at city hall in a 8-7 vote. The motion had been brought forward following a 2011 audit that showed the courses were running an annual deficit of $7 million.\n\nChipman thought that would be the end of the discussion, however he says because of Steeves' campaign pledge, the association is now fearful the golf course won't just leave the city's hands, but will disappear forever.\n\n\"If we lose this green space, we will never get it back again,\" Chipman said.\n\nSteeves refused to comment on Chipman's concerns.\n\nkristin.annable@sunmedia.ca\n\nTwitter: @kristinannable", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Winnipeg Sun", "description": "Members of the Niakwa Park Residents' Association held a golf tournament on Saturday to show their solidarity in opposing mayoral candidate Gord Steeves' pledge to sell off city-owned golf courses.", "title": "Selling courses short-sighted: Golfers to Steeves", "url": "http://www.winnipegsun.com/2014/09/13/selling-courses-short-sighted-golfers-to-steeves?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Selling courses short-sighted: Golfers to Steeves", "image": "http://storage.winnipegsun.com/v1/suns-prod-images/1297606158637_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464337763940", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "Members of the Niakwa Park Residents' Association held a golf tournament on Saturday to show their solidarity in opposing mayoral candidate Gord Steeves' pledge to sell off city-owned golf courses.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "article_summary": "\"Just the fact of selling the golf courses to fix potholes doesn't ring well with us.\"\nLast year, a plan to lease city-owned golf courses was narrowly defeated at city hall in a 8-7 vote.\nMembers of the Niakwa Park Residents' Association held a golf tournament on Saturday to show their solidarity in opposing mayoral candidate Gord Steeves' pledge to sell off city-owned golf courses.\nBack in July, Steeves announced if elected he would sell off four city-owned golf courses and redevelop the land in hopes of raising $100 million for infrastructure.\nThe tournament was held at the Windsor Park golf course, one of four courses on the chopping block under Steeves' proposed scheme, and was co-organized by the association's president Chris Chipman and Coun."}
