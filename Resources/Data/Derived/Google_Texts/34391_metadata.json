(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nIt may have been just the second game of the season, but Goodhue\u2019s coaches had a goal for the team on Saturday: finish.\n\nOn Friday, Goodhue let River Falls stay in the game longer than the Wildcats anticipated. So, in Saturday\u2019s Red Wing Tip-Off Tournament championship game against Waseca, Goodhue wanted to take care of business.\n\n\u201cWhen we were in the locker room (at halftime), the coaches were saying, \u2018No letups like yesterday,\u2019\u201d said Wildcats forward Shelby Hinsch.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to see that we didn\u2019t let up.\u201d\n\nGoodhue showed its killer instinct by opening the second half on a 21-0 run, easily clinching the Tip-Off Tournament title with a 64-39 victory at Red Wing High School.\n\n\u201cWe were very happy getting the win (on Friday), and we\u2019re thrilled today with how sharp and balanced we were,\u201d said Wildcats\u2019 head coach Josh Wieme. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve made it as a team, but we\u2019re getting there.\u201d\n\nAnd it was that balance that had Wieme so excited after Saturday\u2019s win. Against River Falls on Friday, Goodhue leaned heavily on seniors Mikayla Miller and Kali Ryan, who combined for 50 points. But against the Bluejays, four players scored nine or more points. Miller led the way with 19 points, Megan Ryan chipped in with 11, and Michelle Hadler and Hinsch each finished with nine.\n\nAs a team, the Wildcats shot 48 percent from the field, including 54 percent on 2-pointers.\n\n\u201cIt was really good to know that everyone was a threat offensively,\u201d said Hinsch, who also had five rebounds and four assists.\n\nAnd the high-pressure defense that has become a hallmark for Goodhue was on a roll Saturday, holding Waseca without a double-digit scorer. With the Wildcats leading 34-19 at halftime, the Bluejays would not score until Mikayla Rolling got a fast break layup against Goodhue\u2019s backups with 9 minutes, 11 seconds remaining.\n\n\u201cWe played kind of a zone press in the first half and built our lead with that,\u201d Wieme said. \u201cOur kids were all over the place and that really seemed to frustrate them. It let directly to some layups for us, and that pressure was able to not only distract them at the half court, but also in the front court.\u201d\n\nHinsch added, \u201cWhen we did our full-court man, they crumbled. We worked on flustering their guards and we were able to get some steals off of that.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Wildcats face a strong early-season test as they travel to Faribault to take on Bethlehem Academy. Last year, the state-bound Cardinals ended Goodhue\u2019s season in a 54-50 wins in the Section 1A-West finals.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,girls basketball,Goodhue Wildcats", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "It may have been just the second game of the season, but Goodhue\u2019s coaches had a goal for the team on Saturday: finish.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, Goodhue let River Falls stay in the game longer than the Wildcats anticipated.
