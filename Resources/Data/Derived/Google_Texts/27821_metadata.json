While few people live and die by their snail mail these days, anyone with a dog will sooner or later require a reliable dog walker.\n\nMcLure is a member of the forward-thinking Brighter Days Collective, which is just as passionate about economic equality as it is the welfare of its clawed clients.\n\n\u201cThe business was started to create alternatives to the typical top-down business model,\u201d says McLure, who splits ownership of the company, nearly a decade old, with each of her co-workers. \u201cThe 10 of us function as a collective. Each of us manage our own routes. We split up the business\u2019s administrative tasks, like taxes and advertising, as a collective. Our hiring process is a collective: We get together and [interview] the person as a group. It\u2019s important that we have chemistry.\u201d\n\nAs the so-called \u201cfreelance economy\u201d fills in the gap left by disappearing, traditional, full-time jobs, the freelancers themselves are too often clobbered under the interests and abuses of corporate employers who see cheap labor in the place of people. Our most vulnerable generation is often vaunted for their great creative prowess, but 70,000 Instagram followers won\u2019t get you a seat on the Circulator without a dollar.\n\nBrighter Days, then, merits coverage for providing a fair salary and generous benefits to a group of young Washingtonians with a bevy of extra-office creative and community initiatives.\n\nMcLure also works for Beet Street Gardens, which builds community plots throughout Northeast D.C., and likes to indulge her twin passions for cooking and drawing when not at work.\n\nThe other Brighter Days members have similarly packed r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, which is why they get by with a little help from each other. Each is given six weeks of paid vacation a year and the assurance that their fellow walkers will fill in for each other when needed.\n\n\u201cA lot of us come from backgrounds of having other activities \u2014 bands, jobs, creative ventures. [Our structure allows us] to offer people gainful and dignified employment and contribute to the community, to do the things they\u2019re passionate about support themselves. What\u2019s really cool about this model is that it works.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re already itching to pull a Lester Burnham at your accounting firm, it won\u2019t help you to hear that Brighter Days has offered its employee/owners transgender-inclusive health care options since before the signing of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThey are environmentally minded, too, using bikes or shoes to get from neighborhood to neighborhood. They regularly donate money to small, local organizations such as HIPS (Helping Individual People Survive) and Radix farms, which subsidizes CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) boxes for qualifying low-income households.\n\n\u201cWe prefer to donate to organizations that are smaller so that the money will actually help them more,\u201d explains McLure. \u201cWe\u2019ve also created a training manual for other people to set up a [collective business.] They can see what pieces of our model might help them, see there\u2019s autonomy and space within a collective model for people to speak up and have a say in what\u2019s beneficial to themselves and everyone else.\u201d\n\nOf course, no mission statement is a replacement for knowing one\u2019s way around an extendo-leash. The Louisville, Ky.-born McLure is a familiar, St. Francis-like presence in Adams Morgan for her beaming smile and enduring unflappability at the center of an ever-growing hurricane of leashed, happy dogs.\n\nThe tight-knit nature and self-managed routes of Brighter Days means that, with the exception of vacation days, the same dog or puppy will get the same walker every day. This kind of trust and comfort goes a long way toward keeping Bowser happy, healthy and trainable.\n\nDaily human or canine social contact is a necessity for dogs, and that interaction becomes much less stressful for them when constantly accompanied by a familiar, friendly face. The good people of Brighter Days are united by business, but were gathered by shared passion.\n\n\u201cA lot of us grew up with animals,\u201d shares McLure. \u201cThat\u2019s what really drew me to the business. I\u2019ve had a lot of puppies join my route and it\u2019s really fascinating to see this pet develop and to have a hand in it being a friendly, fun companion for people to have in their homes and share their lives with.\u201d\n\nBrighter Days offers packages for walking one or two dogs. The standard \u201cvisit\u201d is 30 minutes, which includes a walk of 20-to-25 minutes. Dog-sitting packages include three-to-four walks per day, plus meals and meds, with overnight and non-overnight supervision options. Cat feedings are free after a customer has already paid for dog sitting, and other cat services and sitting arrangements are available.\n\nFor more exotic companions, the ever-amenable folks at Brighter Days offer \u201cGet in touch with us, and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Brighter Days, visit brighterdayscollective.com.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Metro Weekly", "description": "The Brighter Days dog-walking collective marries good service with progressive ideals", "title": "Dog Walking as One - Metro Weekly", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 570, "identifier": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Dog-walker-by-Halfpoint.jpg", "height": 385}, "updated_time": "2014-05-17T09:14:44-04:00", "url": "http://www.metroweekly.com/2014/05/walking-as-one/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Brighter Days dog-walking collective marries good service with progressive ideals", "title": "Dog Walking as One - Metro Weekly", "image": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Dog-walker-by-Halfpoint.jpg", "creator": "@metroweekly", "site": "@metroweekly", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 118031275134}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-squareLogo_black-270x270.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroWeekly", "section": "Pets", "tag": "featured", "published_time": "2014-05-15T07:15:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T09:14:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d9b\"", "article_summary": "While few people live and die by their snail mail these days, anyone with a dog will sooner or later require a reliable dog walker.\nFor more exotic companions, the ever-amenable folks at Brighter Days offer \u201cGet in touch with us, and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201dFor more information about Brighter Days, visit brighterdayscollective.com.\nThe tight-knit nature and self-managed routes of Brighter Days means that, with the exception of vacation days, the same dog or puppy will get the same walker every day.\nCat feedings are free after a customer has already paid for dog sitting, and other cat services and sitting arrangements are available.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also created a training manual for other people to set up a [collective business.]"}
