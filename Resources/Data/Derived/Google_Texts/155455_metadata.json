The legislative session will begin Feb. 6 and run to June 5 barring any special session.\n\nSandoval will be involved in preparing a 2019 budget before he leaves office, but a new governor elected in 2018 will have the final say over the spending priorities.\n\nWillden said the current budget projects about $7.3 billion in revenue. Estimates for the next two-year budget are in the $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion range but there will be budget roll-ups and other expenses that will consume much of the additional revenue, he said.\n\nThose budget issues include Medicaid spending, which has seen tremendous growth since the health insurance program was expanded to cover new groups as a result of Obamacare, Willden said. The federal share of the program will decrease slightly as well, meaning a higher state contribution, he said.\n\nThe 2017 session \u201cwill not be a revenue overhaul session for the governor,\u201d Willden said.\n\nSandoval got a major tax package approved in the 2015 session, including a new commerce tax. Efforts are underway by those opposed to the new levy to ask voters to weigh in on the tax in November.\n\nWillden said agencies will be asked to submit proposals on how to cut spending by 5 percent just so there are options on the table if they are needed.\n\nThe actual revenue estimates will be set by the Economic Forum by December.\n\n\u201cI think we have probably maximized our revenue streams for the foreseeable future,\u201d Willden said. \u201cAnd we will be talking more and more about efficiencies and how we pay for the things we want to do. That we believe the taxpayers and the people we serve deserve to have.\u201d\n\nDale Erquiaga, chief strategy officer for Sandoval, said the office will be releasing about two dozen budget goals to state agency officials as part of the planning process.\n\n\u201cThe governor has already indicated, for example, that workforce development and post-secondary, that is after high school, education and training will be a major initiative of this administration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe full strategic planning framework will be released in early April, Erquiaga said.\n\nContact Sean Whaley at swhaley@reviewjournal.com or 775-461-3820.
