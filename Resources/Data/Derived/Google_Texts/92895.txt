BEIJING (AP) — Ustin, a rare Siberian tiger released into the wild by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is behaving badly in his new home in northeastern China.

The tiger, one of two to enter China from Russia’s Amur border region, bit and killed 15 goats and left another three missing on Sunday and Monday on a farm in Heilongjiang province’s Fuyuan county, China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported.

“When I opened the goat house in the morning, dead goats were everywhere,” farm owner Guo Yulin told the agency Wednesday.

He said he was alerted by dog barks Sunday night, but that his check turned up nothing unusual. He said he woke up the next morning to find two goats dead and three others missing.

The goats’ skulls were crushed by the tiger and a hole the size of a human finger was visible on each goat’s head.
