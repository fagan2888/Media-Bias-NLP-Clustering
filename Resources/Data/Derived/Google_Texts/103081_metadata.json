In the wake of the Shutdownpalooza, which was either a death knell for conservatives or an incredible victory, depending who you ask, there was one thing for sure. The GOP is not just divided and arguing.. it\u2019s headed for a full blown civil war from which one of the warring tribes will depart the field. Is there any truth to this? Depends who you ask, I suppose, but Matt Kibbe, the head of FreedomWorks, is at least admitting the possibility.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a real possibility because you\u2019re seeing this clash between the new generation and \u2014 to me, it\u2019s not just the old wing of the Republican Party versus the new wing \u2014 you\u2019re really seeing a disintermediation in politics. It\u2019s already happened with the Democratic Party,\u201d Kibbe said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening with the Republican Party now. And grassroots activists have an ability to self-organize, to fund candidates they\u2019re more interested in, going right around the Republican National Committee and senatorial committee.\u201d\u2026 \u201cAs you know by now,\u201d Kibbe said in the video, \u201cMitch McConnell and John Boehner have partnered with Harry Reid to pass a blank check to the president on this budget fight. There is no reform of Obamacare, there\u2019s no defunding, there\u2019s no delays. Um\u2026we lost.\u201d He went on to say that the amount of vitriol directed at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Heritage Action, FreedomWorks and other agitators for further shutdowns and a debt default indicates that, in fact, the far-right is winning the fight against Obamacare and asks that donors send money to fund the insurrection against moderate Republicans.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but this is one of those questions which is much like Mark Twain\u2019s view of the weather. Everybody talks about it, but nobody is going to do anything about it. It\u2019s one of those areas where you seem to get a much better sense of the temperature by reading the comments at various conservative web sites than you do from the front page content, to say nothing of the cable news shows. If you spend some time \u2013 as we tend to do here \u2013 browsing the reader views and guest diaries at not only good ole\u2019 Hot Gas, but at Red State, Right Wing News, National Review and others, you can develop a fairly unified perception: the RINOs have already cost the movement one election after another and have essentially destroyed the Republican Party.\n\nOf course, if you look at the results of elections \u2013 particularly in House races \u2013 around the nation, it\u2019s not really a unanimous call. There are a lot of districts, especially in the Northeast and the west coast, where Republicans win elections, but they are the kind of GOP candidates who are constantly reviled in forums such as those mentioned above. But hey.. somebody must be voting for them. And yet, you don\u2019t see huge online conclaves for the so called \u201cmoderates\u201d in the party. But they\u2019re out there in numbers significant enough to win a lot of elections.\n\nSo if Matt is right, what\u2019s holding everyone back? If there are these two huge groups dividing the GOP in half and they hate each other so much, why is there still just one Republican Party in America? Why hasn\u2019t the Tea Party already bolted to form a new group of True Grassroots Conservatives? Why haven\u2019t the moderates taken their Chris Christie bumper stickers and marched out to start up the \u201cReasonable Republican Coalition\u201d across the land?\n\nBecause it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nThe Democrats have their own internal scuffles, it\u2019s true. But they show up when it\u2019s time to vote. They don\u2019t always win, but you don\u2019t see a \u201cTrue Liberal Party\u201d marching off the field to take their ball and go home. And the GOP is facing a boat roughly the same size as their own in this bathtub. If you cut the Republican pie in half, you get devoured by a bunch of fist bumping Left wingers. The various legs of the conservative stool are stuck with each other, let\u2019s face it. And what\u2019s more, they can\u2019t survive without each other. It\u2019s probably time to face up to that and begin figuring out a way to keep the marriage together.\n\nYou know\u2026 for the children.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here", "title": "Republican Party to split, according to people who would never split the party", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/19/republican-party-to-split-according-to-people-who-would-never-split-the-party/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-19T14:01:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-19T16:22:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "conservatives, Freedomworks, Republicans,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05cd\"", "article_summary": "Republican Party to split, according to people who would never split the partyposted at 10:01 am on October 19, 2013 by Jazz ShawI think we\u2019ve all seen the stories by now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening with the Republican Party now.\nIt\u2019s already happened with the Democratic Party,\u201d Kibbe said.\nIf there are these two huge groups dividing the GOP in half and they hate each other so much, why is there still just one Republican Party in America?\nThey don\u2019t always win, but you don\u2019t see a \u201cTrue Liberal Party\u201d marching off the field to take their ball and go home."}
