This projection is \u201cthreefold higher\u201d than any study previously conducted, according to analysts.\n\nOne of the reasons for the higher estimate is the new model takes into account \u201cabsenteeism\u201d and \u201cpresenteeism,\u201d which show how often people with obesity miss work and how much less productive they are when present, respectively. One 2010 study suggests that the more overweight the worker is, the bigger the average drop in workplace productivity and the higher the associated health benefit costs.\n\nA 2014 report from the Society for Human Resource Management also detailed the strains that obesity puts on employers. \u201cIf current trends continue, more than 50 percent of the U.S. adult population will be obese by 2030,\u201d the report from the trade group said. \u201cThe growing number of employees and candidates who are obese or who have obesity risk factors is creating safety and accommodation challenges for employers.\u201d\n\nAnother SHRM report found that obesity is a \u201crisk factor\u201d that can cost employers two to three times more than they would expect to pay for a \u201clow-risk\u201d employee in the same age group.\n\nCurrently, 34.9 percent of adults in the United States are obese, up from just 10 percent in the 1990s, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which translates into some 78.6 million American adults with a body mass index of 30 or higher. For the young, obesity rates went from 5 percent to 17 percent in the same period.\n\nBut William H. Dietz, director of the Redstone Center at George Washington University, said Tuesday that multiple studies have now found a decrease in obesity in children under 5, and others are reporting a \u201cplateau\u201d in the rates for obese adults. Dr. Dietz said he was cautiously optimistic, saying that the numbers were \u201cencouraging\u201d but that the U.S. still hasn\u2019t \u201cturned the corner\u201d on the issue.\n\nOthers on the panel were less optimistic. Justin G. Trogdon, associate professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health, cautioned that \u201cobesity is tricky and very difficult to turn around,\u201d especially for large populations, despite the best efforts of public health officials.\n\nChanges in the marketplace\n\nAnand K. Parekh, deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Dr. Dietz said changes in the marketplace may help to ease the problem. Noting that food companies\u2019 sales of healthy food were growing more rapidly than their sales of less-healthy fare, Dr. Dietz said that the reasons were twofold: \u201cHalf of that is market demand, and the other half is \u2018moving to where the puck is going to be,\u2019 as Wayne Gretzky said.\u201d\n\nDr. Parekh said that while market demand for healthy food was one part of the equation, \u201cseveral sectors\u201d have to be involved in order to address the issue of obesity effectively. The HHS official spent a great deal of time discussing the several initiatives conducted by his agency, including first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s high-profile \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d initiative, which has raised an \u201cunprecedented\u201d amount of awareness about obesity in the United States.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is [also] a consequence of awareness,\u201d Dr. Dietz added, saying that recent trends in healthy food demands and the \u201cplateau\u201d of adult obesity could largely be attributed to the increased focus on the obesity crisis.\n\nObesity is not just an American problem, nor is it only confined to industrialized nations. Numbers from the World Health Organization reveal that an estimated 115 million people in developing countries worldwide are now considered technically obese.\n\nThe costs of obesity also extend outside of the office.\n\nThe \u201csocial costs\u201d of the condition, including lowered marriage and college acceptance rates, are often \u201cmore painful than medical costs because they\u2019re so personalized,\u201d Dr. Dietz said.\n\nPrivate companies have also had to retool and invest as the average American has grown heavier and wider in recent decades.\n\nA 2004 study also showed that American adult weight gain between 1990 and 2000 cost the airline industry an extra 350 million gallons of jet fuel due to increased payloads. Demand has surged in recent years for extra-size coffins, and stadium seats have been reconfigured to accommodate larger customers.\n\nUniversity of California system president and former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano told Tuesday\u2019s panel that the findings were \u201csobering to say the least,\u201d and suggested that public research universities \u201ccan and will lead the way on dealing with obesity.\u201d\n\nBrookings\u2019 Mr. Kasman said that the research model\u2019s projections \u201clikely underestimate\u201d the total cost, since they do not take into account such factors as \u201cfuel consumption, military readiness, life insurance and workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's weight problem is proving a much heftier drag on the economy than previously thought.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "America\u2019s weight problem is proving a much heftier drag on the economy than previously thought.", "title": "Obesity weighing down U.S. economy, study finds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/13/obesity-weighing-down-us-economy-study-finds/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/03/12/obesityap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/03/12/obesityap.jpg", "description": "America's weight problem is proving a much heftier drag on the economy than previously thought.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obesity weighing down U.S. economy, study finds"}, "Author": "Nathaniel Madden", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Hospitality Recreation, Health Medical Pharma, Matthew Kasman, William H Dietz"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c44\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Dietz said he was cautiously optimistic, saying that the numbers were \u201cencouraging\u201d but that the U.S. still hasn\u2019t \u201cturned the corner\u201d on the issue.\nA 2014 report from the Society for Human Resource Management also detailed the strains that obesity puts on employers.\nThe \u201csocial costs\u201d of the condition, including lowered marriage and college acceptance rates, are often \u201cmore painful than medical costs because they\u2019re so personalized,\u201d Dr. Dietz said.\nOne 2010 study suggests that the more overweight the worker is, the bigger the average drop in workplace productivity and the higher the associated health benefit costs.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is [also] a consequence of awareness,\u201d Dr. Dietz added, saying that recent trends in healthy food demands and the \u201cplateau\u201d of adult obesity could largely be attributed to the increased focus on the obesity crisis."}
