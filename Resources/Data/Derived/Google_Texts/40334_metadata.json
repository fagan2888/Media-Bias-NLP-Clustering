They found that young people most commonly choose to sext based on pressure from a romantic partner or perceived social pressure from peers. In these decisions, parents and teachers had absolutely no influence, as teenagers also failed to consider possible negative outcomes from engaging in sexting--such as blackmail or harassment.\n\n\u201cRemarkably, only the behavioural beliefs that expected positive outcomes of sexting were significant in predicting adolescents\u2019 willingness to engage in it,\u201d the authors said in a statement. Adolescents were most likely to engage in sexting when they felt they shared \u201ccomplete trust\u201d in their electronic partner--the recipient. In making the decision, young people were most swayed by positive influence from peers and romantic partners, with fear of parental monitoring not a significant worry to teenage cell phone users.\n\nInvestigators also confirmed that adolescents sext based less on subjective motivations but perceived social pressure from romantic partners. Girls said they felt more pressured than boys to share sexually explicit images. \u201cOur results suggest that in order to reduce sexting among adolescents, preventive initiatives should allude to what significant others in teenagers\u2019 lives think about them engaging in sexting,\u201d the investigators wrote.\n\nMore specifically, the investigators advise educators and political policymakers to raise awareness about teenage sexting by including the topic in sexual education classes, among other opportunities for group discussions teaching young people to cope with peer pressure.\n\nSource: Walrave, Michel.
