Bill Walker\u2019s announcement seats Alaska as the 30th state to expand Medicaid coverage. The independent governor said his state could not wait any longer to accept the $146 million in federal funds provided under President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office predicts the expansion would provide health care coverage to more than 20,000 Alaskans within the first year of expansion.\n\n\u201cThis is the final option for me,\u201d Walker said at a press conference. \u201cWe are not going to step away from this opportunity to help fellow Alaskans, period.\u201d\n\nJim DeMint, president of The Heritage Foundation, warned in a March op-ed for the Cincinnati Enquirer that while Medicaid expansion is attractive to states in the short-term, the long-term costs are detrimental.\n\nDeMint wrote that medical providers are paid less under government health care programs, including Medicaid, causing providers to raise prices for those with private insurance. This \u201ccost shifting\u201d pushes patients who cannot afford the increased prices out of insurance or onto government coverage, straining state health care budgets.\n\n\u201cThere are too many short-term thinkers in the health care debate,\u201d DeMint said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for proponents of Obamacare and the expansion of Medicaid to understand that they are anything but compassionate. They are dooming many Americans to second-rate health care.\n\nWalker campaigned in 2014 with the goal of expanding Medicaid under his leadership. Alaska\u2019s Republican-held legislature blocked attempts multiple times, leading Walker to assert executive authority to secure the federal expansion funds.\n\nWalker said he sent a letter to the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee, giving legislators the required 45-day notice of his plan. The committee can make recommendations, but Walker said he has legal authority to move forward without its approval.\n\nHis office projects 42,000 residents are eligible for the coverage and that expansion would save the state more than $100 million in the first six years.\n\n\u201cIt would be foolish for us to pass up that kind of boost to Alaska\u2019s economy,\u201d Walker said.\n\nWalker\u2019s announcement comes a month after President Obama vowed he would intensify efforts to persuade governors to accept the federal funds following the Affordable Care Act\u2019s latest Supreme Court victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got states out there that, for political reasons, are not covering millions of people that they could be covering, despite the fact that the federal government is picking up the tab,\u201d Obama said following the decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alaska\u2019s governor said Thursday he was using his executive authority to expand Medicaid after failing to get the state legislature to provide the coverage.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Alaska\u2019s governor said Thursday he was using his executive authority to expand Medicaid after failing to get the state legislature to provide the coverage.", "title": "Alaska Latest State to Expand Medicaid Under Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/AlaskaMedicaid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1fbGUCH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Alaska\u2019s governor said Thursday he was using his executive authority to expand Medicaid after failing to get the state legislature to provide the coverage.", "title": "Alaska Latest State to Expand Medicaid Under Obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/AlaskaMedicaid.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-07-17T21:21:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Medicaid, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Bill Walker"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6f6\"", "article_summary": "Bill Walker\u2019s announcement seats Alaska as the 30th state to expand Medicaid coverage.\nThis \u201ccost shifting\u201d pushes patients who cannot afford the increased prices out of insurance or onto government coverage, straining state health care budgets.\nThe governor\u2019s office predicts the expansion would provide health care coverage to more than 20,000 Alaskans within the first year of expansion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for proponents of Obamacare and the expansion of Medicaid to understand that they are anything but compassionate.\nDeMint wrote that medical providers are paid less under government health care programs, including Medicaid, causing providers to raise prices for those with private insurance."}
