Bush and Barack Obama. This focus on changing income patterns of different age groups over time was a far less \u201cmessy\u201d way of measuring aggregate median income than, for example, examining all households from teen years to 64, he explained.\n\nAmong Shapiro\u2019s main findings:\n\nThroughout the Reagan and Clinton eras, nearly every type of household saw large, steady income gains. That held true whether the households were headed by men or women, by blacks, whites or Hispanics, or by people with high school diplomas or college degrees.\n\nThis broad income progress came to a screeching halt around the turn of the century. Between 2002 and 2013, the incomes of most households \u201cstagnated or declined even as they aged through nine years of expansion and two years of recession.\u201d\n\nThe only types of households that showed rising incomes over this more recent period were those headed by those in their mid-to-late 20s and college graduates, although their gains proved to be much smaller than those achieved by young and college educated households in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nRelated: Why Middle Class Tax Relief Is Taking Center Stage\n\nIn short, Shapiro, a business executive and faculty member of Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, concludes that the income problems that most households face today \u201care not a long-standing feature of the American economy but rather reflect the particular condition and policies of the last decade or so.\u201d\n\nShapiro identifies two main structural causes for the dramatic change in the income trends over the last 15 years. One is the effects of globalization and the other is the explosion in information technologies. Both of these seismic changes in the economy contributed to corporate downsizing and a far more competitive job market in the U.S., as well as downward pressure on wages.\n\nThe findings cast a revealing new light on the on the long-term plight of the middle class and the profound impact that changing public policies in Washington can have on the average lives of Americans \u2014 or at least certain public policies.\n\n\u201cThe broad and strong income progress achieved under the Clinton and Reagan presidencies may well suggest that the major differences in their economic policies, as in tax policy, did not greatly affect the income paths of most Americans,\u201d Shapiro writes.\n\nRelated: Full Employment Alone Won\u2019t Solve Problem of Stagnating Wages\n\nWhat did help improve the incomes of American households, Shapiro suggests, were fiscal approaches under Reagan and Clinton that supported stronger rates of business investment. Those approaches included raising substantial new revenues and slowing the growth of certain areas of spending.\n\nMore specifically, Shapiro notes that Reagan and Clinton had made \u201cpublic investments to modernize infrastructure, broaden access to education, and support basic research and development.\u201d Those investments \u201cpromoted stronger overall growth and an increase in underlying productivity that lifted income in the latter 1990s.\u201d These types of public investments shrank under Bush and Obama, a change that Shapiro said had \u201cserious effects for both short-term growth and long-term income progress.\u201d\n\nShapiro, who served as an economic adviser to Clinton in his 1992 campaign, also points to free-trade agreements under Reagan and Clinton as important measures that helped drive stronger economic growth.\n\nMembers of Congress and the Obama administration may find important lessons in Shapiro\u2019s study as they debate a new budget and infrastructure program for the coming years.\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A constant refrain of Democrats and Republicans alike in seeking to broaden their appe", "title": "What Obama Could Learn from the Reagan and Clinton Economies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/08/What-Obama-Could-Learn-Reagan-and-Clinton-Economies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06142012_Obama_Reagan_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/08/What-Obama-Could-Learn-Reagan-and-Clinton-Economies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06142012_Obama_Reagan_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A constant refrain of Democrats and Republicans alike in seeking to broaden their appe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41bd\"", "article_summary": "Among Shapiro\u2019s main findings:Throughout the Reagan and Clinton eras, nearly every type of household saw large, steady income gains.\nRelated: Full Employment Alone Won\u2019t Solve Problem of Stagnating WagesWhat did help improve the incomes of American households, Shapiro suggests, were fiscal approaches under Reagan and Clinton that supported stronger rates of business investment.\nMembers of Congress and the Obama administration may find important lessons in Shapiro\u2019s study as they debate a new budget and infrastructure program for the coming years.\nThose approaches included raising substantial new revenues and slowing the growth of certain areas of spending.\nThis broad income progress came to a screeching halt around the turn of the century."}
