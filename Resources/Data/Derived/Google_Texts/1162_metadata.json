Each employee was terminated for failing \u201cto live by Centegra values\u201d in 2012 or 2013, according to the suits, filed Sept. 10 in federal court in Chicago.\n\nThe complaints allege that the firings followed an effort to cut costs that started in 2012 when Centegra began working with an accountable-care network called Quality Health Solutions, now Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cThey saw (the high costs) and they started terminating employees under false pretenses,\u201d said Joshua Karmel, one of the lawyers representing the former employees. \u201cWe believe the cuts were illegal.\u201d\n\nCENTEGRA WILL 'AGGRESSIVELY DEFEND' ITSELF\n\nMr. Karmel said disciplining or firing employees based on \u201cvalues\u201d leaves much discretion to the employer and can be used as a catch-all reason to fire workers.\n\nCentegra denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe expect and encourage (employees) to utilize\u201d benefits, Bernadette Szczepanski, Centegra vice president of human resources development, said in a statement. \u201cCentegra intends to aggressively defend such lawsuits.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the company doesn't comment on the details of pending litigation, Ms. Szczepanski said: \u201cCentegra expects the highest standards from its associates and staff. This sometimes results in associates leaving Centegra.\u201d\n\nIntegrated Health Network of Wisconsin \u2014 which is mentioned in the suits but doesn't have a claim against it \u2014 doesn't make employment decisions at member hospitals, Kathy Allen, vice president of marketing and communications, wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cWe never get involved in employment decisions made by any of our members,\u201d Ms. Allen wrote. \u201cBeyond that, it would be inappropriate for us to comment on pending litigation that doesn't involve us.\u201d\n\nCentegra has acute care hospitals in McHenry and Woodstock and a behavioral health hospital in Woodstock. It also recently received state approval to issue up to $133 million in debt to build a hospital in Huntley. The health system reported $404 million in revenue for fiscal year 2012.\n\nThe lawsuits don't say how much money the medical treatments were costing. And Centegra declined to comment on its costs or cost-cutting measures. Employee use of health care benefits is protected under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, according to the suits.\n\nPLAINTIFFS ARE ALL WOMEN\n\nThe former employees suing Centegra are all women in their 50s and 60s who had been employed between six and 13 years. Each began to have costly medical claims as early as 2009. And all were terminated for failing \"to live by Centegra values,\" according to the lawsuits.\n\nJanet Cherette, a 63-year-old registered nurse, underwent hand surgery in 2009. Three years later she received treatment for a work-related shoulder and neck injury and was ordered by her doctor to reduce work hours from 12 hours per day to six to eight hours, which Centegra declined to accommodate. In more than 10 years at Centegra she had never been disciplined for work performance issues, but in 2012 she was disciplined twice and was fired in August of that year, according to the suit.\n\nDaun DePaul, a 60-year-old certified nursing assistant, began working at Centegra in 2007. In 2012, DePaul's husband was hospitalized four times to treat a heart condition and in July of that year underwent heart surgery, according to the complaint.\n\nAround the time her husband was hospitalized, Centegra began to discipline DePaul for minor infractions. The complaint alleges that other employees were not disciplined for similar infractions. DePaul was terminated in September 2012, according to the complaint.\n\nLaura Wolf, 54, was hired in 2002 as a registered nurse. Between 2009 and 2012 she underwent four surgical procedures and was scheduled for eye surgery in July 2013. She was terminated June 17, the suit says.\n\nIn each instance the former employees are seeking reinstatement or lost salary and employment benefits in addition to attorneys' fees.", "article_metadata": {"taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "byline": "Ryan Graff", "timeCrawled": "20160527_01:39:12", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "published_at": "2014-9-18", "title": "Centegra sued after firing employees with high health care bills", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/140919814", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Centegra sued after firing employees with high health care bills"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Three employees at the health system in Chicago's northwest suburbs allege they were fired after their medical bills started to pile up.", "title": "Lawsuits: Centegra Health fired workers \u2014 to save on health care", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140918/NEWS03/140919814/lawsuits-centegra-health-fired-workers-to-save-on-health-care", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Three employees at the health system in Chicago's northwest suburbs allege they were fired after their medical bills started to pile up.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Centegra Health System", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "article_summary": "Three lawsuits filed this month allege that Centegra Health System illegally fired employees to save money on health care benefits for workers.\nAround the time her husband was hospitalized, Centegra began to discipline DePaul for minor infractions.\nAnd all were terminated for failing \"to live by Centegra values,\" according to the lawsuits.\nThe complaints allege that the firings followed an effort to cut costs that started in 2012 when Centegra began working with an accountable-care network called Quality Health Solutions, now Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin.\nEmployee use of health care benefits is protected under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, according to the suits."}
