Businesses added 268,000 jobs in October, making it the 68th consecutive month of private sector job growth. That\u2019s 13.5 million private sector jobs over 68 straight months.\n\nUnemployment rate ticked down, wages grew, and overall the economy added 271,000 jobs in October \u2014 which makes the last three years the strongest years for job creation since\u2026 oh, 2000.\n\nHo-hum. This is what Republicans refer to as a horrible economy that they claim to want to \u201cfix\u201d. (To see what that looks like, recall 2007, 2008, 2009 ish.) This is what the \u201cjob-killing ObamaCare\u201d has done to us. This is what \u201cjob-killing taxing the wealthy\u201d looks like. LOL.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics announced today, \u201cTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 271,000 in October, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 5.0 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Job gains occurred in professional and business services, health care, retail trade, food services and drinking places, and construction.\u201d\n\nJason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs, summarized it thusly, \u201cThe economy added 271,000 jobs in October, marking the strongest three years of job creation since 2000.\u201d\n\nLet that point sink in, because it is an election season and the numbers are what they are: we (non 1%ers) do better under a Democratic president in modern times.\n\nIt gets better. Furman continued, \u201cIn October, the economy added jobs at the fastest pace so far this year as the unemployment rate declined to its lowest level since April 2008 and broader labor market indicators improved further.\u201d\n\nAnd boom, finally, \u201cWage growth picked up in October and wages have grown faster over the past twelve months than any other point in this recovery.\u201d\n\nToday we learned that private-sector employment rose by 268,000 jobs in October. Our businesses have now added 13.5 million jobs over 68 straight months, extending the longest streak on record. The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.0 percent in October\u2014its lowest level since April 2008\u2014with stable labor force participation. Wages continued to rise; average hourly earnings for all private employees have now risen 2.5 percent over the past year, the fastest pace achieved since 2009. Moreover, broader labor market indicators improved as the \u201cunderemployment\u201d (U-6) rate declined to its lowest level since May 2008 amid a substantial decline in part-time work for economic reasons. Private employment growth in August and September was also revised up by a total of 56,000 jobs. Overall, our economy has created 8.0 million jobs over the past thirty-six months, the fastest pace since 2000.\n\nA pretty chart to share with your friends who complain about the socialist in office:\n\nRemind them that Bush doubled unemployment while Obama cut it in half.\n\nWe know things are much better but we also know there\u2019s a long way to go. One of Furman\u2019s five points about the numbers was \u201cLong-term unemployment has fallen rapidly over the past year but remains somewhat above its pre-recession average.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement about the numbers saying our economy is making strong progress, but \u201cmany Americans are still stuck searching for a good-paying job or waiting for a long overdue pay-raise. Congress must do more to create jobs and raise the wages of hard-working Americans.\u201d\n\nThere was, at long last, finally one piece of good news to report in terms of Congress. Pelosi noted a thanks to the \u201cunanimous vote of House and Senate Democrats, the bipartisan budget agreement signed into law this week is projected to create 340,000 new jobs next year alone.\u201d\n\nRepublicans will try to take credit for that but Pelsoi reminded everyone, \u201cYet more than 200 Republicans in the House and Senate voted against this vital legislation.\u201d\n\nAnd the Republican trolling of our economy is far from over, \u201cNow, Republicans continue to threaten to derail this progress and shut down the government over their dangerous and unacceptable ideological riders to the Omnibus bill. Democrats will continue to work to avert more job-killing Republican crises and win progress for hard-working American families.\u201d\n\nThings are looking way up, the economy under President Obama continues to set records for private sector job growth and overall job growth for the last three years the strongest years for job creation since 2000. You know, right before Bill Clinton turned the reins over to George W. Bush in January of 2001, who drove us over a cliff and crashed the car, which then caught fire and burned down the surrounding areas.\n\nNo, a president isn\u2019t the only thing and probably not the major thing driving the economy, but the numbers don\u2019t lie and we do better under a Democrat. Tax cuts for the rich do not stimulate anything but the wallets of the rich.
