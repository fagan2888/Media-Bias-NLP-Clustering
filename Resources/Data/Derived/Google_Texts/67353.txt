U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement after the Department of Labor released their finalized rule regulating overtime pay:

“Our economy continues to be stuck in the worst recovery since World War II and the only solution the Obama Administration can come up with is more red tape that will hurt our nation’s working middle class. Just like Obamacare’s 30 hour work week, this regulation will once again incentivize employers to cut worker hours, provide fewer benefits, and hinder flexible work arrangements for hardworking Americans. That doesn’t help anyone get ahead. I’ve already heard from many concerned constituents in Kentucky on how this misguided regulation will hurt them.

“Instead of forcing another job-killing regulation on our struggling economy, the administration needs to start over. That’s why I’m proud to co-sponsor legislation introduced by Senators Scott and Alexander that will require the Department of Labor to first study this regulation and its real life effects, especially on small businesses who are the engine of our economy and not-for-profits who provide much-needed services to our constituents, before it can be implemented.”
