Amazon has been facing pressure from activist shareholders to provide a compensation report along these lines.\n\n\u201cThere will naturally be slight fluctuations from year to year, but at Amazon we are committed to keeping compensation fair and equitable,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.\n\nThe new report likely won't silence critics of Amazon's employment practices. For instance, Jezebel noted yesterday that, \"While women make as much as men at Amazon, the report indicated that women only accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s workforce. Further, only 24 percent of Amazon\u2019s management are women. That means a large percentage work at Amazon\u2019s warehouses where workers are paid between $10 and $15 per hour.\" Working conditions at those warehouses have also come under fire.\n\nTech giants including Amazon have been under pressure from some investors, including Arjuna Capital in Boston, to disclose details about what they pay men and women. And, of course, the gender pay gap also remains a hotbutton issue outside of the tech sector. One in five human resources managers reported that men are paid more than women at their companies, according to a survey last month from CareerBuilder. A Glassdoor study this week found that gender pay gaps still exist worldwide, even though they shrink considerably when factoring in age, education and years of experience.\n\nRelated: 6 Easy Ways to Recharge Your Job Search\n\nIn January, President Obama introduced new rules that would require every large company to report salary data based on race, gender and ethnicity.

Underrepresented minorities earned 99.7 cents per dollar. Cook said Apple is working to eliminate the gap.\n\nGap\n\nIn 2014, the company said an audit of its employees\u2019 pay conducted by an outside firm found there was no significant wage difference between men and women.\n\nGoDaddy\n\nThe website-hosting company found last year in an internal audit that its female employees are paid $1.01 for every dollar a male employee makes. Women in technological positions are paid 99 cents on the dollar, while female managers at the company make 96 cents to the dollar.\n\nRelated: Top 5 Industries for Job Hunters in 2016\n\nGoogle\n\nAfter a former employee posted a spreadsheet with salary data last year, the search engine giant responded that it \u201cregularly runs analysis of compensation, promotion, and performance to ensure that they are equitable with no pay gap.\u201d The company has not released those internal reports.\n\nIntel\n\nThe chipmaker found in its annual diversity report this year that there was no compensation disparity across genders, taking into account job level, education, experience and responsibilities.\n\nSalesforce\n\nLast year at a Fortune magazine event, the CEO of the cloud-based software company said Salesforce spent $3 million to bring salaries of female employees to the same level as their male counterparts.\n\nSpaceX\n\nLast month, CEO Elon Musk said he would consider reviewing employee salaries at the company to see if men and women were paid fairly, according to a report from The Huffington Post.
