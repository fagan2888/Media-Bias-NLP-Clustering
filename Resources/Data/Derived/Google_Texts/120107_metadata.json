But money is cheap and balance sheets are flush with cash, which has led several major players to combine forces and reap the benefits of their resulting size and efficiencies.\n\nIn 2015 alone, the Milwaukee area saw the announcement or completion of some of the biggest deals in recent memory, including: Glendale-based global multi-industrial firm Johnson Controls Inc.\u2019s pending merger with Ireland fire protection and security solutions company Tyco International plc; Milwaukee-based utility Wisconsin Energy Corp.\u2019s $9 billion acquisition of Chicago-based Integrys Energy Group; McLean, Va.-based USA Today publisher Gannett Co. Inc.\u2019s $297 million acquisition of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel parent Journal Media Group; London-based megabrewer SABMiller\u2019s plan to sell its 58 percent stake in the MillerCoors joint venture to Denver-based brewer Molson Coors for $12 billion; Cincinnati-based grocery giant The Kroger Co.\u2019s $824 million acquisition of Milwaukee-based Pick \u2019n Save parent Roundy\u2019s Inc.; and St. Louis-based Columbia St. Mary\u2019s parent Ascension\u2019s acquisition of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare\u2019s southeast Wisconsin facilities.\n\nThis follows a national trend toward consolidation which helped advance M&A activity to record levels last year. Global announced M&A volume surpassed $5 trillion for the first time in 2015, according to Dealogic, which provides analytics to investment banks. There were 10 deals of greater than $50 billion announced last year, one of which is the Anheuser-Busch InBev bid for SABMiller that is expected to result in the MillerCoors spinoff.\n\nMost companies that weathered the Great Recession have already right-sized their workforce. Balance sheets are generally very strong in the post-recession economy, with debt capacity or cash available in spades, said Steven Barth, a partner and co-chair of the Transactional & Securities Practice at Foley & Lardner LLP in Milwaukee. At the same time, interest rates are very low and money is relatively easy to borrow.\n\n\u201cAs companies continue to deal with what I would call the new normal economy\u2026companies have to look for acquisitions for a very significant part of their growth,\u201d Barth said. \u201cGrowing organically is so difficult to do, especially if you\u2019re a very big company. Really the only way to have an impact on your growth curve and to have a substantial impact is acquisitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of our practice, we\u2019re very excited about all this activity,\u201d said Chris Smyth, transaction advisory services leader for professional services firm EY\u2019s central region, which includes Milwaukee. \u201cOur outlook for 2016 is positive as it relates to M&A.\u201d\n\nAccording to EY\u2019s global Capital Confidence Barometer survey in October, 59 percent of companies surveyed expected to pursue an acquisition in the next 12 months, which is the highest appetite for deal-making measured by the survey in six years. The Barometer, which included 1,600 executives in 53 countries, also indicates that most M&A activity is occurring in what EY defines as the medium-sized category, at between $251 million and $1 billion, but megadeals of more than $1 billion are still prominent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a period where most companies have been very focused on the cost and operational efficiency side and now they\u2019re focused on growth,\u201d Smyth said.\n\n\u201cThis is an ongoing trend of companies using M&A as a tool to drive growth,\u201d said Joe Packee, managing director and co-head of Global Industrial\n\nInvestment Banking at Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc. in Milwaukee. \u201cIn the current global economy, organic growth is limited and companies are achieving the growth they need by going out and buying it.\u201d\n\nActivity up across the board\n\nWhile the national trend is clear, the reasons for the individual transactions are across the board. Depending on the transaction, a company could be making an acquisition to add a new product or technology, expand geographic reach, attain synergies in a supply chain or other operational adjacencies, or to eliminate a competitor and improve market position, Packee said.\n\nAnd across industries, financial conditions are ripe for mergers. Corporate earnings and stock performance grew quickly post-recovery, from 2011 to 2013, but then stagnated, said Matteo Arena, associate professor of finance at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cSo you see companies that have to figure out how to keep growing and when internal growth opportunities, new investments and earnings are stagnant, then companies will try to increase earnings by acquisitions,\u201d Arena said.\n\n\u201cMany corporations have very strong balance sheets, with plenty of cash to finance these deals,\u201d Packee said. \u201cWhere they might need to tap debt financing or where private equity firms may be involved, debt markets have, for the most part, remained incredibly accessible and provided a lot of relatively inexpensive debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you combine the stockpile of cash held by companies with the low-cost debt available to finance M&A transactions, that translates to tremendous purchasing power,\u201d said Rob Jansen, managing director at Milwaukee merger and acquisition advisory firm Bridgewood Advisors Inc. \u201cThere is significant motivation for companies of all sizes to put idle cash to work in a strategic way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s happening in every single industry,\u201d Barth said. \u201cEveryone has their own different dynamics and independent industry factors that are impacting one way or another, but there\u2019s no question. I think it\u2019s across the board.\u201d\n\nWisconsin\u2019s M&A activity has in most ways mirrored the transaction trends across the country and the world.\n\n\u201cThe overall trend in these megadeals is industry consolidation, which has been motivated by both cost synergies and growth synergies,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cWhile the megadeals naturally receive most of the headlines, the same M&A strategies are being employed by middle-market Wisconsin companies, which are using acquisitions to grow market share, expand product lines, add new capabilities and diversify. Our buy-side M&A clients have never been more active.\u201d\n\nBut Wisconsin\u2019s megadeals could just be a rare grouping of opportune transactions, said Bradley Raaths, an attorney at DeWitt Ross & Stevens in Madison who focuses on M&A transactions.\n\n\u201cThere surely is substance behind the deals,\u201d Raaths said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that those deals in and of themselves are an indicator of a trend so much as a confluence of deals of a similar timing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are very solid foundations in Wisconsin for the M&A market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got good performance, you\u2019ve got low unemployment, you\u2019ve got the relative low cost of capital. When you\u2019ve got companies in Wisconsin that are on solid footings, that are doing well\u2026those make good targets. And if they\u2019re not targets, they\u2019ve got the strength of financial resources to undertake deals on their own.\u201d\n\nOf the megadeals that have been completed recently or are in process in the Milwaukee area, four out of six have involved a larger out-of-state company targeting a Wisconsin company.\n\n\u201cMaybe that just points to sort of the hidden gems we have here in the Wisconsin community that are being sought after by the larger companies,\u201d Jansen said.\n\nSearching for growth\n\nCorporations seeking to generate returns in a slow-growth economic environment have few options available.\n\nThey can perform some financial engineering, buying back shares to increase shareholder value, for example, Barth said.\n\n\u201cThat works, but it doesn\u2019t really grow the top or the bottom line at all, it just enhances earnings per share,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could increase the dividend and shareholders love that. But what really excites shareholders is \u2018Hey, they\u2019re still growing and they\u2019re growing by very large strategic acquisitions.\u2019\u201d\n\nStrategic acquisitions make sense in the favorable lending environment and considering most companies\u2019 good cash reserves and strong equity, Smyth said.\n\n\u201cCompanies are focused on growth and they want to do something material, which is why I think you\u2019re seeing larger transaction values,\u201d he said.\n\nAs they take a closer look at their businesses, some leaders are also deciding which areas they want the company to exit, such as with Johnson Controls\u2019 planned spinoff of its automotive seating and interiors business as part of its pending merger.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more companies becoming sophisticated and astute around portfolio management,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cCompanies that are doing M&A are being rewarded by the equity markets.\u201d\n\nThe rise of investor activism may also be contributing some of the pressure on corporations to create returns for shareholders, whether in response to activists or as a proactive avoidance tactic.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really forcing the companies to evaluate the businesses that they\u2019re in to drive shareholder returns,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cThe result is some of these folks really doing an outstanding analysis of some of these businesses and really taking action at the board level.\u201d\n\nMost public companies, particularly large cap firms, are concerned about the activist investment asset class and the hefty investments it has garnered, as well as the substantial returns some of these firms have generated, Barth said.\n\n\u201cTop of the agenda for almost every public company is \u2018How do we anticipate a potential activist and what are we going to do to prevent one from occurring?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nPleasing activists could involve either a purchase or a sale, Arena said.\n\n\u201cDefinitely there\u2019s more pressure from activist investors in the last few years, but that can go either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cSome activist investors in some companies are asking for acquisitions, but in many cases they are asking for divestitures, spinoffs.\u201d\n\nThe threat of activist investors can make leaders more proactive and diligent about cutting fat or adding value, Smyth said. And they\u2019ll need to do their homework to be prepared for the potential activist move.\n\n\u201cIf (leaders are) not prepared to answer (activists\u2019) questions, then I think that\u2019s when shareholders would be willing to engage with the activists,\u201d he said.\n\nA continuing trend\n\nBaird doesn\u2019t expect this megadeal trend to die down anytime soon, Packee said.\n\n\u201c2015 was a record in terms of global M&A deal volume, with more than $4 trillion in transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may not achieve that same record in 2016, but we expect that it will still be a strong year.\u201d\n\nAccording to KPMG\u2019s 2016 M&A Outlook Survey, 51 percent of 550 M&A executives surveyed nationally said the biggest driver of M&A is corporations\u2019 and private equity funds\u2019 record cash reserves and commitments. And 58 percent said the current appetite for M&A is best explained by companies\u2019 need to fortify their competitive position in the current market.\n\nThe mergers are happening across sectors, from diversified industrials to consumer to life sciences. They\u2019re driven by factors as varied as exposure to stressed oil and gas markets, and sector convergence, Smyth said.\n\nWhile many of these deals are driven by the low cost of debt at the moment, the Federal Reserve this year is beginning to increase interest rates, albeit at a slow pace, Arena said.\n\n\u201cSo companies are saying \u2018The interest rates are still low but the window of opportunity is closing, because the interest rates are going up,\u2019 so you see an acceleration of these deals,\u201d he said.\n\nIntegration approvals\n\nWhen a deal is valued at more than $78.2 million, it requires federal approval because of antitrust concerns. The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice evaluate how the companies\u2019 market is defined and whether the merger would have an adverse impact on their competition. This process usually lasts between six and 18 months, Smyth said.\n\n\u201cThe lead time for some of these deals because of the federal approvals is so long that they have a lot of time to plan,\u201d Barth said.\n\nIn some cases, regulators may bar a deal unless one of the companies divests a portion of their business.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re seeing bigger deals, the risk of there being overlap in a particular market or geography, where regulators would look at it and scrutinize it a little more, would be expected,\u201d Smyth said.\n\nAccording to the FTC, the vast majority of deals it reviews are allowed to proceed after its initial review, but sometimes a second request for information is issued. This occurred in the Gannett/Journal deal, and could have resulted in three possibilities: the investigation closing as usual; the FTC entering into a settlement with both companies; or the FTC taking legal action to block the transaction.\n\nFederal regulations also prohibit merging companies from cooperating on areas that could potentially be seen as competitive, such as pricing or marketing. They must remain completely separate competitors until integration, Barth said.\n\n\u201cThey have to be very careful that they don\u2019t work together in connection with their post-merger integration,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the same company until they actually are. If you start too early and you get too in-depth and you deal with matters that impact the competitive landscape, you run the risk of what\u2019s called gun-jumping.\u201d\n\nLocal impact\n\nIf a megadeal does go through, companies may try to limit the impact of these mergers on the local headquarters or employees, or they may limit the effect to a \u201cslow burn,\u201d Barth said. The integration can often be the most difficult part of a deal.\n\n\u201cTo the extent headquarters move, that\u2019s never a good thing, no matter what companies say,\u201d Barth said. \u201cLong term, it does have an impact, because wherever the headquarters is and the CEO, management team is, that makes a difference from a community standpoint.\u201d\n\nJohnson Controls will no longer be headquartered at this Glendale facility when it completes its merger with Tyco. The local impact is expected to be minimal.\n\nThe Johnson Controls deal, for example, could have had a more severe impact on local employment if the company had not decided to keep its operational headquarters in the Milwaukee area, he said.\n\nThe Johnson Controls-Tyco merger is motivated by the tax and efficiency benefits of locating the merged company\u2019s headquarters in Ireland, which has a more favorable tax code, in a practice known as a tax inversion, Arena said. The companies have said they expect to realize $150 million in annual tax savings from the deal.\n\nA U.S. Treasury tax rule announced April 4 could impact the Johnson Controls-Tyco deal by reducing the potential tax savings. The companies have said they\u2019re reviewing the new regulation.\n\nBut the corporate earnings repatriation tax advantage is still available to foreign domiciled corporations, which is likely where the majority of Tyco and Johnson Controls\u2019 tax savings will come from in the transaction, Arena said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that (the merger is) not going to go through, but the possibility that they\u2019re not going to merge is there,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the MillerCoors spinoff, expected to close in the second half of the year, most of the impact may have already been felt in Milwaukee, where the company brews much of its beer, when the joint venture was formed. The companies already announced the MillerCoors Chicago headquarters and name will remain post-sale.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some dislocation of certain management team already,\u201d Barth said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to get much worse than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPremium beer has gone up in demand, so brands like Budweiser, Miller, they are not doing as well as they used to,\u201d Arena said. \u201cTheir market is shrinking, so the only way they can keep growing, reduce the impact of shift in demand for the product, is by merging together.\u201d\n\nWEC Energy Group is always looking to achieve efficiencies and eliminate redundancies, Barth said. With such a large company and so much institutional knowledge to retain, some employees can likely be reallocated to different positions as the companies integrate.\n\n\u201c(Layoffs are) always more of a concern in any industry of equals or mergers in any industry generally in the same market. I don\u2019t know how you would get around having some adverse employee impact,\u201d Barth said.\n\nWEC completed a 2 percent workforce reduction that eliminated less than 200 jobs and reduced positions in its executive suite during its integration.\n\nThere have been an increasing number of health care acquisitions nationally, driven by implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has also been felt in Milwaukee with the Ascension/Wheaton deal, Arena said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because of the health care reform requiring companies\u2026to be more cost efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they cannot get more efficient operationally, just internally through management initiatives, they will do it by economies of scale.\u201d\n\nAscension has not announced its specific plans to generate efficiencies under the combined organization, which now has 11,000 employees and eight hospitals in the Milwaukee area.\n\nThe Gannett/Journal Media deal, completed this month, also is expected to result in significant changes. Gannett has said it plans for $10 million in \u201cimmediately available synergies\u201d and another $25 million of operating synergies over the following two years as the companies integrate. Journal Media Group has about 3,000 employees nationwide and about 400 employees at its offices in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nKroger\u2019s acquisition of Roundy\u2019s was a strategic geographic expansion for a large company that didn\u2019t have a foothold in Wisconsin, Arena said.\n\nThat transaction has so far not resulted in any significant announced changes to Roundy\u2019s Milwaukee operations, which include 22,000 employees, 151 stores and 101 pharmacies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Major mergers impact Milwaukee.", "og": {"site_name": "BizTimes Media", "description": "Major mergers impact Milwaukee.", "title": "Big Deals", "url": "http://www.biztimes.com/2016/04/18/big-deals/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/COV-Big-Deals041816.jpg", "height": 560}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/COV-Big-Deals041816.jpg?w=640", "site": "@BizTimesMedia", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BizTimesMedia"}, "google-site-verification": "q525hWL29Np_TIsJ0g7DBGQn-HsUQezBxm172DFDNQw", "keywords": "anheuser-busch inbev,ascension wisconsin,bridgewood advisors inc.,dewitt ross & stevens,ey,foley & lardner llp,gannett co. inc.,integrys energy group,johnson controls inc.,journal media group,kpmg,marquette university,molson coors,robert w. baird & co. inc.,roundy\u2019s inc.,sabmiller,the kroger co.,tyco international plc,wheaton franciscan healthcare,wisconsin energy corp.", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-18T06:00:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T16:30:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2376\"", "article_summary": "\u201c2015 was a record in terms of global M&A deal volume, with more than $4 trillion in transactions,\u201d he said.\nI don\u2019t know how you would get around having some adverse employee impact,\u201d Barth said.\nJournal Media Group has about 3,000 employees nationwide and about 400 employees at its offices in downtown Milwaukee.\nThe Gannett/Journal Media deal, completed this month, also is expected to result in significant changes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really forcing the companies to evaluate the businesses that they\u2019re in to drive shareholder returns,\u201d Smyth said."}
