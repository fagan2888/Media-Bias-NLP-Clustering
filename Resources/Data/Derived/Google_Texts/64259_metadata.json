Bernie Sanders.\n\nIf the projection turns out to be true, it will be a blow to Sanders, whose win in the racially diverse state would have been a boost to his campaign. Minority voters were key to a win for Clinton, NBC News reported.\n\nTo everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win.

So far, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has more support among first-time caucus goers, while Hillary Clinton has more voters who said this isn\u2019t their first time.\n\nSupport for the two candidates is also split along age lines. According to entrance polls, about three-fourths of caucus goers under the age of 45 support Sanders, while a majority of voters over 45 support Clinton.\n\nThe caucuses come at the same time a bit about Sanders\u2019 past was revealed by an archival photo from the Chicago Tribune. Sanders has said much about his civil rights activism while a student at the University of Chicago, but photo of him being arrested during a South Side Chicago protest in 1963 could help bolster that image.\n\n\u201cHe looked at [the photo] \u2014 he actually has his student ID from the University of Chicago in his wallet \u2014 and he said, \u2018Yes, that indeed is (me).\u2019\u201d Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the campaign, told the Tribune.\n\nBernie Sanders arrested fighting for racial justice in 1963 pic.twitter.com/mIu3ZM0Tr2 \u2014 John Lurie (@lurie_john) February 20, 2016\n\nUPDATE: 4:39 p.m. EST \u2014 Turnout in the Republican South Carolina primary could break records Saturday if absentee ballots are an indication of the number of voters that came to the polls, GOP officials told the Wall Street Journal. Friday saw some 59,000 absentees come in, more than in the 2008 and 2012 elections combined.\n\nThe South Carolina polls are slated to close at 7 p.m., CNN reported.\n\n5 numbers driving the race in Nevada and South Carolina https://t.co/Kh7kMTEOSL | AP Photo pic.twitter.com/BR1nrBeKYB \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) February 20, 2016\n\nUPDATE: 4:09 p.m. EST \u2014 Presidential hopeful Donald Trump\u2019s campaign added some heat to the race for the South Carolina Saturday, tweeting out a picture of an email apparently from Trump competitor Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign, asking for help.\n\nThe email said \u201cThere\u2019s not a delicate way to put this. We\u2019re falling behind,\u201d according to a tweet from Trump\u2019s social media director Dan Scavino. \u201cI\u2019m emailing you now, and I need to hear back in the next 30 minutes if at all possible. Because in 30 minutes I go into my last pre-South Carolina meeting Ted, and as of the last report an hour ago \u2014 we are still behind by more than $150,000.\u201d\n\nDear @realDonaldTrump,\n\n\n\n\"There's not a delicate way to put this.

The email then has a link to allow donations to be made.\n\nUPDATE: 3:43 p.m. EST \u2014 Barbs between supporters of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders were exchanged Saturday as the Democratic caucuses started off. At Rancho High School in North Las Vegas \u2014 one of Nevada\u2019s most diverse voting areas and where Clinton herself started off her Nevada campaign \u2014 verbal exchanges in English and Spanish could be heard between supporters of the two Democrats, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n\"\u00a1Vota por el cambio!\"\n\n\n\nyells Sanders backer.\n\n\n\n\"When I say Madame, you say President,\" Clinton supporters fire back. pic.twitter.com/ugAArJmKxG \u2014 Kate Linthicum (@katelinthicum) February 20, 2016\n\nAnd so it begins! #NVDemsCaucus pic.twitter.com/j4lvIAyXSp \u2014 Yvanna Cancela (@ydc226) February 20, 2016\n\nClinton staff member Natalie Montelongo could be heard leading the chant, \u201cWhen I say \u2018Madame,\u2019 you say, \u2018President!\u2019\u201d against Sanders supporters yelling, \u201cFeel the Bern.\u201d Both Clinton and Sanders have been trying to garner support among Latino voters in Nevada.\n\nUPDATE: 3:24 p.m. EST \u2014 Facebook released its data of the conversations happening in South Carolina's primary and in Nevada's caucuses Saturday afternoon. The social network analyzed the conversation around the candidates from midnight to noon EST Saturday. The data revealed that Donald Trump is dominating the conversation in South Carolina, with 56 percent, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is overtaking Hillary Clinton in Nevada, with 31 percent of posts and comments. Trump is followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 22 percent and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 17 percent.\n\nThe top issues in South Carolina are Pope Francis, Amnesty for Illegal Immigrants, the Affordable Care Act, Islam and Muslims, and racism and discrimination. Top issues in Nevada are government ethics, Citizens United and SuperPACs, education, racial issues and immigration.\n\nPhoto: Facebook Inc.\n\nPhoto: Facebook Inc.\n\nKerry Flynn contributed to this report.\n\nUPDATE: 3:15 p.m. EST \u2014 Early reports of entrance polls at the Nevada caucuses Saturday are showing that Hillary Clinton has a slight lead over competitor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, though the race is still close, CBS News tweeted about an hour after the caucuses opened the doors. About 70 percent of people who showed up early to the caucuses said they arrived at a conclusion of who they were going to support in the race more than a month ago.\n\nEntrance polls of early-arriving Nevada caucus goers show @HillaryClinton with slight lead https://t.co/EB9pnLtDS7 pic.twitter.com/NzZ3RPknfn \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) February 20, 2016\n\nIf you're still in line at your caucus location, stay in line to make your voice heard! https://t.co/apxJoaxOhc \u2014 Nevada Dems (@nvdems) February 20, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: 2:57 p.m. EST \u2014 It\u2019s aces high in Nevada Saturday \u2014 that is, if there is a tie between Vermont Sen.

If that ended up in a tie, the suit would decide the winner, with spades being the highest.\n\nCaucasing in NV for the first time. It's\u2026 intense.

Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton facing off in a race that is all but clear. People had to be in line within the hour of the kick-off time, they can participate in the caucus, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThere's still time!

Phillip (@abbydphillip) February 20, 2016\n\nUPDATE: 12:58 p.m. EST \u2014 While voters are heading to the polls to determine which Republican will come out on top in the South Carolina primary Saturday, the impact of the poll results remains unclear.\n\nDonald Trump maintained the lead heading into Saturday's voting, and a win could force the party to take his candidacy more seriously, but a loss \u2014 possibly finishing behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who started Saturday second in the opinion polls \u2014 could bring in more financial support for other GOP candidates, the Post and Courier of Charleston reported. Cruz could come out on top by taking advantage of the evangelical vote, the same thing he did in Iowa.\n\nThe worst thing that could happen to Cruz may be finishing behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has gotten endorsements from a U.S. senator and representative from South Carolina, as well as Gov. Nikki Haley. A third-place finish for Rubio, however, could be the worst-case scenario for him.\n\nPerhaps the worst thing that could happen to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush would be coming in fourth, which might lead financial backers to end their support and, fulfilling the prediction of Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s campaign, end Bush\u2019s bid. For Kasich, ending in front of Bush could be the most positive thing since he hasn\u2019t collected many endorsements aside from newspapers, the Post and Courier reported. Finishing in the back of the pack, however, could show his strong second-place finish in New Hampshire was nothing more than a fluke.\n\nI voted today for @marcorubio. Did you? ___ #Ivoted #Rubio2016 @TeamMarco pic.twitter.com/br9zYTsRF3 \u2014 kaitlynn\u2655 (@kaitdollxo) February 20, 2016\n\nFor Ben Carson, once one of the GOP front-runners, the best-case scenario would be sticking around in the race, the Post and Courier reported. If he finishes too far behind, the effect may be being shut out of further debates.\n\nJust voted in the #SCPrimary. I voted for @marcorubio. Don't forget to go out and vote today! pic.twitter.com/nmnA6rhmbY \u2014 Will Evans (@willevans_sO) February 20, 2016\n\nUPDATE: 12:12 p.m. EST \u2014 Three days after endorsing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley cast her vote for him in the Republican primary Saturday, a Haley deputy chief of staff tweeted Saturday.\n\nHaley said earlier this week, \u201cI wanted somebody with fight, I wanted somebody with passion, I wanted somebody who had the conviction to do the right thing, but I wanted somebody humble enough to remember he works for all the people,\" CNN reported.\n\n.@nikkihaley casts vote for @TeamMarco @marcorubio in @scgop first in the South presidential primary. pic.twitter.com/ajLDBC4aux \u2014 Rob Godfrey (@RobGodfrey) February 20, 2016\n\nHaley\u2019s endorsement comes with those of South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Trey Gowdy. Rubio said Haley\u2019s endorsement is the most important, however, to possibly coming in second in the primary.\n\nUPDATE: 11:50 a.m. EST \u2014 Even though voters are expected to hit the polls Saturday in South Carolina during the Republican primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz chose to spend at least part of the day in Washington to attend the funeral of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week in Texas. Cruz arrived at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception to honor Scalia, a longtime mainstay of the court\u2019s conservative wing, a New York Times photographer tweeted.\n\nCruz is expected to be back in South Carolina later Saturday, the Washington Post reported.\n\nSen. Cruz arrives for the Mass for Justice Scalia @ the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception pic.twitter.com/E5l32ROA23 \u2014 Doug Mills (@dougmillsnyt) February 20, 2016\n\nUPDATE: 11:03 a.m. EST \u2014 As Republican presidential hopefuls waited Saturday as voters went to the polls in the South Carolina primary, one candidate predicted the end of a rival\u2019s campaign is soon approaching. Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign said Saturday that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign will be over after Saturday.\n\nKasich\u2019s chief strategist, John Weaver, said: \u201cFor all practical purposes, there is no path forward for Gov. Bush. That campaign will come to an end today,\u201d a Boston Globe reporter tweeted Saturday morning.\n\n\"For all practical purposes, there is no path forward for Governor Bush,\u201d says Kasich\u2019s @JWGOP. \"That campaign will come to an end today.\" \u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) February 20, 2016\n\nWeaver also said with Bush out of the race, Kasich\u2019s campaign will get a boost as the last governor in the race for the Republican nomination. Weaver also predicted the final GOP duel will be between Kasich and front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nHow to watch South Carolina's Republican primary today: https://t.co/8l0sKMAwuH pic.twitter.com/jhqzMQBJwL \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) February 20, 2016\n\n\n\nOriginal Story:\n\nThe Republican and Democratic presidential candidates face off against one another on opposite sides of the country Saturday. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders go head-to-head in the Democratic caucus Saturday in Nevada while the GOP\u2019s primary in South Carolina could show whether front-runner Donald Trump can keep the momentum of his campaign going through Super Tuesday March 1 when a series of other Southern states are set to vote, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe AP reported Trump wowed a crowd of thousands Friday in Myrtle Beach. \u201cWe have a movement going on, folks. And we can\u2019t blow the movement. We have to make sure we get a big mandate. We have to go out tomorrow we have to go out and vote,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThose trailing Trump, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have an opportunity to make strides in their campaigns, with Cruz running a strong get-out-the-vote campaign this week to topple Trump. Bush and Rubio aren\u2019t expected to get second or first, but they are trying to best each other.\n\nNevada is a wild card for the Democrats. Ninety-eight percent of voters won\u2019t even attend caucuses Saturday, the Atlantic reported. Nevada has a large population of minorities \u2014 to whom Clinton has appealed \u2014 but also has a large number of young people, whom Sanders has helped energize along the campaign trail.\n\nLatinos hold some of the cards in Nevada's Democratic caucus https://t.co/twVf93UAQy pic.twitter.com/4XOw4wxSl0 \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) February 20, 2016\n\nUnsettled by a loss in New Hampshire last week, Clinton isn\u2019t looking at a surefire victory in Nevada, Politico reported. Her campaign is looking for a best-case scenario in which she gains a slim victory over Sanders, but not one that signals a decisive win.\n\nClinton has a mere 5-point lead over Sanders in the Nevada polls, USA Today reported. If Clinton loses to Sanders Saturday, it could call into question Clinton\u2019s ability to connect with voters in the same way Sanders has.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nevada, caucus, south, carolina, primary, republicans, democrats, gop, sanders, clinton, trump, cruz, rubio, bush, nevada, caucus, south, carolina, primary, republicans, democrats, gop, sanders, clinton, trump, cruz, rubio, bush, clinton, support, sanders", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Voter turnout appeared high in South Carolina's GOP primary.
