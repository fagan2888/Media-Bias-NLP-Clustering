The Egyptian media, however, has remained silent about the incident.\n\nThe tragic event occurred when an anonymous man attacked the victim while she was walking with her friend, witnesses said.\n\n\u201cThe attacker did not stop hanging on and touching the victim on the bridge. She and I asked him to stop, but it was in vain. She threatened him, and then jumped into the water. A man tried to save her. She had already drowned when I tried to help,\u201d a witness said.\n\nThe police tried to hide the truth, but the \u2018\u2019I saw harassment\u2019\u2019 association confirmed that the cause of the suicide was street harassment.\n\n\u201cQasr al Nil police\u2019s report concerning the incident is irresponsible and it should be examined. The police should be accused of absolute negligence, as they tried to hide the truth and pretend that the girl committed suicide because of family problems,\u201d said the association in a communiqu\u00e9.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 also conveyed a direct message to Egyptian women encouraging them to defend themselves from sexual harassment: \u201cYou have the right to life, security, and dignity. Do not be ashamed of your body. Celebrate it instead. You are citizens in this country, and all the acts of violence committed against you are violations of human rights\u201d.\n\nSexual harassment in Egypt has become a significant threat to women\u2019s integration into society, as lot of women have been attacked and raped since the Egyptian revolution in 2011.\n\nEdited by Timothy Filla\n\nJoin the Conversation.
