Feeling abandoned, members of the battalion have turned to a survival strategy they learned at war: depending on one another. Doing what the government has not, they have used free software and social media to create a quick-response system that allows them to track, monitor and intervene with some of their most troubled comrades.\n\nWhen evaluating the long-term support that veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will need, consider this: Federal spending for the care of World War I veterans peaked in 1969\u2026more than half a century after their return from the trenches.\n\nThe Saints and Smugglers of Syria\u2019s Civil War \u2013 Foreign Policy\n\nFor a brief moment in late 2013, it looked as if a small group of Syrian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates had outfoxed Bashar al-Assad. By day, they were businessmen and bureaucrats, working as middle managers, professors, and salesmen. In every moment they could spare \u2014 nights, weekends, lunches, and cigarette breaks \u2014 they and dozens more like them in the capital of Abu Dhabi devoted themselves to supporting an uprising in a homeland they left long ago.\n\nA fascinating look at how diaspora populations can support revolutions, and the logistical nightmare that support sometimes entails.\n\nPope Francis Is Not \u2018Progressive\u2019\u2014He\u2019s a Priest \u2013 The Atlantic\n\nAmericans are often tempted to read Francis as a \u201cprogressive\u201d pope who has tossed out the conservative playbook of Church leaders past\u2026 [But] it\u2019s essentially meaningless to try and place him on the spectrum from \u201cleft\u201d to \u201cright\u201d in the United States, contorting the poor pope to fit the mishmash of statism and individualism that plagues U.S. politics.\n\nThe Pope defies simple labels of left and right. All interesting people do.\n\nThe Decline of the French Intellectual \u2013 Politico EU\n\nArguably the most important reason for the French loss of intellectual dynamism is the growing sense that there has been a major retreat of French power on the global stage, both in its material, \u201chard\u201d terms and in its cultural \u201csoft\u201d dimensions. In a world dominated politically by the United States, culturally by the dastardly \u2018Anglo-Saxons,\u201d and in Europe by the economic might of Germany, the French are struggling to reinvent themselves.\n\nWith Europe beset by so many different crises over the past five years, perhaps the moment is less propitious for grand(iose?) French idealism than for solidly engineered German pragmatism\u2026.though both will be needed as the idea of Europe evolves.\n\nThe Avenger \u2013 New Yorker\n\nWhen Ken Dornstein learned that Pan Am Flight 103 had exploded, he did not realize that his older brother, David, was on the plane\u2026 His colleagues knew nothing of his brother, but he privately took solace from accumulating investigative skills. \u201cI was interested in the tradecraft of how you find people,\u201d he recalled. He wondered about the shadowy culprits behind the Lockerbie bombing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a worldly person, I hadn\u2019t travelled\u2026but I kept thinking, These guys are out there.\u201d\n\nJournalists go where others don\u2019t, won\u2019t, or can\u2019t. They\u2019re motivated by all sorts of things\u2014in this case brotherly love.
