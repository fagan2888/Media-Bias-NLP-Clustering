It benefits from a below-average cost of living and state tax rates that are lower than most of its counterparts in the top 10. (At least those that have an income tax; the top three states in the MoneyRates ranking \u2014 Texas, Washington and Wyoming \u2014 don\u2019t have state income taxes.)\n\n\n\nThe worst state to live, by this measure, is Hawaii, which has a sky-high cost of living \u2014 the price of living in paradise, apparently.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood thing someone researched his work\n\nA former Iowa State University scientist with Cleveland ties was sentenced Wednesday, July 1, to more than 4\u00bd years in prison for making false statements in research reports.\n\n\n\nDong-Pyou Han, 58, who altered blood samples to make it appear he had achieved a breakthrough toward a potential vaccine against HIV, also must pay $7.2 million to a federal government agency that funded the research, the Associated Press reports.\n\n\n\nGovernment prosecutors \u201csaid Han's misconduct dates to 2008 when he worked at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland under professor Michael Cho, who was leading a team testing an experimental HIV vaccine on rabbits,\u201d according to the story.\n\n\n\n\u201cCho's team began receiving NIH funding, and he soon reported the vaccine was causing rabbits to develop antibodies to HIV, which was considered a major breakthrough,\u201d the AP says. \u201cHan said he initially accidentally mixed human blood with rabbit blood making the potential vaccine appear to increase an immune defense against HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS. Han continued to spike the results to avoid disappointing Cho, his mentor, after the scientific community became excited that the team could be on the verge of a vaccine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBig money\n\nIowa State recruited Cho in 2009.\n\nReuters reports that U.S. doctors and research hospitals \u201ccollected nearly $6.5 billion in payments for services rendered to pharmaceutical and medical device companies in 2014,\u201d according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments report released this week.\n\n\n\nCleveland Clinic, the report found, was among the largest recipients of such payments.\n\n\n\nThe Clinic \u201ccollected $25.1 million in research payments and $12.9 million in general payments,\u201d Reuters reports. \u201cIts largest payment of $1.2 million also came from Siemens, followed by $941,311 from biotech Biogen Inc.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report, in its second year, lists 11.4 million payments to 607,000 physicians and more than 1,100 teaching hospitals made by 1,444 companies.\n\n\n\nReuters says the Open Payments program, which was created under the Affordable Care Act health care reform with the aim of improving transparency, \u201crequires drug and device manufacturers to report payments to health care providers for things like speaking engagements about their products and research grants.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report \u201callows individuals to track payments to their physicians by drug companies,\u201d according to the news service. The need for greater transparency \u201cwas spawned by concerns that physician prescribing habits and choices could be driven by payments from pharmaceutical and medical device companies,\u201d Reuters says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSneak attack\n\nThe owner of a Cleveland company is quoted in this New York Times story about makers of custom sneakers cashing in on customers\u2019 growing appetite for one-of-a-kind shoes.\n\n\n\nThe paper notes that retail sneakers are a $29 billion market in the United States. Customization within the sector is growing, \u201creflecting the demand for one-of-a-kind goods \u2014 spurred by millennials on one end and baby boomers on the other,\u201d according to Elizabeth Spaulding, a retail partner at the consulting firm Bain & Co.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers generally want more control and choice in what they purchase.\u201cThere\u2019s been a big push toward customization in many industries,\u201d Spaulding tells the paper, citing as an example the hugely successful restaurant chain Chipotle, where customers build their own meals. \u201cAnd when you think about the market for sneakers, there is already a heavy emphasis on choice and individualism.\u201dThat trend has been a big help to Jacob Ferrato, owner of JBF Customs in Cleveland, who started customizing athletic shoes eight years ago, when he was 16.From the story:He no longer paints them but rebuilds them with high-end exotic leathers like ostrich, python and alligator, and just introduced his own line of custom-built sneakers.Mr. Ferrato\u2019s shoes start at $1,000, and clients have paid as much as $7,000 for a pair. He does no advertising, but has 120,000 followers on Instagram. That, along with Facebook and Twitter, is his marketing.\u201cI\u2019ve grown because of people talking about me on social media \u2014 that\u2019s been everything. And the fact there are so few things you can buy that are truly unique,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just want something no one else has.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The rankings from MoneyRates are based on factors including average wages, state tax rates and cost of living.
