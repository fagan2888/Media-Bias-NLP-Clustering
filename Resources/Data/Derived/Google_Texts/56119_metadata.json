Making decisions based on a huge list of plan options on federally run marketplaces in Pennsylvania and elsewhere may lead to poorer choices.\n\nPeople may pay too much for a plan and for services they won't need, or they may pay too little upfront, with even greater costs down the road. That's what his research and that of others is finding in private-employer marketplaces.\n\nFederal marketplace leaders are currently meeting with experts about this, and they've also solicited public comments on the issue. Other marketplace changes involve requiring insurers to update their provider networks monthly.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal health officials are reviewing new ways http //www nytimes com/2015/05/09/us/politics/health care law consumer complaints to get addressed by white house html to improve the federally run", "title": "How to pick the best marketplace health plan?
