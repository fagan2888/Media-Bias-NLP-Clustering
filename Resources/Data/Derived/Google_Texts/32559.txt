First Obama turned the Border Patrol into coyotes. Now he's turning them into advocates for amnesty. Next they'll be told to offer ObamaCare applications to anyone who crosses.

The White House has ordered federal authorities to inquire of any illegal immigrants they happen to come across during the course of duty: Do you know whether you qualify for any type of amnesty grant under President Obama’s recent deportation order?

The Associated Press obtained internal documents detailing the new procedure for federal authorities — namely, agents with Customs and Border Protection and with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Rather than putting immigrants in charge of proving their qualifications for staying in the United States — under the terms of Mr. Obama’s policy — it puts the government in charge of identifying those individuals who might qualify for leniency.

Federal immigration agents have also reportedly been ordered to sift through government files to see if any immigrants who are currently in jail would qualify for freedom under Mr. Obama’s amnesty order, AP said.
