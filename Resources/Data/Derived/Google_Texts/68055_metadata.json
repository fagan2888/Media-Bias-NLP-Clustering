Or, if she can, she\u2019s afraid to explain the difference, which is what likely happened during two recent interviews where she had to change the subject rather than speak to the question. So apparently, there is nothing to see here, time to move on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should ignore, of course, that as a democrat, President Obama\u2019s divided this nation with the same kind of class warfare and race-baiting that communism has employed for decades. He\u2019s led the charge against job creators, extended olive branches to enemy states and praised anarchists like the \u201c99 Percent.\u201d He\u2019s publicly castigated police, belittled Christians, and disparaged the third (and his equal) branch of government. He trades terrorists for traders, denigrates our allies and discourages our military.\n\nAre people really so gullible to not see the similarities?\n\nAuthor and former politician Upton Sinclair sure thought at least democrats were that gullible. In 1951, referring to his own experience running for public office after switching from the Socialist Party to the Democrat Party he said, \u201cThe American people will take socialism, but they won\u2019t take the label. I certainly proved it... Running on the Socialist ticket I got 60,000 votes, and running on the slogan to \u2019End Poverty in California\u2019 I got 879,000.\u201d Sinclair tricked 819,000 people, err, democrats into voting for him simply by switching labels and tweaking his message.\n\nThe same kind of message tweaking is taking place regarding our sick economy. The economy\u2019s bad with GDP\u2019s growth historically low. Of course, we should ignore just-released GDP figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis reflecting that seven years of \u201cyes we can\u201d effectively turned us into a nation of \u201cno we can\u2019t.\u201d Can\u2019t make it economically, that is.\n\nI know. At this point, we should pause for a moment of silence to remember what Obama inherited. Okay, but let\u2019s also remember what President Ronald Reagan inherited. If Obama inherited the Great Recession, then Reagan inherited the Great-Great Recession with higher unemployment, inflation and interest rates. Reaganomics rocked the economy while Obama\u2019s economy\u2019s on the rocks. It\u2019s no wonder that the American entrepreneurial survivalist spirit has risen from the ash heap, motivating people to do whatever it takes to pay bills. Or put something on the table besides the First Lady\u2019s recommended daily servings of grass products or cardboard flavored entrees school kids regularly toss into trash bins.\n\nWith good jobs scarce, many hard working folks are doing whatever they can to make ends meet, including working for a ride-sharing service called Uber, which brings together willing and ready drivers and needy, paying customers. A 21st century solution that has the progressive left up in arms, declaring war against organizations like Uber. Let\u2019s not forget how pro-entrepreneurship democrats were back in 2010 when Nancy Pelosi channeled her best Ayn Rand while promoting Obamacare, promising it was the gateway to a brave new entrepreneurial world offering \u201can economy where people could be an artist or a photographer...without worry about keeping their day job.\u201d Hail-hail Obamacare! Who knew how right she was? Last year, the Congressional Budget Office reported the equivalent of 2.5 million people won\u2019t need to \u201cworry about keeping their day jobs\u201d because Obamacare\u2019s killing them. Consequently, people need jobs like Uber.\n\nNevertheless, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when far-left extremists like New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declares war against Uber, disregarding that Uber improves workers\u2019 lives and meets a need for a large swath of the population who appreciate efficiency and value. Drivers could do something more productive like waiting in welfare lines, which may give them time to come up with an answer to the question Ms. Wasserman Schultz refuses to address. Here\u2019s a hint: There is no difference except that most self-declared socialists are honest enough to admit it.\n\nSusan Stamper Brown Susan\u2019s is a recovering political pundit from Alaska, who does her best to make sense of current day events using her faith.
