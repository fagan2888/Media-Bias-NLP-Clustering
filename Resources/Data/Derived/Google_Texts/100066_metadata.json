A video of the birthday salute will be sent to Rubik.\n\nIn all, 10 contestants baked and crafted Rubik's Cube-inspired creations of various shapes and sizes. But they all had one thing in common \u2014 the iconic cube.\n\nThe centerpiece was the Carlo's cake, a three-layer Rubik's Cube with a revolving top layer.\n\nA panel of judges \u2014 Castano, Hoffman and speed cubing champion Anthony Brooks \u2014 chose the winning entries in the business and individual categories and a vote of visitors at the LSC today decided the \"people's choice\" award.\n\nCarmen Rosa's Bakery, 37 Coles St. in Jersey City, earned the business category trophy for its four-layer cake that included two Rubik's Cubes and the number 70, for Rubik's age.\n\nThe winner for individual design was Dawn Feminello of Jersey City, who baked a cake consisting of four Rubik's cubes. The cake read \"Rubik's Cube\" and had a \"70\" on the top cube.\n\nFeminello said she was shocked that she won because she entered the contest for fun.\n\n\"I just did it for the fun of it, but it's a cool idea, cool concept, so I'm very happy that I was chosen,\" Feminello said.\n\nThe people's choice winner was Gluten Free Gloriously, a gluten-free bakery in Stirling that made a cake called \"Rubik's Touches the World\" \u2014 the base was a map of the world, while the rest of the cake was made of Rubik's Cubes.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Nicolas Fernandes | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "liberty-science-center", "title": "Rubik's birthday celebrated with cake-off at Liberty Science Center", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Rubik\\u0027s birthday celebrated with cake-off at Liberty Science Center\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/07/rubiks_birthday_celebrated_wit.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/07/11/15390743-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13389581\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-12T07:00:44Z\", \"author\": \"Nicolas Fernandes | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"liberty-science-center\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/07/11/15390743-small.jpg", "description": "People across the world have been paying tribute to Erno Rubik on his 70th birthday by baking Rubik's Cube-inspired cakes and sending him pictures.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, July 12, 2014,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/07/11/15390743-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"NicolasFernandes\", \"author_nickname\": \"Nicolas Fernandes | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11804890\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "People across the world have been paying tribute to Erno Rubik on his 70th birthday by baking Rubik's Cube-inspired cakes and sending him pictures.", "title": "Rubik's birthday celebrated with cake-off at Liberty Science Center", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/07/rubiks_birthday_celebrated_wit.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, July 12, 2014,  3:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "People across the world have been paying tribute to Erno Rubik on his 70th birthday by baking Rubik's Cube-inspired cakes and sending him pictures."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16f1\"", "article_summary": "\"The thing about Rubik's Cube is that it inspired people in all sorts of unexpected ways in the 40 years it has existed,\" Liberty Science Center Paul Hoffman said.\nContestants and attendees sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Rubik and had a slice of birthday cake donated by Carlo's City Hall Bake Shop of \"Cake Boss\" fame.\nThe cake read \"Rubik's Cube\" and had a \"70\" on the top cube.\nThe \"Great Beyond Rubik's Cube Cake-Off\" was held to salute Rubik and the fact that the creator of the gizmo was not on hand did little to dampen the festivities.\nThe centerpiece was the Carlo's cake, a three-layer Rubik's Cube with a revolving top layer."}
