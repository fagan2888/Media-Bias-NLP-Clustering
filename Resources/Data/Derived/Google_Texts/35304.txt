WASHINGTON (MEDIA GENERAL) – While most polls have focused on who’s leading the Democratic and Republican presidential race, new data also suggests how candidates should tailor their campaigns to better connect with voters in their own party.

Republican voter concerns

A Quinnipiac University poll, released before Christmas, asked Republican voters to discuss what issues matter most to them when choosing their GOP nominee.

The results:

Terrorism: 30%

Economy: 27%

Immigration: 11%

Foreign Policy: 10%

Democratic voter concerns

The same survey, which included responses from 462 Democrats, asked liberal voters to discuss what issues matter most to them when choosing their party’s nominee.

The results:

Economy: 34%

Foreign Policy: 14%

Terrorism: 10%

Healthcare: 10%

The ‘X-Factor’

When it comes to presidential campaigns, it doesn’t take much to force a candidate off message. Whether it be a scandal, an ideological disagreement, or a national story the candidates have to be ready for anything.

The recent terrorist attacks in California and France had voters re-thinking how concerned they are over national security.

A New York Times / CBS News poll showed a double digit increase in the last year when it came to how much voters are concerned with terrorism:

December 2015: 14%

September 2014: 3%
