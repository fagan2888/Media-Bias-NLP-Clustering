Shocked and confused, I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Throughout my life, I had heard about undocumented immigrants from TV and from friends and family. I didn\u2019t realize I was one of them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not able to legally work in this country, file taxes, get any financial aid for college, or apply for public housing.\u201d\n\nI was furious. \u201cWhy am I just finding this out now?\u201d\n\nThat was a year and a half ago, and I had been in foster care for four years. This was not the only bombshell I\u2019d get before aging out of care. I turned 21 as I was writing this story, and my son just turned 7. I need to support him and I need a home for us. I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to do so.\n\nMy grandmother is my most responsible relative, though that is not saying much. When I turned 19, my foster care social worker asked my grandmother for my documents to prepare me for aging out. My grandmother told her I had no documents.\n\nI was born in the Dominican Republic and came here when I was 6 years old. I knew I was not born in the United States, but I assumed the adults in my life had done the paperwork to make me a legal resident. For the 13 years I\u2019d been in the United States, neither my mother nor grandmother bothered to get my immigration status resolved.\n\nMy social worker was also upset, asking why my grandmother would wait so long to tell her I had no documents. My grandmother said she thought that my mother had told my foster care workers that I was illegal.\n\nHow This Happened\n\nOne of the reasons I didn\u2019t know I was undocumented is that I had a Social Security number and card, which I had successfully used to get two different retail jobs.\n\nMy brother and I had each received a temporary Social Security number and card when we first arrived in the U.S., when I was 6 and he was 4. My mother applied for our papers, but she did not keep up with the process. (She married someone soon after she got here, so she didn\u2019t have to worry about her own status.) She stopped answering her mail, so our application was dismissed and our Social Security numbers were no longer valid. Yet nobody told me that.\n\nMy brother was able to obtain his green card and Social Security number because he did not have a criminal record. But I had been locked up for a fight and had to get paperwork from court saying that any case I had was dismissed.\n\nThe social worker let me know that I was right to worry. She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have much time. Everything has to be done fast. We have to submit an application for your green card, which is not easy.\u201d She continued, \u201cYou have to meet with an immigration lawyer, we have to get your birth certificate, your son\u2019s birth certificate, your passport, proof of address, proof that you\u2019re in foster care, and your GED certificate. Also, we have to go to court and get a letter from a judge, then submit it with the application and get a TB shot and check-up from an immigration doctor.\u201d\n\nI was overwhelmed. This sounded like so much work and the clock was ticking.\n\nScary Future\n\nI\u2019ve heard people who have aged out of care complain that the foster care system did nothing for them. Once you\u2019re 21, you\u2019re on your own. I got an exception to policy from ACS to stay in my foster home for an extra six months, so I wouldn\u2019t be on the street on my 21st birthday. But after that, my son and I don\u2019t have a place to live and I can\u2019t legally work to support us.\n\nIf I work without having the proper documentation, I could get deported or lose my chances of getting my green card. I can\u2019t apply for housing because I\u2019m not a legal resident. I have a better chance at getting an apartment in public housing if I am applying through foster care, but that ends at age 21. It all seemed so scary. I felt hopeless.\n\n[Related: Represent: A Magazine for Foster Kids by Foster Kids]\n\nI had no time to spare. My foster care lawyers got in contact with the immigration lawyer to explain my case and start the process. The immigration lawyer was honest with me. She said we had to submit the application for a green card before I was 21. For a foster child, it usually takes about six months to get a temporary Social and green card, which was all I needed to work and apply for housing. If you\u2019re applying as an adult, it can take a year or more depending on your case.\n\nCollege Dreams Crushed\n\nI got the new NYC ID for people who don\u2019t have their papers and can\u2019t get a state ID.\n\nI also met with the educational worker in my agency. I told her, \u201cTell me the truth about my education situation.\u201d She said that if I didn\u2019t have the documents to apply for the ETV (Education and Training Voucher) and financial aid before I turned 21, I would not qualify.\n\nThat was difficult to hear because college is expensive. I had worked so hard to get my GED. I knew that to get a high-paying career, I needed to go to college. The fact that I have a son makes it even more important: I need a good income to provide for the two of us. The last thing I wanted was to take out loans and be in debt.\n\nI got my flu shot, TB shot, and an HIV test. I tested negative, and I took all the medical records to the immigration lawyer the next day.\n\nMy immigration lawyer submitted my application. I got my interview with immigration only three months after I applied, which my immigration lawyer said was quick. The immigration lawyer asked me if I\u2019d been fingerprinted yet.\n\nI was confused. I said, \u201cNo, what do you mean?\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cWell, they were supposed to schedule you to go for your fingerprints, and then make the appointment for the interview.\u201d I\u2019d been told to be fingerprinted after I talked to immigration.\n\nAt this point, I was less than a month away from my 21st birthday, so this was terrible news. We went to the interview anyway to see if they would see me, then schedule me for the fingerprints. They told me I couldn\u2019t do the interview until I got the fingerprints done.\n\nI also just learned that when you submit your public housing application, you have to present three or four pay stubs. That is how they determine how much rent you\u2019ll pay.\n\nBut, without the green card, I can\u2019t work! Sometimes it feels like they\u2019re trying to make it hard for me, no matter how much I follow the rules. If the agency had started planning at least three years ago, we could have started the immigration process then. I would have had my documents so that I could have applied for housing when I was 18 or 19. Yet here I was turning 21 in a week with no job, no apartment to live in, unable to go to school, and waiting on my green card and Social Security card.\n\nNo Health Insurance Either!\n\nUnbelievably, as I was writing this story, it got worse. The week of my 21st birthday, my social worker told me that the Medicaid provided to me by ACS would no longer cover my son or me. Under Obamacare, Medicaid is available to foster youth who age out up through age 26, but you have to re-apply; you don\u2019t automatically stay covered. I would have to re-apply for Medicaid on my own, and in the meantime, I have no health insurance. I have braces that cost a couple thousand dollars. Recently, I had an orthodontist appointment and they told me they could not see me since my Medicaid was not active.\n\nEven scarier, my son has no health insurance. If I have to take him to the doctor, I can\u2019t pay for any visits or medications he might need.\n\nIt\u2019s overwhelming. I thought when my social worker said I would get an exception to policy (allowing me to stay in foster care another six months) that everything would continue as normal. Yet the only thing that stayed the same is my foster mother getting checks for me and my son.\n\nPrepare Teens in Care\n\nIf I had known all of this earlier, I would have been on top of it. I could have applied for housing and food stamps. I could have applied for Medicaid for my son and me before the Medicaid that ACS provided was deactivated.\n\nNow here I am trying to solve it all, but so much is happening all at once. It is as if I have my own cloud above my head pouring rain on me. No matter what I do I feel like I can\u2019t get out from under it. I\u2019m trying to take it all in, stay positive, and do everything I need to do, but I\u2019m scared I could break down and shut down.\n\nWhen kids in care turn 16, they should be told to start planning for the aging-out process. What documents do they need? What paperwork needs to be filled out? What are the deadlines and how long will the process take? If you were born outside the U.S., do not assume you are legal, even if you have held a job. Everyone who is in foster care should be made aware of these important things.\n\nTurning 21 shouldn\u2019t be so stressful and scary. I\u2019m realistic about foster care. I\u2019ve known I can\u2019t do what other people can: take their time and live with their parents until they are stable. If I\u2019d known what I had to do to become a U.S. citizen, I\u2019d have done it.\n\nThe author wrote this story as a teenager participating at Youth Communication, a New York City-based nonprofit that helps educators engage struggling youth and build their social, emotional and literacy skills.
