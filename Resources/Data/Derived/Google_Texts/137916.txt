Age: 26

Occupation: Singer/songwriter at Nick O'Connor Productions and day program professional at Sample Supports.

Years in St. Vrain Valley: All in all, it has been around about 12. I grew up here from age 10-20, then moved to Denver for a few years, and came back at age 24.

What brought you here? What has kept you here? The support of the community brought me back. I really believe that I could not do what I am doing here in Longmont anywhere else. There are a lot of people here working very hard to make this community thrive in the arts and in small business. People are very into locally made products here, and it has been an honor to watch people become interested in what I have to offer.

How did you get into music? I moved to Longmont in '98 and didn't have many friends. I was more into the Colorado Avalanche and the Denver Broncos than I was into music. My parents went to a home church group, and I remember being attracted to the vibrations of the man's guitar who played there.

What are your thoughts on the Longmont music scene? I don't want to be anywhere else. I believe that we have a lot of work to do, but that's what makes it exciting. It will be interesting to see how it grows in the next five years. A lot of people are releasing records to wide acclaim. I find it amazing that this is happening here. The right people are here, making this thing go.
