RENO, NV - At H&R Block on Wells Avenue, tax preparers are gearing up for what will be a challenging tax season.

Just last week here in the Truckee Meadows, the company set up a free informational seminar for anyone who had questions about the Affordable Health Care Act. A total of 70 people showed up.

Dena Wiberg says H & R Block has devoted a new computer program to help her estimate how much you may owe or get back depending upon your health insurance this year.

“If you've gone though Nevada Health Link, Access to Healthcare, any of those will provide you with a document that you will need to complete your taxes. Most insurance companies will reflect on your W2 for if you have insurance through your workplace or that type of thing,” says Wiberg, who is the office manager at the Wells Avenue office.

For those who thought they'd only have to pay $95 if they didn't buy insurance? Wilberg says that's only partially true.

It could be $95 per adult member of your household claimed on your tax return and $47.50 for dependents under 18 OR 1% of the household taxable income--whichever amount is greater.

For those who overestimated what they made in 2013 for 2014 health insurance, they may receive a tax return.

For those whose income status changed during the year and they didn't make changes in their health insurance, they could get a refund or owe money.

For those who underestimated their income and received a government subsidy in 2014 to pay for health insurance, they may owe the government money.

Wiberg says you can stop by the office and get a free estimate if you'll owe money this year because of the Affordable Health Care Act.

All you will need to bring is your last paycheck stub of 2014.

For those who don't have health insurance over the next two years, the penalties are only going to increase. In 2015 instead of 95 dollars, it will go to $325 per adult or 2%.

In 2016 it jumps to $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater.
