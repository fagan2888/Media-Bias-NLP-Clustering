The move, which has been pushed by hedge fund 3G Capital, will reduce Kraft Heinz\u2019s open-ended liability to its retirees, which should keep shareholders happy.\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/hannahgleg\n\nBut for the ex-employees, the sudden change in their retirement benefits is akin to scoring a game-winning touchdown, only to have it arbitrarily called back.\n\n(My beloved TCU Horned Frogs are contending for the championship this year, so I feel that football metaphors are appropriate. \u201cMoving the goalpost\u201d is originally a British soccer analogy, but who\u2019s counting?)\n\nKraft Heinz claims that the new retirement benefits will be \u201cequal or better\u201d than traditional group coverage at a \u201csimilar or even lower cost.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see about that.\n\nIt might end up being true, but in my experience, paying more and getting less in health coverage via the \u201cObamacare\u201d exchanges has trained me to be a little skeptical. And for baby boomers in or near retirement, this move should be downright terrifying.\n\nWhat to Do About Your Retirement Benefits\n\nThink about it. When you are still in your prime working years, a sudden increase in the cost of your health insurance is inconvenient but manageable: You still have a regular salary coming in, and you can make adjustments to your other living expenses or to your savings rate to balance the books.\n\nAll of this flexibility goes out the window once you start retirement. Unless you are wealthy (and even if you are wealthy), matching your expenses and liabilities to your income becomes critical. Your income is generally fixed with Social Security, bond interest and stock dividends, annuity payments or, if you\u2019re lucky, a pension.\n\nWhen you were working, you\u2019d generally get a salary boost every couple of years to cover any increased living expenses. In retirement, that\u2019s just not the case. If you suddenly have an increase in expenses that outstrip your current income, you run the very real risk of burning through your savings and being left flat broke.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Kraft Heinz is wrong for shifting the risk of paying for retirement benefits to its retirees. I\u2019ve often made the argument that tying health insurance to employment makes little sense, and it is a historical quirk of the tax code and of the wage caps that were in place during World War II. By tying health and retirement benefits to employment, you raise the cost of starting a new business and generally make it harder to switch jobs.\n\nBut I digress. It really doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s right or wrong. The fact is, it\u2019s happening; and if your retirement plan depends on your ex-employer continuing to pay for your benefits, you might need to rethink a few things.\n\nMy advice? Don\u2019t depend on anyone but yourself. Assume that employer or ex-employer will throw you to the wolves.\n\nAs a practical action plan, I recommend the following:\n\nSit down and do a thorough assessment of your retirement income sources, including social security, any annuities and pensions you might have and your investment portfolio. Use very modest assumptions on the investment portfolio because there is no guarantee that bond or CD yields will be any higher than they are today. Take the dollar figure from No. 1 and slash it by 25% for good measure. This gives you a modest margin of safety in the event that any of your income sources are reduced. Do a realistic budget of your retirement expenses, including medical costs not covered by Medicare. Take your estimate of medical costs and insurance costs and double them.\n\nIf your reduced income estimate doesn\u2019t cover your expanded expense estimate, then you might want to make some lifestyle changes.\n\nThat\u2019s not fun.\n\nBut the earlier you make the adjustment, the less likely you are to have to make more drastic cuts later.\n\nCharles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, is the chief investment officer of investment firm Sizemore Capital Management.
