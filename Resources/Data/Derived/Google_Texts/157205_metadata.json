Beyond the near term, real GDP was expected to increase slightly faster than in the previous forecast, largely reflecting a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices and a lower assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending. The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff\u2019s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period; the staff\u2019s estimate of the natural rate was revised down slightly in this forecast.\n\n\"The staff\u2019s forecast for inflation over the first half of the year was revised up somewhat, reflecting recent increases in the price of crude oil as well as stronger-than-expected data on core consumer prices early in the year.\n\nThe staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years, as energy prices and the prices of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising later this year. Beyond 2016, the forecast was a bit lower than the previous projection, primarily reflecting a flatter expected path for crude oil prices. As a result, inflation was projected still to be slightly below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2018.\n\n\"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff\u2019s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; in addition, global economic prospects were still seen as an important downside risk to the forecast.\n\nConsistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were still seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down, and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially, which would put additional downward pressure on inflation.\"\n\nJAN 26-27 FOMC: Minutes released on Feb. 17:\n\n\"In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been markedly slower than in the forecast for the December meeting. However, the medium-term projection for real GDP growth was only slightly lower, on balance, than the previous forecast. The staff estimated that the negative effects of a lower projected path for equity prices and a higher assumed trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar would be mostly offset by the positive effects of a lower path for crude oil prices and slightly more stimulus to aggregate demand from changes in fiscal policy than was assumed in the previous forecast. In particular, federal legislation enacted in December unexpectedly included both a multiyear extension of the bonus depreciation tax credit for business investment and a delay in the introduction of several tax increases related to the Affordable Care Act. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, sup-ported primarily by increases in consumer spending. The unemployment rate was expected to gradually decline further and to run somewhat below the staff\u2019s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.\n\n\"The staff\u2019s forecast for inflation in the near term was revised down slightly, reflecting recent data for consumer prices and the further declines in the price of crude oil; the projection for inflation over the medium term was little revised. Energy prices and the prices of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising later this year. The staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years and reach the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective of 2 percent by the end of 2018.\n\n\"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its January projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff\u2019s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad. Consistent with the downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially further, which would put downward pressure on inflation.\"\n\nDEC 15-16 FOMC: Minutes released on Jan. 6:\n\n\"In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was little changed, on net, relative to the projection for the October meeting. The staff\u2019s medium-term projection for real GDP growth was revised up slightly, on balance, from the previous forecast, primarily because the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was anticipated to lead to somewhat higher federal government purchases. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending.\n\nThe unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to run somewhat below the staff\u2019s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.\n\n\"The staff\u2019s forecast for inflation was revised down slightly in the near term in response to recent data for consumer prices and the further decline in the price of crude oil; over the medium term, the projection was little revised. Energy prices and prices of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising next year. The staff projected that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years and reach the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective of 2 percent by the end of 2018.\n\n\"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted somewhat to the downside, reflecting the staff\u2019s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was currently well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks. Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as skewed somewhat to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as weighted to the downside, reflecting\n\nthe possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down and that the foreign exchange value of the dollar could rise substantially further, which would put downward pressure on inflation.\"\n\nOCT 27-28 FOMC: Minutes released on Nov. 18:\n\n\"In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was a little lower, on balance, than in the projection for the September meeting, largely reflecting a downward revision to estimated inventory investment. The staff\u2019s medium-term projection for real GDP growth was essentially unrevised from the previous forecast. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output from 2016 through 2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending. The unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and to run a little below the staff\u2019s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.\n\n\"The staff\u2019s forecast for inflation in the near term was revised up a little, reflecting recent data, and it was unrevised over the medium term. Energy prices and prices of non-energy imported goods were expected to begin steadily rising next year. The staff projected that inflation would increase gradually over the next several years but would still be slightly below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective of 2 percent at the end of 2018. However, inflation was anticipated to reach 2 percent thereafter, with inflation expectations in the longer run assumed to be consistent with the Committee\u2019s objective and slack in labor and product markets projected to have waned.\n\n\"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its October projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff\u2019s assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks. Consistent with this downside risk to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The following are the Federal Reserve's staff forecasts as contained in the minutes of recent Federal Open Market Committee meetings:", "title": "Factbox: Fed staff forecasts from FOMC minutes", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - Markets", "sailthru.tags": "US, FED, MINUTES, FACTBOX", "sailthru.title": "Factbox: Fed staff forecasts from FOMC minutes", "keywords": "US,FED,MINUTES,FACTBOX,Reports,United States,US Government News,Corporate Events,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Economic Events,US Federal Reserve", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;FED;MINUTES;FACTBOX;Reports;United States;US Government News;Corporate Events;Central Banks / Central Bank Events;Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers;Economic Events;US Federal Reserve", "DCSext.ContentID_ousivMolt": "USKCN0X32QB", "WT.cg_n": "Markets", "sailthru.description": "The following are the Federal Reserve's staff forecasts as contained in the minutes of recent Federal Open Market Committee meetings:", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "ousivMolt", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-06T22:44:33+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "topNews;newsOne;businessNews;gc05;ousivMolt;SustainabilitySocial;everything;forexNewsCopy;ShellEnergy;AllianzInvestments;Hyundai;Allianz;newsproHome;audib2b;davosBackup;cfaglobal;aa48hours;shipping;nonegative;dassaultuk;ubs;Intel;PFG;centralBanks;factbox;Fidelity2014;LinkedInBusTech;CathayPacific_US;MSFTOne_UK;MOC_US_2015-16;USWire;hsbcDubai", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Factbox%3A+Fed+staff+forecasts+from+FOMC+minutes", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKCN0X32QB", "WT.cg_s": "Markets", "description": "The following are the Federal Reserve's staff forecasts as contained in the minutes of recent Federal Open Market Committee meetings:", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 2, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-ousivMolt", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "The following are the Federal Reserve's staff forecasts as contained in the minutes of recent Federal Open Market Committee meetings:", "title": "Factbox: Fed staff forecasts from FOMC minutes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fed-minutes-factbox-idUSKCN0X32QB", "article": {"section": "Markets", "tag": "US,FED,MINUTES,FACTBOX,Reports,United States,US Government News,Corporate Events,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Economic Events,US Federal Reserve", "published_time": "2016-04-06T22:44:33+0000", "modified_time": "2016-04-06T22:44:33+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Apr 06 22:44:33 UTC 2016", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "article_summary": "However, the medium-term projection for real GDP growth was only slightly lower, on balance, than the previous forecast.\n\"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.\nThe staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, sup-ported primarily by increases in consumer spending.\n\"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its October projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.\nThe staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a somewhat faster pace than potential output in 2016 through 2018, supported primarily by increases in consumer spending."}
