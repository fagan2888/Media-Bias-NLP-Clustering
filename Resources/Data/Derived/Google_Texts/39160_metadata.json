Just for fun, she put together a \u201cmash-up mix\u201d of two songs: \u201cBattle Scars\u201d by Lupe Fiasco and Guy Sebastian and \u201cThe Scientist\u201d by Coldplay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so psyched with it,\u201d Shiffrin said Sunday with typical exuberance. \u201cIt\u2019s playing all day in my head.\u201d\n\nThe talented teen had no problem falling asleep Saturday night but woke up at 2 a.m. and every hour after that, raring to go.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Is it time to race yet?\u2019 \u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI was really excited, but I slept very well.\u201d\n\nShiffrin raced exceptionally well Sunday. Having established herself last season as the best women\u2019s slalom racer in the world, Shiffrin claimed her first giant slalom podium, finishing second to Jessica Lindell-Vikarby of Sweden by .09 of a second. Tina Weirather of Liechtenstien was third.\n\n\u201cIt was a really great day, and I\u2019m happy with it, for sure,\u201d said Shiffrin, 18. \u201cI came into the season hoping to improve my GS standings, so I\u2019m in the process of doing that. I\u2019m always hoping for a win, but focused on my skiing. I\u2019ve never really focused on the results, because that\u2019ll get in my head.\n\n\u201cI have a pretty good balance in the starting gate, knowing exactly what I need to think about in my skiing to get down the hill fast. It\u2019s nice to be on the podium and have that gauge of where I stand with everybody else.\u201d\n\nShiffrin\u2019s teammates performed poorly in three races over the weekend, looking like they weren\u2019t ready to race on such a technically demanding hill in front of a home crowd, but Shiffrin has already distinguished herself as a racer with a knack for performing under pressure. And as always, she raced with joy.\n\n\u201cI was in the starting gate and I was like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, can\u2019t you just let me go already?\u2019 \u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cTwo minutes before you go, I was like, \u2018OK, calm down, save it for your run.\u2019 I finally was able to go, and I just couldn\u2019t get going fast enough. It felt exactly as I imagined it would feel.\u201d\n\nShiffrin\u2019s father, Jeff, said her podium breakthrough in GS was one of those \u201cmoments that take your breath away.\u201d Now his daughter will be regarded as a medal contender in slalom and GS at the Sochi Olympics, not only because of her results but her remarkable poise, too.\n\n\u201cI would imagine the nerves are getting better as she realizes that, in fact, she really does belong,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cNo matter how good the results have been up to now, there\u2019s still the sense of, \u2018Wow, do I really belong here?\u2019 She\u2019s got the confidence of a couple of years, and really good support around her.\u201d\n\nAfter two days of watching U.S. Ski Team athletes disappoint the home crowd in downhill and super-G, chief executive Bill Marolt was thrilled to see the team\u2019s precocious phenom come up big.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, she\u2019s a great athlete, this doesn\u2019t happen if you\u2019re not a great athlete,\u201d Marolt said. \u201cBut she has the tenacity, she has that mental edge to her that just drives her. And she works hard.\n\n\u201cWhen she gets in that gate, she knows what she\u2019s going to do and she makes herself do it. Regardless if the light is good or bad, if she\u2019s tired or where she\u2019s running (in the start order). The good ones, they will it.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nMen\u2019s world cup at Beaver Creek\n\nTuesday-Thursday: Downhill training, 11 a.m.\n\nFriday: Super-G race, 10:45 a.m.\n\nSaturday: Downhill race, 11 a.m.\n\nSunday: Giant slalom race, 9:45 a.m. and 12:45 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin, Colorado teenager, claims World Cup podium at Beaver Creek", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin, Colorado teenager, claims World Cup podium at Beaver Creek", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/mikaela-shiffrin-colorado-teenager-claims-world-cup-podium-at-beaver-creek/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131201__mikaela-shiffrin-beaver-creek2-120113p1.jpg", "height": 462}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131201__mikaela-shiffrin-beaver-creek2-120113p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-01T14:07:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:22:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae6a\"", "article_summary": "Having established herself last season as the best women\u2019s slalom racer in the world, Shiffrin claimed her first giant slalom podium, finishing second to Jessica Lindell-Vikarby of Sweden by .09 of a second.\nRegardless if the light is good or bad, if she\u2019s tired or where she\u2019s running (in the start order).\nBEAVER CREEK \u2014 On the eve of her first opportunity to compete in a World Cup on her hometown mountain, Mikaela Shiffrin had a relaxing evening, playing around on a piano in her bedroom.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Is it time to race yet?\u2019 \u201d Shiffrin said.\nThe good ones, they will it.\u201dJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyerMen\u2019s world cup at Beaver CreekTuesday-Thursday: Downhill training, 11 a.m.Friday: Super-G race, 10:45 a.m.Saturday: Downhill race, 11 a.m.Sunday: Giant slalom race, 9:45 a.m. and 12:45 p.m."}
