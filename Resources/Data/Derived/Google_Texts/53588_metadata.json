The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index, a monthly gauge of factory activity, fell from 50.1 in October to 48.6 last month. A reading below 50 indicates manufacturing activity is contracting, and this is the first time that\u2019s happened since November 2012. It\u2019s also the weakest reading since June 2009.\n\nThe index remains solidly above the level that would indicate another recession, but the disappointing reading \u2014 hurt by a strong U.S. dollar, businesses seeking to correct an inventory glut, low oil prices and the consequent pullback in spending by energy companies \u2014 is still grim.\n\nRelated: Why Most U.S. Manufacturing Jobs Are Gone Forever\n\n\u201cThe manufacturing sector remains in a funk,\u201d Michael Montgomery, an economist with IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients. That\u2019s true globally. \u201cThe manufacturing sector is suffering from a bad case of the blahs worldwide; some countries are firming from tepid to less tepid and others are in modest retreat, but worldwide PMI scores are hovering around 50 due to anemic global demand for goods,\u201d Montgomery added.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing sector\u2019s problems aren\u2019t new \u2026 and they aren\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon. \u201cThe November word of the month is \u2018forgettable,\u2019 as malaise has lingered in manufacturing for so long that purchasing folks have started to nod off from boredom,\u201d Montgomery wrote. \u201cThe bad news is that the tedium will persist well into 2016 (probably until spring), and provide a long hibernation for manufacturing to forget the eminently forgettable close of 2015 and start to 2016.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news: Manufacturing now represents a relatively small segment of the U.S. economy \u2014 just 12 percent, and less than 10 percent of total employment \u2014 and the other 88 percent of the economy is doing much better. Witness today\u2019s data showing construction spending near an eight-year high and car sales, forecast to have had the best November on record, still on pace for a record year.\n\nRelated: Why Black Friday Is Now a Huge Day for Car Buying\n\n\u201cThe services sector is 5.6 times bigger than manufacturing, which is why the industrial downshift is being accompanied by a continued rapid fall in unemployment,\u201d economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics pointed out Tuesday. Plus, as Shepherdson noted, many of the factors dragging down manufacturing activity \u2014 cheap oil and gas, the strong dollar \u2014 also help consumers.\n\nEconomist Harm Bandholz of UniCredit says that the yawning gap between the service and manufacturing sectors is highlighted by the difference between the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s indices for manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity, which is now the largest on record. You can see that spread in the black and blue lines in the chart below.\n\n\u201cOverall, the data releases this morning illustrate that while the dollar\u2019s sharp rise over the past 15 months continues to weigh heavily on the manufacturing sector, the rest of the economy is doing fine,\u201d writes Steve Murphy of Capital Economics. \u201cThis is beginning to look very much like a repeat of the mid-1990s, when a sharp rise in the dollar also pushed the ISM manufacturing index well below the 50 mark, yet headline GDP growth remained close to 3 percent.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing malaise in manufacturing doesn\u2019t mean the broader U.S. economy has to suffer the same fate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S. manufacturing just had its worst month since the Great Recession.", "title": "U.S. Manufacturing Tumbles Toward Recession \u2014 and It Doesn\u2019t Matter Much", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/01/US-Manufacturing-Tumbles-Toward-Recession-and-It-Doesn-t-Matter-Much", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12012011_Manufacturing_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/01/US-Manufacturing-Tumbles-Toward-Recession-and-It-Doesn-t-Matter-Much", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12012011_Manufacturing_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "U.S. manufacturing just had its worst month since the Great Recession.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A reading below 50 indicates manufacturing activity is contracting, and this is the first time that\u2019s happened since November 2012.\nRelated: Why Most U.S. Manufacturing Jobs Are Gone Forever\u201cThe manufacturing sector remains in a funk,\u201d Michael Montgomery, an economist with IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients.\nPlus, as Shepherdson noted, many of the factors dragging down manufacturing activity \u2014 cheap oil and gas, the strong dollar \u2014 also help consumers.\nU.S. manufacturing just had its worst month since the Great Recession.\nThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index, a monthly gauge of factory activity, fell from 50.1 in October to 48.6 last month."}
