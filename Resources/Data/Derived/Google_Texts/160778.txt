Senate panel introduces bill to combat tax refund fraud

The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled on Wednesday to take up a new bill that would beef up the government’s ability to fight tax refund fraud by identity thieves. But another provision in the bill, according to John D. McKinnon of the Wall Street Journal, would give the IRS the ability to regulate paid tax preparers, whom lawmakers say are another big source of problems. A bill summary cites “substantial evidence indicating that incompetent and unethical tax return preparers are harming both their clients and the government.” [Remember: The courts ruled, in Loving v. IRS, that the IRS does not have the legal authority to regulate tax return preparers in the United States.] McKinnon wrote that the bill is being pushed by both Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and the committee’s top Democrat, Ron Wyden (D-OR), and is likely to move through the panel relatively smoothly.

Got a $100 million tax bill? Your check is no good at the IRS

Stephen Ohlemacher of the Associated Press wrote that starting next year, your check won’t be any good at the IRS – if you’re making a tax payment of $100 million or more. The IRS says it will reject all checks for more than $99,999,999 because check-processing equipment at the nation’s Federal Reserve banks can’t handle checks that big. Checks of $100 million or more have to be processed by hand, increasing the risk of theft, fraud, and errors, according to a pair of memos from the IRS and the US Treasury Department. As a result, the richest among us will have to wire their tax payments electronically or write multiple checks for less than $100 million apiece. The Fed says federal agencies have been prohibited from depositing checks of $100 million or more for years. But this year, the IRS accepted 14 checks for more than $99,999,999.

Excise tax on ‘Cadillac’ plans pegged at $3 billion

The Columbus Dispatch recently surveyed several of the largest employers in central Ohio about their potential tax liability for high-cost health plans. In 2018, the excise tax on high-cost plans, called the “Cadillac tax,” will take effect and is expected to cost US employers about $3 billion, according to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service. The state of Ohio could potentially owe $600,000 in excise taxes in 2021, with that liability potentially growing to $241.1 million by 2030 if no changes were made, according to an article by Ben Sutherly. Ohio State University doesn’t expect to trigger the Cadillac tax. But for the current benefits year, the university doubled deductibles for its Prime Care Advantage plan to $200 for single coverage and $600 for family coverage in order to create a bit more breathing room. Under a worst-case scenario, the tax could cost the city of Columbus $5.3 million to $8.1 million in 2018.

Dewey & LeBoeuf case expected to go to jury soon

Jurors soon will begin deliberating the fate of three former Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP executives, accused of fraudulently propping up the once-storied law firm’s finances in the years ahead of its stunning 2012 collapse, wrote Sara Randazzo of the Wall Street Journal. Prosecutors have made a final bid to convince jurors that Dewey’s ex-chairman, Steven Davis, and former executive director, Stephen DiCarmine, sat atop an alleged scheme to defraud the firm’s banks and creditors. The pair enlisted the third defendant, Dewey’s former CFO, Joel Sanders, who then roped in lower-level finance department employees, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Peirce Moser said in his closing remarks on Sept. 11. The case will go to the jury on Wednesday and will likely turn on the credibility of seven cooperating witnesses and how jurors interpret emails sent by the defendants that prosecutors say show criminal intent.
