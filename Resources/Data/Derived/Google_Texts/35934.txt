The disparity of topics of American political advertisements

AMERICAN politics may be highly polarised, but the themes of advertisements by candidates in the mid-term elections are less so. The most popular topic for both parties is health care. Americans across the country will be bombarded with more than a quarter of a million ad placements, or “spots”, on both general health-care issues and anti-Obamacare themes specifically (mainly run by Republicans, though several thousand from the president’s own party too). The next biggest area of consensus is the economy. Both Democrats and Republicans are pumping out around 60,000 spots apiece about jobs. Likewise, both parties are essentially matched when it comes to ads about the budget. The area where Democrats are running considerably more spots than Republicans is around energy and the environment. Altogether, more than 700,000 spots will carry the parties’ messages to the American electorate. The only sure winner is the media collecting the ad revenue.
