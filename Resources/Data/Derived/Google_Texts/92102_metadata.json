For employees hired on or after Jan. 1, it will increase to $450 for an individual and $900 for a family, according to the agreement.\n\nFurthermore, benefits include 100 percent of coinsurance for network benefits, and employee\u2019s share of premium costs will decrease from 12 percent to 10 percent.\n\nThe shift to an up-front deductible was a \u201cdifficult change\u201d for teachers to get behind, school board President Peter Yarnell said in a follow-up interview Tuesday afternoon, stating that the decrease in premium costs was a compromise to address the new deductible requirement.\n\nThe current self-insured disability benefit will be eliminated and replaced by a disability insurance policy provided by a third party. As a result, this will free up the administration that did a lot of the paperwork for those benefits to focus on other things, Yarnell said.\n\nProvisions were also made to decrease teacher work days from 196 to 193 days a year, officials said, as well as for an \u201cexpedited dispute resolution process\u201d if health care benefits become subject to excise taxes under the Affordable Care Act beginning in 2018, which Yarnell said was a very important part of the agreement.\n\n\u201cYou never fully get what you want,\u201d Yarnell said. \u201cThere were things we didn\u2019t get and there were things the teachers didn\u2019t get. You never get all you want, but I think it\u2019s a fair contract.\u201d\n\nPEA President Timothy Deose could not be reached for comment.\n\nAlthough the collective bargaining agreement has been reached with the teachers union, the district is still working on a collective bargaining agreement with the Pennridge Educational Support Personnel Association \u2014 the union that represents groups such as bus drivers, custodians and teachers aids.\n\nReaching an agreement with support staff, Yarnell said, is complex because the PESPA represents a diverse group that has varied interests.\n\nIt has been without a contract for more than two years.\n\nThe district is also working on a standard agreement with the cafeteria employees, who have been without a new agreement since June 2014, Yarnell said.\n\nHe said he is optimistic that in the next month an agreement with both parties will be reached.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Lansdale news, PA news, US news, world news.", "title": "Pennridge School Board unanimously approves teachers contract", "og": {"url": "http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/RO/20151001/NEWS/151009987", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.thereporteronline.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/thereporteronline.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Pennridge School Board unanimously approves teachers contract"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thereporteronline.com", "description": "EAST ROCKHILL >> For approximately 20 months, Pennridge School District teachers have been without a new contract, but all that ended in a 9-0 vote Monday night when the Pennridge School Board approved a new collective bargaining agreement with", "title": "Pennridge School Board unanimously approves teachers contract", "url": "http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/RO/20151001/NEWS/151009987", "image": {"src": "http://local.thereporteronline.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/thereporteronline.png?052016"}, "site": "@lansreporter", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568473750", "iphone": "id525105540", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.reporter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Lansdale news, PA news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "EAST ROCKHILL >> For approximately 20 months, Pennridge School District teachers have been without a new contract, but all that ended in a 9-0 vote Monday night when the Pennridge School Board approved a new collective bargaining agreement with"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac1e\"", "article_summary": "EAST ROCKHILL >> For approximately 20 months, Pennridge School District teachers have been without a new contract, but all that ended in a 9-0 vote Monday night when the Pennridge School Board approved a new collective bargaining agreement with the Pennridge Education Association.\nThe teachers have been without a contract since June 2014, and the new four-year contract covers July 1, 2014, through June 20, 2018.\n\u2022 2016-17 School Year: Teachers will see an estimated 0.07 percent increase.\n\u2022 2015-16 School Year: Teachers will see an estimated 1.61 percent increase.\n\u2022 2017-18 School Year: Teachers will see an estimated 1.26 percent increase."}
