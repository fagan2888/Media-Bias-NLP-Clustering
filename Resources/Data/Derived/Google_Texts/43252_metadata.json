But 10 of those 24 nonprofits reported charity care costs that were less than 1 percent of expenses, indicating that was not the main factor in keeping them in the red.\n\nOn average, the 66 MHA members reported revenue $7.8 million greater than their expenses. Spectrum Health Hospitals, based in Grand Rapids, had $171 million in revenue less expenses \u2014 what would have been reported to the IRS as profit if the hospital network was a for-profit business. Charity care costs at Spectrum equaled 1.1 percent of total expenses in 2012.\n\nBeaumont Health System reported $78 million in revenue less expenses and charity care costs equal to 0.9 percent of total expenses in 2013. In 2012, Borgess Medical Center reported $59 million in revenue less expenses, with charity care costs equal to 2.4 percent of expenses.\n\nMedicaid, while a major revenue stream for most MHA members, is also a strain on care providers because the program pays such low reimbursement rates. The 66 nonprofits reported a total of $2.1 billion as their cost for care of Medicaid patients and $1.7 billion in Medicaid reimbursements, leaving about $400 million in unreimbursed Medicaid costs.\n\nMichigan\u2019s 2014 Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to reduce charity care costs while increasing unreimbursed Medicaid costs.\n\nRuthanne Sudderth, MHA vice president of public affairs, told Watchdog.org the limited hospital data available show \u201ca wide range of changes in their uncompensated levels since 2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn average, we are encouraged by these early results given that Michigan hospitals will forgo nearly $7 billion in reduced future Medicare payments in exchange for expanded health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Sudderth said.\n\nState and federal taxpayers bear the cost of Medicaid reimbursements. The feds pay for 65 percent of traditional Medicaid benefits and 100 percent of Medicaid expansion benefits, for now; the Obamacare expansion match rate is scheduled to gradually drop to 90 percent by 2020.\n\nMedicaid expansion shifts responsibility for care for Michigan\u2019s poor from Michigan hospitals and taxpayers to federal taxpayers by bringing billions in new federal spending to the state. MHA and other expansion advocates emphasized the benefit of this cost-shift in their 2013 campaign for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cMichigan will receive about $2 billion a year from the federal government to pay for the expansion,\u201d Expand Medicaid asserted.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Michigan hospitals end up providing more than $880 million a year in uncompensated care to patients unable to pay, costs that end up being shifted to people who have insurance, employers who pay for it for their workers, and taxpayers,\u201d campaign materials explained.\n\nMHA has pointed to Obamacare cuts in Medicare as a reason for expanding Medicaid, but Congress has repeatedly signaled Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion reimbursement rates will be cut to help slow the growth of the $19 trillion national debt.\n\nPresident Barack Obama vetoed a bill in January that would have repealed Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. And hospitals appear to be counting on Medicaid expansion staying in place permanently.\n\n\u201cThe MHA is confident that the U.S. Congress and the next president will maintain affordable, comprehensive health care coverage for millions of Americans \u2013 600,000 in Michigan alone \u2013 and move beyond discussions surrounding the repeal of Medicaid expansion,\u201d Sudderth told Watchdog.org.\n\nDetails of nonprofit MHA members\u2019 uncompensated care costs are listed in the following table, for calendar year 2013 or for tax year 2012 from hospitals whose calendar year doesn\u2019t begin Jan. 1.
