The Senate has the power to execute the second step \u2014 to remove from office \u2014 and in Clinton\u2019s case, it did not.\n\nSince then, even more than before, the word \u201cimpeach\u201d has been bandied about on Capitol Hill almost as much as the phrase \u201cnuclear option,\u201d and with even less effect. It\u2019s become almost as predictable as the guy who\u2019s peeved that he didn\u2019t get his speeding ticket thrown out and pledges to take it \u201call the way to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nYEAR IN REVIEW: Politicians' lamest apologies in 2013\n\nUntil Clinton was impeached on a pretty much party-line vote in the Republican House, the only presidential precedents were Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. Johnson, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s successor, was impeached by a faction of his own party for Cabinet shifts and Reconstruction policies, but not booted out of office by the Senate. Nixon resigned before the House voted \u2014 as it would have \u2014 to impeach him.\n\nImpeach is such a short, satisfying word, no wonder it\u2019s getting tossed around so, well, liberally. In 2008, liberal Democratic Ohio congressman and sometime presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush over the Iraq war. They went nowhere.\n\nSince President Obama was elected, the word\u2019s definitely been trending.\n\nRepublicans in and out of Congress, like Reps. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Trey Raydel or Florida, invoked the \u201cI-word.\u201d (Raydel, who suggested indicting Obama over his gun policies, recently pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession and is under House ethics investigation.) Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins says his constituents keep telling him, \u201cYou got to go up there, and you just impeach him.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress have done themselves no favors by conflating their disagreements with duly passed legislation from a twice-elected president \u2014 like Obamacare \u2014 with a palpable personal dislike of the chief executive, and with meatier questions about his executive policies.\n\nThe word has been used more and more boldly \u2014 obviously in the hope of scoring political points and the expectation that just using the word is a goal in itself \u2014 but overuse has rendered it less potent. In fact, some among the GOP may remember how the Clinton impeachment backfired on them in the 1998 midterm elections and kneecapped them in the polls.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why congressional Democrats haven\u2019t turned a hair over it now.\n\nThe word\u2019s been used more about sitting Supreme Court justices. In 1970, Michigan Republican Rep. Gerald Ford, who became president because of the looming impeachment action against Nixon, wanted to impeach Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, partly over the dubious sources of Douglas\u2019 income (he was paying alimony to two exes) as well as his being paid for writing for an avant-garde magazine. One member of Congress asked whether his colleagues had \u201cread the article\u201d or were \u201cjust looking at the pictures.\u201d Douglas\u2019 unorthodox life and his liberal opinions did not sit well with Capitol Hill Republicans.\n\nIn the 1950s, Southerners who objected to Supreme Court desegregation rulings raised up billboards across Dixie demanding \u201cImpeach Earl Warren,\u201d the chief justice and the former governor of California who presided over Brown vs. Board of Education.\n\nOnly a few federal judges have ever been impeached and removed from office, among them Florida District Judge Alcee Hastings. In 1988, he was convicted almost unanimously by Congress \u2014 an institution his constituents sent him to four years later as a Democratic member. There, in 2009, he voted to impeach Samuel B. Kent, a federal judge who faced sex crime charges, and who resigned before serving more than two years behind bars.\n\nIn a couple of weeks it\u2019ll be 2014, and I\u2019m nominating \u201cimpeach\u201d as the soon-to-be \u201cword of the year.\u201d If I had a nickel for every time someone will be using it, I could probably finance a whole congressional campaign.\n\nALSO:", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "15 years after Clinton, Congress loves the word 'impeach' again", "Description": "It\u2019s a red-letter day about a blue dress, the day the House of Representatives voted 15 years ago to impeach President Bill Clinton.   \u201cImpeach\u201d means only to charge with or accuse of \u2014 in Clinton\u2019s case, perjury and obstruction of justice over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
