O\u2019Connell was a few years older than me and living in New York, a complete stranger who updated his roadmap to Millennial angst \u2013 published in the form of listicles and second-person confessional essays \u2013 daily on the nascent site. I was so, so good at following it, even when I wasn\u2019t reading it.\n\nGiven the earnestness of this interview intro, it\u2019s probably clear that I can still be very good at the Millennial angst thing; for this, I suppose I owe a debt to O\u2019Connell, who quickly became known for his insight on \u201cHow to Be a 20-Something.\u201d Personally, I was bad at some of what he listed as crucial \u2014 the binge-drinking and drug use, for example, for which I\u2019m now grateful \u2014 but very successful at having hip wannabe-filmmaker friends who read Tao Lin and hosted punk shows in their dank Austin living rooms.\n\nMy friends would occasionally contribute to Thought Catalog, then a burgeoning, somewhat highbrow platform where they could submit things like snarky reviews of Mormon.org or lists of experimental musicians\u2019 Facebook pages. The site had not yet become the trolling behemoth it\u2019s now known to be, but was, as Newsweek recently noted, criticized for a different reason: essentially, O\u2019Connell\u2019s sincerity.\n\nHe was the star. He would reckon with the meaning of his 20-something existence before a growing Internet audience and get all the clicks, because people like me were eating that shit up.\n\nO\u2019Connell made his name by churning out hundreds upon hundreds of how-to guides and justifications for bad behavior \u2013 \u201cHow to Fall In Love With a Boy for the First Time,\u201d \u201cHow to Appear Cooler On Facebook than You Really Are,\u201d \u201cWhy It\u2019s Okay to Flake on People Sometimes\u201d \u2013 which simultaneously made him untouchable to other, more mainstream media organizations. And yet you might have noticed that the sort of somber indulgence in nostalgia, anxiety and desire for which O\u2019Connell became known \u2013 which became the O\u2019Connell brand \u2013 is everywhere now. Just take a look around at your Internet.\n\nThat\u2019s not what O\u2019Connell does anymore, but it sort of is. After using Thought Catalog as a launch pad \u2014 and paving the way for other 20-somethings to pour their hearts out online in some effort at human connection \u2014 O\u2019Connell branched out, writing essays for Vice and eventually getting a book deal. His first manuscript was also about \u201chow to be a 20-something,\u201d and was, he told me recently, terrible.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d O\u2019Connell said of the essay collection when I spoke to him by phone earlier this month. \u201cThe first draft I wrote of the book was such garbage. It was so bad.\u201d\n\nSo he left the full-time Internet writing game, moved to Los Angeles, and came up with a different idea: an essay collection that\u2019s still about being a 20-something, but is infused with a general indictment of the entire online culture O\u2019Connell has, in a way, been instrumental in creating.\n\nThe book, \u201cI\u2019m Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves,\u201d is a grown-up version of the type of writing for which O\u2019Connell is best known. It is deeply revealing in the most casual manner, and deals with topics O\u2019Connell chose not to touch at Thought Catalog \u2014 specifically, what it\u2019s been like for him to live with cerebral palsy. The book still preaches to the aimless-ish Millennial, leans heavily on Internet slang and is meant, clearly, to be relatable. For the most part, it is \u2013 at least to me, a white 23-year-old who grew up affluent, lives in New York, writes for the Internet and read Thought Catalog back in the day. I also still have a lot of feelings and plenty of uncertainty, so I\u2019m pretty much the target demographic.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sort of the problem: The book is part of a genre that is meant to appeal to the universality of 20-something angst, but relies overwhelmingly on experiences that aren\u2019t universal. Rather, they\u2019re unique to a very narrow, privileged demographic. It\u2019s an issue O\u2019Connell actively tries to address in \u201cI\u2019m Special,\u201d with a discussion of the role socioeconomic status contributes to \u201cthe Millennial experience\u201d \u2013 if such a term can even be applied to the myriad realities of being a 20-something. He\u2019s aware of the problem, and of the ubiquity of the problem and of the way places like Thought Catalog contribute to it. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to stop writing.\n\nO\u2019Connell spoke with Salon by phone about his new book, which comes out June 2, as well as how he feels about Thought Catalog\u2019s turn toward transphobic trolling, what he has to say to critics of his writing, and what he\u2019s looking forward to as he wraps up his 20s. Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHow do you go from already having put so much of your life on the Internet in blog posts to writing a book? I feel like you sort of pioneered this certain kind of blogging that is now ubiquitous and then you went old-school and wrote a book\u2026\n\n\n\nYeah, it was a vintage moment, it was a throwback Thursday!\n\nHow did you navigate that?\n\nAt first, it was really difficult. I got this book deal when I was 25, and I was working full-time at Thought Catalog still. The book that I sold to Simon & Schuster was kind of bad. I think it was literally called \u201cHow to Be a 20-Something\u201d \u2014 it was terrible, but God bless them, they bought it. So when I got the book deal I realized I didn\u2019t want to write about that, and I knew that if I really did want to write a book, I had to make it different. I wanted to write about my disability, which was something I had never talked about before. Well, actually, my editor was like, \u201cI think I have a title for your book. I think we should call it, \u2018I\u2019m Special,\u2019\u201d and I was like, \u201cFunny you should say that. Not only am I a special snowflake, but I\u2019m riding-the-short-bus special as well.\u201d\n\nYou said this is the first time you wanted to write about your disability. Do you feel like now you\u2019ve used up all of your personal material?\n\nNo\u2026 It\u2019s interesting, because this book to me really represents the end of that chapter of confessional writing. I\u2019ll always be writing personal essays, but not that much. To me, the next step in my writing is just writing for other shows, creating my own show, and just immersing myself in that world. My life just isn\u2019t that interesting anymore! It\u2019s a good life, I\u2019m happy, everything is relatively stable. When I was writing for Thought Catalog, I was a hot fucking mess. I was on drugs, I had shitty friends and I was pretty miserable, which obviously inspires good writing, but for mental health isn\u2019t so good. Once you find your life taking a more stable shape, what are you going to write about?\n\nI\u2019m curious how you know which mundane aspects of your life are actually not that mundane, and are worth exploring. Or did you just kind of think everything was important when you were writing for Thought Catalog?\n\n\n\nIf I feel drawn to something enough to actually sit down and write about it, I usually know I\u2019m onto something. Writing is such a painful, horrible process that actually wanting to sit down and make a point of writing down your thoughts \u2014 that means you\u2019re onto something for sure.\n\nRight? Why do people always think writers actually enjoy writing?\n\nThat\u2019s the thing: When you do it, it should count. When I look back at my old stuff on Thought Catalog, there was no filter; it was definitely quantity over quality. Now I feel like I\u2019m much, much more choosy about what I want to put out. When I write things for Thought Catalog now, I feel like it needs to add something to what I\u2019ve already discussed. I always see universal things in specific things I talk about.\n\nYou talk a little bit about socioeconomic class and background, but what do you make of critiques that your writing is speaking to a very distinct class or racial group \u2014 that a lot of what might be your personal experience isn\u2019t really that universal, and that it overlooks the experiences of other Millennials?\n\nEverything does, though. That\u2019s culture, that\u2019s movies, that\u2019s TV shows. You always write what you know; at least I do. I would never try to speak for things I\u2019ve never experienced. I would never even try to put myself in a position where I\u2019d comment on something that\u2019s way out of my league. Here\u2019s the thing: Things always look different on the surface. I think that on the surface, everything looks different \u2014 class, race, whatever \u2014 and that definitely informs your existence, but when you strip everything down, wanting human connection and wanting to be loved is universal. Wanting to feel not alone is universal. What I hope my writing tries to get at are those basic feelings that I think everyone experiences in their 20s or forever. I may not always succeed, and it may be more specific than I think, but I do try to get to a larger picture than just this privileged 20-something angst.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former Thought Catalog star tells Salon about his new book, \"I'm Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves\"", "title": "Ryan O\u2019Connell on Thought Catalog, trolling & the Millennial angst tipping point: \u201cThe more you write about your personal life, the less you have one\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former Thought Catalog star tells Salon about his new book, \"I'm Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves\"", "title": "Ryan O\u2019Connell on Thought Catalog, trolling & the Millennial angst tipping point: \u201cThe more you write about your personal life, the less you have one\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/ryan_oconnell_on_thought_catalog_trolling_the_millennial_angst_tipping_point_the_more_you_write_about_your_personal_life_the_less_you_have_one/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/OConnellRyan_CreditSarahWalker1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former Thought Catalog star tells Salon about his new book, \"I'm Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves\"", "title": "Ryan O\u2019Connell on Thought Catalog, trolling & the Millennial angst tipping point: \u201cThe more you write about your personal life, the less you have one\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/OConnellRyan_CreditSarahWalker1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 20-somethings, Books, Editor's Picks, essays, millennials, Personal essays, Ryan O'Connell, thought catalog", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 20-somethings, Books, Editor's Picks, essays, millennials, Personal essays, Ryan O'Connell, thought catalog, Life News, Entertainment News, NewsWhen Ryan O\u2019Connell started writing for Thought Catalog in 2011, I was a 20-year-old girl with a lot of feelings and even more uncertainty.\nWhen I write things for Thought Catalog now, I feel like it needs to add something to what I\u2019ve already discussed.\nWhen I look back at my old stuff on Thought Catalog, there was no filter; it was definitely quantity over quality.\nHe\u2019s aware of the problem, and of the ubiquity of the problem and of the way places like Thought Catalog contribute to it.\nI got this book deal when I was 25, and I was working full-time at Thought Catalog still."}
