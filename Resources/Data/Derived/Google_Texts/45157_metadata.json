But they refused to move in due to eerie letters they say they received from a person with a \u201cmentally disturbed fixation\u201d on the home.\n\nThe couple took the house off the market last summer after suing the previous owners. But they put the house up for sale again last week.\n\nThe six-bedroom, 3\u00bd-bathroom home, according to an online post, has high ceilings, fireplaces and \u201celegant foyers,\u201d and sits on nearly a half-acre. The listing price $1.25 million\n\nThe current owners, Derek and Maria Broaddus, claim in their suit that they should have been warned about the letter writer. They want the former owners to refund them the purchase price and pay punitive damages.\n\nREAD: Watching and waiting: The mystery house in Westfield\n\nThey claim one of the letters they received read: \u201cDo you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Once I know their names I will call to them and draw them too (sic) me.\u201d The person signs the letters as \u201cThe Watcher.\u201d\n\nIn their suit, they claim they are unable to live in the home \u201cwithout extreme anxiety and fear for their children\u2019s safety and wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe former owners, John and Andrea Woods, have called the couple\u2019s account fiction and moved earlier this year to have the suit dismissed. But no decision has been made on that request.\n\nThe Woods said in a court filing that they received a single anonymous note days before the closing, but they deny the note was disturbing or claimed an ownership right to the home.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
