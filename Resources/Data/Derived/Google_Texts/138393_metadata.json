Examples: Condoms, sponges, spermicides used with a diaphragm or a cervical cap.\n\nHormonal methods\n\nWork by \u201cinterfering with ovulation and possibly fertilization.\u201d Examples include a skin patch, the vaginal ring, two types of pills and a shot:\n\nThe \u201ccombined pill,\u201d the patch and the ring each have two hormones (estrogen and progestin) that combine to prevent ovulation, and may also prevent sperm from reaching the egg.\n\nA progestin-only \u201cmini pill\u201d acts to keep sperm from getting to the egg. Less often, it stops ovulation.\n\nA progestin shot stops ovulation or prevents sperm from reaching the egg.\n\nImplanted Devices\n\nInserted in the body, an intrauterine device (known as an IUD) or a contraceptive rod with progestin, work by preventing sperm from reaching or fertilizing the egg, and may prevent implantation.\n\nEmergency contraception\n\nUsed within three days of unprotected sex, they come in two major forms:\n\nPlan B, Plan B One-Step and Next Choice (levonorgestrel) work mainly by preventing ovulation, preventing fertilization, or by preventing implantation.\n\nElla (ulipristal acetate) works primarily by stopping or delaying ovulation. It may also prevent implantation.\n\nKRE/AMB END GROSSMAN", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Politics, birth control, contraception, emergency contraception, Food and Drug Administration", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) An FDA web site explains the four major methods of contraception and how they work.", "title": "SIDEBAR: How FDA-approved contraceptive methods work", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2014/01/28/sidebar-fda-approved-contraceptive-methods-work/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_161036579.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CLGrossman"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2014/01/28/sidebar-fda-approved-contraceptive-methods-work/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2014/01/28/sidebar-fda-approved-contraceptive-methods-work/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) An FDA web site explains the four major methods of contraception and how they work."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4146\"", "article_summary": "Emergency contraceptionUsed within three days of unprotected sex, they come in two major forms:Plan B, Plan B One-Step and Next Choice (levonorgestrel) work mainly by preventing ovulation, preventing fertilization, or by preventing implantation.\nImplanted DevicesInserted in the body, an intrauterine device (known as an IUD) or a contraceptive rod with progestin, work by preventing sperm from reaching or fertilizing the egg, and may prevent implantation.\nRELATED: Abortifacients: The drugs at the center of the Obamacare contraception mandate (RNS)courtesy of areeya_ann via ShutterstockAn FDA web site explains the four major methods of contraception and how they work.\nWASHINGTON (RNS) The Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate specifies women should be offered insurance coverage with no co-payment for all contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nA progestin shot stops ovulation or prevents sperm from reaching the egg."}
