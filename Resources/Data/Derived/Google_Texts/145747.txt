Rising concerns about college campus rape have led California lawmakers to propose sex contracts for undergraduates.



FULL TRANSCRIPT

S.E. Cupp: Sex contracts to prevent college rape? Nice try.

It’s really frustrating that college rape in this country is treated as if it were an inevitability. Students are unilaterally disarmed, in many cases women can’t even carry pepper spray on a college campus.

And then all of the resources and all of the discussion and all of the debate is about crisis centers and hotlines and what happens after the rape.

And then we debate adjudicating the rape so that it embarrasses the college the least.

College rape shouldn't be an inevitability and some lawmakers in California are experimenting with an idea whereby they require a contract to be signed by both parties who are about to engage in a sexual act while on state campuses.

Now that seems pretty silly to me, but I do want to give, uh, kudos for trying to think about preventing the rape in the first place instead of treating it afterwards.

Crisis centers are fantastic but I’d much rather have not been raped in the first place.
