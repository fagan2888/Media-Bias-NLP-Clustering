Va. home, former coal miner Randall Lester spoke with his wife, Missi, about his job prospects.\n\nGILBERT, W.Va. \u2014 A Marilyn Monroe statue still beckons travelers to Happy Days Diner, a reminder of boom times in this Appalachian town at the heart of West Virginia coal country \u2014 an area long viewed as reliably Democratic.\n\nThe restaurant is now shuttered, along with a string of other storefronts on the two-lane road that snakes through town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while Marilyn harkens back, the town\u2019s fading fortunes tell a political tale that could determine the Democratic Party\u2019s future in West Virginia, with ramifications far beyond the state\u2019s borders.\n\nHere in Mingo County, which has lost hundreds of coal industry jobs, a 12.1 percent unemployment rate leads the state and is twice the national average. As a result, a half-century after John F. Kennedy worked to address West Virginia\u2019s poverty and after Democrats have directed billions of dollars in \u201cearmarks\u201d to boost local fortunes, the party faces its biggest challenge here in generations.\n\nDemocrats had hoped to make economic opportunity a central theme in November\u2019s election, but it has failed to resonate in places like Gilbert. This disconnect could cost Democrats control of the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fed up,\u201d said Randall Lester, a coal miner who grew up, met his wife, and raised his two boys in Gilbert. He has watched the Larry Joe Harless Theater close and the region\u2019s children take jobs elsewhere. After four decades in the mines, Lester lost his own job two weeks ago. A registered Democrat, he plans to vote for Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u201d about change, he said. \u201cShow me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis disenchantment goes farther than these southern West Virginia hills. A recent Associated Press-Gfk poll showed nine of out 10 voters consider the economy America\u2019s biggest problem. Democrats have tried to tap into these concerns with a focus on raising the minimum wage and eliminating the gender pay gap amid close races in Kentucky, North Carolina, Alaska, Georgia, and Louisiana.\n\nNatalie Tennant, West Virginia\u2019s secretary of state, embodies that strategy. She is the party\u2019s nominee for the US Senate seat to replace retiring Senator John \u201cJay\u201d Rockefeller, a Democrat whose name is synonymous with the economic elite but who focused his three-decade career on helping the less fortunate.\n\nTennant has struggled to follow. A recent poll conducted by RealClearPolitics shows she trails her Republican opponent, Shelley Moore Capito, a multiterm congresswoman, by some 17 points.\n\nRepublicans need six seats to win the Senate and have made West Virginia key to their takeover strategy.\n\nTennant, who runs a media consulting company, frames herself as a small-business owner and her opponent as a shill for rich bankers. She has accused Capito of working for Wall Street by voting for CEOs to keep bonuses during the financial bailout of 2008. She also targets Capito, the daughter of a former governor, for voting against bills that would increase the minimum wage and reduce the gender pay gap.\n\n\u201cWest Virginians see and know that this is a real West Virginia issue \u2014 income inequality,\u201d Tennant said in an interview.\n\nCapito\u2019s message is simple. \u201cMy opponent is supporting the president, who is putting people out of jobs,\u201d she said during a recent debate in Charleston. Capito declined requests for an interview.\n\nRELATED: Sununu: Obama\u2019s energy policy is hurting fellow Democrats\u2019 campaigns\n\nPresident Obama has never been popular in West Virginia, least of all Mingo County. Residents in 2012 gave more votes to a convicted felon.\n\nCritics blame Obama\u2019s policies for the demise of coal jobs, although the rise of natural gas and increased use of mechanized mining also play a role.\n\nEven Democratic leaders here are critical of the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has done nothing to help southern West Virginia,\u201d said Justin Marcum, a Democrat who represents Mingo County in the state\u2019s House of Delegates. \u201cPoverty has grown here due to the war on coal.\u201d\n\nMarcum\u2019s law office is in the county seat of Williamson, across the street from the historic Mountaineer Hotel, which plays constant bluegrass music and markets itself as the place Kennedy stayed during his 1960 presidential election campaign.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see the JFKs anymore,\u201d Marcum said, pulling up a digitalized photo of the former president shaking hands. Most everyone in this county of nearly 26,000 people \u2014 where \u201csweet pea\u201d and \u201choney\u201d are common greetings \u2014 knows someone who works in the mines. Marcum wants the region to focus on diversifying and doesn\u2019t see either candidate proposing an adequate solution.\n\nObama\u2019s administration doesn\u2019t always get due credit. An expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has meant coverage for about 147,000 people statewide.\n\nBut the president\u2019s latest message \u2014 the economy\u2019s improvement \u2014 is a hard one for people here to grasp.\n\nThe West Virginia Center on Budget & Policy estimates 5,000 jobs have disappeared from the southern coal fields since 2011. The state\u2019s unemployment rate hit 6.6 percent this August, up from 4.1 percent at the same period in 2007.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that\u2019s going to impact the Senate race,\u201d said Neil Berch, an associate professor in West Virginia University\u2019s political science department.\n\nDemocratic voters have dropped to below 50 percent in the state. If Capito wins, she will become the first Republican senator from West Virginia in more than a half-century. The state GOP hopes to take control of the House of Delegates for the first time in over 80 years.\n\nMany Mingo County residents, reflecting a national frustration, don\u2019t plan to go to the polls. Marcum predicted 13 percent of the county\u2019s residents would vote.\n\nIn this climate, lawmakers must prove economic populist ideas are somehow different than policies of the past.\n\n\u201cThe sense that there are solutions that would work hasn\u2019t quite taken hold yet,\u201d said Heather Boushey, executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a research organization that examines economic inequality.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t see the answer in traditional divisions between Democrats who campaign on federal benefits for the poor and Republicans who see the solution in fewer regulations.\n\n\u201cThat debate is far too narrow,\u201d she said.\n\nStephanie Harrison scrapes by on as many hours as she can get at the Gilbert community center\u2019s front desk. The job starts at minimum wage. Her husband, a high school coach, makes $3,000 a season. With four kids, there\u2019s always an unpaid bill.\n\nHarrison, who supports Tennant, believes the town needs more than politics.\n\n\u201cYou adapt,\u201d she said, her voice echoing through the empty atrium, \u201cand pray it will get better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.1289263936", "eomportal-id": 166055, "description": "GILBERT, W.
