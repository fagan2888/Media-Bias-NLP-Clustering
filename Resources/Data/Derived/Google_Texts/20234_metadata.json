Modeled on the old-fashioned intro that scrolls up the screen at the start of each \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, it envisioned a future in which Trump won the candidacy, lost the presidential election and left Hillary Clinton triumphant.\n\nTitled \u201cOur Only Hope\u201d, Kasich\u2019s video began: \u201cUpon defeating Donald Trump in the largest landslide since Reagan in 1984, President Hillary Clinton is preparing to name her newest Supreme Court justice, Elizabeth Warren. [House] Speaker Nancy Pelosi is planning new tax hikes, hoping that Senate President Chuck Schumer and his new Democratic majority can swiftly get it to the President\u2019s desk for her signature.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew executive orders restricting the Second Amendment are being drafted while increased federal spending on Obamacare is readied. Meanwhile, our allies across the world are swiftly losing faith in America\u2019s role as a global leader, empowering our enemies and leaving America in a more dangerous position. But we have hope it can be different\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was a roll-call of all the nightmarish things that Republicans fear a Clinton presidency would do: create a \u201cliberal\u201d majority on the Supreme Court, raise taxes, bring in gun control and spend more money on health care for poor Americans. Kasich, of course, was the \u201cOnly Hope\u201d to prevent this disaster. (It was his video, after all.)\n\nIf Kasich didn\u2019t get the Republican nomination, according to the video, then Trump would win it, but then lose the national election and put Clinton into the presidency. That would be followed shortly by dragons, plagues and strange portents in the sky, leading to the full-on End Times during her second year in office.\n\nWell, Kasich is out of the race, Trump will get the Republican nomination, and Clinton will win the presidency by a landslide, just like the video says. Not only that, but the Democrats really may win control of both houses of Congress.\n\nClinton probably will create a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, tax the rich a bit more, and expand the Affordable Care Act (what Republicans call \u201cObamacare\u201d). She probably will tackle gun control, too, although you should not hold your breath while awaiting a positive result.\n\nShe will certainly push on with President Barack Obama\u2019s initiatives on climate change and add to them. (She talks about wanting \u201chalf a billion more solar panels deployed in the first four years.\u201d) But will she do anything genuinely surprising? It would be astounding if she did. Clinton is \u201ca safe pair of hands,\u201d not a radical.\n\nOn foreign policy, she belongs to the \u201cWashington consensus,\u201d so she is suspicious of Russia and Iran, reflexively pro-Israel and uncertain what to do about China. She resents the fact that people still bring up her vote in support of President George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it does highlight her inability to think outside the box that the rest of the consensus is trapped in at any given time.\n\nShe takes the standard liberal positions on practically every domestic issue from same-sex marriage and abortion (cautiously pro) to immigration (no mass deportation of undocumented immigrants). She has talked about the need to reform the rules on political campaign finances, but would have trouble in getting that through even a Democratic-controlled Congress (\u201cthe best Congress that money can buy\u201d), and might just decide not to waste her political capital that way.\n\nIf all this makes Clinton sound like a profoundly unexciting president, that would not bother her a bit. Nearly three decades of experience with the political game at the highest level has reinforced her natural tendency to think only in terms of incremental change, and her whole approach to politics is managerial, not transformational. She will not rock the boat.\n\nThis is perhaps not such a bad thing in a peacetime national leader \u2014 and the United States really is at peace, despite the small overseas military commitments that entail an occasional military casualty.\n\nIt\u2019s also the best way to assure a second term in office \u2014 which also could be within Clinton\u2019s grasp if the Republican Party splits before either before or after the electoral debacle that, with Trump as its candidate, now seems almost certain. Although that would make her 77 at the end of her second term.\n\nGwynne Dyer is an independent journalist whose articles are published in 45 countries.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly three decades of experience with the political game at the highest level has reinforced Hillary Clinton\u2019s natural tendency to think only in terms of incremental change, and her whole approach to politics is managerial, not transformational.
