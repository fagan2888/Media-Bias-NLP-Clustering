And judging by the previews, it looks like the next White House race will be just as inane and annoying as the last one. But as unpleasant as being forced to witness another battle in the endless war of attrition between Hillary Clinton and the press may sound, we have at least one thing to look forward to: The presidential campaign of Louisiana\u2019s Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, which is quite likely to happen and absolutely certain to fail.\n\nI\u2019m a congenital pessimist, so don\u2019t give me too much credit for drawing attention to this pending debacle-cum-comic-relief. Instead, all praise should go to National Review\u2019s Eliana Johnson, who reported Monday evening that a source \u201cclose to\u201d Jindal was willing to confirm that the \u201cslight\u201d governor \u201chas gained 13 pounds over the past few months\u201d because he\u2019s \u201clooking to beef up\u201d now that the 2016 campaign is \u201con the horizon.\u201d Yes indeed, the guy whose political future began to unravel as soon as people noticed he sounded like Kenneth from \u201c30 Rock\u201d seems to think he can revive his flatlining career by reminding everyone that he doesn\u2019t exactly reflect the Republican Party base\u2019s particular vision of rugged masculinity.\n\nBefore reading the National Review piece, I assumed Jindal would run, fare poorly and then lobby the ultimate GOP nominee to pick him as vice president. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that; it can often lead to a cabinet position in a future administration, and is a very traditional course for a second- or third-tier presidential aspirant to take. But now that I know Team Jindal is oblivious enough to think his career can be salvaged by cultivating mass? Well, I think it\u2019s time we ready ourselves for a campaign that\u2019s so lost in the Tea Party twilight zone that anything could happen.\n\nTo understand why the Jindal camp\u2019s decision to share this little scooplet is so phenomenally bizarre and foreboding, rather than simply silly and weird, you need to keep in mind just how much of a disaster his tenure as Louisiana governor has been. If you understandably don\u2019t pay especially close attention to goings on in the Bayou State, this should give you a sense of Jindal\u2019s severe lack of political acumen: In a state that went for John McCain and Mitt Romney by nearly 20 points in \u201908 and \u201912, respectively, only 34 percent of Louisianans approve of the job the extremely conservative Jindal is doing. He even loses a hypothetical matchup with former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who is not only a convicted felon but a Democrat to boot!\n\nAs to how Jindal managed to get himself into this situation, there\u2019s no one single answer. But as Rachel Weiner of the Washington Post discovered last year (Jindal\u2019s been underwater for a while now), the governor\u2019s troubles can\u2019t be explained without noting his proposal to eliminate income taxes in the state while raising sales taxes to make up for lost revenue. In addition to being extremely regressive, due to poor people being less likely to pay income taxes but certain to pay sales taxes, Jindal\u2019s plan was also extremely unpopular \u2014 at one point, as many as two-out-of-three Louisianans opposed it outright. Recognizing political reality, Jindal ultimately surrendered. But many voters \u2014 who already were unhappy with Jindal\u2019s cuts to education and healthcare, as well as his refusal to accept Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 never looked at him the same.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It appears the guv's likely presidential campaign is going to be a bizarre disaster.
