On Tuesday, March 10, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice President and the White House Council on Women and Girls, will host a special event to commemorate the annual observance of National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (NWGHAAD).

In 2012, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum creating an inter-agency Federal Working Group to explore the critical intersection of HIV/AIDS, violence against women and girls, and gender-related health disparities. During Tuesday’s event, the White House, Federal agencies, and the community will amplify achievements and progress in implementing the recommendations from that working group.

The event will be webcast live at www.WhiteHouse.gov/LIVE from 10:00–11:30 a.m. (EDT). We encourage you to watch the webcast, and to share it with your networks.
