Spotlight on… Chris Paul, point guard, Clippers

When: The March 28-April 3 evaluation period brought us the return of an old friend — Chris Paul. The point guard played some of his best basketball of the season during the span, and because of that he is The Denver Post’s NBA player of the week.

What’s up: In three games, Paul averaged 29.7 points, 12.0 assists and 2.3 steals. He shot 53.2 percent from the field, including 47.4 percent from 3-point range, and he didn’t miss a free throw — on an average of 10 attempts per game.

Background: We’ve all seen “The Crossover,” the move Golden State’s Stephen Curry put on Paul that put him on the ground. But despite that one moment of shame, Paul has been brilliant. Never more has that been apparent than recently, just when the Clippers need it in the middle of a playoff race. Since December, Paul’s performance has improved every month, and the Clippers are benefiting.

Dempsey’s take: Is there a question about whether Paul is the best point guard in the NBA? Sure there is. Curry is just one of a new wave of young players pushing for that crown. But do you still want Paul as your team leader, running the show? Absolutely. He’s every bit as effective as he had ever been, and this past week showed it. Furthermore, Paul’s performance is peaking at the right time, and because of that the Clippers will be a sleeper team in the Western Conference playoffs.
