For that sweet, pre-holiday time business booms. Like tree farmers, many other industries experience a similar seasonal flux -- including retail trade, agriculture and resort properties.\n\nFor businesses that experience a particularly high season and have little need for a full staff year-round, hiring temporary staff (or \"temps\") is an ideal way to supplement personnel. However, employers are often left uncertain about what is and is not required to manage and protect their seasonal employees.\n\nTo help provide some clarity, below is an outline of risk management best practices for operations with temporary employees -- just remember the acronym TEMPS:\n\nT rained\n\nrained E ligible\n\nligible M anaged\n\nanaged P rotected\n\nrotected Secure\n\nTrained:\n\nCreate a solid training program specifically tailored to the needs of short-term workers. Temporary employees will have a weaker grasp on your business practices and policies, so they are at a higher risk of making mistakes or having an accident.\n\nMake sure all temporary employees receive the following:\n\nFormal orientation with documented materials on company policies and procedures. These should clearly outline the expectations of employees and safety practices.\n\nTraining on all equipment used in your operation (i.e. registers, cooking equipment, lifts, tractors, sharp tools, etc.).\n\nEmergency drill to simulate crisis situations, including evacuation and emergency exit routes.\n\nEligible:\n\nOutsource your temporary hiring needs to a reliable staffing agency where sufficient employee screening is a quality standard, or offer temporary opportunities independently and pre-screen employees on your own.\n\nEmployee screening measures should include:\n\nIdentity and social security number verification.\n\nPast employment references.\n\nVerification for necessary credentials, such as education or professional licenses.\n\nSex offender registry check, drug testing and vehicle history.\n\nTesting and thorough interviewing to confirm character and skills.\n\nManaged:\n\nMake sure a manager or more experienced full-time employee is present at all times to enforce safety protocols and to guide temporary workers. Maintain a zero-tolerance policy for disregard of uniform safety requirements, such as protective gloves or steel-toed shoes.\n\nMost importantly, encourage regular breaks to ensure your employees remain focused, nimble and energized throughout the day.\n\nProtected:\n\nYour business is legally required to carry workers' compensation insurance coverage as seasonal employees are still covered by most fair-employment laws. To pinpoint the details of your state's specific workers' compensation regulations, visit the Department of Labor's Division of Federal Employees' Compensation page.\n\nFurthermore, updates introduced by the Affordable Care Act can be confusing for business owners not familiar with new employer requirements, especially for seasonal employees. I debunked some of the most common uncertainties in my blog post, Fact or Fiction: The Benefits Required for Seasonal Employees.\n\nEmployers who retain an average of 50 full-time employees per year are required to offer affordable health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours per week. If your business doesn't fit the definition of a \"large employer,\" as defined by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, you do not need to provide coverage. However, to ensure the safety and health of your seasonal employees, you should encourage them to visit HealthCare.gov to enroll in an insurance plan.\n\nSecure:\n\nRisk levels for temporary employees vary from job to job. A retail clerk versus a position chopping down Christmas trees will, of course, pose different risks and liabilities for your operation.\n\nKeep Records: Maintain a detailed account of where each employee works, the tasks they are assigned to, amount of hours completed and their rate of pay. This information will be important for setting rates for workers' compensation insurance.\n\nTrack Claims: Keep a record of on the job injuries and workers' compensation claims made. Monitor the frequency of these claims and be sure to note when unusual patterns occur. This will help in consideration for future employment eligibility during seasonal hiring needs.\n\nIt should be noted that, while you cannot discriminate or deny someone employment based on an injury, you can review their file for following company protocols and procedures. For example, did the employee file the claim while still onsite and within a timely manner? Did their injury result from disregard for company safety procedures? Use this information to protect your business from fraudulent and expensive workers' compensation costs.\n\nBusiness owners with seasonal highs and lows need to think through methods of how to protect against liabilities created by the necessity of hiring temporary employees. The legal and financial implications are unique to that of full-time employees, and taking preventative measures as described in TEMPS will protect your business' bottom line.\n\nFor more information on business insurance, visit the INGUARD blog.\n\nNote: A version of this article originally appeared on www.INGUARD.com.\n\nImage Credit: jill111 via Pixabay\n\nFollow Parker Beauchamp on Twitter: www.twitter.com/INGUARD", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2015-11-21 15:36:27 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "title": "How to Prepare Your Business for Seasonal Employees", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/parker-beauchamp/how-to-prepare-your-business-for-seasonal-employees_b_8601660.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/o-DEFAULT-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3337804/images/o-DEFAULT-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "INGUARD", "site": "@HuffPostBiz", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How to Prepare Your Business for Seasonal Employees"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-20 15:36:27 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=8601660", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "business,Risk Management,insurance,Holiday Season,temporary employment,seasonal employment", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "business,Risk Management,insurance,Holiday Season,temporary employment,seasonal employment", "published_time": "2015-11-20 15:36:27 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-11-20 15:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Protected:Your business is legally required to carry workers' compensation insurance coverage as seasonal employees are still covered by most fair-employment laws.\nHowever, employers are often left uncertain about what is and is not required to manage and protect their seasonal employees.\nFurthermore, updates introduced by the Affordable Care Act can be confusing for business owners not familiar with new employer requirements, especially for seasonal employees.\nTo pinpoint the details of your state's specific workers' compensation regulations, visit the Department of Labor's Division of Federal Employees' Compensation page.\nI debunked some of the most common uncertainties in my blog post, Fact or Fiction: The Benefits Required for Seasonal Employees."}
