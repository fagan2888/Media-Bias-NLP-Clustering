The windy conditions made it difficult for the teams to string together passing sequences.\n\n\u201cI think we were a little off today,\u201d said Hermon coach M.J. Ball, whose Hawks improved to 4-0-1. \u201cBut the way I see it, good teams find ways to win, even if they have to win ugly.\n\n\u201cMDI always plays well against us. It was a good physical battle,\u201d added Ball. \u201cWe need to do a better job taking care of the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was one of our best games of the season,\u201d said dynamic senior midfielder Curless, whose Trojans are now 4-2. \u201cThey\u2019re really good and we played right with them. It was really fun.\u201d\n\nJunior Saulter opened the scoring just 9:49 into the game when she worked a nifty give-and-go with Alex Allain. Saulter launched a 22-yard strike that trickled over the goal line after it struck the hands of MDI senior back-up goalkeeper Julianna Cleaves, a defender who was filling in for Keely McConomy, who underwent recent minor surgery.\n\nIt was just her third game as a goalkeeper.\n\n\u201cI tried to hit it hard and put it in a corner. Even though it went at the goalie, it still went in,\u201d said Saulter.\n\nJunior center back Higgins extended the lead from the penalty spot with 47 seconds left in the half after a Hawk was pushed down in the penalty area.\n\nHiggins sailed her shoulder-high penalty kick to the left of Cleaves, who finished with five saves on 16 shots.\n\nCurless, who will attend Syracuse University in the fall, cut the lead in half with 19:50 remaining in regulation. She lofted a high, 26-yard shot from a tough angle near the right sideline into the far corner past Hermon goalie Bryanne Crouse, who wound up with four saves on 14 shots.\n\n\u201cI figured the only way to score was chip it and it worked,\u201d said Curless, who was closely marked throughout the game.\n\n\u201cThey did a good job marking me,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe tried to double-team her so she wouldn\u2019t have space to go to the net,\u201d explained Saulter.\n\nSaulter, Allain, Higgins and junior center back Sierra Snow were standouts for Hermon while energetic junior midfielder Darcy Kanu, Curless and junior defenders Paige Mason and Abby Miller shone for MDI.\n\n\u201cWe gave them a good game and we hadn\u2019t done that in the past. We\u2019ve improved so much since last year,\u201d Kanu said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HERMON, Maine \u2014 The Hermon High School girls soccer team remained undefeated on Saturday afternoon but it didn\u2019t come easy.
