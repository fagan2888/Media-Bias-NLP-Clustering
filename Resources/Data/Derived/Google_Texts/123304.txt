As its executives predicted a year ago, MVP Health Care finished 2015 in the black.

The Schenectady-based insurer had net income of $42.3 million on revenues of $2.92 billion last year, halting a two-year trend of losses.

The company attributed the turnaround to synergies from its acquisition of Hudson Health Plan, controlled administrative costs and a realignment of its insurance offerings.

MVP has in recent years increased its offerings through government programs, including through Medicaid and New York State of Health, the online market established under the federal Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The insurer has also ventured into more contracts in which doctors and other providers are paid a set fee per month per member, rather than for each service provided.

“The hard work we’ve done, diversifying our product portfolio and reducing administrative costs by more than $30 million in two years, has had a significant impact on our bottom line,” said Chief Operating Officer Chris Del Vecchio.

MVP lost $12.4 million in 2014 and $13.6 million in 2013.

Insurers filed reports on their 2015 financial results with the state Department of Financial Services at the end of last week. The Buzz is tracking down 2015 financial figures for two other locally based companies, CDPHP of Albany and BlueShield of Northeastern New York.
