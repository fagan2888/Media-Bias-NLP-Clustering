The pages beyond this chapter have yet to be written, but as we pause to fold the corner down on patient-engagement, and the emerging ePatient, some of us are left wondering: Why has it taken us this long to look at HIT from the patient perspective?\n\nBefore asking that question, perhaps it\u2019s better to ask what is an ePatient? By definition, ePatients are health consumers who participate in their medical care via electronic communications search tools and technologies. They are educated, empowered and electronic when it comes to health matters, which is what the \u201ce\u201d in their namesake implies. They may be tech-savvy screen adorers, but there is much more to ePatients than the screens that sit in front of them. These ePatients seek to be active participants in their healthcare by partnering with their providers. As a result, the potential that these scrupulous breed of consumers hold for U.S healthcare is great\u2014as they may be the solution to cure the system\u2019s ills by taking care of their own health.\n\nAs we move to reform our healthcare system and seek proactive solutions to improve the health of our populations, patient participation and collaboration are now seen as the comprehensive glue that will, \u201chold it all together.\u201d While ePatients may be destined to be the central characters, they have been an elusive part of healthcare\u2019s HIT story thus far. Only recently has the ePatient emerged into the HIT equation.\n\nTo understand why the ePatients\u2019 importance in HIT was first evaded and now evolving, we must first explore how and why this new breed of patients has emerged. It\u2019s hard to say that there is one key driver behind the rise of the ePatient. However, if we take a quick glance back, we can begin to pull together the social, technological and political pieces that have given rise to their electronic empowerment.\n\nThe History of the ePatient\n\nAccording to a Pew Research survey released in January 2014, 90 percent of adults in the U.S own a cell phone, 58 percent of those being smartphones. An additional survey (conducted in September 2012) revealed that 72 percent of internet users looked up health information on the Web. Access to more intuitive mobile devices, as well as health information via a variety of Internet sources, has surely played a part in the progression of the ePatient, beginning, with the release of the first iPhone in 2007.\n\nApple\u2019s prolific App store launched the following year; Android soon followed with the release of its first smartphone, the HTC Dream in 2008. Mobile phone accounts were already multiplying at a rapid rate, and those accounts worldwide grew from $3 billion to approximately $ 5.5 billion from 2007 to 2010, according to Source International Telecommunication Union.\n\nSocial media websites like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, all in early existence on the web (from 2003 to 2006), received a boost in visitors upon releasing their smartphone and tablet applications. Research compiled by Media Bistro revealed that social media is equally an influential driver of health-related material, with 40 percent of the consumers claiming that information found via social media affects the way they deal with their health, citing emotional support and instant gratification as two of the reasons to embrace social health communications.\n\nWhile mobile and internet users were learning what health information was accessible at their fingertips, the U.S government was working on healthcare\u2019s electronic empowerment. On February 17, 2009 the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was signed into law by the federal government. This Act encouraged providers to adopt electronic health records (EHR) to receive financial incentives (starting from 2011 until 2015) by establishing Meaningful Use (MU) to enhance healthcare delivery (failure to establish MU by 2015 may result in penalties to providers).\n\nIn March 2010, The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law by President Obama. Although some would argue that the HITECH Act stands on its own when it comes to encouraging the development of HIT, there are many provisions in the ACA that are heavily dependent on IT advancements. The Medicare Shared Savings program, which rewards doctors for operating as accountable care organizations (ACOs) to keep patients well and reduce costs, is a prime example.\n\nThe Evasive Human Element of HIT\n\nThe political drivers and new provisions of reform have suddenly made embracing technology an industry imperative for healthcare providers, and so the quest to become electronic with intention of bettering care delivery began. So, too did the struggles of patients trying to access those health records, like Regina Holliday a wife, mother, art teacher and soon to be patient activist. Holliday was trying to access the records of her ailing husband Fred Holliday II, who was diagnosed with metastatic kidney cancer in March 2009.\n\n\u201cWe were unable to access Fred\u2019s EHR for a myriad of reasons. The workflow design of the facilities had not made access a priority,\u201d said Holliday. \u201cThe doctor in charge of Fred\u2019s care seemed threatened and frustrated by questions. The technology that could allow that access was in place, but the system had not been designed to give us that access.\u201d\n\nHolliday wanted to view her husband\u2019s medical records so that she could conduct her own research on her husband\u2019s condition, which would have allowed them to make informed decisions about his treatment together. She was not only denied that access, but also told that there would be a cost and a lengthy waiting period before obtaining those records.\n\nOne can aptly assume the reasons for both the cost and delay had to do with the interoperability, privacy and security issues circulating around EHRs at the time, along with the lack of technological infrastructure between the various medical facilities that treated Holliday\u2019s husband. As a result, Holliday would not have access to her husband\u2019s records until May 2009. Fred Holliday II passed on June 17, 2009. For Holliday, her husband\u2019s HIT story was one of \u201ctoo little, and far too late.\u201d\n\nHolliday\u2019s experience is not uncommon, however. Although EHR adoption nearly doubled between 2008 and 2011, according to the U.S Department of Health & Human Services, many providers faced the storm that came with navigating this uncharted territory. A recent Bipartisan Policy Center survey revealed that 70 percent of doctors who have adopted EHRs cite lack of interoperability as a dominant issue of frustration. And one of the major complaints of EHR adoption is that long-promised healthcare savings simply haven\u2019t materialized.\n\nBack in 2005, RAND Corp. researchers optimistically predicated that EHRs could save the U.S healthcare system at least $81 billion annually, a significant, yet obtainable goal. Fast forward to 2013, and those savings are not there. In fact, healthcare costs have grown by $800 billion. The lack of significant savings, interoperability and provider frustrations are abounding. These are the familiar stories emerging in HIT every day, but what about patients and their frustrations? What have they stood to lose during this process? Turns out, it\u2019s a lot.\n\nFor Regina Holliday, the story of her husband\u2019s illness and death got lost in the haze of this healthcare story\u2014until she brought it back to the forefront. Holliday is a prime example of today\u2019s ePatient. She knows of the possibilities out there thanks to the developments of coming HIT. But she also knows firsthand of healthcare\u2019s failings in the process, and that our system needs to do better to make the patient a true priority when it comes to enhancing healthcare delivery.\n\nAs a result, Holliday has become a healthcare activist and teacher. Her strongest source of empowerment doesn\u2019t derive from a tap on a keyboard or the swipe of a touch screen, but from the stroke of a paintbrush.\n\nHolliday found her passion for advocacy and wanted to bring awareness to the problems in our health system through her art. \u201cI have painted my entire life, but I rarely used it as a tool before Fred\u2019s illness,\u201d said Holliday.\n\n\u201cMy hope was to use art, during Fred\u2019s illness and after his death, to create national policy change. I thought art was the strongest tool in my arsenal to exact rapid change. Although art is therapeutic, that was the fringe benefit for me. The first story I told was the story of Fred and I. I told that story for two years. Then, I realized I must tell the many other stories that are out there.\u201d\n\nThe patient stories that Holliday along with 25 other artists paint, depicted via passion and applied acrylic, have evolved from murals and canvas, and now, onto the backs of jackets. Holliday founded a movement known as The Walking Gallery of Healthcare, which she premiered at the Washington, DC Health Innovation Week in June, 2011. Subsequently, The Walking Gallery has become a living breathing movement as she and fellow health activists paint many different types of coats, including those belonging to medical professionals who are now taking part.\n\nEach painting tells a story, be it the wearer of the jackets, or a larger story about patient or care giving, healthcare reform, or larger national and global health issues. Those donning the jackets, which are now popping up at health conferences all over the country, are bringing the story of the patient back into focus. For Holliday\u2019s artwork is spreading a message that is becoming impossible to ignore.\n\nThe conferences may be about technology, but Holliday is demonstrating the importance of marrying the technical experience with what can only be described as the irrecoverable and unequivocal feeling of being human.\u201cIt\u2019s profoundly changing the worldview of those who participate,\u201d said Holliday. \u201cMany who join the gallery join as professionals who want to tell a story of their patient or caregiver selves. They become their patient self within the professional venue of a conference. It is powerful\u2026and oh so very real.\u201d\n\nMovements like Holliday\u2019s are finally giving a voice to the importance of the patient perspective when it comes to HIT. Ironically, the HIT movement started to better the patient care experience but has inundated provider\u2019s with so many obstacles (from interoperability to security issues), patients experience was put on the back burner. But as technology evolves, and patients like Holliday shine a light on the issues, a shift placing primary importance on the patient is taking place.\n\nContinue reading\u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "Explore the digital health evolution that is propelling the ePatient movement into the epicenter of healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"description": "Explore the digital health evolution that is propelling the ePatient movement into the epicenter of healthcare.", "title": "In-Depth: Rise of the ePatient Movement - HIT Consultant", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1034, "identifier": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/EPATIENT-MOVEMENT.jpg", "height": 1034}, "updated_time": "2014-07-09T11:42:15-04:00", "url": "http://hitconsultant.net/2014/06/25/rise-of-the-epatient-movement/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Explore the digital health evolution that is propelling the ePatient movement into the epicenter of healthcare.", "creator": "@hitconsultant", "image": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/EPATIENT-MOVEMENT.jpg", "title": "In-Depth: Rise of the ePatient Movement - HIT Consultant", "site": "@hitconsultant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "ZfA9TYzJhTo4Qq5hZKk2GVBYHj0-7Bu73PO0P5jbDaI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/HIT-Consultant-Media/302199219847409", "section": "Health IT", "published_time": "2014-06-25T09:00:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T11:42:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s hard to say that there is one key driver behind the rise of the ePatient.\nBy definition, ePatients are health consumers who participate in their medical care via electronic communications search tools and technologies.\nIronically, the HIT movement started to better the patient care experience but has inundated provider\u2019s with so many obstacles (from interoperability to security issues), patients experience was put on the back burner.\nOnly recently has the ePatient emerged into the HIT equation.\nHolliday founded a movement known as The Walking Gallery of Healthcare, which she premiered at the Washington, DC Health Innovation Week in June, 2011."}
