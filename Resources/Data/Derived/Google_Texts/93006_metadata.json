It published its Surgeon Scorecard on eight different procedures on Tuesday.\n\nAt Citrus Memorial Hospital in Inverness, ProPublica reporters found Dr. Constantine Toumbis was one of three surgeons conducting spinal fusions.\n\nAccording to the Florida Department of Health\u2019s medical license database, Toumbis hasn't faced formal discipline in at least the past decade. But ProPublica found he has one of the highest complication rates in the country.\n\nReporter Marshall Allen said Toumbis\u2019s record of post-surgery complications was widely known among hospital staff. But the release of ProPublica\u2019s Surgeon Scorecard is the first time the public can see it.\n\n\u201cPeople did know that there was a difference between these doctors, and yet the patients would not have any way of knowing that until our information became public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scorecard compares 17,000 U.S. doctors to peers performing the same procedures over a five-year period. Of the more than 800 surgeries in Florida, a third of the patients experienced complications, such as post-surgery infections or death.\n\nThe database is part of ProPublica's ongoing coverage on patient harm, which also includes the ongoing collection of Patient Harm Questionnaires from patients in Florida and across the country.\n\nAllen says the Surgeon Scorecard database only includes hospital billing claims to Medicare - the government insurance for Americans 65 and older. Private insurance information isn't available to the public.\n\nAllen says releasing this information educates patients -- and reminds doctors -- there's no guarantee a procedure is 100 percent safe.\n\n\u201cNot every surgery is low risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really does depend on the surgeon performing the procedure it appears...This wasn\u2019t just at Citrus Memorial. It was at hospitals across the country.\u201d\n\nMary Shedden is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
