Or maybe your new Obamacare insurance plan has a higher cost along with a higher deductible. Or you can't even get on the government site to access this \"wonderful product\" as President Barack Obama (D) called his namesake act.\n\n\n\nWell, don't complain to us, it's not our fault. Go directly to the Obamacare's Facebook page itself and join the thousands of dissatisfied customers to register your complaint such as these.\n\nHow is it that Facebook, which is a non-essential social networking web site, can reliably handle BILLIONS of electronic interactions per second, but the Healthcare.gov site, which is literally the very heart of the Obamacare program wasn't ready for the obvious millions of visitors that you had to know it would be receiving?\n\n\n\nThese prices are outrageous and there are huge deductibles. No one can afford this!\n\n\n\nI got notice that my blue cross was being canceled. The cheapest Obamacare replacement is $160 per month more and my total risk increases from $5000 to $12,500. The good news is that my menopausal wife and I now have maternity, pediatric dental and vision! Thanks a lot.\n\nIf you voted for Barack Hussein Obama, you have ZERO right to complain. If you voted for him twice you owe me an apology and have to pay for MY coverage.\n\n\n\nAs you sign up today folks don't forget your free Obamaphone and to request a copy of Michelle Obama's Healthy food choices book series. \"How to survive on twigs and bark\" ... It will come in handy after you sell your first born to pay for the mandatory premiums!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2013/10/leave_your_obamacare_complaints_here.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Leave your Obamacare complaints here"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4636\"", "article_summary": "Or maybe your new Obamacare insurance plan has a higher cost along with a higher deductible.\nSo, you're one of the many hundreds of thousands (so far) who have been dropped from your perfectly decent health care insurance because of Obamacare.\nThe cheapest Obamacare replacement is $160 per month more and my total risk increases from $5000 to $12,500.\nOr you can't even get on the government site to access this \"wonderful product\" as President Barack Obama (D) called his namesake act.\nGo directly to the Obamacare's Facebook page itself and join the thousands of dissatisfied customers to register your complaint such as these."}
