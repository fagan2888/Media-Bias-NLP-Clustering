The FDA gets sued over frankenfish approval, that\u2019s what happens. The groups insist that the GMO fish is unsafe for human consumption and is possibly dangerous to the environment.\n\nThe coalition includes groups such as Food and Water Watch, Friends of the Earth and the Center for Food Safety (CFS). The suit, filed in federal court in California, names Sylvia Burwell (as the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the FDA as defendants.\n\nThe suit alleges that the approval of AquaBounty Technology, Inc.\u2019s AquAdvantage salmon was a mistake. AquaBounty originally stated to the regulatory agencies that it would confine its efforts to two locations: Panama and Canada. According to the coalition, the company has been telling investors that it plans to expand well beyond the two FDA-approved facilities. This, the coalition says, puts the FDA on notice that there may be environmental risks that it chose not to investigate.\n\nIn a statement, the coalition said, \u201cSince at least 2010, the company has been engaged in efforts to expand the production of GE salmon to facilities around the world \u2026 and to sell the salmon in other markets, including Canada, Argentina, Brazil and China. This [recent approval] constitutes merely the company\u2019s effort to open the regulatory door.\u201d\n\nThe groups further allege that the agency\u2019s environmental assessment didn\u2019t go far enough in light of the \u201csignificant and irreversible environmental, ecological and intertwined socioeconomic harms\u201d that might result from such a large, yet understudied, project.\n\nThe salmon sounds like something that came out of a mad scientist\u2019s lab: the Atlantic salmon\u2019s genetic profile serves as the \u201cbase,\u201d but genes from the Pacific Chinook salmon and the deep-water ocean eelpout are added to increase the speed of the fishes\u2019 maturity (i.e., market readiness).\n\nThe FDA-approved plan, according to the suit, has the eggs grown in Canada and shipped to Panama where the fish will be raised and slaughtered.\n\nThe CFS raised the question of whether the FDA had adequately considered the potential negative environmental impact of the GMO salmon when the agency announced its approval in November 2014. The CFS, along with other consumer groups, including Japan-based consumer advocacy group the Seikatsu Club Consumers\u2019 Co-operative Union of Japan, again spoke out against the FDA\u2019s decision in December 2014. The Seikatsu Club and the CFS said the approval was \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\nThe FDA approval was made with certain conditions the agency said were based on AquaBounty\u2019s information and peer-reviewed data, both of which showed that the GMO salmon is just as nutritious and safe as its non-GMO Atlantic salmon relative.\n\nSource:\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "What happens when an alliance of food-safety groups gets together to discuss\u00a0genetically engineered salmon?
