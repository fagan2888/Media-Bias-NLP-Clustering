This seemed to be the perfect movie for us, so off we went to the Galleria theater. It started out pretty well, and then George Washington was shot by a sniper and the colonies supposedly lost the American Revolution.

Slavery, Civil War, other wars \u2014 I took issue with leaving out the Korean War as I am a veteran of the Korean War, 1st Cavalry Division, 1951, and the United States stopped North Korea from overrunning a very prosperous democracy.\n\nThe movie continued with the Vietnam War and World War II, and it mentioned the disastrous Iraq War as a positive war with America restoring oil to the Iraqi people. We all know that the oil is controlled by the big international oil companies.\n\nThe rest of the movie seems to be about the rise of capitalism in the United States and copied by the rest of the world. This all made some sense until out of the clear blue sky came an attack on our current president, Barack Obama.\n\nFirst, the movie portrayed him as a disciple of a well-known communist \u2014 then it started to describe the Affordable Care Act as a failure along with the charge that large insurance companies orchestrated it (total garbage). It is working very well and is very popular with the American people. The Republican House has voted more than 50 times to repeal all or part of it with no success.\n\nAt this point, I began to boo in the theater and make unkind comments about the movie. My wife and I got up and left. As we were leaving, the movie was attacking Hillary Clinton (how desperate is the right wing?).\n\nWe found the manager and demanded our money back. He promptly did so; it seems as if he was expecting more people to request a refund. This theater is no place for this kind of political propaganda. Shame on the Galleria management for injecting this kind of political attack alongside the theater\u2019s legitimate offerings. The public deserves an apology.\n\nRUDY M.
