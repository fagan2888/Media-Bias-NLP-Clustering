Ohio Gov. John Kasich trounced a disastrous Democrat for his November re-election win, but in 23 of 88 counties Kasich received fewer votes than he got in 2010.

Based on official results from the secretary of state, Kasich received 12,504 fewer votes in Butler County, 8,369 fewer votes in Warren County, 7,740 fewer votes in Franklin County and 3,368 fewer votes in Clermont County in the 2014 general election than in the 2010 general election.

Cuyahoga County, a Democratic stronghold and the home of Democrat gubernatorial candidate Ed FitzGerald, accounted for 23,708 votes of the Republican governor’s statewide 55,662 vote increase over his narrow 2010 victory.

Fox News exit polling indicated 26 percent of self-identified liberals and 25 percent of Democrats voted for Kasich. Exit polls also indicated Kasich won 33 percent of voters who think Obamacare “did not go far enough” and 31 percent of voters who think Obamacare “was about right.”

Kasich claims he would like to see Obamacare repealed — but he unilaterally implemented Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which has added more than 450,000 Ohioans to the state’s most costly entitlement program.

An Oct. 1 Quinnipiac University poll found 25 percent of likely Democratic voters planned to pick Kasich over FitzGerald. Election results suggest Kasich won tens of thousands of Democrats who would have supported a credible Democrat challenger. Every down-ticket Democrat running for a statewide executive office received more votes than FitzGerald in almost every county.

Statewide, FitzGerald received 313,966 fewer votes than treasurer candidate Connie Pillich, 169,067 fewer than attorney general candidate David Pepper, 139,946 fewer votes than auditor candidate John Patrick Carney and 65,116 fewer than secretary of state candidate Nina Turner.

“This is information that is necessary for every Ohio voter to be aware of and understand,” Ohio Liberty Coalition president Glenn Newman told Ohio Watchdog in a phone interview. An umbrella organization supporting local limited-government groups throughout the state, OLC has been sharply critical of Kasich’s support for Medicaid expansion, Common Core and a tax hike on oil and gas drilling.

FitzGerald was finished by early August, after newspapers reported on a 2012 incident in which he was found in a parked car at 4:30 a.m. with a woman who was not his wife. The press also reported FitzGerald had driven illegally with a temporary driver’s license for the better part of a decade.

FitzGerald’s campaign, already far behind Kasich in fundraising, reported contributions of $111,137 in August and $54,452 in September. Kasich’s campaign raised $1.1 million in August and $1.5 million in September.

From Oct. 1 until after the Nov. 4 election, Kasich received $1.2 million in cash contributions; FitzGerald received $47,377.

With his Democrat opponent imploding three months before Election Day, Kasich backers spent big to run up a 31-point landslide win. During the final two months of the race, the Kasich campaign and Ohio Republican Party poured more than $7.5 million into print and television ads.

Kasich’s campaign spent $1.9 million on media buys in September and $4.9 million in October. Although down-ticket Republicans were in competitive races throughout the state, ORP spent $639,476 on Kasich mailers in October and November.

Overall turnout in the Nov. 4 election — 41 percent, with 3.1 million of the state’s 7.7 million registered voters casting ballots and less than 2 million voting for Kasich — was 806,169 lower than in Nov. 2010. In the May primary, 15 percent of Republican voters declined to vote for Kasich even though he was unopposed and spent millions on ads in the spring.

The Kasich campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Kasich’s general election vote totals were lower in 2014 than in 2010 in the 23 counties listed below:
