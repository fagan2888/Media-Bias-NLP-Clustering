While McCarthy claims she\u2019s not part of an anti-vaccine movement, rather she\u2019s \u201cpro-safe vaccine,\u201d she was a driving force behind the idea (and fear) vaccines can increase a child\u2019s risk for autism, albeit studies suggesting the opposite. So comedian Amy Schumer used dog moms to poke fun at anti-vaxxers in the latest episode of Inside Amy Schumer.\n\nTo be fair, Schumer pokes fun at both groups: the women who treat their dogs like people, and the parents who don\u2019t get their children vaccinated. After dropping her dog Addison off at doggy daycare, Schumer gets to talking with other moms about their pets. Each mom tries to one-up the other by sharing devastating details about their dog, from where they were rescued to their \u201csevere body image issues.\u201d\n\nSchumer volunteers Addison suffers from FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out \u2014 to which one mom suggests she consider medication. Prozac and Valtrex are OK, but not vaccination. One mom says she didn\u2019t get her \u201cguy vaccinated because Jenny McCarthy said it can cause \u2018pawtism.\u2019\u201d Schumer adds she follows McCarthy\u2019s advice too, because \u201cthere\u2019s nothing she doesn\u2019t know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "inside, amy, schumer, parodies, anti, vaxxer, jenny, mccarthy, features, dog, moms, afraid", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Comedian Amy Schumer pokes fun at parents influenced by celebrities' unscientific opinion.", "title": "'Inside Amy Schumer' Parodies Anti-Vaxxers [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/inside-amy-schumer-parodies-anti-vaxxer-jenny-mccarthy-features-dog-moms-afraid-334346", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/20/inside-amy-schumer-parodies-anti-vaxxer-jenny-mccarthy-features-dog-moms-afraid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Comedian Amy Schumer pokes fun at parents influenced by celebrities' unscientific opinion.", "title": "'Inside Amy Schumer' Parodies Anti-Vaxxers [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/inside-amy-schumer-parodies-anti-vaxxer-jenny-mccarthy-features-dog-moms-afraid-334346", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/20/inside-amy-schumer-parodies-anti-vaxxer-jenny-mccarthy-features-dog-moms-afraid.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/20/inside-amy-schumer-parodies-anti-vaxxer-jenny-mccarthy-features-dog-moms-afraid.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-20T15:54:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T16:00:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Comedian Amy Schumer pokes fun at parents influenced by celebrities' unscientific opinion."}, "article_summary": "So comedian Amy Schumer used dog moms to poke fun at anti-vaxxers in the latest episode of Inside Amy Schumer.\nYou may remember how actress Jenny McCarthy became a touchstone for anti-vaccinators following her son\u2019s diagnosis.\nOne mom says she didn\u2019t get her \u201cguy vaccinated because Jenny McCarthy said it can cause \u2018pawtism.\u2019\u201d Schumer adds she follows McCarthy\u2019s advice too, because \u201cthere\u2019s nothing she doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\nAfter dropping her dog Addison off at doggy daycare, Schumer gets to talking with other moms about their pets.\nTo be fair, Schumer pokes fun at both groups: the women who treat their dogs like people, and the parents who don\u2019t get their children vaccinated."}
