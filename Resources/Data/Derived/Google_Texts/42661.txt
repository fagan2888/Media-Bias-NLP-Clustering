Each year, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood‘s CMA Awards monologue gets stronger. The friends and frequent collaborators have grown more comfortable with country’s biggest stage, and their opening segment tends to reflect that. Many of the most unforgettable Brad and Carrie CMA Awards moments comes from their last three monologues, but not all.

We’ll give you a few code words here, but you’ll need to watch the video above to see all the highlights: Bocephus, Obamacare, the “reveal” … these are three of the eight jokes/skits/songs we feature in this list. Honestly, a separate video could be made of all of Paisley’s one-liners, and yet another of the duo’s parody songs!
