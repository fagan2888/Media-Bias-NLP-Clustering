That coalition included not only NATO allies, but also such Middle Eastern countries as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need to go and destroy ISIS, and you cannot just do it by bombing people,\u201d Kasich told an audience of about 150 people Saturday at Colby-Sawyer College. \u201cWe need to be putting a coalition together of people with similar aims, and we need to be in the air, on the ground. \u2026 We need to destroy them wherever they are, plain and simple, with no discussion. Because the longer we wait, the more complicated and more costly it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s call for escalating the fight stopped short of the heightened rhetoric of some rivals for the Republican presidential nomination after Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, for example, suggested to The New York Times that \u201cwhat I believe we\u2019re facing is the next world war.\u201d\n\nDespite his call for escalating the fight against ISIS abroad and at home, Kasich, like members of his party in the US Senate, rejected Democratic calls to ban the purchase of weapons in the United States by anyone whose name appears on a terror watch list. (The Senate defeated such a ban Thursday by a vote of 54 against and 45 for it. Just one Republican supported the measure.)\n\n\u201cShould we figure out a way to keep people like that from being able to get firearms? I think the answer would be yes,\u201d Kasich said in response to a question.\n\nBut, he added, blocking those on the list from buying firearms might tip them off that they are being watched. \u201cWe have to figure out how to do this without changing \u2026 their lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Fraidstern, a self-identified Democrat who asked the question, said he wasn\u2019t satisfied with Kasich\u2019s answer.\n\n\u201cIf someone wanted to fly on an airplane, they wouldn\u2019t be able to fly, so they know they\u2019re on a terrorist list,\u201d he said. Furthermore, he said, \u201cI would rather have them know that they are on the watch list, rather than [for them to] be able to get\u201d the weapons.\n\nSeveral other questioners asked Kasich about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Rescinding the law has long been a goal of the GOP majority in Congress. Kasich said that while he agreed it should be repealed, he said Republicans should first have something with which to replace it. He defended Medicare, the health care program serving senior citizens, as something that is \u201cvital for us.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Kasich\u2019s presentation, Chris and Roger Berger said that they were fully committed to voting for him.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a very measured thinker. He won\u2019t plunge into something impossible,\u201d said Chris Berger. \u201cHe will take the bold leadership we need. I feel we need something more than we have now.\u201d\n\nKasich, who has campaigned frequently in New Hampshire, has polled between 7 and 9 percent in the last four poll results reported there, according to RealClearPolitics.com. His 8 percent average puts him fifth in the Republican race.\n\nThe state\u2019s primary will likely take place Feb. 9.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1500281668", "eomportal-id": 394058, "description": "GOP presidential candidate John Kasich call for an international response similar to that in the first Gulf War.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "GOP presidential candidate John Kasich call for an international response similar to that in the first Gulf War.", "title": "International coalition needed to fight ISIS, Kasich says - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/12/06/international-coalition-needed-fight-isis-kasich-says/1qr7fcpqlgaRYkvvGRsxPJ/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/12/06/BostonGlobe.com/Politics/Images/be248974dc9d4241b8ee4e9ee8a374fb-be248974dc9d4241b8ee4e9ee8a374fb-0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 09:06:28 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "efdaca90-9c60-11e5-ba6b-921ced89275f"}, "article_summary": "At that time, in 1990-91, the United States organized a broad-based international coalition to repel Iraqi forces from Kuwait.\nNEW LONDON, N.H. \u2014 Ohio Governor John Kasich is calling for the United States to forge an international coalition similar to the first Gulf War to fight ISIS on the battlefield as well as from the air.\nThat coalition included not only NATO allies, but also such Middle Eastern countries as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria.\nAdvertisement\u201cWe need to go and destroy ISIS, and you cannot just do it by bombing people,\u201d Kasich told an audience of about 150 people Saturday at Colby-Sawyer College.\n\u201cWe need to be putting a coalition together of people with similar aims, and we need to be in the air, on the ground."}
