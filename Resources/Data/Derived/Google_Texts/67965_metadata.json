But Cruz, lodged in the middle of the 2016 GOP presidential pack, is taking his criticism of fellow Republican senators to a new level \u2014 rhetorically and in his new book out Tuesday, \u201cA Time for Truth.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz accuses McConnell and GOP leadership of maneuvering to dry up his fundraising and plant hit pieces in the press aimed at hurting him politically. He says GOP leaders cowered from joining him in big fights over the debt ceiling, Obamacare and gun control, accusing his colleagues of \u201cmendacity\u201d and capitulating to Democrats to avoid bad headlines.\n\nHe contends that McConnell misled him in vowing to stay out of primaries when Cruz accepted a senior-level position at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And he accuses a GOP rival, Rand Paul of Kentucky, of parroting McConnell\u2019s talking points by seeking to \u201cundermine\u201d his efforts to defund Obamacare during the 2013 fight that led to the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in the Senate, I\u2019ve been amazed how many senators pose one way in public \u2014 as fiscal conservatives or staunch tea party supporters \u2014 and then in private do little or nothing to advance those principles,\u201d Cruz writes in his 342-page book.\n\nDisparaging Washington, of course, is one of the more timeworn campaign tactics of presidential hopefuls. What\u2019s less typical is the personal, pointed way Cruz is doing it as his campaign ramps up. He\u2019s leaning heavily into his brand of unapologetic and confrontational conservatism, arguing that GOP leadership\u2019s compromises with Democrats are nothing more than \u201csurrender.\u201d\n\nYet presenting himself as a polarizing figure at war with the party establishment is a risky way to try to become the Republican presidential nominee. Plus, Republicans are beginning to undercut several of Cruz\u2019s assertions, including over his role at the NRSC, which received a giant donation from the senator\u2019s campaign committee last fall, despite his sharp criticism of the group in his book.\n\nCruz\u2019s book is in keeping with his stepped-up effort in recent days to portray himself as the one GOP candidate who\u2019s taken on party leadership. On the Senate floor last week, he accused unnamed Republicans of \u201cquietly celebrating\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold Obamacare subsidies. After vocally endorsing trade legislation backed by party leaders, Cruz flipped on the issue, bemoaning in an op-ed \u201ccorrupt\u201d Washington deal making on the matter and singling out McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner for misleading conservatives.\n\nAnd in the opening chapter of his book, Cruz calls out McConnell and his GOP colleagues for \u201cchicanery\u201d by publicly opposing an increase in the borrowing limit while privately trying to let the debt ceiling increase in 2014 without their fingerprints. When he told a California GOP donor in 2014 about the debt ceiling dispute, Cruz recalls the donor saying repeatedly: \u201cThe bastards.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the 2016 primary, you\u2019re going to have 15 candidates up there going, \u2018I\u2019m conservative. No, no, I\u2019m conservative.\u2019 And what we see is they go to Washington and they don\u2019t do what they said they would do,\u201d Cruz told NPR Monday in an interview about his book. \u201cI think the question Republican primary voters should ask is, \u2018When have you stood up against the Washington cartel? When have you stood up against leaders in our own party?\u2019\u201d\n\nDon Stewart, a McConnell spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nSince coming to Washington in 2013, Cruz has co-sponsored only three bills that have become law, none of them controversial. But in his book, Cruz suggests that cutting deals to pass legislation shouldn\u2019t be the gauge of senatorial success.\n\n\u201cSometimes, people ask me, \u2018When you have a room full of Republican senators yelling at you to back down and compromise your principles, why don\u2019t you just give in?\u2019\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cThe answer is simple. I just remember all those men and women who pleaded with me, \u2018Don\u2019t become one of them.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his book, Cruz writes that immediately after he won his 2012 Senate race, McConnell made a \u201cconcentrated effort to befriend me.\u201d Cruz said he was \u201cwary,\u201d but \u201cglad to reciprocate.\u201d He joined McConnell on an official trip to Afghanistan and Israel and was the GOP leader\u2019s guest at the 2013 Alfalfa Club Dinner. McConnell awarded Cruz with plum committee assignments \u2014 even a spot on the Senate Rules Committee, which is typically reserved for more senior members.\n\nAs an added bonus, McConnell named him vice chairman of the NRSC, the main committee aimed at protecting incumbents and winning Senate seats for Republicans. In Cruz\u2019s telling, McConnell wanted to enlist Cruz as an emissary to the tea party and had \u201cpromised that the committee would stay out of primaries from here on out.\u201d\n\nWhen the NRSC began to back GOP incumbents in contested primaries, and help other Republicans it favored in open seats, Cruz said he \u201cstopped asking donors to support\u201d the committee.\n\n\u201cIt was yet another lesson: Assurances in Washington come with an expiration date.\u201d\n\nJosh Holmes, a former chief of staff to McConnell, questioned the accuracy of Cruz\u2019s recollection of the episode.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall any misunderstandings at the time Sen. Cruz agreed to serve about Leader McConnell\u2019s view that the first job of the NRSC is to protect incumbent Republicans in primary and general elections,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cAs any casual observer will recall, McConnell was not exactly shy about expressing himself publicly and privately on this topic, and until today, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone who was unclear about his position.\u201d\n\nAccording to documents obtained by POLITICO, Cruz\u2019s decision to transfer $250,000 to the committee in September \u2014 during general election season \u2014 tied him for second most among all GOP senators last cycle. Moreover, Republican sources said that Cruz was in regular communication with senior NRSC staff about where he could play a role to help GOP candidates in the heat of fall campaign.\n\nBut a chunk of the book focuses on Cruz\u2019s war with his colleagues.\n\nCruz, a Harvard Law graduate and former Texas solicitor general, says many of his colleagues lack a background of a litigator and let witnesses off the hook during oversight hearings. \u201cUnfortunately, many senators are wholly untrained in this area.\u201d\n\nAfter he was sworn into office in 2013, Cruz made his mark early on during confirmation hearings over Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination to be secretary of defense, even suggesting that the former Nebraska senator may have benefited financially from extremist groups and hostile nations, such as North Korea.\n\nWhile Cruz writes in his book, \u201cI made a mistake when I uttered the words North Korea,\u201d he said that Hagel was not forthcoming about a gap in his finances and said the nominee was aided by \u201cmedia complicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media\u2019s personal attacks on me were a sign of things to come,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nIndeed, Cruz doesn\u2019t hide his contempt for the press, accusing McConnell\u2019s team of going to POLITICO and The Wall Street Journal editorial pages with negative stories about him. This \u2014 compounded with what he said were threats from GOP leaders to K Street and big-spending political action committees not to help him out \u2014 were meant to send him a message, Cruz wrote.\n\nCruz said \u201conce I demonstrated that I would stand up to party leadership,\u201d members of the GOP leadership warned K street and PACs they would be \u201cfrozen out\u201d if they continued to support him.\n\nMcConnell and Cruz\u2019s relationship took a hit in May 2013 when the Texas freshman refused to allow House and Senate negotiators to meet for conference negotiations on the budget. He believed they would use it as a backdoor way to raise the debt ceiling. It went further south that fall when Cruz demanded that any spending bill to keep the government open also include provisions to defund the health care law \u2014 a dispute that led to the 16-day government shutdown.\n\nWhat made things worse was that Cruz helped raise money for the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group trying to defeat GOP senators like McConnell in primaries. (After the shutdown, Cruz privately told his colleagues he would no longer fundraise for SCF.)\n\nCruz bashes his colleagues for their unwillingness to join his push to defund the health care law, many of whom saw it as a poorly conceived idea that had no chance of success.\n\n\u201cImagine what would have happened if the Republican Senate leadership had simply decided \u2026 let\u2019s support House Republicans,\u201d Cruz said. If Cruz had just listened to GOP Senate leaders, he wrote: \u201cWe will never stop Obamacare. .. At every stage, their plan was to avoid the fight.\u201d\n\nTo make his point, Cruz launched a floor speech for 21 straight hours in late September 2013. During the marathon speech, Cruz said he and Utah Sen. Mike Lee were surprised that Paul seemed intent on hurting his effort.\n\n\u201cAnother tea party senator was notably less helpful,\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cMy friend Rand Paul came to the Senate floor to ask questions that seemed deliberately designed to undermine our efforts. \u2026 His questions echoed the skeptical attacks of Mitch McConnell, and I marveled that Rand had decided not to be with us in this fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMike Lee is not an easily excitable guy, but he was so upset by this that I thought he was going to need a sedative.\u201d\n\nAides to Lee and Paul both declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u2018I\u2019ve been amazed how many senators pose one way in public \u2026 and then in private do little or nothing.\u2019", "title": "Cruz unloads on McConnell, Paul in new book", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/ted-cruz-slams-mitch-mcconnell-rand-paul-book-119565.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/29/150629_ted_cruz_gty2_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Senate,2016 Elections,Mitch McConnell,Ted Cruz 2016,Rand Paul,Books,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "\u2018I\u2019ve been amazed how many senators pose one way in public \u2026 and then in private do little or nothing.\u2019", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But in his book, Cruz suggests that cutting deals to pass legislation shouldn\u2019t be the gauge of senatorial success.\nIf Cruz had just listened to GOP Senate leaders, he wrote: \u201cWe will never stop Obamacare.\n\u201cImagine what would have happened if the Republican Senate leadership had simply decided \u2026 let\u2019s support House Republicans,\u201d Cruz said.\nMcConnell awarded Cruz with plum committee assignments \u2014 even a spot on the Senate Rules Committee, which is typically reserved for more senior members.\nWhat made things worse was that Cruz helped raise money for the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group trying to defeat GOP senators like McConnell in primaries."}
