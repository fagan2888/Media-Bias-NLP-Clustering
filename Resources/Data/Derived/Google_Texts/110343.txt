High winds, snow squalls pelt area

hello

Electricity largely has been restored to a portion of northwest Batavia after high winds snapped utility poles and caused power outages along Western Avenue.

Retailers along Randall Road such as Kohl's and Hobby Lobby regained power late Saturday afternoon.

Batavia Mayor Jeff Schielke said three or four poles were damaged by winds estimated at 60 to 70 mph.

"Its just the wrong place at the right time," he said.

City crews also were dealing with a tree that blew down onto a car and garage in the 100 block of North Jackson Street, he said.

The utility poles on Western Avenue were replaced two years ago, after a half-dozen snapped during a violent storm in July 2012. After that storm the city discovered five of the poles had significant rot. That prompted the city to check utility poles citywide, and replace many.

Saturday's strong winds and snow showers will be followed by below-normal temperatures for most of the next week, according to AccuWeather.com.

Another round of gusty winds is coming Sunday as temperatures rebound for the day, before dropping again.

Highs will be in the 40s on Monday and Tuesday, AccuWeather Meteorologist Steve Travis said, about 10 degrees below normal for the beginning of April.

"Though conditions will be mainly dry, it'll be chilly," he said.

While temperatures will hit above the 50-degree mark on Wednesday, showers may dampen any outdoor activities.
