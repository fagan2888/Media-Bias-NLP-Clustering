In fact, they're going to be more present than ever in our skies, seas, and on land. Some of us might even buy them for ourselves.\n\nAs Shane Harris previous wrote for Reason, not only is \u201cthe military is planning for a future that relies more on drones than it does on manned planes,\u201d but also \u201cthe market in domestic drones [is] poised for takeoff. A drone revolution is coming.\u201d Below are a few pieces of unmanned technology, some of which are already being implemented. (Others are still at the drawing board.)\n\n1. Unmanned Aerial (and Aquatic and Terrestrial) Vehicles\n\nSandia National Laboratories are developing and testing \u201cmulti-modal vehicles\u201d that can fly, swim, drive, and jump. All of these features are operated through a single interface. Concept videos show the vehicle's ability to drop exterior layers, such as its wings when it hits the water and its paddles when it drives onto land. Sandia anticipates that the Volant will provide quick, flexible assistance to manned operations without requiring a whole army of robots outfitted exclusively for certain situations.\n\nThe Volant's design is not without drawbacks, though. Wired explains that \u201cbecause it sheds parts and material as it transforms from one mode to another, recovery is almost impossible \u2014 making every mission an expensive one-way trip.\u201d\n\n2. The Rail-Launched Stealth Bat\n\nThe Bat is a drone with a blended wing body that makes it stealthier than conventional designs. It also relies on a mobile hydraulic-rail launcher for take off and a large net for recovery.Unlike larger, more cumbersome combat drones, the Bat does not require a runway. Being freed from the tarmac allows this drone to take off in rougher environments.\n\nThe Bat may be small, but it is fierce. Current models comes in 10 to 12-foot wingspan, can fly 70 mph, and can carry a 3.2 cubic foot payload. Until recently, this drone was resigned to \u201cintelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition and communications,\u201d according to Northrop Grumman, producer of the Bat. But, it was recently outfitted with a \u201cminiature electronic attack payload\u201d that makes it capable of engaging in combat.\n\n3. Drones for Personal Use\n\nFrog, a product strategy and design firm, is working on ways to integrate unmanned aerial vehicles into daily activities and transform them into \u201coff-body wearables.\u201d These small drones would be privately owned tools more akin to a flying roomba than a war machine.\n\nThe Guardian Angel concept drone would fly along with its owner on jogs. Guided by a signal from a heart-rate monitor, this drone \u201chelps you adjust your performance by providing instant feedback,\u201d according to the design team. Other designs include the \u201cPaparazzi\u201d drone that would film its owner for social media purposes. Or at least that's the idea. The company doesn't anticipate completing these devices until 2020.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Drones aren't going away any time soon.
