The ideological part is fairly easy to understand: Trump represents (among other things) a revolt of ideologically-heterodox Republicans against the party\u2019s litmus tests, which lots of people saw coming even if we didn\u2019t imagine would take this form or rope in quite this much support. But the electability issue is trickier to parse: No Republican (or Democratic) primary in generations has produced a nominee with anything like Trump\u2019s unfavorable ratings or long general-election odds, and you would think the combination of eight years of Obama and the hated Hillary waiting in the wings would have concentrated voters\u2019 minds on that, ah, problematic aspect of Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nNot so, not so \u2026 but then neither have Republican voters simply cast the electability issue aside. Instead, on the evidence of polls, even many not-Trump voters have convinced themselves that Trump is the most electable candidate available, that he\u2019s better positioned than his rivals to beat Hillary, and that given the alternatives supporting him is actually the pragmatic thing to do.\n\nI don\u2019t have a complete theory for how this self-deception has been accomplished: My column threw out several possibilities but hardly exhausted the list. But the possibilities I cited were mostly sub-rational \u2014 a reaction to Trump\u2019s media dominance, a reaction to his winning streak, a reaction to his demagogue\u2019s charisma, a tribal wishful thinking \u2014 plus the logical fallacy that having once proved pundits wrong Trump can always do so.\n\nFor the most rational case for Trump\u2019s electability, though, and one that some Republicans have probably internalized, I recommend reading this Will Rahn piece touting Trump\u2019s chances against Hillary, and particularly these passages:\n\nHillary\u2019s weak points aside, Trump also has one main advantage, which is that he\u2019d be probably the most moderate nominee in decades. Now, Trump is not normally what we think of when we think of moderates \u2013 \u201creactionary moderate\u201d is perhaps the best term to describe him. But border walls and Muslim bans aside, Trump really most closely resembles an old-school northeastern centrist Republican. Trump likes the welfare state. He\u2019s made protecting entitlements central to his pitch. It\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s likely, at heart, socially liberal \u2014 the story of how he became anti-abortion, for example, doesn\u2019t make a great deal of sense. \u2026 And given the milieu he\u2019s always existed in, it\u2019s hard to believe he really opposes gay marriage, either. Trump has had the benefit of never really fleshing out what he believes about specific policies; nearly a year into his campaign, we still don\u2019t know what he\u2019d replace Obamacare with. He is, as his longtime advisor Roger Stone says, a \u201cbig picture\u201d guy: pro-business, pro-military, pro-America. The rest is all open to negotiation, to making the best deal. And, as Jim Antle notes over at The Washington Examiner, that puts him pretty squarely into the vast middle of the American electorate \u2026 Now, there are still plenty of reasons why someone who agrees with Trump on a whole mess of issues might still be unwilling to vote for him. But it\u2019s a mistake to assume that the man doesn\u2019t have a natural constituency outside the GOP.\n\nIt\u2019s true: If you just take Trump\u2019s mixture of positions, quasi-positions and non-positions and apply them to our current partisan divides, he does seem like he could have a large constituency in the American center. As a blue-state social liberal campaigning as an America First populist, he offers a kind of mash-up of stances taken by Acela corridor Bloombergists and Middle American radicals, and while some of those positions cost you turnout on the Republican side, on paper you could make up for that deficit by winning voters in the center who are turned off by libertarianism or neoconservatism or religious conservatism, but who\u2019d give a tough-talking businessman who doesn\u2019t seem all that ideological a second look.\n\nSo this could be what some Republican voters, especially moderate-ish Republican voters, are thinking when they imagine that Trump is more electable than his more ideologically conservative rivals. And if the pundits are all proven wrong one more time and Trump makes a real race of it, this will be the reason why.\n\nBut we won\u2019t be, because this logic lacks the cultural imagination required to see that Trump\u2019s positions won\u2019t get a hearing with groups that might find them appealing otherwise, precisely because they\u2019re associated with, well, Donald Trump himself.\n\nAre there Hispanic swing voters who would vote for a Republican who promised to protect entitlements and avoid messy foreign wars? Sure. Are there upper-middle-class white women who would vote for a Republican who seemed to be friendly to gay rights and favorably disposed to Planned Parenthood? No doubt. Are there African-American voters who would support a candidate who wants to renegotiate trade deals, limit low-skilled immigration and spend more money on U.S. infrastructure? I\u2019m certain there are.\n\nBut will any of these constituencies vote for Donald Trump? For Trump the rank misogynist, Trump the KKK-flirter, Trump the deport-the-Mexican-rapists candidate? If you read seven of Trump\u2019s positions to the median Hispanic voter, they might agree with five or six of them \u2026 but Trump\u2019s favorability/unfavorability ratings with Hispanics are 12/77. If you go back to last August, before the campaign began, Trump had a 20 percent favorable rating with African-Americans; by Republican standards that\u2019s not terrible. Six months of race-baiting later, he\u2019s winning 5 percent of the black vote against Hillary Clinton. And women \u2026 well, he\u2019s losing women, let\u2019s put it that way, on a scale that no Republican nominee ever has before.\n\nHence his essential unelectability, which no centrist positioning is likely to much change. And the fact that so many Republican voters can\u2019t seem to see this, haven\u2019t been able to see this, may be a sign of cultural isolation above all. They can see how Trump might be able to win on the issues if he hadn\u2019t alienated so many millions of Americans on the basis of their race or sex \u2026 but they can\u2019t quite grasp how powerful that alienation is for the people who experience it, and how impossible it will be for Trump to overcome.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160428125700, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 28, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1461862620, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:57:00-04:00"}, "keywords": "Clinton Hillary Rodham,Trump Donald J,Abortion,Blacks,Hispanic-Americans,Immigration and Emigration,Presidential Election of 2016,Same-Sex Marriage Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,United States,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/The Idea of Trump's Electability ( 20160428 )", "description": "Why many Republicans believe that Trump can win in November.", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Trump, Donald J", "twitter": {"description": "Why many Republicans believe that Trump can win in November.", "title": "The Idea of Trump's Electability", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/the-idea-of-trumps-electability/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "news_keywords": "Abortion,Blacks;African-Americans,Hispanic Americans", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 28, 2016", "org": "Republican Party", "geo": "United States", "utime": 20160428165700, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160428, "pdate": 20160428, "des": "Abortion;Blacks;Hispanic-Americans;Immigration and Emigration;Presidential Election of 2016;Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships;United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "Why many Republicans believe that Trump can win in November.", "title": "The Idea of Trump's Electability", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/the-idea-of-trumps-electability/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/the-idea-of-trumps-electability/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Idea of Trump's Electability", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "If you read seven of Trump\u2019s positions to the median Hispanic voter, they might agree with five or six of them \u2026 but Trump\u2019s favorability/unfavorability ratings with Hispanics are 12/77.\nNot so, not so \u2026 but then neither have Republican voters simply cast the electability issue aside.\nSo this could be what some Republican voters, especially moderate-ish Republican voters, are thinking when they imagine that Trump is more electable than his more ideologically conservative rivals.\nAnd the fact that so many Republican voters can\u2019t seem to see this, haven\u2019t been able to see this, may be a sign of cultural isolation above all.\nAnd women \u2026 well, he\u2019s losing women, let\u2019s put it that way, on a scale that no Republican nominee ever has before."}
