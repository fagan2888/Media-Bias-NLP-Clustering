The greener grass may be under your feet.

We all love one-liners. They are the grist of the comedy mill for many comedians — from classic performers like Henny Youngman and Rodney Dangerfield through hundreds of late night monologues from Letterman and Leno to Fallon.

What do one-liners have to do with gaining a competitive edge in the benefits business? These relatively simple thoughts can provide a valuable, thought-provoking stimulus. As an example, last month I closed with a one-liner: “The future is a great place to do business.” I first heard that around 30 years ago, and every so often I think over what I am doing to help make the future become that great place.
