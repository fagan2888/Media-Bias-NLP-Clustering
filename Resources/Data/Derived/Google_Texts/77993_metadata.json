She was 79.\n\nShe and her then-husband, Clarence L. Werner, founded Werner Enterprises in 1956 with one truck. She worked there until she retired from the business in 1984. Werner Enterprises now operates internationally and has about 13,000 employees and independent contractors.\n\nGloria Werner started out doing the bookkeeping, and eventually oversaw financial transactions and handled regulatory reporting to various government agencies.\n\n\u201cI kind of like to think of her as one of the first real working women executives,\u201d Werner-Robertson said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t take over her whole life, so she had a good balance.\u201d\n\nWerner was born Oct. 27, 1934, on her family\u2019s farm in Petersburg, Nebraska. She met Clarence Werner at the wedding of her brother and his sister, and a long distance courtship ensued. They married and settled in Council Bluffs, where they founded Werner Enterprises. In 1977 the company moved to Omaha, where Gloria Werner lived out the rest of her life.\n\nAfter retiring, she threw herself into the lives of her grandchildren, Werner-Robertson said, often swooping in to watch them when parents were out of town or between day cares and nannies. \u201cShe was so dedicated to her family,\u201d Werner-Robertson said. \u201cShe just really left her schedule open so she could help like that.\u201d\n\nWerner also was a voracious reader interested in current affairs and politics, her daughter said. \u201cShe was very interested in her local community and what was going on and how she could be a good citizen.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her daughter, Werner is survived by her children Gary Werner, Greg Werner and Curt Werner; 12 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.\n\nVisitation is scheduled for 5 p.m. Tuesday at St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church, 15353 Pacific St., with a vigil service at 7 p.m. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the church.\n\nContact the writer: 402-444-1414, paige.yowell@owh.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "The Werner Enterprises co-founder still found time to devote to family.", "title": "Gloria Werner's hard work a big part of trucking company's success", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/money/gloria-werner-s-hard-work-a-big-part-of-trucking/article_d675e94e-8cc2-5e0b-8df5-4d3f2c598f37.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/f7/0f737e6a-e39e-11e3-b10c-0017a43b2370/538130264abc0.image.jpg?resize=300%2C374", "height": 374}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "money,metro", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "money,metro", "description": "The Werner Enterprises co-founder still found time to devote to family."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf984\"", "article_summary": "Gloria Werner started out doing the bookkeeping, and eventually oversaw financial transactions and handled regulatory reporting to various government agencies.\nShe and her then-husband, Clarence L.
