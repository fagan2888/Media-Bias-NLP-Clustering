If you\u2019re unable to book on that exact day, you\u2019ll still generally get the best deal booking your ticket between 21 and 112 days out, which CheapAir.com calls the \u201cprime booking window.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 10 Worst Airports in the US\n\nEven though many travelers think that they\u2019ll get a better deal by waiting until the last minute to book, that strategy usually backfires. Recent airline consolidation and cost cutting means that most airplanes are flying at or near capacity, so the airlines have less incentive to discount seats.\n\n\u201cFares usually go up dramatically within 14 days of the flight,\u201d CheapAir.com CEO Jeff Klee said in a statement.\n\nBuying your ticket less than two weeks out will cost an average of $75 more than it would have if you\u2019d bought during the prime booking window. Purchasing a ticket less than a week out can cost you an extra $200.\n\nEarly birds will also pay a premium, with those buying tickets more than 197 days out paying an average of $50 more than the prime booking window price.
