Clinton is the man to help them embrace it, attack obsessed Republicans\u2014and win.\n\nLet Bill do it.\n\nWith Democrats facing a daunting midterm season, it\u2019s time to bring in the Big Dawg, not just as a campaigner but as a strategic driving force with the resources to deploy and dominate the message wars from coast to coast. Put him in charge of one of the existing super PACs\u2014which would instantly multiply its fundraising\u2014or form a new one that can operate on a genuinely super scale, with a pervasive reach. Let the Republicans have Karl Rove and Sheldon Adelson, the gambling mogul who in 2012 seemed to have all the electoral magic of a muggle. They, and the Koch brothers, would prove no match in messaging for Bill Clinton\u2014and he\u2019s the best chance to come close to matching them financially by attracting money beyond the Obama true believers among the big givers and the grass roots.\n\nWhy Clinton?\n\nFirst, he has the right instinct about a year in which a platoon of Democrats appear to think\u2014it\u2019s not really thinking but reflex desperation\u2014that they can run by hiding from health-care reform. Clinton has already rebuked that reflex, advising his party\u2019s candidates that they \u201chave to turn in toward all the controvers[y] and embrace it\u201d\u2014just as he did in a spectacular tour de force from the podium of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. He didn\u2019t make what he calls \u201cthe terrible mistake\u201d of \u201cshy[ing] away from the health care deal.\u201d\n\nClinton had to live with the consequences when too many Democrats contrived to flee their own history in the 1994 midterm contest that followed the failure of his health-care plan. So many of them lost that the party lost both the House and the Senate. Clinton understands that the last refuge of Democratic fear and trembling is to pretend you\u2019re not really a Democrat, or not that much of a Democrat\u2014and that the last thing we need, this year or then, is two Republican parties. The real Republicans will win out every time.\n\nFour years later, he learned\u2014or taught\u2014another lesson during another midterm election. In 1998, the Democratic establishment was terrified to confront the GOP elephant stomping down the campaign trail. Democratic candidates were talking about anything and everything\u2014except impeachment. Clinton himself had practiced the politics of triangulation during his reelection, although he prevailed primarily because of a fast-rising economy and the Gingrich-engineered government shutdown. But in 1998, he sensed the urgency and the utility of taking impeachment on directly\u2014and certainly not defensively. Frustrated by conventional wisdom that routinely dismissed the notion as strategic malpractice, he was energized and engaged as an independent expenditure, spearheaded by a major contributor named Danny Abraham, prepared to go on the air just a week before Election Day to indict the GOP for wasting months and millions on their relentless pursuit of political revenge. I was a political consultant then, and my partners and I were producing the ads. The president of the United States was phoning our office with his \u201csuggestions.\u201d He is not only a hell of a speech-giver but a hell of a scriptwriter.\n\nThis is \u201cno ordinary time,\u201d one ad began. Instead of the GOP\u2019s obsession with unending \u201cinvestigations,\u201d shouldn\u2019t we be focusing on the issues that matter to Americans\u2014Social Security, education, health care? Wasn\u2019t it time to \u201cmove on\u201d? Conveniently, the Republicans were obsessed, and so they were reinforcing the Clinton argument with a stream of commercials that battered the president and blasted his \u201cscandals.\u201d\n\nDemocrats might have reclaimed a House majority if this effort had started sooner and been amplified consistently across party and candidate advertising. Nonetheless, Democrats did game five House seats\u2014unprecedented for a party holding the White House in the sixth year of a presidency. Gingrich\u2019s \u201cimpeachment spectacle had left voters gagging, and\u2026 a humiliating defeat\u201d triggered a GOP mutiny that defenestrated him from his speakership.\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are obsessed with Obamacare. Clinton, who\u2019s so comfortable drawing distinctions on specific issues, could and would put Democrats on the offensive here. He understands that the question is not just the 7.5 million people already securing coverage on the exchanges, or the 8 million who will sign up for Medicaid this year, or the 100 million Americans who now have access to free preventive care, including mammograms for women. The explainer in chief can easily and eloquently point to all that. But he also can oversee the making of ads, alongside a flow of earned media events, that starkly hold the GOP accountable for voting to deny access to mammograms\u2014and to let insurance companies refuse coverage because of preexisting conditions, cut it off when people get sick, or throw young adults off their parents\u2019 policies.\n\nThat is the high ground of the battle if Democrats will seize it. And it has the additional advantage of being true, in contrast to the parade of broadcast lies featuring individual \u201chorror\u201d stories about Obamacare from conservative propagandists such as the misnamed Americans for Prosperity. If anything, the real horror stories are on the other side\u2014for example, the young mother in Florida with a heart condition who died as she was struggling to afford medication after Republican Gov. Rick Scott turned down the federally funded expansion of Medicaid. Any ad invoking that tragedy would have to be exquisitely sensitive and carefully crafted.\n\nOther issues beyond health care also could be pushed by a super PAC guided by Bill Clinton. They range from the minimum wage to the Paul Ryan budget, just supported by almost every House Republican, which would turn Medicare into a voucher program and cut off college aid for \u201clow and moderate income students.\u201d Seniors don\u2019t have to vote Republican and won\u2019t\u2014and younger voters will turn out\u2014if someone tells them what\u2019s at stake. And who is better than Bill Clinton, not only in speeches but with a sustained message that follows and vastly magnifies the effective if belated anti-impeachment TV spots of 1998?\n\nFinally, Clinton, the right fundraiser, the right messenger with the right instinct, also has close relationships with Democrats in Congress and virtually every state. He knows how to target and modulate the case to fit particular places, say Arkansas, where Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor shows every sign of pursuing the faux Republican strategy. He is in a tight race, but he might well follow a Clinton lead to a narrow victory in November.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s fantasy that Bill Clinton would consider this kind of decisive role in the midterms, but he should. Yes, he\u2019s surely looking toward Hillary\u2019s 2016 campaign\u2014which I\u2019m convinced she\u2019ll be announcing next year. Yes, for the sake of his wife\u2019s run, he may want to husband his fundraising prowess and the force field of his presence for contributors. But that next Clinton run for the White House will be hobbled if the GOP takes the Senate as well as the House\u2014and manages to stall or reverse the economic recovery. And just listen to Bill: He obviously cares about the progressive purposes that are in danger now, especially the health-care reform for which he fought so long and so hard. He could and should take his own advice\u2014\u201cturn into the controversy\u201d\u2014and take the lead in \u201cembracing it.\u201d\n\nWon\u2019t that embarrass Barack Obama, the sitting president who is axiomatically the head of the Democratic Party? Wouldn\u2019t that confirm that his hold on the party\u2019s heart, and the voters\u2019 affection, is shaky\u2014that Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill was spot-on when she bluntly conceded that the president should stay out of tough Senate elections? McCaskill, the first woman in the Senate to endorse Obama over Hillary Clinton in 2008, added that if she were on the ballot this year she \u201cprobably\u201d wouldn\u2019t bring Obama into her state.\n\nThe notion that Bill Clinton, by helping to save Democratic chances, would diminish Obama reminds me of the self-defeating notion that presidential nominees shouldn\u2019t pick a running mate who could outshine them. It\u2019s more important to be president than to out-glitter your No. 2. And the outcome in 2014 is more important to this president than who gets the credit if the tide turns toward the Democrats. If the GOP controls both the House and the Senate, the gridlock to come will make recent times look like a minor traffic jam.\n\nThe 44th president will have a part and an impact in 2014. There are places where Obama\u2019s campaigning will lift his party. He has set forth the themes and drawn the battle lines. But he has a day job. The 42nd president could take the midterm campaign to a new level\u2014to Democratic parity in paid communication and Democratic advantage on decisive issues.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bobshrum"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Obamacare, Republican Party, u.s. poli, Super PAC, Bill Clinton, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201404140945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Obamacare, Republican Party, US Politics, Super PAC, Bill Clinton, Democratic Party", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Send In Bill Clinton to Save the Democratic Midterm Campaign", "tags": "entity:person/barack_obama,Obamacare:Industryterm,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,entity:organization/super_pac,entity:person/bill_clinton,entity:organization/democratic_party", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Months away from Election Day, the Democrats are already cutting and running away from Obamacare.
