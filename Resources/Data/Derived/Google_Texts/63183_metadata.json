Apparently it is a weird Obamaspeak pronunciation of OB/GYN (pronounced oh-bee-gee-why-en). For the president\u2019s benefit, let me specify that means a doctor who delivers babies and takes care of the lady parts. When President Obama announced the departure of Eric Holder from his position as attorney general, he also mentioned his \u201cgood friend,\u201d the AG\u2019s wife, Dr. Sharon Malone , and he called her an \u201cohbee-guynee.\u201d Don\u2019t believe me? See for yourself.\n\nI have to wonder what kind of conversations they had in the Obama household when Michelle had her two pregnancies and deliveries. Did they never use the familiar acronym for an obstetrician/gynecologist? Or did they both think it was pronounced ohbeeguynee? If the latter, did Michelle never discuss her OB/GYN with female friends? I have been married to an OB/GYN for decades, and have never heard it pronounced the Obama way. Always oh-bee-gee-why-en.\n\nThis is such a downright strange phenomenon, it almost seems as though someone raised in a fantasized USSR training camp for deep cover agents was inserted into the identity of Barack Obama and loosed upon America, a highly trained faux American. But they forgot to teach him the pronunciation of OB/GYN. Like those WW II movies where the German spy is caught because he doesn't know who Babe Ruth is. Okay that\u2019s ridiculous, the stuff of spy novels. Couldn\u2019t possibly happen.\n\nBut how ridiculous is being the father of two girls and not knowing the pronunciation of the kind of doctor who delivered your children?\n\nHat tip: WeaselZippers and Clarice Feldman", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/10/another_weird_obama_pronunciation.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Another weird Obama pronunciation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd268\"", "article_summary": "Apparently it is a weird Obamaspeak pronunciation of OB/GYN (pronounced oh-bee-gee-why-en).\nI have been married to an OB/GYN for decades, and have never heard it pronounced the Obama way.\nBut how ridiculous is being the father of two girls and not knowing the pronunciation of the kind of doctor who delivered your children?\nI have to wonder what kind of conversations they had in the Obama household when Michelle had her two pregnancies and deliveries.\nOr did they both think it was pronounced ohbeeguynee?"}
