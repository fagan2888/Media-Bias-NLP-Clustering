John Hickenlooper\u2019s office, as a means to force the federal government\u2019s hand at deciding with finality whether pot and banking can go together.\n\nUntil now, it\u2019s been undecided at best. There are bills languishing in Congress that would give special exemptions to banks in states where marijuana is legal \u2014 currently only two have approved recreational sales, while more than 20 others allow for its medical use.\n\nFederal regulators and prosecutors have done little to alleviate the logjam, offering advice on how to approach the issue, but ultimately causing banks to keep what could be a lucrative relationship at arm\u2019s length.\n\n\u201cColorado\u2019s congressional representatives have tried to move a bill; the banking industry has asked for guidance; the governors of Washington and Colorado (where recreation marijuana is legal) have asked for guidance; we\u2019ve gotten the memos from regulators and prosecutors, and the banks ran screaming,\u201d said Chris Myklebust, Colorado\u2019s commissioner of the division of financial services and the one tapped for overseeing the new co-op system should it emerge.\n\n\u201cWe want an answer, on the record, a written response. Can we do this?\u201d he said.\n\nNo dark shadows\n\nBut before the Federal Reserve can even tackle the issue \u2014 presumably the first application would head to the Fed\u2019s regional bank in Kansas City, which is likely to punt the decision to Washington, D.C. \u2014 Myklebust says there is much more work to be done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible we can get something to the Fed in 2015, but more likely 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to put rules into place, come up with standards and bylaws, and a foundation for what one of these cooperatives will look like from an organizational standpoint.\u201d\n\nWhat Colorado seeks is approval for the marijuana industry to carry on its own banking-type segment, with accounts and credit cards and full access to the nation\u2019s financial system. And it wants it as if it\u2019s a new concern, with no dark shadows of a criminal past.\n\n\u201cThe critical problem is you have money flowing through this (co-op) entity with proceeds of transactions that are still illegal under federal law,\u201d said Oliver Ireland, a Washington, D.C., attorney specilizing in bank regulatory issues.\n\n\u201cIs the Fed going to do what the banks won\u2019t already do? No. Why would they?\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral former members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System politely turned down Denver Post requests for interviews for this story.\n\nThe push for an answer stems from the federal government\u2019s own indecision on how to handle pot and banking.\n\nAlthough a branch of the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Department of Justice in February theoretically gave banks the go-ahead to do business with the legal-marijuana trade \u2014 medical and recreational sellers of the drug \u2014 it was seen as little more than tacit approval surrounded by a number of red flags.\n\nRather than solving the banking dilemma, it complicated it.\n\n\u201cBanks are responsible to regulators, most of which are independent and uncontrolled by the president\u2019s executive branch,\u201d Colorado Bankers Association CEO Don Childears said when the guidance came. \u201cThe idea of no prosecution is nice, but to banks, regulators have the real power.\u201d\n\nSome U.S. senators loudly questioned how a branch of federal government \u2014 the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, within the Department of Treasury \u2014 could buck its mandatory obligation of keeping drug trafficking out of the nation\u2019s money system.\n\n\u201c(FinCEN\u2019s) guidance is dangerously misleading. Indeed, following the guidance may expose financial institutions to civil or criminal liability,\u201d Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in April. \u201cCongress and the President may reconsider marijuana\u2019s legality, but until federal law is changed, selling marijuana, laundering marijuana proceeds, and aiding and abetting those activities all remain illegal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the relationship between banks and pot shops doesn\u2019t exist, despite repeated rhetoric that the marijuana industry is a cash-only enterprise.\n\nMillions at stake\n\nIt\u2019s simply had to survive quietly, in some cases covertly \u2014 little different than how marijuana has hid in the shadows of criminality for more than 75 years.\n\n\u201cSome bank customers have gone to great lengths to disguise accounts related to marijuana,\u201d Childears said, \u201ceven spraying deposited cash from \u2018Susie\u2019s Cookies\u2019 with Febreze air freshener.\u201d\n\nWith millions \u2014 perhaps billions \u2014 of dollars at stake, the worries of public safety have been the oft-used words to insist that banking and pot must come together legally, without any worry that federal seizure looms around each deposit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just bizarre how many people out there who just don\u2019t want marijuana to have access to banking, as if it\u2019s a punishment,\u201d said Michael Elliott, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, a trade organization for cannabis businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re hoping for public safety issues to be associated with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, it\u2019s easier to get a bank account if you run a licensed brothel in Nevada than a licensed marijuana shop in Colorado.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of skepticism over whether this can work at all,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nThough credit unions are chartered to serve specific groups of people, there isn\u2019t one specific to businesses within an industry. Colorado\u2019s legislation \u2014 it\u2019s still unclear whether Hickenlooper will sign it \u2014 creates a cooperative, specifically prohibited from calling itself a bank or a credit union.\n\nEither way, the idea is unique.\n\n\u201cSome (credit unions) were formed specifically to provide business lending for the farming industry, but really not for anything other than feed and things necessary to run their business,\u201d said Pat Keefe with the Credit Union National Association. \u201cThe marijuana idea is very different.\u201d\n\nCritical, Keefe said, is that co-ops in Colorado, under HB 1398, are not required to have federal deposit insurance, theoretically keeping it from federal laws that insist funds not have any connection to the illegal drug trade.\n\nThat, Keefe said, may keep the concept from flying.\n\nWasted time?\n\nDespite any potential setbacks, the whole idea still requires Federal Reserve approval because it\u2019s the only way into the nation\u2019s money system.\n\n\u201cAs a public entity, the Federal Reserve is a creature of federal law,\u201d Ireland reminded. \u201cIs it, as a matter of policy, going to promote the violation of federal law? To willingly participate and promote that as a federal entity?\u201d\n\nIt seems more than unlikely, he said.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how it plays out, but I\u2019d be very surprised if the Fed wound up doing this without a change in federal law first,\u201d Ireland said. \u201cPerhaps for political reasons, Colorado needs to know.\u201d\n\nEly said Colorado could well have wasted its time.\n\n\u201cPutting it at the Fed\u2019s feet is a cop-out,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have spent the money to get it passed, on setting it up, only to say \u2018We\u2019ll see what the Fed says.\u2019 That\u2019s just not how you do business.\u201d\n\nThe way Myklebust sees it, that\u2019s precisely how it needs to go.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we stop asking, stop pushing on doors, then nothing happens.\u201d\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or twitter.com/davidmigoya", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pot finance co-ops likely to fail, but they\u2019re better than nothing", "title": "Pot finance co-ops likely to fail, but they\u2019re better than nothing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/16/pot-finance-co-ops-likely-to-fail-but-theyre-better-than-nothing/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__20140518_K1_BZ18POTBANKp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__20140518_K1_BZ18POTBANKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T21:24:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T20:02:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd379\"", "article_summary": "Several former members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System politely turned down Denver Post requests for interviews for this story.\n\u201cAs a public entity, the Federal Reserve is a creature of federal law,\u201d Ireland reminded.\nDespite any potential setbacks, the whole idea still requires Federal Reserve approval because it\u2019s the only way into the nation\u2019s money system.\nThe push for an answer stems from the federal government\u2019s own indecision on how to handle pot and banking.\nJohn Hickenlooper\u2019s office, as a means to force the federal government\u2019s hand at deciding with finality whether pot and banking can go together."}
