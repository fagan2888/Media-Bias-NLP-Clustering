President Barack Obama will speak to the press shortly before noon about the problems still plaguing the Health Insurance Marketplace that is intended to help the uninsured in 36 states, including Florida, the New York Times reports.

Federal health officials still won't give exact numbers for how many people have enrolled in a health insurance plan through HealthCare.gov, the Associated Press reports. But anonymous officials quoted by the Associated Press say that 476,000 health insurance applications have been received through the state and federal online exchanges. President Barack Obama is expected to speak Monday morning about the website glitches. As the New York Times reports, one expert says as many as five million lines of coding need rewriting to get the site running smoothly.

Meanwhile, health insurance counselors in Florida say theyâ€™re spending more of their time explaining the law to people than actually getting them enrolled in a health insurance plan, the Associated Press reports .
