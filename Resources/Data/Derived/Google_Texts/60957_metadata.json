The drug combination may also prevent neurological damage from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, opening possibilities too for the treatment of a variety of other diseases and conditions.\n\nNearly five millennia into the history of medical marijuana, investigators from Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center say they\u2019ve found a way to strip marijuana\u2019s most deleterious side effect. The discovery may prompt U.S. regulators to soon approve marijuana-based treatments for ailments beyond nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients.\n\nA simple medication may prevent memory loss from marijuana, while helping to prevent progression of Alzheimer's. Cell, Chen et al.\n\n\"Our studies have solved the longtime mystery of how marijuana causes neuronal and memory impairments,\" lead investigator Chu Chen said Thursday in a statement. \"The results suggest that the use of medical marijuana could be broadened if patients concurrently take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen.\"\n\nTo date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved drugs based on THC for only limited use in some cancer patients, out of concern for side effects such as memory loss. Until now, little was known about the molecular underpinnings of such neurological impairment. Using laboratory mice specially bred for the study, Chen and his colleagues found that THC treatment increased levels of an enzyme \u2014 ccyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) \u2014 in the mouse hippocampus, an area of the brain important to learning and memory.\n\nSubsequently, they found that memory loss in mice was prevented with efforts to reduce COX-2 levels, using either genetic techniques or drug intervention. Previous work has shown the enzyme may be zapped by simple over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. Moreover, Chen and his colleagues found that THC prevented memory loss from Alzheimer\u2019s in the mouse model, an effect that persisted when coupled with treatment reducing COX-2 levels, and thus blocking any memory loss from the marijuana.\n\nChen pointed out the market\u2019s dearth of effective medications for not only preventing and managing Alzheimer\u2019s but for stopping progression of the disease. \"Our results suggest that the unwanted side effects of cannabis could be eliminated or reduced, while retaining its beneficial effects, by administering a COX-2 inhibitor along with [delta-9-THC] for the treatment of intractable medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.\" The common form of dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s worsens in an increasingly debilitating progression leading to death. First described by scientists in the early 20th century, the neurodegenerative disease affects 26.6 million people around the world, and is predicted to strike one in 85 people by 2050.\n\nSource: Chen, Rongqing, Zhang, Jian, Fan, Ni, Teng, Zhao-gian, Wu, Yan. \u03949-THC-Caused Synaptic and Memory Impairments Are Mediated through COX-2 Signaling.
