But to some, she seems tone deaf on the issue, as more information emerges about the exorbitant fees she\u2019s charged colleges and universities at a time of mounting tuition costs and student debt.\n\nStudent body leaders in Nevada, California and elsewhere have begun publicly complaining about these fees \u2013 with some even asking she return a portion of them.\n\nHer fattest fees thus far was $300,000 for a speech at the Luskin Lecture for Thought forum at the University of California in Los Angeles in March \u2013 and $251,250 for a speech at the University of Connecticut in April, according to an accounting today by The Washington Post. A foundation supporting the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) has agreed to pay her $225,000 to speak at a gala fundraising dinner on October 13.\n\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton Must Run in 2016\n\nClinton has also given speeches to at least five other schools that so far have declined to reveal her speaking fees, including the University of Buffalo, Colgate University, Hamilton College, Simmons College and the University of Miami. Assuming she charged those five schools at least her base fee of $200,000, Clinton\u2019s overall take from colleges, universities and related institutions totals at least $1.8 million, said The Post.\n\nReports about the $225,000 speaking fee at UNLV touched off a campus flare-up. Student leaders last Friday sent a letter to the Clinton family foundation urging Clinton to \u201cdo what is right\u201d and donate all or part of her fee back to the university for the students\u2019 benefit, according to The Las Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cIn keeping with Secretary Clinton\u2019s longstanding history of advocating for students in higher education, we as student government leaders are asking that she charitably donate part or all of the $225,000 speaking fee she is reportedly making for this fundraising speech back to the UNLV Foundation as a whole,\u201d the letter stated.\n\n\u201cThe students are outraged about this,\u201d Elias Benjelloun, president of the student body, told The Washington Post. \u201cWhen you see reckless spending, it just belittles the sacrifices students are consistently asked to make.\u201d\n\nRelated: 9 Takeaways from Hillary Clinton\u2019s New Memoir\n\nClinton\u2019s office recently told The Washington Post that the fee UNLV has agreed to pay would go to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, the family\u2019s non-profit global philanthropic organization. Also, a UNLV spokesperson said Clinton\u2019s fee is covered by private sponsorships \u2013 and not public money.\n\nSince leaving the State Department in February 2013, Clinton has made at least 90 speeches and received fees for at least two dozen of them, according to a report by Mother Jones. Exact figures aren\u2019t available, but the Center for Responsive Politics estimated broadly that Hillary Clinton\u2019s net worth is between $5.2 and $25.5 million as of 2012. Bill Clinton amassed $104.9 million for delivering 542 speeches around the world between 2001 and 2013, according to a recent analysis by The Washington Post. Most other analysts put their combined net worth, including real estate and investments, at well over $100 million.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Here\u2019s one idea for bringing down soaring college costs: Get Hillary Clinton off the s", "title": "College Students Outraged over Hillary Clinton\u2019s Massive Speaking Fees", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/03/College-Students-Outraged-over-Hillary-Clinton-s-Massive-Speaking-Fees", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/RTX14N4U.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/03/College-Students-Outraged-over-Hillary-Clinton-s-Massive-Speaking-Fees", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/RTX14N4U.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Here\u2019s one idea for bringing down soaring college costs: Get Hillary Clinton off the s", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ef0\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s one idea for bringing down soaring college costs: Get Hillary Clinton off the speaking circuit.\nExact figures aren\u2019t available, but the Center for Responsive Politics estimated broadly that Hillary Clinton\u2019s net worth is between $5.2 and $25.5 million as of 2012.\nBy one estimate, the former secretary of state has charged eight universities and colleges \u2013 including four public institutions \u2013 a total of at least $1.8 million in speaking fees over the past year.\nAlso, a UNLV spokesperson said Clinton\u2019s fee is covered by private sponsorships \u2013 and not public money.\nReports about the $225,000 speaking fee at UNLV touched off a campus flare-up."}
