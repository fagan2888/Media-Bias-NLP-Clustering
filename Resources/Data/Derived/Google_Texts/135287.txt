Ontario’s Registrar of Payday Loans is seeking to cut off The Cash Store and Instaloans, both owned by The Cash Store Financial Services Inc.

The provincial authority issued a proposal to refuse payday lender licences for the company that has Cash Stores at 157 Bayfield St., 555 Essa Road and at 230 King St. and an Instaloan at 7 Anne St. S.

Ontario issued a news bulletin Thursday after a series of allegations and court actions.

Feb. 12, the Superior Court of Justice ruled that the basic line of credit The Cash Store’s outlets issue is a payday loan and subject to Ontario’s Payday Loan’s Act and Regulations. The court ordered the Cash Store and Instaloans to pay $50,000 in cost to the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services.

The court decision resulted from a June 7, 2013 application by the consumer services ministry. As a result, Cash Store and Instaloans cannot offer payday loans for their basic line of credit in Ontario.

The company was convicted of operating as unlicensed payday lenders in November 2013.
