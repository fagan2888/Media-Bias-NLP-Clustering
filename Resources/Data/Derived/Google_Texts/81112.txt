Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says his supporters are so loyal they would stick with him even if he stood in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shot somebody.

Trump was addressing a rally Saturday at a Christian school, Dordt College, in Sioux Center, Iowa.

In addition to criticizing his rivals, Trump went after conservative radio host Glenn Beck, who will be appearing at two rallies with Ted Cruz later in the day.

Beck is among nearly two dozen conservative thinkers who penned anti-Trump essays for National Review magazine.

Cruz is Trump's most serious challenger in early-voting Iowa.

Several Republican contenders are in the state this weekend, with just nine days to go before Iowa's caucuses open the voting in the 2016 campaign.
