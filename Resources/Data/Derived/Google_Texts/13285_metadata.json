This season\u2019s story is spoken about metatextually rather than with the engaged engrossment of rapt viewers\u2014every episode is analyzed ruthlessly, but little enjoyed. The possible reasons for why this season isn\u2019t as good as last season are numerous and well-discussed: sophomore slump, the loss of Cary Fukunaga\u2019s creative vision, less talented actors, a far less enchanted setting.\n\nBut there is a way this season is brilliant, and that is with Rachel McAdams\u2019 Ani Bezzerides. Vince Vaughn\u2019s character, Frank, seems to be the one that creator and showrunner Nic Pizzolatto imbued with all of the circular dialogue and thwarted poesy of last season\u2019s breakout character Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McConaughey. But where Vaughn can\u2019t quite render the convoluted lines given to his character with any kind of grace, McAdams has stepped up to offer unexpected texture to her part, just as McConaughey did with Rust. I haven\u2019t given up hope on \u201cTrue Detective\u201d just yet, because I think that through Ani, this season is doing something brilliant. Ani is thwarted, impotent, raging, like all of \u201cTrue Detective\u2019s\u201d heroes\u2014but she\u2019s raging on behalf of all women as much as her own trauma. In a show saturated with masculinity and bogged down by antiheroes, Ani is the hero of the hour.\n\nWhen her casting was first announced, the character of Ani appeared to be a sad sop tossed to critics of the show who observed the first season\u2019s lack of compelling female characters. Ani is almost a parody of a \u201cstrong female character\u201d\u2014a tough cop who toughly toughs out tough situations with toughness. She has little discernible femininity (aside from an inexplicable dye job that is managed so unrealistically that it\u2019s obvious a man wrote the show; how have her roots not grown out after two months?). As Alan Sepinwall observed in his review of the first few episodes, on one hand, it\u2019s great that there\u2019s a female character expressing her identity however she wants to, but on the other hand, it\u2019s kind of troubling if the only female character a male auteur can come up with is just like his male characters, but with boobs. Ani is as damaged and emotionally incompetent and incoherently moralistic and commitment-phobic as her male counterpart, Ray (Colin Farrell); aside from her affection for e-cigarettes and Ray\u2019s distinct inability to keep anything together in the first few episodes, there\u2019s almost nothing to tell them apart.\n\nThat changes with the knives. After a brief, silent scene that shows Ani strapping on her weaponry in the police locker room, Ray casually asks her about them. \u201cThe fundamental difference between the sexes is that one of them can kill the other with their bare hands. Man of any size lays hands on me, he\u2019s going to bleed out in under a minute.\u201d Ani does not use the term \u201cfeminism\u201d; that\u2019s introduced by Ray, who quips, \u201cWell, just so you know, I support feminism, mostly by having body image issues.\u201d Ani cracks a barely perceptible smile.\n\nIt\u2019s one of Ray\u2019s more charming moments, but it\u2019s incongruous with what came before. Ray is making a little joke; Ani is outlining the crisis of literally half of humankind. Women are always at the mercy of men, in any situation, in every civilization; it\u2019s only the strength of numbers, culture and empathy that combat them. If those fail\u2014and they often do\u2014women are raped, murdered, beaten, enslaved, almost exclusively at the hands of men. Ani may not be terribly \u201cfeminine,\u201d according to our social definition of the word, but in terms of the fear and anger that is part of her lived reality, she is as female as any woman who has lived in the world. This is the horrible inequality baked into our world, one that must be stumblingly and painfully taught to every successive generation of girls. Except in the slimmest of alternate scenarios, you will always be the weaker one, the more vulnerable one. Unless, perhaps, you carry a lot of knives.\n\n* * *\n\nThe word \u201cvagina\u201d means \u201csheath.\u201d It comes, like so much, from Latin, except that the Romans didn\u2019t use it to refer to any part of human anatomy. \u201cVagina\u201d was a scabbard, or a husk; the female sexual organs were instead the vulva or the pudenda (a word indicating, \u201cthing to be ashamed of\u201d). In the 1680s, medical texts began referring to the birth canal as the \u201cvagina,\u201d and so it is still called today. \u201cPenis,\u201d meanwhile, comes from the Latin for \u201ctail,\u201d but the Romans started using it to mean the other thing often enough that we can trace \u201cpenis\u201d to Cicero. Considering that \u201cvagina\u201d limits the female sex organs to merely a receptacle for the penis\u2014and, indeed, does not include the clitoris\u2014\u201cvagina\u201d is a usage that is the subject of some debate among feminist intellectuals. The word \u201ccunt\u201d\u2014which has existed since at least 1230, but only began being used as a derogatory term in the 1920s\u2014has been suggested as a substitute (if only because the denizens of the British Isles use it constantly) and has been repurposed in fascinating ways by various female music artists in the U.S. and writers like Inga Muscio.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an uneven second season, \"True Detective\" hits its stride with Ani's simmering rage", "title": "Being female is a wound that never heals: How Ani Bezzerides emerged as the real hero of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In an uneven second season, \"True Detective\" hits its stride with Ani's simmering rage", "title": "Being female is a wound that never heals: How Ani Bezzerides emerged as the real hero of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/26/being_female_is_a_wound_that_never_heals_how_ani_bezzerides_emerged_as_the_real_hero_of_true_detective/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/true_detective_2_6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an uneven second season, \"True Detective\" hits its stride with Ani's simmering rage", "title": "Being female is a wound that never heals: How Ani Bezzerides emerged as the real hero of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/true_detective_2_6.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ani bezzerides, HBO, Rachel McAdams, true detective, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9edd\"", "article_summary": "Topics: ani bezzerides, HBO, Rachel McAdams, true detective, TV, Entertainment News\u201cTrue Detective\u201d Season 2 may not be much of a success, compared to its predecessor.\nBut there is a way this season is brilliant, and that is with Rachel McAdams\u2019 Ani Bezzerides.\nI haven\u2019t given up hope on \u201cTrue Detective\u201d just yet, because I think that through Ani, this season is doing something brilliant.\n* * *The word \u201cvagina\u201d means \u201csheath.\u201d It comes, like so much, from Latin, except that the Romans didn\u2019t use it to refer to any part of human anatomy.\nAni is almost a parody of a \u201cstrong female character\u201d\u2014a tough cop who toughly toughs out tough situations with toughness."}
