When Big Data gets patient info\n\nA research network funded with millions by the Affordable Care Act will begin conducting vast studies next year to compare standard medical treatments. But what about the 100 million patients in the network \u2014 do they have a choice in the matter?\n\nWill researchers get permission from each of those patients? And if patients are told about the studies, what, exactly, will they be told? These questions have bioethicists, scientists and health care officials debating how to bring the question of patient informed consent into the 21st century.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObamacare is best known for extending health coverage to more Americans. But the health care law has many provisions aimed at improving health care outcomes and safety while lowering costs. One element is \u201ccomparative effectiveness\u201d research: not just finding out whether a drug or treatment is safe and effective but comparing drugs head to head to find out which is better, for everyone or certain populations.\n\nAnd with electronic medical records and vast pools of data, some of these studies have the potential to make lightning-fast, dramatic discoveries. But informed consent issues have the potential to slow such studies and make them too expensive.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Hackers steal 4.5M patients' data)\n\nMoves are afoot to overhaul federal regulations such as the 1991 Common Rule, which governs informed consent in all federally backed research, according to Kathy Hudson, the National Institutes of Health deputy director for science, outreach and policy. But such rule-makings are long drawn-out affairs that won\u2019t happen in time to get the comparative effectiveness research underway.\n\nThe principle of informed consent \u2014 the idea that patients need to be advised of a study and its risks \u2014 was enshrined at the Nuremberg trial of Nazi doctors in 1947. But the process has grown cumbersome and expensive. Informed consent forms can be 30 pages long and may seem aimed more at protecting hospitals from lawsuits than informing patients.\n\nNo one wants to expose patients to dangerous trials without their consent. In these comparative effectiveness studies, the risks are usually small or similar for different groups of patients. And researchers are intent on gaining some degree of patient engagement in the studies.\n\nDrug companies and other deep-pocketed sources are rarely interested in funding such studies, though, so there\u2019s a pressing need to make them cheap. Traditional drug trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars each.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Will better technology save the VA?)\n\nMany comparative studies are planned by the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, which involves 11 research networks and 19 patient advocacy groups. It\u2019s getting at least $100 million from PCORI, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which was created and funded \u2014 to the tune of about $650 million per year \u2014 under the health law.\n\nFor comparative effectiveness trials, patients might be randomly selected to receive one of two drugs. In other studies, researchers might simply electronically rummage through patient files to examine outcomes from similar drugs in similar populations. Both types of study raise practical questions for informed consent.\n\nSome patients in the records-based studies might be dead, or impossible to reach. As for the randomization trials, \u201cHow do you integrate consent for research into regular health care delivery if you have 1 million patients and 20-30 minutes for each clinical encounter?\u201d asks Joseph Ali, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.\n\nMost everyone agrees that \u201cinformed consent needs to be fixed,\u201d says Julia Adler-Milstein, a health informatics specialist at the University of Michigan. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do informed consent right, we\u2019ll be so much more limited in what we can do with data, and that would be a huge loss.\u201d\n\nThe power of big data\n\nDoctors often prescribe drugs without knowing whether they are the best choice. For example, a common anti-hypertension drug is the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. The older, cheaper drug chlorothiazide may be just as good, but doctors almost always prescribe hydrochlorothiazide \u2014 possibly because its abbreviation is widely known and easy to scribble on a pad: HCZT.\n\nBoth are safe and effective; the FDA has established that. But there no requirements and few incentives in the current system to figure out which drug is better.\n\nA physician studying a relatively rare disease, meanwhile, could easily recruit thousands of, say, cystic fibrosis patients from a database that included millions of people. \u201cI will no longer have to spend years recruiting 3,000 patients for a study, because I will already have 10,000 banging on the door,\u201d says Michael Lauer, director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\n\u201cAs a Harry Potter fan, this is magic in the muggle world,\u201d Lauer says. \u201cIt will allow us to do dozens, hundreds of large-scale studies at a very low cost.\u201d\n\nWould it be necessary to tell patients they were in such a trial?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bioethicists, scientists and health care officials debate how to give patients informed consent.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Bioethicists, scientists and health care officials debate how to give patients informed consent.", "title": "When Big Data gets patient info", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/can-big-data-and-patient-informed-consent-coexist-110567.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/17/130917_doctor_patient_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Medicine,Privacy,Health Care,Technology,Big Data,Data", "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/arthurallen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the health care law has many provisions aimed at improving health care outcomes and safety while lowering costs.\nThese questions have bioethicists, scientists and health care officials debating how to bring the question of patient informed consent into the 21st century.\nWhen Big Data gets patient infoA research network funded with millions by the Affordable Care Act will begin conducting vast studies next year to compare standard medical treatments.\nMany comparative studies are planned by the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, which involves 11 research networks and 19 patient advocacy groups.\nInformed consent forms can be 30 pages long and may seem aimed more at protecting hospitals from lawsuits than informing patients."}
