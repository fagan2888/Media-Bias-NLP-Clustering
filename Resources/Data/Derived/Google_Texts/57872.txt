Rapid City, SD

A wanted man was wearing a bullet proof vest when arrested after leading police on a long chase late Saturday night in Rapid City.

Around 11:30 Saturday night, police say an officer tried to pull over a car allegedly driven by Eric LaDeaux. The 29-year-old is wanted for a federal fugitive warrant.

That's when LaDeaux allegedly took chase, weaving police through the south west part of the city. At one point, the car slowed down and a 19-year-old got out, but police say LaDeaux refused to stop.

On Highway 385, the car traveled two miles with spiked tires before LaDeaux was captured. Police say he was wearing a law-enforcement style bullet-proof vest. Police say they didn't find a gun on LaDeaux but think he may have hidden it before the arrest.

He faces eluding and drug charges in addition to two warrants.
