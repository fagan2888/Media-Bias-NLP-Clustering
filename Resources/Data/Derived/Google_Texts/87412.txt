LOS ANGELES (AP) — Justin Bieber’s attorney says the singer is on schedule to finish his sentence in a misdemeanor vandalism case by early next year.

Attorney Shawn Holley told a Los Angeles judge that Bieber will complete community service and anger management treatments by the time his case is called again on Feb. 10.

Bieber is on probation for a vandalism case filed earlier this year over an incident in which the singer threw eggs at a neighbor’s home.

The pop singer did not attend Monday’s hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Bieber was ordered to complete five days of community service, attend 12 anger management sessions and pay $80,900 to repair damage to his neighbor’s home.

Holley says Bieber has already paid restitution.
