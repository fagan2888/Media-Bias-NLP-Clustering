It was not clear if Trump knew beforehand that Beck was speaking at the location when he made his entrance.\n\nAt the time, MSNBC was broadcasting a live look at the caucus site, Palo Verde High School in Summerlin.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has just walked into this location,\u201d an MSNBC reporter said on-air, noting Beck was still \u201cspeaking on behalf of Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump shows up as @glennbeck speaks.

We are going to have hopefully a historic night. In New Hampshire it was an amazing win. As you know, South Carolina. Unbelievable. Hopefully this will be the same. I appreciate everybody being here.
