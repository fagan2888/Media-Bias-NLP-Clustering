She had taken the boys, 10 and 13 at the time, to school, taken care of the house, and after putting them to bed, planned to relax in front of her computer.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what she was hoping to do. Eliza opened her computer and started to search for a document, but based on previous searches, the term \u201cchild porn\u201d appeared on the screen.\n\n\u201cI went into a panic,\u201d said Eliza, who was given anonymity to protect the identity of her children. Her mind started to race in a million different directions.\n\nTwo nights later, as they were going to bed, she asked the older son if he had searched for \u201cchild porn\u201d and if so, why.\n\n\u201cHe said he was looking for porn made for children,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe explained, embarrassed, that he just wanted to know what his body was supposed to look like at his age.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the new teenage years. Not long ago, boys and girls nearing that curious age might sneak a peek at Playboy or scour the underwear section of a J.C. Penney circular.\n\nToday, teenagers have easy access to a seemingly endless supply of pornography, including things that even many adults don\u2019t want to see, such as mock sexual violence, misogynistic videos and, in extreme cases, child pornography.\n\n\u201cAt first, I told my son the next time he wanted to look at things like this, to talk to me and we\u2019d do it together,\u201d Eliza said. \u201cYet as soon as the words left my mouth I realized, and said, \u2018No, no, no, that would be a terrible idea.\u2019 \u201d Parents who have young boys acknowledge that trying to stop them from seeing online pornography is all but impossible. One father, for example, installed web filtering software on the home computer, only to learn that his son had watched a gross-out pornography clip at a friend\u2019s house.\n\nResearchers at the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire walked me through a number of long-term studies that the group has been conducting since 2000 on children\u2019s exposure to pornography. In one paper, the group found that 42 percent of online users ages 10 to 17 had seen pornography, and that 66 percent of those had seen it unwittingly, often as display ads on file-sharing sites.\n\nFor parents, this leaves two questions.\n\nFirst, is the pervasiveness of online pornography bad for today\u2019s youth, potentially creating a society of sexual deviants? And second, what can parents do to help protect their children?\n\nThere is no definitive answer to the first question, although it is a running debate in the nation\u2019s culture wars.\n\nExperts who monitor teenagers and sexuality say that there is plenty of evidence pointing in the opposite direction.\n\nTeenage pregnancy has dropped sharply in recent years; the number of sexual partners that teenagers have is down; and the number of ninth-graders having sexual intercourse has fallen, to cite just three examples.\n\n\u201cIf you just look at the indicators of sexual responsibility, you don\u2019t see a generation of kids looking like they are off the rails,\u201d said David Finkelhor, an author of several books on child abuse and a director of the Family Research Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nBut Finkelhor and other experts said that today\u2019s easy access to pornography, especially its violent and illegal forms, makes it imperative for parents to educate their children, not only about sex but specifically about online pornography, in all its flavors. And given how easy it is to find it online, it is important to inculcate them at an early age.\n\nAlso, children should be warned about the dark and dangerous material they may stumble across online. If parents don\u2019t, that uncomfortable and embarrassing feeling could be replaced with something much worse.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/hfyouth20.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca49c\"", "article_summary": "First, is the pervasiveness of online pornography bad for today\u2019s youth, potentially creating a society of sexual deviants?\nAnd given how easy it is to find it online, it is important to inculcate them at an early age.\nEliza opened her computer and started to search for a document, but based on previous searches, the term \u201cchild porn\u201d appeared on the screen.\nTwo nights later, as they were going to bed, she asked the older son if he had searched for \u201cchild porn\u201d and if so, why.\nAlso, children should be warned about the dark and dangerous material they may stumble across online."}
