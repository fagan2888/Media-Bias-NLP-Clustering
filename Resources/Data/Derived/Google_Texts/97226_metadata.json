His 120-hour voyage from Nagoya broke the record for the world\u2019s longest nonstop solo flight, his team said. The late U.S. adventurer Steve Fossett set the previous record of 76 hours when he flew a specially-designed jet around the globe in 2006.\n\nBut Borschberg flew the Solar Impulse 2 without fuel. Instead, its wings were equipped with 17,000 solar cells that charged batteries. The plane ran on stored energy at night.\n\nThe plane\u2019s ideal flight speed is about 28 mph though that can double during the day when sun\u2019s rays are strongest. The carbon-fiber aircraft weighs over 5,000 pounds or about as much as a minivan or mid-sized truck.\n\nBorschberg and his co-pilot Bertrand Piccard have been taking turns flying the plane on an around-the-world trip since taking off from Abu Dhabi in March. After Hawaii, it will head to Phoenix and then New York.\n\nThe project, which began in 2002 and is estimated to cost more than $100 million, is aimed at highlighting the importance of renewable energy and the spirit of innovation. Solar-powered air travel is not yet commercially practical, however, given the slow travel time, weather and weight constraints of the aircraft.\n\nThe plane is visiting Hawaii just as the state has embarked on its own ambitious clean energy project. Gov. David Ige last month signed legislation directing Hawaii\u2019s utilities to generate 100 percent of their electricity from renewable energy resources by 2045. The utilities currently get 21 percent of their power from renewable sources.\n\nBorschberg took naps and practiced yoga to cope with the long hours.\n\n\u201cYoga is a huge support for this flight above the Pacific: it positively affects my mood and mindset,\u201d he wrote in a tweet from the plane on Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A plane powered by the sun's rays landed in Hawaii Friday after a record-breaking five-day journey across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A plane powered by the sun\u2019s rays landed in Hawaii Friday after a record-breaking five-day journey across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.", "title": "Solar-powered plane lands in Hawaii after flight from Japan", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/3/solar-powered-plane-due-to-land-in-hawaii-after-5-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/03/33b624c69d8f1c1d7b0f6a706700f06a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/03/33b624c69d8f1c1d7b0f6a706700f06a.jpg", "description": "A plane powered by the sun's rays landed in Hawaii Friday after a record-breaking five-day journey across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Solar-powered plane lands in Hawaii after flight from Japan"}, "Author": "Audrey McAvoy", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Andre Borschberg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc7c\"", "article_summary": "KAPOLEI, Hawaii (AP) \u2014 A plane powered by the sun\u2019s rays landed in Hawaii Friday after a record-breaking five-day journey across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.\nThe plane is visiting Hawaii just as the state has embarked on its own ambitious clean energy project.\nDavid Ige last month signed legislation directing Hawaii\u2019s utilities to generate 100 percent of their electricity from renewable energy resources by 2045.\nThe project, which began in 2002 and is estimated to cost more than $100 million, is aimed at highlighting the importance of renewable energy and the spirit of innovation.\nHis 120-hour voyage from Nagoya broke the record for the world\u2019s longest nonstop solo flight, his team said."}
