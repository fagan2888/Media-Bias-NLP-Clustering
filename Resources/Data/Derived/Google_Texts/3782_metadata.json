It\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t say \u201cI will shut down the government.\u201d But we know who\u2019s making the demands. They\u2019re issuing those demands through us.\n\nWhich is why I think my colleague Danny Vinik is letting literalism get the best of him when he argues there is no government shutdown threat. There very much is. That\u2019s not to say that the threat will build, or morph into a tense stand off, let alone an actual shutdown. But the threat is clear. It\u2019s clear in explicit statements like the ones above. It\u2019s clear in leaks, like this one to The Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball. And it\u2019s clear in more roundabout statements, like this one, from Senator Marco Rubio, to the conservative website Breitbart.\n\n\u201cThere will have to be some sort of a budget vote or a continuing resolution vote, so I assume there will be some sort of a vote on this,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI\u2019m interested to see what kinds of ideas my colleagues have about using funding mechanisms to address this issue.\"\n\nHis comments are admittedly vague. He's is suggesting either that Republicans will condition funding the government on ending deferred action\u2014the same formula that led to the shutdown over Obamacare\u2014or that they will use the appropriations process to force Democrats to vote on ending deferred action, without actually making the end of deferred action a requirement for funding the government. (House Republicans tried something similar just a few weeks ago. It was stunningly ineffective.)\n\nBut the truth is practically irrelevant to the question of whether this presages a government shutdown fight. Just as it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell actually has a government shutdown in mind when he promises to strong-arm Obama next year, or whether he intends to cave.\n\nIn either case he\u2019s threatening to use the appropriations process as leverage to extract concessions. That's a government shutdown fight. And no matter how he plays it, he will unleash forces he and other GOP leaders have proven incapable of restraining. They can\u2019t control the plot.\n\nThat\u2019s why Politico\u2019s headline blared \u201cMcConnell\u2019s plan to shut down Obama,\u201d and HuffPost warned \u201cMarco Rubio Hints At A Government Shut Down Fight.\u201d Nobody\u2019s saying a government shutdown will definitely happen. But a confrontation is very likely, and Republicans in Congress are the reason.
