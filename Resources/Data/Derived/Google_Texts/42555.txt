Severe storms kept people on edge across KAKEland Sunday night, with a tornado apparently causing damage in southwest kansas.

Tornadoes were spotted on the ground in several locations, between Liberal and Dodge City. The National Weather Service reports a probable tornado damaged a home near Ensign.

Daniel Wilson is a volunteer fire chief at Ensign and was storm spotting when his wife called to tell him their house was damaged by a tornado.

His wife and three children - age five and four years old and an eight month old infant - managed to get to the basement moments before the tornado hit.

Wilson says his focus is on his families safety, not his damaged home

"For the winds to come through here and do the damage that it did and everyone was just a little rattled and shaken, we will make it," Wilson said.

People have been driving by the Wilson's home throughout the day, offering help and words of encouragement.

"Everybody is like family, you never know when you are going to need help, so it is good for everybody to come together and help," said Tracey Hogie.

A witness reports a wind turbine south of Ensign was no match for a twister. A barn was damaged in the Fort Dodge area of Ford County, and power poles were knocked down two miles east of Haggard in Gray County.

Hail was also a concern, with stones the size of baseballs in some places.

But by the time the storm line reached Wichita, there wasn't much left. Eisenhower National Airport only had 0.02 inches of rain between 12:00 midnight and 7:00 a.m.
