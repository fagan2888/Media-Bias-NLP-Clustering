Writing for the majority in the 6-3 King v. Burwell decision, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the 900-page law was written behind closed doors with little debate or amendment and thus was \u201cinartfully\u201d drafted. It was the court\u2019s obligation, he wrote, to translate bill language limiting the government subsidies to enrollees in \u201can exchange established by the State\u201d as meaning enrollees in federal exchanges also can get subsidies.\n\nRoberts always has been a consummate politician in his role as guardian of the big bench. The President George W. Bush appointee had good reason to fear how the public might react if the Supreme Court overturned a law that benefits millions of Americans.\n\nThirty-four states rely on federal Obamacare exchanges. That\u2019s 6 million people, 87 percent of whom bought health care with federal tax credits. Roberts cited a study that predicted that cutting off those subsidies would result in a 47 percent increase in premiums and a 70 percent decline in enrollment.\n\nBetween a rock and a hard place, Roberts argued that Congress surely never meant to cut out subsidies in states without their own exchanges, because \u201cit would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very \u2018death spirals\u2019 that Congress designed the Act to avoid.\u201d\n\nI sympathize, but Roberts has to know he\u2019s wrong. Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who advised the White House, explained during a 2012 speech that the federal law limited subsidies to enrollees of state exchanges in order to \u201csqueeze\u201d states to act. Quoth Gruber, \u201cIf you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits, but your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill.\u201d\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley \u2014 no conservative he \u2014 wrote last year, \u201cI believe that the text is clear in the Act and that the Obama Administration effectively altered the language when 34 states decided to defy the government and refuse to create state exchanges.\u201d\n\nJoined by two conservative brethren, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a blistering dissent. He raged that words have no meaning if \u201cestablished by the State\u201d doesn\u2019t mean just that \u2014 and the law used the term repeatedly. Observing that Roberts also penned the 2012 decision that, by a 5-4 majority, perversely interpreted the Affordable Care Act \u201cpenalty\u201d language as actually representing a tax, Scalia railed, \u201cWe should start calling this law SCOTUScare.\u201d\n\nI think Roberts did what he did to protect the court from the outrage that would have followed if millions of Americans had lost their subsidies. There\u2019s a big hole in my thinking, as Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, kindly pointed out over the phone. Even without Roberts, there were five justices \u2014 GOP appointee Anthony Kennedy joined the four Democratic appointees \u2014 ready to uphold the health care act as per the Obama administration.\n\nSeverino, too, first assumed Roberts was attempting to \u201cjump on the grenade of a bad decision\u201d by penning a less damaging decision than Kennedy and company would have written, she wrote for National Review\u2019s Bench Memos blog. After reading the decision, however, she decided the chief justice \u201chas simply gone over to the dark side.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration never has had much respect for process \u2014 an attitude that rubbed off on the Democratic Congress that passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The president dishonestly claimed, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\u201d Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously said, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.\u201d\n\nThe fog of the controversy only has gotten murkier.\n\nThe result is the mess that put Roberts in the position of believing he had to engage in judicial activism in order to not look like a judicial activist.\n\nAs a conservative, I think it serves the country best if elected officials, not judges, repair what\u2019s wrong in Obamacare. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a 2016 GOP presidential hopeful, hit the right note when he said he did not agree with the ruling. \u201cIt was never up to the Supreme Court to save us from Obamacare,\u201d he said in a statement issued Thursday.\n\nBecause the Democratic Congress wrote a heavy-handed provision that the Obama White House determined it was best to ignore, the Supreme Court got handed a live grenade. With all the Democratic justices on board, Roberts jumped on the grenade \u2014 leading with a bogus argument.\n\nThe real casualty is any notion that the U.S. Supreme Court remains an honest broker.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2015 CREATORS.COM\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded31\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was never up to the Supreme Court to save us from Obamacare,\u201d he said in a statement issued Thursday.\nThe GOP-majority Supreme Court saved President Barack Obama\u2019s bacon Thursday with a political ruling that papered over his signature Affordable Care Act.\nThe real casualty is any notion that the U.S. Supreme Court remains an honest broker.\nBecause the Democratic Congress wrote a heavy-handed provision that the Obama White House determined it was best to ignore, the Supreme Court got handed a live grenade.\nThe President George W.
