(NEWSNET5) — AKRON, Ohio – An estimated 800,000 people visited the new and improved www.healthcare.gov Monday to shop for affordable health insurance. But what one Akron woman got was a bad case of sticker shock.

“I thought it was supposed to help us,” Liz Binns said in frustration. “I can’t afford it. I cannot afford it.”

Binns had been trying to navigate the government’s health care website since October to find affordable insurance for her husband, a 60-year-old who has a pre-existing condition and whose job doesn’t offer coverage.

What she finally found for him Monday carries a premium of more than $400 a month and a $5,000 annual deductible.

“How can I pay this kind of money out?” she asked. “It’s going to take at least a second job and praying that I would make enough on a second job just to pay for this health insurance.”
