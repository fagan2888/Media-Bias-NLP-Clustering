MICHAEL GRAHAM: Barack Obama, in his sixth year, are there any other presidents who were in similar positions where they had a key policy that was collapsing beneath their feet and taking their party down with them. Has this happened in the past that you can think of?



MICHAEL BARONE: Well, I think a lot of Democrats would say, and I think they may very well be right, that this is George W. Bush in Iraq. An ambitious policy that was entered onto with great hopes, that was not attended to with sufficient care and willingness to change tactics, and at this point in 2006, things looked pretty bad there for the president, and -- though Karl Rove and I were late to pick up on it -- for his party.
