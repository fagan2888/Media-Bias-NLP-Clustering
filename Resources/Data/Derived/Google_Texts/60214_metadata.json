(AP) \u2014 It looks like Elvis Presley\u2019s airplanes are staying at Graceland after all.\n\nGraceland released a statement Sunday saying the Lisa Marie and the Hound Dog II, two custom-designed airplanes once owned by Presley, will remain permanently at the Memphis tourist attraction centered on the life and career of the late singer.\n\nThe announcement ends confusion about the future of the planes, once used by the King for travel to performances after he bought them in the 1970s.\n\nThe larger plane, a Convair 880 named after Presley\u2019s daughter Lisa Marie, is like a customized flying limousine, complete with a large bed, a stereo system, conference room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. It was renovated after Presley bought it from Delta Air Lines. Presley took his first flight on it in November 1975.\n\nWhen Presley died on Aug. 16, 1977, Presley\u2019s pilot flew the Lisa Marie to California to pick up Presley\u2019s ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, to bring her back to Memphis.\n\nThe smaller jet, a JetStar named the Hound Dog II, was also used by Presley.\n\nThe planes were sold after Presley\u2019s death, and they were eventually purchased by a company called OKC Partnership.\n\nOKC Partnership and Graceland agreed to park the planes at Graceland in the mid-1980s, and tours of their opulent interiors became popular with visitors. Their agreement called for OKC Partnership to receive a cut of ticket sales in return for keeping the planes at Graceland.\n\nBut the fate of the planes became cloudy last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elvis Presley\u2019s planes to remain at Graceland", "title": "Elvis Presley\u2019s planes to remain at Graceland", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Elvis Presley\u2019s planes to remain at Graceland", "title": "Elvis Presley\u2019s planes to remain at Graceland", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/27/elvis_presleys_planes_to_remain_at_graceland/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/graceland-planes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Elvis Presley\u2019s planes to remain at Graceland", "title": "Elvis Presley\u2019s planes to remain at Graceland", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/graceland-planes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Adrian Sainz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdcb\"", "article_summary": "OKC Partnership and Graceland agreed to park the planes at Graceland in the mid-1980s, and tours of their opulent interiors became popular with visitors.\nTheir agreement called for OKC Partnership to receive a cut of ticket sales in return for keeping the planes at Graceland.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsMEMPHIS, Tenn.
