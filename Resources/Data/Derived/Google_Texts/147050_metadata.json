I also think it has improved my balance when I walk. Is there any science behind that? \u2014 Janet R., Tempe Arizona\n\nA: You\u2019re so smart to get a hearing aid; less than 25 percent of folks who need them get them!\n\nA hearing aid reconnects you to the world around you, and researchers are discovering that it can even affect your balance and help prevent falls. Balance is dependent on a complex system that processes information from your feet, skin, eyes and (there\u2019s some indication) hearing. It all comes together in your inner ear, where the so-called labyrinth \u2014 the centerpiece of your balance or vestibular system \u2014 sends data to your brain.\n\nThe exact way hearing and balance are related remains a mystery. Regardless, there have been good epidemiological studies that show a strong correlation. For example, a 2012 study from Johns Hopkins found that people with even mild hearing loss were nearly three times more likely to have a history of falling than folks with no hearing problems.\n\nFunny thing, though \u2014 Medicare pays for a hearing exam, but Medicare/Medicaid doesn\u2019t pay for hearing aids. That puts them out of reach for many people. But if you consider that in 2012 the price tag for direct medical costs associated with falls of older adults was $30 billion, it makes good medical and financial sense for our health-care system to start covering hearing aids.\n\nHere\u2019s an idea: Maybe the health-care system could offer them to people who achieve five \u201cnormals\u201d \u2014 normal blood pressure, normal LDL cholesterol, normal fasting blood sugar, normal waist circumference to height ratio and normal use of tobacco, which is to say none. More than 97 percent of folks CAN get to those five normals with lifestyle changes and/or medication, and the cost savings from THAT would be stupendous. Do we need to say it more loudly?\n\nQ: I\u2019m turning 65 next year and am looking at getting an advanced directive for health care written up. Should I get the rest of my family to sign up, too? \u2014 Tammy R., Norman, Oklahoma\n\nA: An advance directive is a good idea for you, your husband and adult children.\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes called a living will or a durable power of attorney for health care, and it protects your point of view or specifies who can speak for you and what you want them to say if you can\u2019t speak up for yourself about health and medical issues. It also can spare your family the agony of making decisions about your medical treatment or end of life. Although it\u2019s tough to think about these kinds of issues, it\u2019s important. Almost 65 percent of people don\u2019t have any form of AD.\n\nOnce you create an AD, you can always change it as your circumstances shift or you change your point of view. After all, when The Who released \u201cMy Generation\u201d in 1965, Roger Daltry (then 21) sang, \u201cI hope I die before I get old.\u201d Now, the 71-year-old drinks herbal tea, advocates healthy living and says, \u201cI hope I die before I get too old.\u201d Seems over the years, his attitude changed \u2014 and yours may, too.\n\nTwo good resources are the websites caringinfo.org or nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/advancedirectives.html. And talk to your family about your point of view; discuss your wishes with your doctors to make sure they support your directives and make sure they all have a copy.\n\nTo help individuals take this important step, and to help the health care system avoid costly wrangles, former senator Dr. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) introduced the Medicare Choices Empowerment and Protection Act (S.2240) last April. It proposed an incentive to get Medicare beneficiaries to voluntarily create an AD in conjunction with a certified and accredited advance directive vendor.\n\nSince then, Dr. Coburn has retired \u2014 he\u2019s fighting prostate cancer \u2014 but the bill is important and we hope it makes its way through Congress.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
