Boycott Tesla Nutters Strike Again, Call Musk a Mobster

August 16th, 2014 by Jo Borrás by

Despite being named the safest car ever tested by the NHTSA, keeping its owners safe in practice, as well as theory, and being generally regarded as the best car money can buy these days, the Tesla Model S sure gets an awful lot of the wrong kind of attention.

The latest round of anti-Tesla fuckwittery comes from (probably) the same “Tesla Ticket” group as before.

Now calling itself “Phase 2: PROJECT AXCIOM” [sic], these “Boycott Tesla” nimrods believe, well … why don’t I just let you read what these nimrods believe for yourself? You can check out the group’s official insane statement for yourself, below, and leave any comments you deem such nonsense appropriate of in the comments section at the bottom of the page. Enjoy!

THIS IS YOUR TESLA MOTORS INTERVENTION: BORN IN BRIBES AND CORRUPTION, FORGED IN FIRES, AND MORE FIRES, AND STILL MORE FIRES AND SOME EXPLOSIONS, THE TOXIC TESLA CRIME-MOBILE THAT YOU ARE DRIVING IS FULL OF LIES AND CANCER CAUSING MATERIAL. WE WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT THE LOOK ON PEOPLE’S FACES, WHEN YOU DRIVE BY, MAY NOT BE ENVY BUT, RATHER: DISGUST! BRIBED: 5 Senators, 8 Senior Agency Staff and 2 White House Staff. Why do “YOU” want to be a part of that? Let’s examine the facts and details … … Some of the people involved have worked at Tesla and claim to have witnessed: “Organized crime on a first hand basis.” Two members have subscriptions to the Axciom Privacy Abuse database. They thought: “hmmm, why not use something evil for good purposes by helping to inform, and save, hapless Tesla owners who got screwed during the information Green-wash!” Members found out that major media outlet owners (Engadget, Google, AUTOBLOG GREEN, Gizmodo, Jalopnik, etc.) had stock in the Tesla and battery cartels and, thus, covered up the first investigation results. They want to clean the market more completely than an email “accident” on an IRS Hard Drive. Does that sound like a big project? It isn’t! After nearly a decade and billions of dollars of your tax money, Tesla has only sold .5% of the cars that their competing electric, or gas cars have sold for the same investments in time and dollars. Nobody wants a Tesla except Tesla’s investors and douche-bag surgeons who then crash them and kill people. So, relatively speaking, there are not that many people to hunt down.
