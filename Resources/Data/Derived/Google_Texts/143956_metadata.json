Last week, DreamWorks Animation was in talks to sell the studio to Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank for $3.4 billion.\n\nThis week, however, the talks stalled after Katzenberg made an unsuccessful effort to interest Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox in buying the company, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nFox already distributes DreamWorks films and has its own animation division, Blue Sky Studios, creator of the \"Rio\" and \"Ice Age\" films.\n\nMeanwhile, SoftBank announced a deal to invest $250 million in Legendary Entertainment.\n\nTwitter: @rverrier", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hillary Clinton to attend fundraiser hosted by Jeffrey Katzenberg", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "While he negotiates the possible sale of his studio, Jeffrey Katzenberg isn't retreating from his role as Hollywood's chief fundraiser for Democratic Party.", "title": "Hillary Clinton to attend fundraiser hosted by Jeffrey Katzenberg", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-katzenberg-fundraiser-20141003-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54300de7/turbine/la-et-ct-katzenberg-fundraiser-20141003", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "katzenberg fundraiser clinton", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81582953", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-03", "Description": "While he negotiates the possible sale of his studio, Jeffrey Katzenberg isn't retreating from his role as Hollywood's chief fundraiser for Democratic Party.
