ANALYSIS/OPINION:

President Obama and his White House are evidently so dedicated to their go-it-alone approach to governing that some Democratic senators have been forced to call up MSNBC talking heads to get the inside scoop on White House strategy.

On the network’s “Morning Joe,” both show host Joe Scarborough and “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd said they had received calls from Democratic senators to get updates on Mr. Obama’s plans, The Washington Free Beacon reported.

“I actually had a senator, and it happens quite a few times where senators will call us saying, what are you hearing over at the White House?” said Mr. Scarborough, a former Republican congressman. “What are they thinking on this bill? I’ll go, are you kidding me?”

Mr. Todd, promoting his new book on the Obama presidency — aptly titled “The Stranger” — added, “I’ve had those conversations.”

Adding to the picture of Mr. Obama’s ongoing detachment, Mr. Todd couldn’t identify a single strong relationship Mr. Obama has with a member of Congress.

With Republicans getting ready to run the show in Congress, MSNBC phones are likely going to keep ringing for Mr. Obama’s final two years.
