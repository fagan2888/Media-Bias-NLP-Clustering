Police and fire personnel were deployed Saturday afternoon at the Boulder Reservoir on the grim task of retrieving a man's body that was first spotted floating in the water by a passing cyclist.

The discovery was first reported to authorities at 12:15 p.m. They responded to the east side of the reservoir, along the dirt road that splits off from Reservoir Road just before the Boulder County Regional Fire Training Center.

Upon arrival, they spotted a man, who Boulder Sgt. Tom Dowd said appeared to be at least 50 years old, floating on the east side of the city-managed reservoir dam, clothed in pants and a shirt.

Dowd said police aren't sure how long the man was in the water before the cyclist found him, but did note that "there were no obvious signs of foul play."

The reservoir remained open throughout the recovery process, and recreational boaters remained on the lake as a fire safety boat was keeping the curious away from the recovery site.

The Boulder County Coroner and city detectives were investigating the incident. No additional details have been released.
