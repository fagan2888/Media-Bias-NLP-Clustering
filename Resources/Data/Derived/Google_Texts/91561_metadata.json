They participated in the Hoops for Troops Leadership seminar, put together by USA Basketball, the NBA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey.\n\nModerated by ESPN\u2019s college basketball analyst Jay Bilas, the panel discussion centered around the importance of dynamic leadership to build winning teams.\n\n\u201cIt was impressive to get a chance to speak to a lot of troops around the world,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so special when you\u2019re invited to do something like that. To share your leadership and expertise with coaches at that level is really a great honor.\u201d\n\nAfter the panel discussion, the coaches spent the day in DC meeting with military officials and personnel and took a tour of the White House where they met President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cIt was good to be there, knowing that President Obama is our nation\u2019s first African American president,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat was really special. It was my first opportunity to meet him. I was very impressed. I had my picture taken with him and Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nHe also met Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, a Minnesota native.\n\n\u201cWe had some things to talk about there,\u201d said Smith, who coached the Gophers from 2007-13.\n\nSmith left the nation\u2019s capitol impressed with Gen. Dempsey.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really concerned about the transition and transformation of his troops when the military starts to downsize,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe has the foresight that their troops are a lot like our athletes. They\u2019re about the same age group and are being trained to do a certain thing that will all of a sudden no longer be there. How do we make that transition?\u201d\n\nIn order to help, the coaches were asked to partner, along with their student athletes, with troops in their community and surrounding areas to spend time with them and help them cope with changes.\n\nInstead of just waving goodbye and saying he wishes them well, Smith said Dempsey wants to help the troops grow and become leaders even after their military careers are over.\n\nAnd he believes no one is better than a college coach to offer ideas and solutions in this area.\n\nWith graduation upon us, two of the four Red Raider seniors have hired agents \u2014 Jaye Crockett and Dejan Kravic.\n\nSmith makes sure his players have a grasp of what their goals are.\n\n\u201cNot just basketball goals but career goals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you want to do with your life. I spend a lot of time with our athletes making them write down their goals.\u201d\n\nWhile Smith was able to share his thoughts, he also learned a thing or two from his colleagues. Before every practice this next season, Smith wants to implement Ollie\u2019s challenge circle \u2014 where the team gathers in a circle at midcourt with the basketball and one player throws the ball to another and challenges him in a fundamental area to help him get better.\n\n\u201cI learned why these coaches are so successful,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey use different techniques to help their team and players, to motivate them or to do a lot of things. Not many people are privy to that. Some times you just have to let your ego down and say, \u2018That\u2019s good stuff.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Smith\u2019s first experience with this type of event.\n\nIn 2006, he went to Kuwait as part of Operation Hardwood II where he, along with 12 others, coached a military team in a basketball tournament.\n\nSmith and his wife Donna stayed an extra half-day in DC to meet with five members of Congress who are the TTU System\u2019s champions: Rep. Randy Neugebauer, Rep. Mike Conaway, Rep. Lamar Smith, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Rep. Roger Williams.\n\nSmith ended his time in the capitol with a luncheon with key Texas Tech alumni in Washington D.C. He hopes his players at Texas Tech accompany him on his next visit to the White House, saying that winning a national championship is \u201cour dream and goal here.\u201d\n\nHe took Kentucky to the White House after winning the 1998 national championship.\n\n\u201cIt was a great experience,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBill Clinton was the president at the time. I had a chance to speak and give him a Kentucky jersey. I had my basketball family as well as my blood family there with me. That\u2019s what made the 1998 trip such a great experience.\u201d\n\nkrista.pirtle@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8735\n\nFollow Krista on Twitter @AJ_KristaPirtle", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Sports / Red Raiders / Mens Basketball, KRISTA PIRTLE", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Texas Tech men's basketball head coach shares stories of leadership, teamwork with other coaches during his visit to D.C.", "title": "Tubby Smith goes to Washington", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/sports-red-raiders-mens-basketball/2014-05-14/tubby-smith-goes-washington", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/13359960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Guffrie Smith assigned his son, Tubby, a chore and the time frame he wanted it to be completed.That\u2019s how current Texas Tech men\u2019s head basketball head coach Tubby Smith learned an abundance about leadership from his father, an ex-military man and wounded veteran.With the different assignments in the military, Guffrie taught his son the importance of doing your own job along with the importance of teamwork.Smith shared these lessons from his father, along with countless others he\u2019s picked up in his 39 years as a coach, when he visited Washington, D.C. last week."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a14\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was good to be there, knowing that President Obama is our nation\u2019s first African American president,\u201d Smith said.\nSmith and his wife Donna stayed an extra half-day in DC to meet with five members of Congress who are the TTU System\u2019s champions: Rep.
