Every state north of Virginia has either embraced Medicaid expansion or is working towards doing so \u2013 except Maine, where Gov. Paul LePage (R) refuses to cooperate. More than 60,000 low-income Mainers would benefit from the policy, on top of the economic and fiscal benefits, but the Republican governor nevertheless vetoed Medicaid expansion yesterday.\n\nThe measure also would have established a managed care system for all 320,000 beneficiaries, an effort to control costs in the $2.5 billion program, which is Maine\u2019s version of the Medicaid health insurance program. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, the federal government offered to reimburse states for 100 percent of the cost of expansion for at least three years, then gradually reduce reimbursements rates to about 90 percent. But in his veto message to the Legislature, LePage wrote that Maine could neither afford expansion nor trust the federal government to deliver on its promises.\n\nThe rejection didn\u2019t come as a surprise, and Democratic state lawmakers will try to override LePage\u2019s veto. By all accounts, however, they face an uphill climb \u2013 some GOP state lawmakers are on board with the policy, but probably not enough to generate a two-thirds majority.\n\nBut what was somewhat surprising was just how awful LePage\u2019s defense was. The governor, struggling in his re-election bid this year, had plenty of time to come up with a credible rationale for blocking Medicaid expansion, but he didn\u2019t come up with much.\n\n\u201cIt is shortsighted to think federal funds will always be available, especially after watching the federal deficit climb and witnessing continual delays and changes from Washington,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nI realize that Paul LePage sometimes struggles with policy details, but there are some rudimentary facts he should probably understand before telling 60,000 people they can\u2019t have health insurance.\n\nFor example, if LePage is \u201cwatching the federal deficit climb,\u201d he\u2019s not watching closely enough. The federal deficit isn\u2019t climbing; it\u2019s shrinking . In fact, in recent years, we\u2019ve seen the fastest deficit reduction than at any point since World War II. Does LePage not know that? Maybe he should have looked it up before issuing his statement?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, LePage is convinced federal funds may not \u201calways be available\u201d to finance Medicaid expansion. In other words, he\u2019ll refuse the funds now because maybe, someday, far off in the future, Washington won\u2019t offer the funds they\u2019re promising to provide.\n\nSorry, 60,000 struggling Mainers. You can\u2019t have access to affordable medical care because your governor is paranoid about a fiscal situation that may or may not materialize at some point.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Maine governor had months to come up with a rationale to deny 60,000 low-income people access to affordable medical care.
