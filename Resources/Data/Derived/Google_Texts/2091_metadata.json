While you may think all of your wrapping paper is recyclable, it's not.\n\n\"People get confused about wrapping paper,\" Gunderson said.\n\nTo clear up the confusion, Gunderson says plain wrapping paper is fine; it's the fancy paper that makes it a recycling reject.\n\n\"So what we try to say is stay away from foil, or ribbons and glitter, a lot of wrapping paper has glitter,\" Gunderson said.\n\nAnother thing people don't think about is tape, they say a little tape on wrapping paper is fine, but they're asking you to remove as much of it as possible.\n\nThey also can't recycle Christmas bows, wreaths, ornaments or decorations. So in this season of giving, they're asking *you to give your trash a little thought before tossing it out.\n\n\"Anything that comes in that's not suppose to be on the line, we have to manually pick out, so anything people can leave out of the recycling bin, that really helps us out to make sure we are recycling correctly,\" Gunderson said.\n\nOne other note, old Christmas lights and electronics need to be dropped off at the city's Household Hazardous Material drop off site on North Cliff Avenue.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Whether you opened your Christmas presents tonight or are waiting until tomorrow morning, recycling companies are asking you to give them a gift.
