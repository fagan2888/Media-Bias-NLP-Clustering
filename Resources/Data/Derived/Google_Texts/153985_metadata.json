Months after its initial rollout, it still doesn't work. It has more than a dozen outstanding critical errors. There is no date set for its completion.\n\nBut according to KATU-TV, it kept passing federal \"gate reviews\" easily during its development. How could that be?\n\nFormer state lawmaker Patrick Sheehan has been looking into the scandal. He has even spoken with the FBI about what he has found.\n\nPick through his and KATU's investigation, and it looks like the Obama administration's incentive system played a part on how Cover Oregon remains unable to cover anyone at all.\n\nCover Oregon won a federal \"early innovator\" grant to build the state's healthcare exchange website. That number grew to $59 million over the course of development. In order to keep the federal dollars flowing in, Cover Oregon had to undergo periodic reviews with the feds.\n\nThe Obama government had an incentive not to find problems. Finding problems would have generated bad publicity on his signature issue, from a Democratic state, across President Obama's run for re-election. The government of Oregon had incentives to cover up any problems it was having developing the site -- 59 million reasons, to be exact.\n\nThrough the development process and the \"gate reviews,\" Cover Oregon's then chief, Carolyn Lawson, presented something to the federal reviewers that won accolades for her and the state.\n\nIn January 2012, for instance, Lawson wrote a project update for the legislator\u2019s Ways & Means Committee. She wrote that staff from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had reviewed the design in its entirety on Nov. 16 and 17. She said they were \u201cdelighted\u201d with the technical application and level of quality. \u201cThey gave Oregon very high marks, say our design was among the best they had seen,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhat else had the feds seen?\n\nDespite the praise, Lawson's team never developed a site that actually works. It still doesn't work. During the same timeframe, a company that the state hired to review progress on the site said that it was seeing a \"disaster in the making.\"\n\nSheehan says Oregon's apparent deception is enough to warrant criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cIt was communicated to me that something - one of these gate reviews having to do with a benchmark for federal funding - that the State of Oregon was not being truthful,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cThat was the allegation that was made and that was serious enough that I had to go to talk to the FBI.\" Sheehan said he took his concerns to the FBI in December, and that he\u2019s talked to investigators several times since.\n\nThroughout the process in 2012, Lawson was telling the state that her team was showing the feds a working site that allowed a live person to sign up for insurance. That's a feat that the site still can't accomplish consistently.\n\nAll this surely warrants a fraud investigation, but who investigates it? The FBI, which just scuttled its own investigation into the IRS abuse scandal? The government of Oregon? Who?\n\nCover Oregon's scandal may well go straight up into the Department of Health and Human Services, which both bungled Healthcare.gov and had every incentive to not notice problems building up in the state exchange sites. President Obama promised in his interview with Bill O'Reilly that he would hold people accountable for Obamacare's failures. But no one has been fired from his administration.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Cover Oregon Scandal: 'If it's true, someone's going to prison' | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "The award-winning Carolyn Lawson may have mishandled tens of millions of taxpayer dollars.", "title": "Cover Oregon Scandal: 'If it's true, someone's going to prison'", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/cover-oregon-scandal-if-its-true-someones-going-to-prison/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/02/IW-Lawson.jpg", "updated_time": 1464307370, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The award-winning Carolyn Lawson may have mishandled tens of millions of taxpayer dollars.", "title": "Cover Oregon Scandal: 'If it's true, someone's going to prison'", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/cover-oregon-scandal-if-its-true-someones-going-to-prison/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2014/02/IW-Lawson.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Cover Oregon Scandal: 'If it's true, someone's going to prison' | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Cover Oregon Scandal: 'If it's true, someone's going to prison'", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Cover Oregon Scandal: 'If it's true, someone's going to prison'Cover Oregon's Obamacare website is a mess.\nPick through his and KATU's investigation, and it looks like the Obama administration's incentive system played a part on how Cover Oregon remains unable to cover anyone at all.\nCover Oregon won a federal \"early innovator\" grant to build the state's healthcare exchange website.\nIn order to keep the federal dollars flowing in, Cover Oregon had to undergo periodic reviews with the feds.\nThe government of Oregon had incentives to cover up any problems it was having developing the site -- 59 million reasons, to be exact."}
