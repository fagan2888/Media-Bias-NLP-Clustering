Government Motors, however, is prepared to shovel hundreds of millions of dollars into the continued production of one of America\u2019s least favorite automobiles\u2026 Oh, and they\u2019re also going to introduce a new version of the Volt, with a lower price point and significantly fewer options.\n\nAccording to Reuters:\n\nChevrolet has sold just 58,158 Volts since the car went on sale 39 months ago, despite price cuts and heavy discounting. In comparison, the best-selling Ford F-series pickup last month sold more than 70,000.\n\nWow\u2026 That almost makes Obamacare enrollments look like a rousing success. (Almost.) Of course, the two vehicles are drastically different \u2013 making the comparison is kinda like comparing apples to spontaneously-combusting oranges. According to sales figures, the biggest difference between the two vehicles seems to be that people actually like Ford pickups.\n\nBut let\u2019s not let little business realities (like no one wanting to purchase a heavily subsidized, and overpriced, electric hybrid) get in the way of throwing some more money at the problem. Despite the fact that selling the Chevy Volt has proven to be more difficult than selling overpriced \u201cbrosurance\u201d to \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d, GM is taking a page from Team Obama\u2019s style of management: They decided to invest roughly $384 million dollars to expand production of a \u201cnew generation Volt\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cnew and improved\u201d model will, of course, be stunningly similar to the current model (ya know: the model that, apparently, nobody wants to purchase). According to Reuters:\n\nThe standard Volt won't deviate dramatically from the current model, which is priced from just under $35,000 and has a driving range of up to 380 miles, according to Chevrolet.\n\nInexplicably, some people actually seem to think that continuing the production of GM\u2019s embarrassment will yield different sales figures as time goes on. And, really, it\u2019s a logical conclusion\u2026 \u201cDoubling down\u201d is what most businesses do with products that have failed to capture the imagination of consumers. Right?\n\nFor good measure, and to ensure that their poor-performing Volt rakes in a couple dozen extra sales each year, Chevy will also feature a \u201clow cost\u201d edition of the vehicle. The plan is likely to work (sarcasm font), because there\u2019s nothing quite like shelling out tens of thousands of dollars for a liberal status symbol that doesn\u2019t have electric windows. (Especially when a large chunk of the price of the vehicle is earmarked for the electric power supply.)\n\nThe low cost edition will have less than a 300 mile range, less equipment and undoubtedly fewer cup holders. (They could probably cut a few more costs by employing the rarely mentioned \u201cFred Flintstone\u201d method of propulsion.) Oh\u2026 And it will still cost more than $30,000 for the privilege of getting behind its wheel. (A $7,500 tax credit didn\u2019t do the trick\u2026 but shaving a few thousand off the price, at the expense of quality, is going to get sales rolling?)\n\nTo the untrained eye, the Volt\u2019s sales figures pretty much resemble what the average person would consider \u201can unmitigated disaster\u201d. Most businesses, after three years of abysmal sales, would sack the creative team responsible for pitching the idea, as well as the dreamy eyed managers who gave the disaster a \u201cthumbs up\u201d\u2026\n\nBut, this is Government Motors. Results, apparently, don\u2019t matter\u2026 Maybe GM can set up an online exchange for Volts if their \u201cless-car-for-slightly-less-money\u201d campaign doesn\u2019t pan out. (Of course, with our current set of government leaders, I also wouldn\u2019t rule-out a tax on all consumers who \u201copt out\u201d of buying a Volt.)", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "GM Doubles Down on Chevy Volt's Failure - Michael Schaus - Personal Finance, Financial Advice, Money, Business News, Real Estate, Mortgages, Investments, Stocks, Ransom Notes Radio, John Ransom", "og": {"site_name": "finance.townhall.com", "description": "Chevy has sold a mere 58k Volts in more than 3 years.
