On the March 24, 2014 edition of The Kelly File on Fox News, the network's judicial analyst claimed that the controversial contraception coverage mandate will also cover abortion and euthanasia:

As everybody knows, the Affordable Care Act requires anybody that employs 50 or more people to provide health care for them that includes contraceptive services. Contraceptive services means contraception, euthanasia, and abortion.

Excluding the same kind of freedom of interpretation so vague that it would allow a hammer to be classified as an assault weapon, this claim is a flat out lie.

As explained by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the preventive coverage includes "FDA approved contraceptives," while "abortion coverage is specifically banned from being required as part of the essential benefits package."

The FDA has only ever approved one drug which induces abortion, and it is not included in this coverage. The only forms of birth control that would be provided under the ACA are those that prevent pregnancies, not any that terminate them.

The Affordable Care Act also includes language legally protecting medical providers and insurance companies who choose not to provide euthanasia services.

It's been four years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, and we still have not been able to have even so much as one honest conversation about it.
