She simply walked around him as he was chased back to where he had come from, behind stage near risers where a throng of photographers snapped away, along with Twitter-crazed guests in the audience.\n\nAnd for the record, his skimpy piece of cloth included animal ears, googly eyes and a red tongue sticking out.\n\nSo, back to the lovely clothes, and that they were.\n\nOpera coats came in deep crimson red and cantaloupe colors with mohair. Chunky turtleneck knit sweaters perfect for ski lodge or base camp had mixed patterns, high slits and embracing sleeves. One coat was a grey mink paired with snow white Mongolian lamb.\n\nGurung, a Nepalese American designer, embroidered organza for draped looks in blouses. He embellished chiffon with sequins and Swarovski crystals with more draped-detail in a Bordeaux red.\n\nHis finale was all about the gowns and more draping: in crimson, Bordeaux and midnight black. One dress had ostrich feathers embroidered on a tulle train.\n\nGurung said in a backstage interview he was inspired by a tiny former kingdom in mountainous Mustang and the indigenous culture and textures found there. He visited on a recent trip home to Nepal and it \u201cgave me this sense of calm and serenity.\u201d\n\nSandra Bullock, Zoe Saldana and Cate Blanchett have all worn Gurung gowns on recent red carpets, including a colorblocked look for Bullock at the Golden Globes.\n\nFor an up and comer like Gurung, the thrill is tangible.\n\n\u201cI know how many options they have and I know the impact that it had and I\u2019m forever grateful,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Gurung\u2019s front row was Carolina Herrera, his mentor after he won the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award in 2010, including a $300,000 prize.\n\nSitting at a show for another designer was an unusual treat for Herrera, whose Fashion Week show is scheduled Monday.\n\n\u201cI never get to go to shows and I\u2019m always in the backstage, so I don\u2019t see anything. So I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writer Nicole Evatt contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie and Nicole Evatt, http://www.twitter.com/NicoleEvatt", "article_metadata": {"description": "There were opulent gongs, mood music and richly colored coats on Prabal Gurung's Himalayas-inspired runway Saturday at New York Fashion Week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There were opulent gongs, mood music and richly colored coats on Prabal Gurung\u2019s Himalayas-inspired runway Saturday at New York Fashion Week.", "title": "Prabal Gurung show disrupted by G-string streaker", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/8/prabal-gurung-show-disrupted-by-g-string-streaker/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/08/09112bd081e542054b0f6a706700e73b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/08/09112bd081e542054b0f6a706700e73b.jpg", "description": "There were opulent gongs, mood music and richly colored coats on Prabal Gurung's Himalayas-inspired runway Saturday at New York Fashion Week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Prabal Gurung show disrupted by G-string streaker"}, "Author": "LEANNE ITALIE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK (AP) - There were opulent gongs, mood music and richly colored coats on Prabal Gurung\u2019s Himalayas-inspired runway Saturday at New York Fashion Week.\nOh, and something unusual: a streaker in an animal-print G-string, crown and bright red socks!\nAnd for the record, his skimpy piece of cloth included animal ears, googly eyes and a red tongue sticking out.\nSitting at a show for another designer was an unusual treat for Herrera, whose Fashion Week show is scheduled Monday.\n\u201cI know how many options they have and I know the impact that it had and I\u2019m forever grateful,\u201d he said."}
