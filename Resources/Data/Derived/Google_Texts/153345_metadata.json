And they\u2019re putting their money where their values are: The same survey found that the typical parents pay 27% of each student\u2019s total school costs from their income and savings.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that it costs $241,000 to raise a child in the United States from birth to age 17, and the costs don\u2019t stop when they leave home\u2014there\u2019s still college to attend, car insurance to pay, weddings to finance and home down payments to scrounge up. With the unemployment rate for 18- to 29-year-olds hovering at a discouraging 16% as of August, it\u2019s understandable that parents may want to pitch in.\n\nBut when your child looks to you for help, should you put his financial needs ahead of your own?\n\nWhy Do We Want to Help So Badly?\n\nThis desire to give your children as much as possible is something Dr. Fran Walfish, a child and family psychologist and author of \u201c The Self-Aware Parent: Resolving Conflict and Building a Better Bond With Your Child, \u201d sees often. She explains that the parent-child dynamic has changed even in the past generation or two. \u201cI think parents are inclined to put their children first because they\u2019re so desperate today to have their kids like them; they cannot bear to have their children angry at them,\u201d she says of the helicopter-parent generation. \u201cSome parents are just generally selfless, but we are living in the generation of entitlement. Grown young adults have an expectation that they deserve and should be given to, and think they have the ability to convince their parents to give in. It\u2019s not unheard of for parents to find themselves in the position of sacrificing their own financial health to give more to their children. \u201cIf I do something detrimental to myself to help out my kids, whatever. I\u2019ll make it up with extra freelance work,\u201d says Linda Guthrie, a 59-year-old mom of two college students. \u201cOur job is to help each other out.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Guthrie understands that wanting to help her kids financially and being able to aren\u2019t the same. With money for school secured through student loans, both of her children work and are expected to pay what they can for non-essential expenses such as a new smartphone or a summer abroad\u2014so Guthrie now plans to turn her attention to her own needs. \u201cNow that my kids are off in college,\u201d she says, \u201cI need to buy a new car and figure out how to contribute to retirement and build up an emergency fund. When my future is set, I will help them out.\u201d\n\nWill Giving Less Hurt Your Kids?\n\nWhile Grayson Bell\u2019s parents funded his higher education, he doesn\u2019t intend to do the same for his 8-month-old son. He opened a While Grayson Bell\u2019s parents funded his higher education, he doesn\u2019t intend to do the same for his 8-month-old son. He opened a 529 savings account before the baby was born, but if Bell has his way, the child will never know the savings exist. \u201cI want to teach him to be self-sufficient at an early age,\u201d Bell says. \u201cI want him to work hard. If he doesn\u2019t know about the savings account, he can\u2019t use it as a backup plan.\u201d\n\nBell credits this plan to the lessons he learned when his parents scaled back their contributions after his sophomore year of college. \u201cThey realized that I wasn\u2019t taking school seriously,\u201d Bell remembers. \u201cBut once I started working to cover my rent and food costs, I realized I hadn\u2019t been doing myself any favors. I learned a lot more in the last two years, juggling work and school and extracurriculars, than I did taking a free ride in the beginning.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 6 BEAUTIFUL AND AFFORDABLE PLACES TO RETIRE ABROAD\n\nBell\u2019s experience isn\u2019t uncommon. When Laura Hamilton, assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Merced, spent a year living in a dorm at a large, Midwestern university to write her thesis on how parental investments in college affect the students, she found that those who were most successful at school were also the most financially invested. That is, kids whose parents footed the bill without reservation were less understanding of the value of their education \u2026 and therefore less invested in getting its full value. (To learn more about her findings, read our interview with Hamilton .)\n\nJust as Hamilton found that kids with less financial help cared more about college, Dr. Walfish finds that kids whose parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t help them beyond a certain point take more responsibility for themselves. \u201cI think that kids whose parents can\u2019t afford to help them turn out O.K.,\u201d she muses. \u201cThose kids are forced to tap into their own resources\u2014not just financial, but also emotional\u2014to find ways of generating their own income. In the end it\u2019s better for them.\u201d\n\nWhere Should You Draw the Line?\n\nNatalie Taylor, CFP\u00ae with Natalie Taylor, CFP\u00ae with LearnVest Planning Services , says that while every generation tends to want to provide more than they had, the changing economy means that today\u2019s parents need to think differently about financing their futures.\n\nRELATED: READY TO RETIRE? 7 THINGS YOU NEED TO DO NOW\n\n\u201cWith something like retirement, there\u2019s kind of a \u2018We\u2019ll figure it out later\u2019 mentality because we don\u2019t want the kids to deal with the consequences of not getting that money today,\u201d Taylor explains. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t plan for your retirement, your kids are going to have to deal with the consequences later. By giving large sums of money to your kids, you might be sacrificing your ability to be secure in retirement.\u201d\n\nPutting your children\u2019s needs ahead of your own doesn\u2019t always mean funding their college tuition at the expense of your own retirement; Taylor also sees parents make compromising decisions like co-signing a child\u2019s mortgage \u2026 and then watching their credit score drop as the child becomes delinquent on payments.\n\nTaylor says that if you don\u2019t have the three following pillars of financial health in place, you might need to consider scaling back the funds you give your children:\n\nA continually funded and largely undisturbed retirement account like an IRA or 401(k)\n\nAn emergency fund that stores at least six months of net income in a savings account\n\nMinimal\u2014preferably no\u2014high-interest debt\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about putting yourself first financially, Dr. Walfish points out that being a financial resource for your children is less critical than being an emotional resource. \u201cParents need to feel good about whatever they can give and not feel guilty about the limitations of what they cannot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat they can always be generous with is their loving support and positive cheerleading. They can always be there to say, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re doing it on your own!\u2019 That\u2019s a great feeling for a kid\u2014I think it means more than having the cash.\"\n\nTo pull back on your contributions, she recommends simply being honest with your children. \u201cTell them, \u2018I truly wish I could give you this money, but I have to earmark it in case something comes up. I\u2019d rather you learn to be independent and financially autonomous now while I\u2019m well and can enjoy watching you grow than spring a surprise burden on you later.\u2019\u201d She says that the main message, however you choose to convey it, should always be that giving them less money isn\u2019t a punishment\u2014it\u2019s an opportunity for your children to grow.\n\nMore from LearnVest:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "According to a July study from lender Sallie Mae, 85% of parents \u201cstrongly believe that college is a smart investment in their student\u2019s future.
