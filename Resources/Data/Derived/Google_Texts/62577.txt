It's not very often fans get to sit back (or most likely stand up and dance) on a Saturday night at home and watch a pro-shot live concert by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. But we all had a special treat as the final 2013 show of the Wrecking Ball tour was streamed live on the internet (through YouTube) in spectacular fashion.

Bruce's 26-song, two-hour-and-41-minute party from the Rock in Rio Festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Saturday night played into early Sunday morning and had fans around the world buzzing at this unique opportunity to watch a live show. And what a show it was, with a huge crowd that was dancing and singing all night long.

Facebook, twitter and other social media sites were abuzz with fans staying up to close to 2 a.m. New Jersey time (the show ended at close to 3 a.m.Rio time) taking it all in.

THANK YOU @springsteen management for allowing this live stream! You brought the whole E Street Extended Worldwide Family together tonight! â€” Bruce Funds (@BruceFunds) September 22, 2013

Bruce, for the second straight show, began with the Brazilian song "Sociedade Alternativa." The crowd which was huge (probably 100,000) was to into it, just like the 8,000 fans in Sao Paulo on Wednesday.

Overall it was a pretty standard set list which is what you usually get at a festival. Bruce did play the entire "Born in the U.S.A." album and closed with a solo acoustic "This Hard Land."

Here's "Dancing in the Dark" from the show. Bruce brings up a whole crew to dance with him. Notice the great quality, the whole show was streamed like this:



Here's the final song "This Hard Land."





It was quite the way to end the 133 shows on the Wrecking Ball tour and has fans, especially those of us in the United States, hoping we get shows in 2014 as the U.S. had none in 2013.

Show began at 12:16 a.m. Rio time (one hour ahead of New Jersey)
