The pharmacy chain calls its version myHealthFinder and makes it available either through cvs.com or through minuteclinic.com, the website of its MinuteClinic chain of convenience clinics.\n\nHealthFinder.gov is a consumer-facing website that provides recommendations on health screenings and preventive care based on age, gender and other health factors, as well as information on benefits available under the Affordable Care Act and a provider directory. \u201cIt informs people of care that they can get now that they are covered,\u201d national health IT coordinator Dr. Karen DeSalvo told MedCity News.\n\nShe also agreed with an assessment that the site is a bit of clinical decision support for consumer health.\n\nDeSalvo announced CVS\u2019s participation while speaking Tuesday at the sixth annual Health Datapalooza event in Washington and in a post on the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 blog. Shortly thereafter, CVS put out a press release.\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to go to a government website, so we opened it up with an API,\u201d said DeSalvo, who has been nominated to be assistant secretary of HHS.\n\nWe know that prevention is key to helping families stay healthy, so we are pleased to work with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to give people easy access to more information about the preventive services clinically recommended for them,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Sussman, president of MinuteClinic and associate CMO of CVS Health.\n\nDeSalvo told MedCity News that \u201cthis is the beginning\u201d of a series of integrations of HealthFinder.gov. \u201cWe want to let others amplify,\u201d DeSalvo said.\n\nPhoto: CVS\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "CVS Health has become the first private company to integrate the federal government's HealthFinder.gov service into its website via a public API.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "CVS Health has become the first private company to integrate the federal government's HealthFinder.gov service into its website via a public API.", "title": "CVS opens portal to HealthFinder.gov consumer site", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/minuteclinic_003.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-03T01:14:34-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/06/cvs-opens-portal-to-healthfinder-gov-consumer-site/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/minuteclinic_003.jpg", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "CVS Health has become the first private company to integrate the federal government's HealthFinder.gov service into its website via a public API.", "card": "summary", "title": "CVS opens portal to HealthFinder.gov consumer site"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,clinical decision support, consumer health, cvs, Department of Health and Human Services, Health Datapalooza, HealthFinder.gov, HHS, Karen DeSalvo, open data, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Convergence", "tag": "open data", "published_time": "2015-06-02T11:52:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T01:14:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc78d\"", "article_summary": "DeSalvo told MedCity News that \u201cthis is the beginning\u201d of a series of integrations of HealthFinder.gov.\nCVS Health has become the first private company to integrate the federal government\u2019s HealthFinder.gov service into its website via a public application programming interface.\n\u201cIt informs people of care that they can get now that they are covered,\u201d national health IT coordinator Dr. Karen DeSalvo told MedCity News.\nShe also agreed with an assessment that the site is a bit of clinical decision support for consumer health.\nThe pharmacy chain calls its version myHealthFinder and makes it available either through cvs.com or through minuteclinic.com, the website of its MinuteClinic chain of convenience clinics."}
