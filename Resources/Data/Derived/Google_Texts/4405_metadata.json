We might debate which sacrifices are appropriate and how much should be asked of different groups, but we cannot deny that some amount of pain and discomfort \u2013 whether paying taxes, carpooling to cut harmful emissions, or volunteering to take care of our neighbors \u2013 is both necessary and healthy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn today\u2019s political climate, asking voters to engage in shared sacrifice has become taboo. But it was not long ago that public servants \u2013 liberals, independents, and conservatives \u2013 discussed sacrifice as part of a citizen\u2019s duty. At the dawn of World War II, President Roosevelt warned Americans that sacrifices awaited them, although he wisely employed some reverse psychology by saying the \u201cUnited States does not consider it a sacrifice to do all one can . . . when the Nation is fighting for its existence.\u201d President Kennedy famously asked Americans to ask themselves what they could do for their country. And President Reagan agreed to raise taxes to counter budget shortfalls.\n\nSo why don\u2019t politicians ask us to sacrifice? For one thing, a presidential campaign might be the wrong time to ask for voters to shoulder any burden. Candidates behave rationally when they avoid invoking the idea of shared sacrifice, saving painful decisions until after inauguration day. Voters do not demand a discussion of sacrifice, so politicians do not supply one. But the marketplace for sacrifice is dynamic. That is, the amount of time our leaders talk about sacrifice \u2013 and how they talk about it \u2013 affects the electorate\u2019s appetite for sacrifice.\n\nUnfortunately, talking about shared civic pain has been out of fashion for decades. Perhaps the greed-is-good philosophy of the 1980\u2019s is to blame. Or maybe we became complacent during the booming 1990s. That only a small fraction of Americans have served in the military since 9/11, and that we remain entrenched in controversial wars, further diminishes our interest in sacrifice.\n\nWhatever the cause, we need a conversation about sacrifice soon. Collective sacrifices, regardless of scale, contribute mightily to American ideas of citizenship. Shying away from a discussion about sacrifice weakens our sense of common duty, and promotes atomistic individualism among citizens who are adept at being angry, but increasingly see each other as fanatics who are unwilling to revisit their own opinions or compromise any of their priorities.\n\nThe 2016 presidential contenders have provided plenty of ostensibly pain-free \u2018solutions\u2019 to our nation\u2019s problems \u2013 carpet-bombing ISIS and raising taxes only on the rich, for example. But wishful thinking and clever sloganeering will not solve our numerous political challenges, which range from mitigating terrorism and climate change, to forging new job opportunities and criminal justice reform. Each challenge and many more will require tough choices and shared national sacrifice.\n\nCreating an ethic of shared sacrifice depends in part on our willingness to reward politicians who ask us to put our collective nose to the grindstone. If we don\u2019t reignite this conversation, we ultimately will face harder choices than those we face today. We therefore urge citizens of all political stripes to choose any issue, and ask how personal and collective sacrifice could be a part of the solution.\n\nOnly when our elected officials ask us to sacrifice, then and perhaps only then we will be able to understand the magnitude of the challenges that lie ahead of us, and be able to appreciate that making America great again will be difficult work, but work that is worth doing.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Our democratic republic cannot function without shared sacrifice.", "description": "Our democratic republic cannot function without shared sacrifice.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Our democratic republic cannot function without shared sacrifice.", "title": "The end of sacrifice?", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/268442-the-end-of-sacrifice", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-08T14:00:01-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-08T14:00-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/268442-the-end-of-sacrifice", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-08T14:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Robert M.
