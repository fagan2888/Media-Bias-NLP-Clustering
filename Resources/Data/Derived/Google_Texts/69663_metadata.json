Also, marketplace plans probably would charge low-income families a lot more for the children\u2019s coverage than the modest premiums and co-pays they pay now, said CHIP proponents.\n\nCongress\u2019 inaction poses a problem for state budget writers and health care providers. They said that while CHIP has strong political backing, they can never be sure what will happen in Washington\u2019s bitterly divided atmosphere.\n\nFrom the state, there have been no cries for Congress to kill the program. Begun in 1997, it allows states either to add children to their Medicaid programs or cover them using private insurance. Texas does the latter.\n\nWhile state GOP leaders fiercely opposed adding more poor adults to Medicaid as the federal health law encourages, they have mounted no resistance to Congress\u2019 funding CHIP beyond Sept. 30.\n\nLast fall, before he left office, former Gov. Rick Perry wrote to congressional leaders in support of continued funding.\n\n\u201cStates have considerably more flexibility in operating their CHIP programs than Medicaid programs,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a wave at Obamacare\u2019s marketplace plans, Perry said \u201cthere appears to be no immediately viable alternative proposed for covering CHIP recipients.\u201d\n\nWhile Gov. Greg Abbott hasn\u2019t taken a position on continued federal funding of CHIP, Senate Finance Committee Chairwoman Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, expects it to happen.\n\nNelson said through a spokeswoman that while the Affordable Care Act \u201cis unsustainable,\u201d she expects Congress to extend CHIP funding, \u201cat least for now.\u201d\n\nTexas legislative leaders and health care providers said failure by Congress to act would put a nearly $2 billion dent in the next two-year state budget.\n\nHouse and Senate Republican leaders assumed in their initial budgets that not only would federal funding of CHIP last through 2017, but a special bump in federal funding that starts this fall would continue as well. The increase is part of Obamacare.\n\nIn Texas, it would make 94 percent of the program federally funded. In the current state budget cycle, Washington covered 71 percent of CHIP\u2019s cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful,\u201d said Anne Dunkelberg, a former Texas Medicaid official who has strongly promoted CHIP as associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities. It advocates for low- and middle-income Texans.\n\n\u201cIf history is our guide, we always get much more bipartisan support for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Washington, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said continued funding for CHIP is \u201cmust-do\u201d legislation. Hatch was one of the program\u2019s original authors.\n\nGOP Rep. Joe Barton of Arlington, chairman emeritus of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, through which a CHIP bill would pass, said renewing the funding should be \u201cpretty plain vanilla.\u201d\n\nSpokesman Sean Brown, while cautioning that deliberations have yet to begin, said Barton \u201cis supportive of CHIP reauthorization.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Michael Marks in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Robert T.
