The insurers \u2014 only one of which is identified, CareMore \u2014 are testing Sentrian\u2019s computer learning approach, which is designed to automatically adjust the triggers based on previous results, says Martin Kohn, M.D., chief medical scientist at Sentrian and a former IBMer himself. [Kohn was chief medical scientist for Care Delivery Systems at IBM Research, according to Sentrian].\n\nFor example, weight is a commonly recorded gauge for congestive heart failure patients who may be recording and reporting the data multiple times a day. \"The problem is that there are many, many reasons why a patient's weight can change from one day to the next,\" Kohn says. As a result, the recorded weight change doesn't always reflect worsening CHF, he says.\n\nThe approach being tested by CareMore is based on multiple parameters and a pattern-recognition algorithm designed to sift out false positives as they become recognizable. The pattern may be a combination of weight gain and change in pulse.\n\nSentrian's system can measure things like blood pressure, pulse and blood concentration generally two times a day, according to Kohn. Advancements in technology may soon allow for the measurement of fluid in the lungs, as well as more frequent monitoring, Kohn says. CareMore and the unidentified insurer are testing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1,500 in total and the same number of control group patients.\n\nCompared with the machine learning we're accustomed to seeing in movies, this might sound like child's play. But if these advances progress as quickly as predicted, big changes may be ahead.\n\nComment below or via email, Twitter, and Google+.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care may still be at the very early stages of using computers that can learn and adapt over time, but the industry is advancing in that regard.", "csrf-token": "qMA9cKrk8frlMxKiumM1SRnlnnJVc56fajNTNDX7QwY=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/b/Barr_190x127.jpg?1448315746", "description": "New advanced computing systems, including IBM's Watson, are being tested to propel clinical learning to new levels.", "card": "summary", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Gaining Ground in Health Care"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/b/Barr_190x127.jpg?1448315746", "type": "Article", "description": "New advanced computing systems, including IBM's Watson, are being tested to propel clinical learning to new levels.", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Gaining Ground in Health Care"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "Artificial intelligence, machine learning, ibm, Watson, mayo clinic, sentrian, caremore, home monitoring, hospital, healthcare, healthcare, chronic care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad36\"", "article_summary": "Advancements in technology may soon allow for the measurement of fluid in the lungs, as well as more frequent monitoring, Kohn says.\nSentrian's system can measure things like blood pressure, pulse and blood concentration generally two times a day, according to Kohn.\nAs a result, the recorded weight change doesn't always reflect worsening CHF, he says.\n\"The problem is that there are many, many reasons why a patient's weight can change from one day to the next,\" Kohn says.\nTraditionally, home monitoring systems focused on a single parameter that carried a fixed trigger level, according to Sentrian officials."}
