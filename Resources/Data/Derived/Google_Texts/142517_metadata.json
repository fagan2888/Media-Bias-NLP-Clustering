But the technology side of banking and finance is evolving just as rapidly.\n\nBetween big fund managers trying to sidestep high-frequency stock trading, banks trying to cut costs through streamlining their systems, and small day traders who want access to big professional tools, some private equity and venture capital investors see a similar scale of opportunity.\n\nOne firm trying to step up in the space is Aquiline Capital Partners, the New York-based private equity firm founded by Jeffrey Greenberg, former chief executive of insurance and risk-management giant Marsh & McLennan (and son of former AIG chief Hank Greenberg).\n\nThe firm\u2014whose current fund, raised in 2012, is roughly $750 million\u2013at present focuses on investments in insurers, banks and investment-management companies (and recently disclosed its full portfolio on the web). In June, it hired Vincenzo La Ruffa from Susquehanna Growth Equity, a \u201cfin tech\u201d specialist, to focus on investments in that sub-sector for the firm.\n\nWe spoke to Mr. La Ruffa about what he and Aquiline see as the future for private equity in \u201cfin tech.\u201d Here is an edited transcript of the conversation.\n\nHow do you define financial technology?\n\nIt\u2019s the enabling technology around the financial services universe: asset management, banking, trading, and insurance. It gets bigger every day, because we\u2019re more of a paymentized society every year.\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cpaymentized society?\u201d\n\nFrom the commercial level down to a retail individual user, we can make more and more choices of how to buy things, like in smaller increments or with much more control. Whether it\u2019s how we pay for a taxi, buy food, or what we want from our banking services, the payment of those items is more discrete, and there are more unique ways to pay.\n\nWhere will you be aiming for investments?\n\nOur strategy will be more in the classic private equity, but squarely in the mid-market. There are assets that are off the beaten track, but are increasingly extremely important: compliance, the back office, processing.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot of attention around \u201chigh-frequency trading\u201d again, especially after the publication of \u201cFlash Boys.\u201d Is market structure a hot investment right now?\n\nUp until about six months ago, we\u2019d been in a lull in market structure opportunities. There were a series of successful businesses that developed in the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s, and public companies that grew as well and created a lot of value. Since then, it hasn\u2019t been an area where you saw a lot of dollars going. But I think recently some of the news in the market, some new entrants, and a few new regulatory announcements have been making a lot of noise. So I think that\u2019s back in play.\n\nWith all the attention on the space, how are prices of fin-tech assets?\n\nFinancial technology provides incredibly high return on investments for customers \u2013 very small improvements can create dramatic economic outcomes for the end user. So [private equity firms] continue to acquire businesses because they are able to keep turning around and selling them. When that keeps happening again and again, the secret gets out, and you\u2019re going to have a high-valued sector.\n\nSo is the hope of a private equity firm to flip these technologies to big banks?\n\nThere was a time when you saw the big banks as acquirers. That happened with some real frequency. But I think that time has passed.\n\nYet you don\u2019t see a ton of IPOs. The problem is that the market opportunity for them very often is only $100 million to $200 million. Public markets need massive growth and massive markets. With the notable example being Markit, the strategic option is typically going to be the exit.\n\nOn the payments and transaction processing side, many of those would make terrific public companies: they\u2019re growing fast, with recurring revenue and large margins. But we\u2019re in an environment when the existing public companies are serial acquirers.\n\nI do think you\u2019re going to have more [M&A] activity in insurance and core retail banking systems. The underlying profitability of those businesses are under enough pressure that for the first time in a while, they want to focus more on how outside technology can help them.\n\nWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com.
