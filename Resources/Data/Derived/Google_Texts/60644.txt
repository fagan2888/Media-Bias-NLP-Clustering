Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.03% had reportedly been in talks to buy Salesforce.com CRM, +0.99% earlier this spring but the discussions fizzled out after the two failed to see eye-to-eye on price, according to CNBC. Microsoft was willing to offer roughly $55 billion for the company, while Salesforce was insisting on something as high as $70 billion, according to the report. Salesforce, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings earlier this week, has a market cap of roughly $48 billion. Its stock has risen 17% over the last three months, including more than 3% to $75.21 in recent trade on Friday. Earlier this spring, Bloomberg reported that Salesforce was working with financial advisers to field takeover offers. Shares of Microsoft were down 0.5% to $47.19 in recent trade.
