Jeb Bush made headlines by suggesting that love prompts many foreign nationals to illegally enter the U.S. They come, he said:\n\n\u201c\u2026 because their families \u2013 the dad who loved their children \u2013 was worried that their children didn\u2019t have food on the table. And they wanted to make sure their family was intact, and they crossed the border because they had no other means to work to be able to provide for their family. Yes, they broke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony. It\u2019s an act of love.\u201d\n\nThe conservative response was strong, swift and almost unanimously negative. A few pundits even claimed that, with his \u201cact of love\u201d remark, Bush dashed any hope he may have had of winning the Republican nomination for president in 2016.\n\nMuch of the criticism was of the \u201cWe are a nation of laws\u201d variety. (Of course, some of these same people supported Cliven Bundy in his battle with federal land managers; perhaps if immigration reformers labeled their cause \u201ccivil disobedience,\u201d they\u2019d attract more conservatives to their cause.) But Bush stated clearly that he thinks those crossing the border illegally should pay a \u201cprice\u201d for breaking the law.\n\nMore to the point, just because an act is \u201cillegal\u201d does not mean it can\u2019t be done out of love. Which brings me back to my original question to my fellow conservatives: What would you do in their shoes? Would you break the law to feed your family, or follow the law and risk endangering them?\n\nI have yet to encounter anyone who has told me that they wouldn\u2019t do whatever it took to help their family \u2014 including crossing a border to find work. In fact, I\u2019d argue that people living in the direst circumstances would not only be permitted to break the law, but be obligated to do so.\n\nI am not the only one who feels that way. So, apparently, do many of those most directly responsible for preventing such acts of love from happening.\n\nRecently in National Affairs, immigration expert Peter Skerry wrote that one thing \u201cwhich no [Border Patrol] agent I have ever talked with has failed to voice unprompted, is, \u2018If I were in [the undocumented immigrants\u2019] shoes, I\u2019d be doing the same thing and crossing that border to better things for me and my family.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The way we treat immigrants is wrongheaded and counterproductive.
