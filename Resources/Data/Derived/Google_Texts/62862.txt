Exactly five years ago this week, as the Congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act was coming to its eventual conclusion, Rush Limbaugh made a bold statement about his future as a resident of the United State of America.

Speaking to a caller who expressed concerns about the impact of Obamacare on the U.S. healthcare system, Limbaugh said, “If this passes and it’s five years from now and all that stuff gets implemented, I am leaving the country. I’ll go to Costa Rica.”

While this month has seen a Supreme Court challenge to the fundamental principle behind the law, which could be its undoing if the justices rule in the plaintiffs’ favor, there has been plenty of positive news about Obamacare this year as well. An additional 11.4 million people enrolled through the exchanges ahead of last month’s deadline and just today the CBO put out a new projection that says it will cost $142 billion, or 11 percent, less to implement over the next 10 years than previously estimated.

Curiously, the host did not host his daily radio show on Monday, with Wisconsin’s Mark Belling sitting in. Could this mean that Limbaugh made good on his promise?
