Bush, Iraq, peter baker, Entertainment News, Politics News\n\nOn Jan. 30, 2001, ten days after his inauguration, President George W. Bush convened the first meeting of his National Security Council in the White House Situation Room. The first order of business was a discussion of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.\n\nThe second order of business was Iraq.\n\n\u201cWhy are we even bothering with sanctions?\u201d Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld responded to Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s suggestion that the administration strengthen economic sanctions against Iraq, which was in violation of U.N. resolutions intended to prevent Iraq from developing atomic, chemical and biological weapons.\n\nPeter Baker recounts the exchange in his new book, \u201cDays of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House,\u201d which depicts a Bush administration preoccupied with Iraq from its earliest days. Baker, the Times\u2019 chief White House correspondent, spoke to me by phone from his desk at the paper\u2019s Washington bureau.\n\nIraq was really the point of the first meeting of the National Security Council. The Bush administration was thinking about invading Iraq long before 9/11. Did you set out to find the \u201creal\u201d reason for invading Iraq?\n\nI did want to find out the thinking about Iraq. That was the single biggest, most consequential decision he makes during his presidency. How they came to that moment is something we\u2019re going to be exploring and debating and reexamining for years to come. I think what [the book] shows is that the invasion was not always preordained but that they came in with Iraq as the central focus of their national security. Saddam Hussein was their No. 1 threat, in effect.\n\nI don\u2019t think they were necessarily talking about war at that point. Regime change was definitely on the table \u2014 that had been the policy Clinton had signed and Congress had passed \u2014 but at that point there was no appetite by the public to send American troops. They were looking at what they could do to further squeeze [Saddam] through sanctions, through covert acts perhaps, through all sorts of different possibilities, but I don\u2019t think they were thinking about the full-on invasion that we ultimately had.\n\nDid you come to any conclusions or realizations about who drove the decisions or whether the bases for the invasion were different than the ones that were offered at the time?\n\nIt\u2019s a mix of things. It\u2019s never as simple as a single reason. Did President Bush\u2019s father\u2019s experience with Iraq play a part? Obviously that\u2019s part of it. Was it the main thing? That\u2019s overstating it. How much did Cheney\u2019s experience having been in the [George H.W.] Bush administration as secretary of defense during the Gulf War shape this? That\u2019s where he comes from. So these things are the context from which people are making decisions.\n\nI found an oral history that Cheney had given just before he joined the ticket in 2000 that was sealed until he left office, so nobody had really ever seen it. In 2000, he defends the idea of not going all the way to Baghdad, as they didn\u2019t in 1991. He thought it would have been a mistake. By the end of 2001, his thinking had changed. His calculations were different. His calculation of the risks involved, his calculation of what\u2019s possible as far as the American public \u2014 all of that has changed by that point. It\u2019s an interesting, developing process.\n\nWhen you staff your State Department and your Defense Department with a bunch of neocons, the advice you get is going to be hawkish.\n\nYep, no question. But they\u2019re also pushing on an open door. That\u2019s where Bush\u2019s head was. That\u2019s one of the things we may over-interpret \u2014 how much other people were making decisions. Cheney was in two previous administrations, but Bush 41 and 43 were different presidents with different philosophies.\n\nYou said in the acknowledgments that President Bush had declined to talk for the book but that he did not discourage people from his administration from talking to you. Was there anyone you didn\u2019t get to talk to?\n\nJust to be clear: He wasn\u2019t encouraging people at the beginning. Over time, he was less vigorous in discouraging people. It took some people 20, 30 months to actually agree to sit down and talk to me. I suspect that\u2019s because over time he came around to the idea that he wasn\u2019t going to stand in the way if people wanted to talk to me.\n\nAt any rate, as far as the national security side, I got most of who I really wanted. I would have liked to have had the president, but we got Cheney, Colin Powell, Condi Rice, Don Rumsfeld, Steve Hadley, David Petraeus, lots of the other generals, and so on. There are a few people who were not on the record, but most people I talked to were, which added to the value of the record.\n\nHave you seen the neocons from the administration recasting? What\u2019s their current conventional wisdom on what the point of Iraq was?", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Days of Fire\" author Peter Baker talks to Salon about the Iraq war, and how the GOP has changed", "title": "Would Rand Paul be another George Bush?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Days of Fire\" author Peter Baker talks to Salon about the Iraq war, and how the GOP has changed", "title": "Would Rand Paul be another George Bush?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/15/would_rand_paul_be_another_george_bush/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/bush_paul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Days of Fire\" author Peter Baker talks to Salon about the Iraq war, and how the GOP has changed", "title": "Would Rand Paul be another George Bush?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/bush_paul.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Porch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, days of fire, George W.
