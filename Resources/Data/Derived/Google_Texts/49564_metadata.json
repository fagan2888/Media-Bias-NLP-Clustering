She answered children\u2019s questions about Santa\u2019s exact location using the global Santa Tracker located at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe NORAD Tracks Santa program began in 1955 after a phone call was made to the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe call was from a local youngster who dialed a misprinted telephone number in a local newspaper advertisement. The commander on duty who answered the phone that night gave the child the information requested \u2013 the whereabouts of Santa. This began the tradition of tracking Santa, a tradition that was carried on by NORAD when it was formed in 1958.\n\nThe NORAD Tracks Santa program has grown immensely since first presented on the Internet in 1997. The website, www.noradsanta.org, receives millions of unique visitors from hundreds of countries and territories around the world. In addition, a live Operations Center is occupied for 23 hours with more than 1,200 volunteers each year who receive hundreds of thousands of phone calls and emails from families around the world.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NORAD-calling Santa-trackers receive surprise update from First Lady", "title": "NORAD-calling Santa-trackers receive surprise update from First Lady", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/24/norad-calling-santa-trackers-receive-surprise-update-from-first-lady/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224_074445_NORAD-Santa-Tracker.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224_074445_NORAD-Santa-Tracker.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-24T18:52:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T11:05:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe16\"", "article_summary": "The NORAD Tracks Santa program has grown immensely since first presented on the Internet in 1997.\nThe NORAD Tracks Santa program began in 1955 after a phone call was made to the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center in Colorado Springs.\nThis began the tradition of tracking Santa, a tradition that was carried on by NORAD when it was formed in 1958.\nIt is the fifth consecutive year that the First Lady took calls during her family\u2019s vacation in Hawaii.\nThe commander on duty who answered the phone that night gave the child the information requested \u2013 the whereabouts of Santa."}
