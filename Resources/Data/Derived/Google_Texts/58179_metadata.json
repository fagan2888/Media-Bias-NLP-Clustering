The tax still must be repealed, they say, not merely modified.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 cannot be fixed,\u201d James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, a nonprofit representing employers, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re glad the administration recognizes the \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 is seriously flawed. But its impact in high cost areas is just one of its many problems.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s proposal would reflect regional differences in the cost of practicing medicine, reducing the tax\u2019s bite where care is particularly expensive, Jason Furman, the White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. Employers have complained that by imposing a uniform limit on the value of health benefits across the country, the tax failed to take into account the higher cost of health insurance in some regions.\n\nThe American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, said it still supports \u201cnothing less than full repeal\u201d of the tax.\n\n\u201cMinor tweaks are insufficient to remedy its myriad problems,\u201d said Steven Kreisberg, director of collective bargaining at the AFSCME union.\n\n\u2018Gold\u2019 Plans\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health plans pay a 40 percent excise tax on the cost of their coverage over a threshold value, currently $10,200 for individuals or $27,500 for families. Such plans are called \u201cCadillac\u201d because they usually offer generous health coverage. The limits are expected to adjust upward before the tax takes effect in 2020.\n\nObama\u2019s budget would raise the threshold at which plans are subject to the tax in states with higher health-care costs. Instead of a single threshold across the country, employers could offer more generous coverage in states where \u201cgold\u201d-level plans offered on the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges cost more than the Cadillac tax limits. Gold plans are the second-most generous plans available on the exchanges.\n\nThe effect would be that fewer employers would pay the tax.\n\nEven though Obama\u2019s modification of the tax hasn\u2019t mollified groups affected by the tax, there are strategic reasons to offer the proposal, said Stan Collender, a budget analyst and executive vice president at Qorvis/MSLGroup in Washington. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat vying to succeed Obama as president, has promised to eliminate the tax and may benefit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep the tax in place rather than have it go away,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNow unions are going to be able to sidle up to Hillary, who says she\u2019s going to remove it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bad Policy\u2019\n\nThe National Retail Federation, a group of more than 18,000 companies that often finds itself on the opposite side of unions, is in the same corner on the tax.\n\n\u201cThe Cadillac tax is bad policy,\u201d Neil Trautwein, vice president of health-care policy at the retail group, said by e- mail. \u201cThe answer to health-care costs is with providers, not the purchasers of care or coverage.\u201d\n\nThe National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers, said it appreciated Obama\u2019s acknowledgment that the tax \u201chas flaws and targets employees even in modest plans,\u201d but that it still wants the levy repealed.\n\nThe White House said the change is good economic and health-care policy.\n\n\u201cEconomists and health policy experts across the political spectrum agree that the excise tax will drive employers \u2014 and the insurers who want their business \u2014 to make their health- care plans more efficient, such as by deploying innovative new ways of paying doctors and hospitals and negotiating for better prices from insurers and providers,\u201d White House spokeswoman Katie Hill said in an e-mail. \u201cCongress has already shown a willingness to make common-sense improvements to the tax, and we encourage them to enact additional sensible improvements, like the proposals we\u2019re putting forth.\u201d\n\nCost Growth\n\nPaul Van der Water, a researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which advocates for policies that benefit low-income people and is frequently allied with the White House, said Obama\u2019s proposal merits consideration.\n\n\u201cThe tax has a strong policy rationale,\u201d he wrote in a blog post on the group\u2019s website. \u201cIt could slow health-care cost growth by discouraging firms from buying extremely expensive health coverage that promotes excess use and inefficient delivery of health care.\u201d\n\nThe tax was key in financing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance coverage expansions, and was intended to slow the rise of health-care costs by putting pressure on employers to limit their benefits and push for lower prices from hospitals and doctors.\n\nThe year-end spending deal that Obama signed in December postponed the start of the Cadillac tax by two years, until 2020. The Congressional Budget Office said the delay would result in lost revenue of $17.7 billion over 10 years.\n\nOrrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, maintained that the tax must be repealed.\n\n\u201cPutting a band-aid on the issue, as the administration\u2019s proposal does, won\u2019t fix the problem,\u201d Hatch said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. \u201cInstead, we need to have this flawed tax repealed in its entirety once and for all.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 Bloomberg.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "President Barack Obama is having a tough time winning friends for his Cadillac tax.
