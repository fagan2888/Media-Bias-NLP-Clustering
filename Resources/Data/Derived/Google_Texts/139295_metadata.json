Ferrell posted a brief message and a picture of himself holding a #GetCovered sign.\n\nAccording to The Hill, many A-List celebrities have avoided helping the president and the Obama administration in the Obamacare public relations blitz in the run-up to the March 31 enrollment deadline. \u201cIt seems that not even the president\u2019s most fervent and committed supporters want to get too close to ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nThe administration claimed yesterday that enrollment has hit four million, but according to the Washington Examiner, that\u2019s not the full picture: \u201cThe [Department of Health and Human Services] numbers include only those who have selected a plan through one of the exchanges, rather than the number who have paid \u2014 which is typically how insurers measure enrollment. As a gauge, last week California reported that 20 percent of those who signed up in the state as of Jan. 31 hadn\u2019t paid first month\u2019s premiums.\u201d\n\nThe contradiction inherent in celebrity endorsements is that most wealthy Hollywood types have gold-plated insurance plans and access to the best doctors that insulate them from the limitations, cancellations, and many other problems associated with Obamacare, including glitches on HealthCare.gov and the state equivalents, that ordinary Americans face or will face.\n\nWhile quite a few pro-Obamacare comments (some of which sound like they might have been posted by political operatives working from talking points) showed up on Ferrell\u2019s page, the following are representative:\n\n\u201cYou can pay for my Obamacare Mr. Ferrell. You millionaires know what\u2019s best for us anyways right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill!!! Love your movies, but you are out of your mind on the ACA. Why don\u2019t you make a movie about some huge group of morons who are promised lower rates, better coverage, and the ability to keep your doctors\u2026 Oh wait, nobody would believe a stupid story like that.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026As a former Obama supporter, former democrat and now former fan of yours I can tell you this much why don\u2019t you try walking in our shoes or at the very least read about the topic or the actual Obama care platform, you fucking sellout!! You were never that funny anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich plan did you sign up for Will? Did you get to keep your doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem with Obamacare is that the premium is more than double what I currently play for private individual health insurance, and for fewer benefits\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGo hold that sign in front of the President and Congressional morons who voted this law upon the country and then opted themselves right out of it\u2026\u201d\n\nWhether you\u2019re a fan of Obamacare (i.e., the Affordable Care Act) or not, in general would those in the entertainment industry like Will Ferrell be better off steering clear of politics?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will Ferrell's Facebook posting/picture encouraging people to #getcovered by Obamacare received a \"healthy\" response, but apparently most of it negative", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Will Ferrell\u2019s Facebook posting/picture encouraging people to #getcovered by Obamacare received a \u201chealthy\u201d response, but apparently most of it negative", "title": "Will Ferrell #GetCovered Obamacare Promotion, Facebook Users Respond", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1150226/will-ferrell-getcovered-obamacare-promotion-facebook-users-respond/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Will-Ferrelll-promotes-Obamacare-facebook-2.png", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-26T15:14:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-27T14:50:21+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Will-Ferrelll-promotes-Obamacare-facebook-2.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-02-26T15:14:50+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,facebook,getcovered,will ferrell,will ferrell obamacare,celebrity news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Will-Ferrelll-promotes-Obamacare-facebook-2.png", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Will Ferrell\u2019s Facebook posting/picture encouraging people to #getcovered by Obamacare received a \u201chealthy\u201d response, but apparently most of it negative"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd59a8\"", "article_summary": "Will Ferrell\u2019s Facebook posting/picture encouraging people to #getcovered by Obamacare received a \u201chealthy\u201d response, but apparently most of it negative.\nNearly 6,000 users added comments to Ferrell\u2019s Facebook page about the actor/comedian\u2019s role in trying to convince consumers, particularly younger ones, to enroll in the health insurance program, which is falling far short of projections.\nFerrell posted a brief message and a picture of himself holding a #GetCovered sign.\nAccording to The Hill, many A-List celebrities have avoided helping the president and the Obama administration in the Obamacare public relations blitz in the run-up to the March 31 enrollment deadline.\nYou were never that funny anyway.\u201d\u201cWhich plan did you sign up for Will?"}
