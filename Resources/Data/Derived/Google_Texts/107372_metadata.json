He completed 13-of-19 passes for 206 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\u201cIt was really important for me to play well,\u201d the sophomore said. \u201cIt was real special, because I grew up going to CU games. So to come onto this field as a player was like a dream come true.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, I tried to calm my mind before the game and tried to do my job.\u201d\n\nMiles executed some beautiful plays, including a perfectly timed option pitch to Shaq Thompson that resulted in a 24-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. With 5:38 left in the third quarter, Miles gave his Huskies a 24-23 lead on a perfectly-executed play-action, 28-yard TD pass to Dante Pettis.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all pretty. He mishandled several snaps, including one on Washington\u2019s second possession of the game. Deep in CU territory, he dropped the ball while in the shotgun formation. Colorado\u2019s Kenneth Olugbode smothered the fumble at the CU 12.\n\n\u201cI think (Miles) did a good job,\u201d Washington coach Chris Petersen said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why he was fumbling the snaps. I don\u2019t know if he was putting too much on himself to make things happen fast, but that was very frustrating for us. I know it was frustrating for him.\u201d\n\nA week after suffering a concussion, Miles did not play in Washington\u2019s 24-10 loss to No. 14 Arizona State last Saturday at Husky Stadium. Redshirt freshman Troy Williams made his first career start, but Miles was back under center against the Buffs.\n\nThe Huskies (6-3, 2-3 in the Pac-12) are 5-2 in Miles\u2019 starts this season. In those seven games, the UW offense has averaged 27.6 points per game. Miles had gone 173 consecutive passes without an interception until throwing his first at No. 9 Oregon two weeks ago. Overall this season, he has completed 66.5 percent of his passes (117-for-176) for 1,2049 yards with 12 touchdowns and just one interception.\n\n\u201cI thought I did some good things,\u201d Miles said after Saturday\u2019s game while friends and family eavesdropped on his interview outside the visitors\u2019 locker room at Folsom Field. \u201cI thought I definitely needed to take care of the ball. I thought I did a decent job, but I have a lot of work on ball security.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mullen High grad Cyler Miles has big game in Washington\u2019s win over CU", "title": "Mullen High grad Cyler Miles has big game in Washington\u2019s win over CU", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/01/mullen-high-grad-cyler-miles-has-big-game-in-washingtons-win-over-cu/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101__washingotn-cyler-milesp1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101__washingotn-cyler-milesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-01T16:52:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:44:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "Miles shook off a few jittery moments Saturday afternoon to lead the Huskies to a 38-23 victory over the Buffs at Folsom Field.\nBOULDER \u2014 Back in the day, when Cyler Miles was winning state titles at Mullen High School, plenty of Colorado football fans thought he\u2019d look really good in black and gold.\n\u201cI thought I did some good things,\u201d Miles said after Saturday\u2019s game while friends and family eavesdropped on his interview outside the visitors\u2019 locker room at Folsom Field.\nI know it was frustrating for him.\u201dA week after suffering a concussion, Miles did not play in Washington\u2019s 24-10 loss to No.\nWith 5:38 left in the third quarter, Miles gave his Huskies a 24-23 lead on a perfectly-executed play-action, 28-yard TD pass to Dante Pettis."}
