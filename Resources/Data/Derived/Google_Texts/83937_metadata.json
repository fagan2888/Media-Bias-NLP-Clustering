The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the desk of President Barack Obama, where it surely will be vetoed.\n\nJust when, I have to ask, did my Grand Old Party\u2019s idea of victory become passing bills that won\u2019t become law? What\u2019s so glorious about fecklessness? The GOP House put an awful lot of work \u2014 it has voted to repeal Obamacare 62 times \u2014 into passing something that cannot become law while Obama is president and there are not enough Republicans to override a veto. Yet I see progress.\n\nThis was the first time the Senate passed a repeal bill \u2014 thanks to a budget reconciliation rule that allows leadership to bypass cloture rules that require 60 votes. \u201cEvery single member of our conference campaigned on repeal of this disastrous law,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s . spokesman, Don Stewart, told me. They all delivered.\n\nRepublicans did not deliver a bill with an alternative health care plan \u2014 to the glee of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi . , whose office posted on a blog about the many times House Republicans have promised an alternative without wrapping the package. It seems there is not a lot of pressure for Republicans to support an alternative bill; the heavy pressure lines up behind gimmicks.\n\nOr maybe that\u2019s changing. Last year, Sen. Ted Cruz, . R-Texas, argued it was the \u201cright thing\u201d for the GOP Congress to risk shutting down the government by passing a spending bill that defunded Planned Parenthood. Cruz didn\u2019t care how that same tactic backfired in 2013 or that National Right to Life President Carol Tobias opposed his shutdown gambit. She told supporters that given how congressional rules work, the only way to defund Planned Parenthood is to elect a president who opposes abortion. For once, the lemming caucus didn\u2019t herd the whole GOP caucus toward the cliff.\n\nTobias told me the newly passed measure shows that the Senate can pass a bill to defund Planned Parenthood with a simple majority vote. That\u2019s a win. And: \u201cThere were a lot of conservatives and Republicans who didn\u2019t think Mitt Romney was good enough. So they didn\u2019t vote.\u201d Obama won re-election. Now \u201cmany of these same people are \u2026 upset that Republicans in Congress aren\u2019t doing what they consider to be enough. I\u2019m sorry; elections have consequences.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what bugs me: The House Freedom Caucus withholds votes \u2014 which sends House Speaker Paul Ryan . into Pelosi\u2019s loving arms. Then the caucus complains that Ryan worked with Democrats. As the House passed the Obamacare repeal, caucus head Raul Labrador of Idaho announced that Ryan\u2019s honeymoon is over \u2014 and Ryan \u201cneeds to start putting up real conservative reform\u201d to show that he is different from former House Speaker John Boehner . .\n\nBy the way, Pelosi\u2019s post also asserted that Ryan is \u201cno different than John Boehner.\u201d Great minds\u2026\n\nActually, Ryan and McConnell have done something that could not be accomplished without their majorities. With a bill on his desk, Obama will be forced to veto the measure \u2014 and in so doing, he\u2019ll remind the public why the Affordable Care Act is so unpopular. But wait; there\u2019s more: They sent the Oval Office a spending bill, signed in December, that included a two-year hiatus on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans and the 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices. The impure GOP establishment actually passed measures that peeled back Obamacare.\n\nCritics on the far right want to rub away the shine of accomplishment. Talk to Republican voters and many seem unaware of GOP victories. The think tank establishment and radio talk show hosts tell the base that the GOP leadership is good for nothing, when the eggheads are good for getting nothing done.\n\nThe notion that the GOP-led Congress doesn\u2019t do anything feeds Democrats\u2019 claims that this is a \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Congress. To the contrary, under Republican control, the Senate passed the first multiyear highway bill since 2005. Obama signed it in December. Since 1997, Congress regularly has had to pass \u201cdoc fixes\u201d to avert huge scheduled cuts in payments to physicians that would have chased physicians out of Medicare. This Congress repealed the formula that made those fixes necessary. In April, Obama signed the bill. In November, the president signed a defense bill that raised military pay and impedes his promise to close Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYes, to their discredit, Republicans didn\u2019t pay for these reforms. But these measures represent steps in the right direction. They are improvements. People elect candidates to Congress to improve the country, not fall on their swords.\n\nAs he was leaving the speakership, Boehner sagely advised: \u201cHave the courage to do what you can do. It\u2019s easy to have the courage to do what you can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nI have my own saying: It\u2019s hard to dance with a knife in your back.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2016 CREATORS.COM", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": ", whose office posted on a blog about the many times House Republicans have promised an alternative without wrapping the package.\nR-Texas, argued it was the \u201cright thing\u201d for the GOP Congress to risk shutting down the government by passing a spending bill that defunded Planned Parenthood.\nTo the contrary, under Republican control, the Senate passed the first multiyear highway bill since 2005.\nThis was the first time the Senate passed a repeal bill \u2014 thanks to a budget reconciliation rule that allows leadership to bypass cloture rules that require 60 votes.\nRepublicans fulfilled a popular campaign pledge Wednesday when, by a 240-181 vote, the House passed a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act and defunding Planned Parenthood."}
