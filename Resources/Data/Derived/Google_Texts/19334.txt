Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said in an interview aired Sunday that Supreme Court Justice John Roberts was an "absolute disaster."

Trump, during an appearance on ABC's "This Week," said Roberts should've fought to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Trump made sure to make mention of rival Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) as well.

"Cruz fought like hell to get Justice Roberts in there," Trump said. "Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster, he turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare."

"Justice Roberts could've killed Obamacare and should've, based on everything â€” should've killed it twice. Ted Cruz is the one that was promoting him," Trump said.
