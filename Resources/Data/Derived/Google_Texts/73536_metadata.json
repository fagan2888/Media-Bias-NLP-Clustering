That information is housed in Atherotech\u2019s aptly titled \u201cVery Large Database of Lipids\u201d or VLDL for short. Johns Hopkins\u2019 world-renown cardiac research will use that information to try to apply it to better clinical practices for physicians on the front lines battling cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u201cThis unique collaboration initiative joins Atherotech Diagnostics Lab\u2019s valuable VLDL dataset with Johns Hopkins\u2019 tremendous human capital and expertise,\u201d Michael Mullen, Atherotech chief executive, said in a release. \u201cWith more than 8 million individual samples of multiple cardiovascular disease biomarkers, our VLDL database represents one of the largest diagnostic testing databases of its kind in the world, capable of advancing heart disease research and improving patient treatment and outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mullen said Atherotech\u2019s VLDL along with the multiple positions, disciplines and profiles from Johns Hopkins will go a long way in identifying the 50 percent of those at risk of heart disease who don\u2019t realize it through current basic testing techniques.\n\nA study in the August 20 Journal of the American College of Cardiology compared the accuracy of calculated LDL cholesterol measurement using the traditional basic lipid panel against the directly measured LDL cholesterol using Atherotech\u2019s VAP Lipid Panel. The test determined that nearly 60 percent of at-risk patients with basic lipid panel LDL below 70 mg/dL and triglycerides over 200 were misclassified. The study examined more than 1.3 million VLDL samples and is the largest of its kind to evaluate basic lipid panel estimation of LDLc relative to Atherotech\u2019s direct measurement.\n\nAtherotech\u2019s proprietary VAP Lipid Panel consistently assesses and measures risks of LDL, HDL and subclasses; triglyceride-rich risk in remnant lipoproteins; and hereditary risk markers \u2014 all of which are represented in the VLDL.\n\nAtherotech\u2019s current VLDL has 1.4 million data points representing unique individuals. Its next data harvest will give the VLDL more than 3 million data points.\n\nDr. Steven R. Jones of the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, said Johns Hopkins and Atherotech are both focused on not just diagnosing, but preventing heart disease.\n\n\"Atherotech\u2019s organization is committed to a comprehensive yet practical lipid profile, and our research group\u2019s emphasis is on high-impact, clinically relevant research,\u201d Jones said.\n\nMullen said more studies will be published in other journals that bolster Atherotech\u2019s work. He said the ability to identify at-risk patients with an inexpensive test will be a critical tool as the Affordable Care Act goes into effect.\n\nUp until now, the collaboration has \u201call been in the interest of science,\u201d Mullen said. But as the relationship matures, Mullen said there will likely be a foundation formed to seek National Institutes of Health funding to expand the research and heart disease prevention.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Michael Tomberlin", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Atherotech, biotechnology, Johns Hopkins, business", "title": "Birmingham's Atherotech joins forces with Johns Hopkins to fight heart disease", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Atherotech's research will be used by Johns Hopkins' medical professionals to identify at-risk patients currently misclassified with existing lipid tests.", "title": "Birmingham's Atherotech joins forces with Johns Hopkins to fight heart disease", "url": "http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2013/09/birminghams_atherotech_joins_f.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/business_impact/photo/13352433-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Atherotech's research will be used by Johns Hopkins' medical professionals to identify at-risk patients currently misclassified with existing lipid tests.", "title": "Birmingham's Atherotech joins forces with Johns Hopkins to fight heart disease", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/business_impact/photo/13352433-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MAJ_Chicken", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, September 04, 2013,  5:18 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, September 04, 2013,  5:18 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Atherotech's research will be used by Johns Hopkins' medical professionals to identify at-risk patients currently misclassified with existing lipid tests."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3df\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Steven R.
