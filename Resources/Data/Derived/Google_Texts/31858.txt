TONOPAH, NV - Nye Regional Medical Center in Tonopah closed Friday, saying it's been struggling financially for years and can't afford to keep operating with expenses outweighing revenues.

The closest medical centers are more than an hour away.

According to a letter from hospital management to the community, all acute patient services, including the emergency department, laboratory, respiratory and radiology areas, plus inpatient and outpatient care, have closed. Even the outpatient clinic is closing.

Town and county officials have been working with the facility since it went into bankruptcy in 2013. They enacted a hospital taxing district and solicited local business to help cover the costs, but it was not enough to keep it in business.

As as of Sunday, August 23, 2015, the center would not have had a doctor on staff until the following Wednesday, and the hospital board has been in touch with Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) to see if anything can be done keep it open.

A local private practicioner is the only medical provider in the area now that the hospital has closed.

Tonopah is southeast of Reno along Highway 95, about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.
