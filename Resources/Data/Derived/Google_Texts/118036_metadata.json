He volunteers at free medical clinics in Syracuse.\n\nPotash says this kind of universal health care also means there wouldn\u2019t be premiums, co-pays or deductibles, things he sees sometimes getting in the way of medical care -- even with the Affordable Care Act in place.\n\n\"It is very worrisome to see people who need health care who can\u2019t get it, can\u2019t afford it and end up in the emergency room, which is ten times more expensive,\u201d Potash says. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good way to have medical care.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time this universal health care bill has been on the floor of the state Legislature since 1992. Syracuse Green Party leader Ursula Rozum says the Senate still needs to approve the bill to bring it to the governor\u2019s desk, and that\u2019s a big hurdle. But she\u2019s optimistic.\n\n\"We\u2019re hoping that in the next couple of years that the Senate will see that this is something New Yorkers want, and the New York State Senate will come out in support of this,\u201d Rozum says.\n\nSupporters of universal health care see this vote as an indicator of growing political support for a comprehensive one-payer health care system in the state.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Central New York boosters of universal health care are celebrating this week, after the state Assembly passed the New York Health Act.
