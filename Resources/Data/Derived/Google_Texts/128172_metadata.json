He then clearly lays out solutions that the entire country, including young people, should be able to rally around.\n\nIn Plunder and Deceit, Levin is unrelenting in his barrage of facts, history, and logic as he eviscerates an out-of-control government. He also explains how the federal Leviathan is destroying the nation, with calamitous consequences for future generations. The book is embargoed until its August release and we anticipate it will be a breakaway bestseller. As with his other bestsellers, Levin\u2019s scholarship is impeccable and his intellect is as sharp as ever. And as always, his passion for freedom is evident throughout the book.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the summer of our discontent -- a summer marked by gay marriage, the battle flag, Obamacare, trade deals, immigration -- Mark Levin delivers a fabulous broadside against the Left and an out-of-control government.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In the summer of our discontent -- a summer marked by gay marriage, the battle flag, Obamacare, trade deals, immigration -- Mark Levin delivers a fabulous broadside against the Left and an out-of-control government.", "title": "Mark Levin's New Blockbuster 'Plunder and Deceit' Sets the Stage for 2016 Debates", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mark-Levin-e1422502000960.png", "height": 479}, "updated_time": "2015-07-05T16:01:06-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/05/mark-levins-new-blockbuster-plunder-and-deceit-sets-the-stage-for-the-2016-debates/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the summer of our discontent -- a summer marked by gay marriage, the battle flag, Obamacare, trade deals, immigration -- Mark Levin delivers a fabulous broadside against the Left and an out-of-control government.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Mark-Levin-e1422502000960.png", "title": "Mark Levin's New Blockbuster 'Plunder and Deceit' Sets the Stage for 2016 Debates", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mark Levin,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,levin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-07-05T15:32:00-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T16:01:06-07:00", "tag": "Mark Levin", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In Plunder and Deceit, Levin is unrelenting in his barrage of facts, history, and logic as he eviscerates an out-of-control government.\nAs with his other bestsellers, Levin\u2019s scholarship is impeccable and his intellect is as sharp as ever.\nHe then clearly lays out solutions that the entire country, including young people, should be able to rally around.\nHe also explains how the federal Leviathan is destroying the nation, with calamitous consequences for future generations.\nThe book is embargoed until its August release and we anticipate it will be a breakaway bestseller."}
