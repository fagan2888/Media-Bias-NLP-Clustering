The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, presents a unique opportunity for health care entrepreneurs. It aims to change the payment structure for health care and is incentivizing doctors to keep people healthy \u2014 not just bill for expensive tests and procedures.\n\nOne of these young companies is Mountain View, Calif. based HealthLoop, which gained the first $10 million investment today from Canvas, a new health and IT-focused venture firm, and Subtraction Capital. HealthLoop is focused on one particular problem: helping doctors connect with patients between visits.\n\nThe company was founded by a practicing physician, Dr. Jordan Shlain, who was looking to solve a personal problem. He calls it \u201cinnovation by irritation,\u201d as Dr. Shlain wasn\u2019t looking to start a new venture. He realized that most physicians could benefit from more efficient tools to track patients between visits than an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nRebecca Lynn, a digital health-focused investor at Canvas, is confident that HealthLoop will rise above the rest, as it is designed by a physician to make life easier for other practitioners. Much of the new health IT is developed by entrepreneurs with scant understanding of doctors\u2019 needs.\n\nHealthLoop helps physicians keep track of their patients with an analytics toolset that pinpoints the people most at risk in any practice. In addition, the company offers peer-reviewed follow-up plans, which automate some of the most routine aspects of care. These plans are a simple but ingenious idea, as they free up time for doctors to focus on the most complex cases.\n\n\u201cDoctors are dealing with a lot right now, and little of it has to do with their core business, which is helping patients,\u201d said Lynn. Most doctors adopted electronic health records in the wake of the HITECH Act of 2009, which incentivizes care providers to shift away from paper-based records. But this transition is an ongoing process, and doctors are having a hard time determining what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cDoctors are struggling to figure out what this all means to their future and what is going to happen to them in the next five to 10 years,\u201d she added.\n\nAnother unique aspect to HealthLoop is that the technology can be used by large physician practices, hospitals, and employers. According to Lynn, a distinction from earlier versions of this technology is that patients aren\u2019t treated autonomously or on a case-by-case basis. Instead, she says HealthLoop promotes \u201cconnectivity and continuity\u201d between all parties in the health care system.\n\nHealthLoop founder Dr. Shlain also serves as the commissioner of San Francisco\u2019s human health services board and on the board of the Hope Street Group, a bipartisan policy think tank.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2013-12-09T10:10:07+00:00", "author": "christina-farr", "modDate": "2013-12-09T10:10:07+00:00", "keywords": "aca,affordable-care-act,doctors,electronic-health-records,health-it,medical,selling-to-doctors", "type": "news", "id": 869925}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "A new startup called HealthLoop offers analytics and peer-reviewed plans for doctors to stay connected with their patients.", "title": "Closing the loop: New startup HealthLoop brings in $10M to help doctors track\u00a0patients", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/09/closing-the-loop-new-startup-healthloop-brings-in-10m-to-help-doctors-track-patients/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/image.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A new startup called HealthLoop offers analytics and peer-reviewed plans for doctors to stay connected with their\u00a0patients.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23e2\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, presents a unique opportunity for health care entrepreneurs.\nHe calls it \u201cinnovation by irritation,\u201d as Dr. Shlain wasn\u2019t looking to start a new venture.\nThe company was founded by a practicing physician, Dr. Jordan Shlain, who was looking to solve a personal problem.\nInstead, she says HealthLoop promotes \u201cconnectivity and continuity\u201d between all parties in the health care system.\nIt aims to change the payment structure for health care and is incentivizing doctors to keep people healthy \u2014 not just bill for expensive tests and procedures."}
