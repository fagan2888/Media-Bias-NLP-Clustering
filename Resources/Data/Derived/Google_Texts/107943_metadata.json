Published in JAMA, the most recent study analyzed a cross section of MA enrollees in 2011 to determine if disparities exist dependent on Puerto Rican residence.\n\nResearchers compared 17 performance measures and found Hispanic MA enrollees received significantly worse care across age, sex and income level than their white and Hispanic counterparts in the U.S. for 15 of those measures. The largest disparities were found in appropriate drug use for coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nThe study notes that about one-quarter of the MA program's Hispanic enrollees live in Puerto Rico, and more Hispanic enrollees live in Puerto Rico than in any other state. Thus, as the MA program makes efforts to understand and address ethnic disparities in care, Puerto Rico must be part of the solution, according to the study authors. Puerto Rico's MA disparity needs attention in particular because the island has a poverty rate three times higher than the U.S. On top of that, its MA payment rates are 30 percent lower than Alabama's \u2014 the state with the lowest payment rate \u2014 and further cuts to the plans may be implemented this year as the Affordable Care Act aligns MA and traditional Medicare payments, according to the study authors.\n\nMore articles on payer issues:\n\nUnitedHealth to leave Iowa ACA marketplace\n\nAs insurers lose on the exchanges, ACA premiums expected to rise\n\nHCA, BCBS of Texas renew contract\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
