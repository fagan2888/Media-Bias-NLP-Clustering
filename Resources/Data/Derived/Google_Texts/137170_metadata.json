Today will be a bit warmer \u2013 but it will take another day to get above the freezing mark.\n\nForecasters and officials have warned everybody to stay warm, stay inside and take precautions as a polar vortex \u2013 a system which normally keeps the harshest cold air in Siberia \u2013 has enveloped the continental United States.\n\nSo far, the state has weathered the cold blast. A scattered handful of accidents are reported by the state Department of Transportation this morning.\n\nThe three metro airports, including Newark Liberty International, are all \u201cplaying catch-up\u201d today, said Ron Marsico, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nNJ Transit is running almost entirely back on schedule, said John Durso, Jr., an agency spokesman. Up to 30-minute delays are in effect on Atlantic City-line trains, because of switching problems \u2013 and to the north, overnight trains were unable to stop at the Newark Airport stop because a water main break had frozen over the platform, D\u2019Urso said. Travelers were diverted to Newark Penn Station, where they hopped a bus for the airport, he said.\n\nPower outages have been few. PSE&G, the state's largest utility, is reporting scattered outages throughout its system as of 8 a.m., with the biggest concentration in Burlington County, which has more than 100, according to the company\u2019s online listing of outages. JCP&L was reporting between 500 and 1,500 outages in Toms River this morning, and the cause was still being investigated, the company said.\n\nGov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency during the winter storm - and that remains in place this morning.\n\nHigh temperatures are expected to rise into the 20s today, with further warming above freezing predicted for Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. However, another shock of cold is expected to drive temperatures down into the single-digits again Monday night.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','nj-snow','nj-transit','nj-weather','port-authority-ny-nj','transportation'", "title": "N.J. gets back up to speed after snow storm, despite Arctic blast", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"N.J. gets back up to speed after snow storm, despite Arctic blast\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/nj_chills_out_gets_back_up_to_speed_after_snow_storm_despite_arctic_blast.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/01/14034638-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11930077\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-04T14:30:05Z\", \"author\": \"Seth Augenstein | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"nj-snow\",\"nj-transit\",\"nj-weather\",\"port-authority-ny-nj\",\"transportation\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/01/14034638-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@SethAugenstein", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Transportation is getting back up to speed, after snow, and despite bone-chilling cold"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, January 04, 2014, 10:07 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/01/nj-cold-aristidejpg-49264f9bd2f68125.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"saugenstein\", \"author_nickname\": \"Seth Augenstein | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"8847793\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Transportation is getting back up to speed, after snow, and despite bone-chilling cold", "title": "N.J. gets back up to speed after snow storm, despite Arctic blast", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/nj_chills_out_gets_back_up_to_speed_after_snow_storm_despite_arctic_blast.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, January 04, 2014,  9:12 AM", "article_author": "Seth Augenstein | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Transportation is getting back up to speed, after snow, and despite bone-chilling cold"}, "article_summary": "Today will be a bit warmer \u2013 but it will take another day to get above the freezing mark.\nChris Christie declared a state of emergency during the winter storm - and that remains in place this morning.\nHowever, another shock of cold is expected to drive temperatures down into the single-digits again Monday night.\nArctic air swept across New Jersey overnight, putting the state into a deep freeze.\nSo far, the state has weathered the cold blast."}
