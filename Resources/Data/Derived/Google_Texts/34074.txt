The father of Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger has penned an open letter calling for an end to mass shootings.

Peter Rodger's letter , which was written for ABC News and published today, calls for mental health reforms and "a change in the culture" that allows such violence to perpetuate.

Too many lives are being lost. Law enforcement professionals, teachers and health workers on the front lines of the mental health crisis bear too much of a burden. And countless families struggle in silence with the consequences of mental illness each day...

We have to try and stop this... None of us understood what was in Elliot’s head –- he hid it from not only his family, but also from mental health professionals and law enforcement.
