Organizations and agencies are working together to address the same goals and to care for the same patients.\n\nShould be a piece of cake, right?\n\nOf course, with so many major, complex changes happening so quickly, there have been some challenges. Providers are looking for information, and there have been a lot of questions. So to help keep the lines of communication open, the Health Foundation for Western and Central New York has held large educational meetings where regional providers could learn about DSRIP, as well as smaller facilitated meetings with organizations to help them develop a collaborative approach and maximize the potential for impact.\n\nMost recently, on October 6, we hosted an event to have New York State Medicaid Director Jason Helgerson update the western New York region on the state of Medicaid redesign, DSRIP, and Medicaid payment reform, including value-based payments.\n\nHelgerson began his presentation by giving the audience of health and human service providers a brief history lesson on how the state\u2019s Medicaid program got to where it is today.\n\nNew York has come a long way since it created a Medicaid Redesign Team in 2010. The state has invested in care coordination for high-risk and high-cost patients through the Medicaid Health Homes program. New York has been able to tackle some social determinants of health, such as housing and transportation. Medicaid Redesign initiatives have reduced costs, bringing Medicaid spending per beneficiary back to 2003 levels. In fact, New York State is no longer first in the nation in Medicaid spending\u2014that title is now held by California. But we still spend $59 billion each year to cover approximately 6 million people, according to the New York State Department of Health. That\u2019s one-third of the entire state budget.\n\nDespite any improvements, we still have a delivery system that does not meet the needs of the present, much less the needs of the future. We need to create a system that is much more sustainable.\n\nSo, part of the Medicaid Redesign Team\u2019s plan was to obtain a waiver from the federal government that would allow New York to reinvest savings generated by the Medicaid Redesign Team back into the state\u2019s Medicaid health care delivery system.\n\nIn 2014 the state got that waiver. New York could reinvest $8 billion of the $17.1 billion in federal savings generated by Medicaid reforms. Nearly all of that money\u2014that is, $7 billion\u2014is designated for DSRIP.\n\nOver five years, twenty-five performing provider systems will receive funding for targeted health projects to drive change. A performing provider system is made up of regionally collaborating providers that will implement DSRIP projects over the five-year period and beyond. Each of these systems must include enough providers to form an entire continuum of care. This includes hospitals, primary care providers, health homes, clinics, behavioral health providers, home care agencies, and community-based organizations.\n\nThe goal? Reduce avoidable hospital readmissions by 25 percent.\n\nBut transforming the delivery system can only happen if the payment system is transformed as well.\n\nMany of the state\u2019s problems are rooted in how it pays for services. Under the fee-for-service model, avoidable hospital readmissions are financially rewarded more than successfully transitioning a patient to integrated home care is.\n\nThe new goal is to pay for value, not volume. That means moving to value-based payments. If it\u2019s done well, providers\u2019 profit margins go up when the value of care delivered increases. But health outcomes are going to matter.\n\nBy the fifth year of DSRIP, all Medicaid managed care organizations in New York must transition to value-based payment systems for at least 80 to 90 percent of their provider payments. If these goals aren\u2019t met, federal funding to New York for DSRIP will be significantly reduced.\n\nMoving to value-based payments is not a small change\u2014it requires organizations to fundamentally change their business model.\n\nThere isn\u2019t just one path toward value-based payments, Helgerson said, so he walked the audience through three different examples of value-based contracting options for providers.\n\nTo achieve meaningful results through value-based payments, though, providers will have to take on some risk. So, in addition to choosing which integrated services to focus on, managed care organizations and performing provider systems can choose from three different levels of value-based payments, each with different levels of potential risk and reward.\n\nBut it\u2019s up to providers to enter into these contracts with managed care organizations. So it\u2019s not about what the state does, it\u2019s about what the performing provider systems decide to do with this opportunity, Helgerson said. More and more providers are already moving toward value-based care, so he encouraged the audience to not wait too long to figure out how to proceed.\n\nAs performing provider systems begin work on their projects to reduce avoidable hospitalizations and move toward value-based payments, we at the foundation will continue to convene health and human service providers in western and central New York to share information and support collaboration.\n\nIt takes the combined efforts of many stakeholders, including providers, policy makers, nonprofit organizations, and the community at large to create lasting results that improve health and health care, and philanthropy can play an important role in achieving these improvements.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note:\n\nRelated resources from Health Affairs journal:\n\n\u201cAn Examination Of Medicaid Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Initiatives Under Way In Six States,\u201d by Michael K.
