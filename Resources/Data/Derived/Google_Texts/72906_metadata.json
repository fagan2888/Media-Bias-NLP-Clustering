But thanks to the surgeons at Stony Brook Children\u2019s Hospital , Rosero\u2019s malformation has been fixed, leaving him feeling \u201chandsome.\u201d\n\nPlastic surgeon Dr. Alex Dagum and neurosurgeon Dr. Henry Woo teamed up to perform a series of 10 surgeries on Rosero over an eight month period. The boy traveled from Ecuador to Long Island in January as part of a program called Blanca\u2019s House that is dedicated to providing modern health care to those would otherwise have no access to it. Rosero stayed in Miller Place, Long Island with a host family as he underwent the surgeries.\n\nThe 10-year-old had a rare venous malformation that impacted his lip, face, and mouth. Venous malformations are caused by misshapen veins that enlarge as children get older. The misshapen veins don\u2019t go away on their own and they may even recur after treatment. Doctors feared that Rosero\u2019s malformation \u2014 if it continued to grow \u2014 would cause blindness or even death.\n\n\"The malformation wouldn't allow his teeth to form properly, so he was getting a lot of cavities,\" said Dr. Woo, co-director of the Cerebrovascular Center at Stony Brook University Hospital. \"His tongue and lip were so large that he was constantly drooling. He needed something to hold his lip up just to live.\"\n\n\"His self-confidence and ability to interact with people has changed dramatically for the better,\" Woo continued. \"He's only 10 years old and to be away from your family for such a period of time and go through so many things ... it's incredible.\"\n\nAs her prepared for his return to Ecuador, the staff at Stony Brook Children\u2019s Hospital surprised Rosero by arranging for him to meet the Stony Brook Seawolves, a local soccer team. Rosero is a soccer fan and the Seawolves coach, Ryan Anatol, said he couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to meet such a remarkable kid.\n\n\"When we heard about Kevin's story, we were truly, truly amazed by the strength and the courage that he's shown \u2014 not just over the last eight months, but throughout the course of his life,\" coach Anatol said.\n\nRosero learned English over the eight months he\u2019s been in the States. He told reporters that he\u2019s sad to leave his host family, but is excited to see his family and friends in Ecuador to show off his new look.\n\n\"I want to go see my family and my little brother, because when I was here he was born,\" he said. \"I feel really good, I feel happy. I feel handsome!\"\n\nStony Brook University Hospital Stony Brook University Hospital Stony Brook University Hospital Stony Brook University Hospital", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kevin rosero, facial malformation, stony brook", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ten-year-old Kevin Rosero will return to Ecuador with confidence after 10 surgeries over eight months fixed his rare face malformation.", "title": "Boy From Ecuador Gets Rare Face Deformity Fixed [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kevin-rosero-boy-ecuador-has-rare-face-deformity-fixed-stony-brook-childrens-hospital-photos-256771", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/14/kevin-rosero.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ten-year-old Kevin Rosero will return to Ecuador with confidence after 10 surgeries over eight months fixed his rare face malformation.", "title": "Boy From Ecuador Gets Rare Face Deformity Fixed [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kevin-rosero-boy-ecuador-has-rare-face-deformity-fixed-stony-brook-childrens-hospital-photos-256771", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/14/kevin-rosero.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/14/kevin-rosero.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-09-14T14:25:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-14T14:25:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ten-year-old Kevin Rosero will return to Ecuador with confidence after 10 surgeries over eight months fixed his rare face malformation."}, "article_summary": "Stony Brook University Hospital Stony Brook University Hospital Stony Brook University Hospital Stony Brook University Hospital\nAs her prepared for his return to Ecuador, the staff at Stony Brook Children\u2019s Hospital surprised Rosero by arranging for him to meet the Stony Brook Seawolves, a local soccer team.\nWoo, co-director of the Cerebrovascular Center at Stony Brook University Hospital.\nKevin Rosero of Riobamba, Ecaudor was born with a rare malformation on his face that made it difficult for him to eat and speak.\nRosero stayed in Miller Place, Long Island with a host family as he underwent the surgeries."}
