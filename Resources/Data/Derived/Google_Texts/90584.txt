A young woman says she was attacked in an elevator at the Clevelander Hotel on South Beach.

The woman, who was staying at the hotel, told police she woke up naked on the hotel's rooftop, where 30-year-old Eberto Medrano-Ramirez allegedly found her. Police say he took her to an elevator, where the victim claims she was attacked while incapacitated.

Police arrested Ramirez and charged him with sexual battery. Ramirez is an employee of a professional cleaning service contracted by the hotel.

"The Clevelander Hotel is aware of an alleged assault in the early morning hours. As always, we are fully cooperating with the Miami Beach Police Department to fully investigate the situation," the hotel said in a statement. "We do know at this time that no Clevelander associates were involved in the allegation. We will continue to work with local authorities as investigation is ongoing."

Ramirez was being held on $10,000 bond. It is unclear if he has an attorney.

According to an arrest report, the victim was on vacation from Philadelphia and had returned to her hotel room intoxicated around 3:30 a.m.

The woman told police she couldn't recall when she left her hotel room but recalled being on the rooftop of the hotel, where she was approached by Medrano-Ramirez, the report said.

Medrano-Ramirez was later found in the lobby of the hotel. He told police he was cleaning on the roof when the woman exited the elevator completely naked and appeared to be lost, the report said.

He admitted he sexually battered the woman, who appeared extremely intoxicated and incoherent, the report said.

"I apologize, I know that I f---ed up, I had a naked girl next to me and I did what any man would have done," Medrano-Ramirez said in Spanish, according to the report.

The attack is still under investigation.
