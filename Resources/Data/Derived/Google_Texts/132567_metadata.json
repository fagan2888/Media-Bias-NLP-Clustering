Doing the job most U.S. politicians won\u2019t do, Sheriff Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, was the first to bring a challenge when Obama ordered his Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Nov. 20, 2014, to rewrite and circumvent the laws passed by Congress. Now Arpaio, with Freedom Watch as his counsel, is the first to go to the Supreme Court!\n\nIn essence, we are asking the high court to resolve conflicting approaches among the nation\u2019s appellate court circuits. We are reminding the justices that America\u2019s system of law and order and our nation\u2019s experiment in self-government (unique in human history) cannot long survive if the judiciary refuses to play its part by upholding the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution can only have meaning if we are disciplined to live by it, even when politicians are tempted to cheat. If neither the courts nor elected politicians will protect and defend \u2013 and follow \u2013 the Constitution, they leave every door closed for a peaceable resolution of our citizens\u2019 refusal to stand by and watch our country slowly die.\n\nEven as Freedom Watch was drafting Sheriff Arpaio\u2019s Supreme Court appeal came more news of Obama\u2019s unbridled arrogance and tyranny. A leaked memorandum from DHS outlined plans for new executive-action usurpations of the role of Congress \u2013 which bypasses even the federal court in Texas that ordered Obama and his minions at DHS to cease and desist from implementing his illegal executive amnesty. Thus, some of the plans mapped out at a DHS retreat are designed to barrel full-speed ahead on granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens while technically side-stepping the injunction that is still in place from Judge Hanen in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, as reported in The Hill. A coalition of 26 states led by Texas had sued the Obama administration last December. In the jurisdiction of U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, the Honorable Andrew Hanen issued a preliminary injunction blocking implementation of Obama\u2019s amnesty. The 5th Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction (refused to order a stay) on May 26, 2015.\n\nSo in the 5th Circuit, the states were found to have standing to bring a lawsuit from the costs that amnesty imposes on them. In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit), Sheriff Arpaio on almost identical facts \u2013 in fact, much stronger \u2013was found not to have standing, and that is why we are going to the Supremes to break this impasse.\n\nHow can that be? Different judicial circuits and courts are following widely different and dramatically inconsistent rules and standards to govern standing. That is one reason the Supreme Court must step in and end the judicial chaos.\n\nIn the D.C. Circuit, Judge Janice Rogers Brown on the appeals panel explained in her concurring opinion what her problem is:\n\nSome may find today\u2019s outcome perplexing. Certainly Sheriff Arpaio cannot be blamed for believing he had standing. The relevant judicial guide-posts do not exactly \u201cdefine\u201d standing \u201cwith complete consistency.\u201d Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 475 (1982). And some cases suggest standing can be satisfied based on fairly ephemeral injuries and attenuated theories of causation.\n\nBrown stated: \u201cI write separately to \u2026 note the consequences of our modern obsession with a myopic and constrained notion of standing.\u201d And: \u201cToday we hold that the elected Sheriff of the nation\u2019s fourth-largest county, located mere miles from our border with Mexico, cannot challenge the federal government\u2019s deliberate (unconstitutional) non-enforcement of the immigration laws.\u201d\n\nFor several decades, the federal courts have been building higher walls to avoid doing their jobs and refusing to uphold the Constitution against the lust for power of politicians. As a result, the judicial invention of \u201cstanding\u201d has continually grown like a cancer. Lawsuits against the government have become increasingly impossible \u2013 unless the plaintiff is pursuing a liberal, big-government agenda.\n\nThere is no mention of standing in the Constitution or in laws governing court procedures. Based on nothing, standing rules are completely inconsistent from one circuit to the next and one case to the next. In Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 549 U.S. 497, 516\u201326 (2007), the Supreme Court found that plaintiffs had standing from the mere possibility that in 50-100 years coastline will be lost to a rising ocean. The inconsistency deeply troubled Judge Brown in her dispute in our case with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s thinking.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit essentially applied a standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d used in criminal cases: \u201cWe have required \u2018substantial evidence of a causal relationship between the government policy and the third-party conduct, leaving little doubt as to causation and the likelihood of redress,'\u201d wrote the D.C. Circuit in inappropriately dismissing Sheriff Arpaio\u2019s case.\n\nBy contrast, the 5th Circuit presented the correct rule of law: \u201cThe Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff has standing if the injury alleged is both \u2018fairly traceable to the Government conduct \u2026 challenge[d] as unlawful. \u2026\u201d \u201cFairly traceable\u201d is a very different rule of law from \u201csubstantial evidence \u2026 leaving little doubt as to causation.\u201d The analysis is in sharp conflict among the circuits.\n\nSince last November, we heard tough talk from the Republican-led Congress seeking votes that they would block Obama\u2019s unconstitutional amnesty. Yet Republican leaders in Congress have funded Obama\u2019s amnesty. We still have not seen the lawsuit former Speaker John Boehner promised, and he and his dishonest legacy are now toast. The courts and especially the Supreme Court must now finally do their duty and protect We the People from the tyranny of Obama\u2019s executive branch, which thanks to the cowardly and do nothing Republican Congress who has rolled over to him, likely for fear that they will be branded racists if they challenge and block an African-American president in the years leading up to the presidential elections in 2016. Whether its illegal immigration, Obamacare, the Iran nuclear treaty, or halfhearted and useless congressional hearing allegedly to investigate the myriad of Obama-Hillary Clinton scandals like Benghazi, IRS-gate, or Fast and Furious, this has been the Republican establishment\u2019s modus operandi, which ironically has taken a seat at the back of the proverbial government bus ever since Obama was elected president. It\u2019s why conservative, libertarians, people of faith and anyone who believes in representative government has had it with them and now are prepared, if necessary, to take matters into our own legal hands!\n\nWe at Freedom Watch are not cowardly and neither are the readers of this column. Let us hope our Supreme Court finally does its job and steps in to protect the citizenry before revolution eventually breaks out!\n\nHelp Larry Klayman with his class-action suit against Obama\u2019s use of the NSA to violate Americans\u2019 rights\n\nMedia wishing to interview Larry Klayman, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/11/obamas-illegal-amnesty-heads-to-supreme-court/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Freedom Watch\u2019s legal team are now filing his petition with the Supreme Court to challenge President Barack Obama\u2019s executive grant of amnesty for illegal aliens.
