TUPELO – United Blood Services is hoping that while people are giving thanks this holiday season, they will also come to the donor center at 4326 S. Eason Blvd. to give blood.

The first 50 donors who donate blood today will receive a $15 voucher to Palmer’s Supermarket to be used for the purchase of any food item.

Appointments can be scheduled at www.bloodhero.com or by calling (662) 842-8871. Walk-ins are also welcome.

On Friday United Blood Services will be open from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. for holiday shoppers to come in and donate blood. Donors will receive points in the United Blood Services’ Reward Store that can be redeemed for a $25 Amazon gift card.

All blood types are needed, but United Blood Services has an increased need for type O negative red cells and type AB plasma. Type O negative blood is the only type that can safely be given to patients of all blood types, and AB is the universal donor for plasma.

Donors can skip the interview portion of donating blood by visiting www.unitedbloodservices.org the day of their donation and click “Health History Questionnaire.” Print the “Fast Track Ticket” and bring it to the donation.

Blood donors must be at least 16 years old, weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health.
