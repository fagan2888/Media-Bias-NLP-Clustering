Senate passed its own form of Medicaid expansion, a new plan that would insure about 50,000 additional New Hampshire residents and allow them to choose their preferred health insurance on the state\u2019s health exchange.\n\nBut this expansion will still leave out one important thing for adults: dental insurance.\n\nMedicaid, a federal insurance program, covers children, and adults who are disabled, pregnant or have Medicaid-dependent children.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Medicaid covers dental care for children up to age 21, as well as disabled adults and pregnant women. It pays for preventive care for children, but for adults, it only pays for emergency care, such as extractions.\n\nIf approved by the House and signed into law \u2014 which is expected to happen \u2014 New Hampshire\u2019s Health Protection Plan will give more residents access to medical care and mental health services. But even though Medicaid expansion means more people are getting covered, the scope of dental services they receive won\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cThere is no dental benefit covered by expansion,\u201d said Thomas Bunnell, policy consultant for New Hampshire Voices for Health, a nonprofit health care advocacy group. \u201cOur state would have to do something to change the Medicaid benefit for dental to be covered.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something the N.H. Department of Health and Human Services has considered for a few years, according to Jeffrey Meyers, director of intergovernmental affairs at the department.\n\nBut each time the department proposed expanding dental coverage for the uninsured as part of its biennial budget, it\u2019s been turned down by the state Legislature to save money, Meyers said.\n\nPeople can learn more about expanding benefits at upcoming public hearings hosted by the state agency.\n\nMeyers said the department has tried to add dental care with the goal of taking a \u201cwhole-person approach\u201d to health care.\n\nIn addition to medical care, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to look at oral health,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nDentists tout good dental care as an integral part of overall health: Preventive care like check-ups can help prevent cavities and tooth abscesses, which, left untreated, can sometimes turn into serious systemic infections.\n\nGetting coverage\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion will cover adults who make less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 per year. It\u2019s estimated about 40,000 to 50,000 adults will receive health insurance under the expansion, which will kick in July 1.\n\nAlthough Medicaid expansion doesn\u2019t include a dental health benefit, it opens the door to getting one, according to Meyers and Bunnell.\n\nThere are opportunities for states to leverage federal Medicaid dollars to implement optional programs such as dental benefits, Bunnell said.\n\nHere\u2019s how it would work: By signing onto Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act, New Hampshire would be showing a commitment to having more people insured, more people getting preventative care, and theoretically, less people developing serious health problems because of it.\n\nAnd fewer people getting sick would mean less money spent by the state and federal governments on emergency and intensive care.\n\nMeyers said if the state shows it\u2019s reforming programs and saving money, it can ask for a waiver from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThis waiver grants New Hampshire the ability to put the money it\u2019s saved back into developing other programs that improve the quality of health care available to low-income patients, such as dental insurance.\n\nTo start getting on-track for dental benefits and other programs, the state Department of Health and Human Services must submit a waiver application by June 1, according to Meyers.\n\nBut even if the federal money is granted to New Hampshire, the final decision with what to do with the money rests with the state Legislature.\n\nIf the Legislature were to agree on spending money for Medicaid dental benefits, N.H. Medicaid Dental Director Margaret Snow said the Department of Health and Human Services would develop a specific plan tailored to the Legislature\u2019s specifications, and amend the state Medicaid plan as the legislation directed. Finally, they would submit the request for a waiver to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency for those programs.\n\nSnow said these steps could take many months.\n\n\u201cThere have been discussions for decades about the need for an adult dental benefit under N.H. Medicaid, yet there had not yet been success in ... authorizing legislation or even pilot programs under waivers,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Meyers said the department is looking closely at applying for waivers if the N.H. House and Gov. Maggie Hassan sign off on Medicaid expansion.\n\nMeyers said his department will be announcing public hearings about waivers and expanding benefits in the coming weeks.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "Last week, the N.H.
