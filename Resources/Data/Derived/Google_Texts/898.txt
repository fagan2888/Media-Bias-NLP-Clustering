Spotlight on … Filip Forsberg, F, Predators

When: The Avalanche’s next two games are against Forsberg and the Predators, beginning Tuesday in Nashville, Tenn.

What’s up: Forsberg, 20, will be the only rookie playing Sunday in the NHL All-Star Game in Columbus, Ohio. He leads the Predators, and all NHL rookies, with 40 points. He’s also first among rookies with a plus-24 rating, which is third-best in the league.

Background: From Ostervala, Sweden, Forsberg was selected No. 11 by the Washington Capitals in the 2012 draft, with the pick the Caps acquired from the Avalanche in the Semyon Varlamov trade. In a 2013 trade-deadline move that general manager George McPhee felt would bolster Washington’s playoff run, the Caps sent Forsberg to Nashville for Martin Erat and minor-leaguer Michael Latta. In hindsight, the trade might have cost McPhee his job, and the Predators ridded themselves of a 31-year-old veteran making $4.5 million for one of the world’s top young prospects.

Chambers’ take: Forsberg is not related to Peter Forsberg, the Hall of Famer and former Avalanche star, but they are similar in that both were traded by the NHL team that drafted them, and that team will never hear the end of it. The Flyers traded Peter to the Quebec Nordiques in the Eric Lindros deal. Filip was traded for a guy who is 33 and playing out what likely will be the final year of his last NHL contract.
