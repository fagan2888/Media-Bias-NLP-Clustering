- makes future bank bailouts more likely by pushing back on the Dodd-Frank restrictions on gambling, er, sorry, derivatives. (This rider was written, it turns out, by Citigroup, if you can believe that — but of course you can.)

- allows for cutting existing pensions paid to already retired people;

- among other anti-environment measures, cuts the Environmental Protection Agency budget by $60 million and halts funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine whether certain birds should be placed on the Endangered Species List — birds that happen to live where energy companies want to drill;

- cuts funding to an already beleaguered I.R.S., making audits of tax avoiders less likely;

- and, yes, weakens mandating healthier school food, lowers nutrition standards for the Women, Infants and Children program and directs experts to ignore environmental factors in determining the new dietary guidelines.

This brings us to the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for carrying out nutrition labeling in restaurant chains. (This is part of the Affordable Care Act.) When federal agencies propose new regulations, they’re required to do an evaluation to make sure the costs do not outweigh the benefits. Sounds logical enough. But this is the government we’re talking about, and recently the F.D.A.'s interpretation of this order has taken a turn for the absurd. This summer, the F.D.A. discounted by 70 percent the benefits of increased tobacco legislation. Why? That was the value of the “pleasure” lost by smokers, according to the agency, pleasure these addicts would miss by giving up a nasty habit.

Mass- and hyper-produced food, of course, is ostensibly not as dangerous and arguably more pleasant in its consumption than cigarettes. So the agency was required to discount the “pleasure” lost by eaters who would be discouraged from buying fast food because they determined that its massive calorie load and pathetic nutrition profiles were perhaps not desirable. In an “alternative” analysis, the cost of that pleasure was put at $5 billion over 20 years, which is about the same as the low end of the estimated value of the health benefit we’ll derive by eating less junk.

When asked, an agency representative pointed out that this analysis was not included in the “final benefits estimation.”

To which I say, “So what? The damage is done.” Because you can bet that the labeling regulations will be taken to court, and that every piece of ammunition will be deployed in the struggle to keep Americans in the dark about the quality of food we are being fed.

There are, of course, the obvious and almost inane questions like, “How could the F.D.A. possibly know that eaters will lose ‘pleasure’ by eating healthy food as opposed to unhealthy?” “Who is the F.D.A.'s pleasure analyst?” “How can a voluntary choice by a better-informed person to eat better food and improve his or her life possibly be a ‘cost’ ”? And finally, “How can you possibly fix a monetary value on this?” (By the way, this whole scheme, and that’s what it is, was cooked up by a lone graduate student, who determined that “healthier foods are worse off on other dimensions such as taste, price, and convenience.” Clearly, this is a person who’s never prepared broccoli raab with oil, garlic and chiles.)

But there’s a bigger question: How can intelligent, thoughtful, science-based legislation survive attacks by well-funded lobbyists — many of whom have worked in the very agencies they besiege — who now seem to be able to include sneaky “fixes” that might embarrass even a Republican-led Congress (it’s hard to publicly argue against listing new endangered species) into a spending bill that must be passed and is essentially veto-proof?

The answer: It cannot. Not without active and ongoing demonstration of passion by people who care. If you’re reading this, and any of it resonates, that’s you.

Remember, in the 1960s, few in Congress were civil rights advocates, and Lyndon Johnson was hardly anti-segregation, yet citizen action brought big changes. Barack Obama did not come into office as a supporter of gay rights, yet “don’t ask, don’t tell” fell under his watch, and gay marriage is now legal in a majority of states. There are a dozen other examples of people claiming their rights through struggle, the latest being that two years ago almost no one was talking about a livable minimum wage, and now $15 an hour is making its way into reality.

The 2014 election was a wake-up call; when the reactionaries fully take over Congress, not only school lunch standards but every standing bit of progressive legislation, from the new Affordable Care Act to the 42-year-old Clean Water Act, will be ruthlessly attacked. To defend these programs, we must recognize that politicians will not do anything smart unless they are pushed, and it’s up to us to push them.
