He\u2019d said, the word had it, to each of them that he wished them well and he was going to stay out.\n\nBut something seems to have changed, as the rumor mill is now spitting out a tale of Boustany\u2019s impending endorsement of Scott Angelle. It\u2019s still a rumor as yet, because there\u2019s no confirmation so far the endorsement has taken place.\n\nBut one of Angelle\u2019s opponents in the 3rd District, Gus Rantz, got wind of an endorsement and his camp popped off about it in no uncertain terms. Here\u2019s a press release\u2026\n\nThis morning conservative candidate for Congress, Gus Rantz was informed by Congressman Charles Boustany that he was breaking his pledge to stay neutral in the race to replace him. Boustany said he would be endorsing career politician and former Democrat Scott Angelle. Angelle and Boustany had spent the better part of this year jockeying against each other for the US Senate before Angelle\u2019s surprise announcement to run for Boustany\u2019s now vacant Congressional Seat. OFFICIAL STATEMENT BY GUS RANTZ \u201cThese backroom, secret deals are exactly what\u2019s wrong with Washington. Today\u2019s endorsement stinks to high heaven of political maneuvering and trying to control who gets elected. Well, the voters are FED UP! They\u2019re sick of career politicians like Scott Angelle who blindly follow the DC Republican establishment that drove up our debt, accomplished nothing as Obamacare destroyed our health care system, and sold out our conservative beliefs. If you liked it when your Congressman backed John Boehner as he drove this country off a fiscal cliff, then you\u2019ll love Scott Angelle. If you liked it when your Congressman opposed real conservatives like Steve Scalise, then you\u2019ll love Scott Angelle. If you were happy when your Congressman voted against a balanced budget, supported the expansion of Obamacare, voted for funding of Planned Parenthood, and made it easier for terrorist to smuggle weapons, then you\u2019ll love Scott Angelle. But if you are fed up, then this is the wakeup call where we unite and take our country back!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re waiting for responses by the Boustany and Angelle camps and we\u2019ll update when they come in. Something tells us the 3rd District race, which so far has been a bit of a sleepy affair with the possibility of fireworks, is about to start sparkling.\n\nUPDATE: The endorsement is official \u2013 here\u2019s the quote from Boustany\u2026\n\nI am proud to support Scott Angelle for the Third Congressional District. I\u2019ve worked with Scott to support our farmers, our ports, and to restore our coastline. We fought together against the Obama Administration in the wake of the Gulf drilling moratorium and won. I\u2019m supporting Scott because he\u2019s the best candidate to stop Washington\u2019s war on oil, repeal Obamacare, and secure our border.\n\nPlus a snappy graphic from Angelle\u2019s Facebook\u2026\n\nIt turns out that Boustany had never made a public pledge that he would stay neutral in the race, which means he\u2019s got deniability as to the charge Rantz\u2019 camp is making that he\u2019d made that guarantee.\n\nSo it\u2019s Rantz\u2019 word against Boustany\u2019s on that, which is likely going to engender a back-and-forth between the camps.\n\nStrictly from a political standpoint, though this could well look a little petty to some (particularly those voters who like Boustany and were probably for Angelle anyway), Rantz comes out a winner here whether Boustany broke a pledge or not. He\u2019s in a position to make some news and set himself up as the loudest anti-Angelle candidate in the race. There was a poll out last week which had Angelle catching 56 percent of the vote largely on the strength of name recognition; nobody in the district really knows anything about Rantz, Greg Ellison, Grover Rees or Eric Knezek, so getting on the map is the top challenge for each of them. Rantz being the candidate throwing the first bombs at the \u201cestablishment\u201d gives him an advantage and a position the others don\u2019t qualify for as yet, and it might give him a platform to pick other fights and make other points to gain traction.\n\nOr he might come off like a jerk.
