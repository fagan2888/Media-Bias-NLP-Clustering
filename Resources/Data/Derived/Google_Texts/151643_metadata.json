The group will visit spring training from March 6-8, the hospital announced in a press release.\n\n\u201cI have done it for the past couple of years,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to get them out here for a little mini-vacation. We give them a chance to meet some of the players. It\u2019s a good little getaway.\n\n\u201cThey are going through some difficult things and spending a lot of time at the hospital. \u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nFor many of the young patients, it will be the first trip away from home without their parents. Doctors and nurses will also be on the trip, but mostly it\u2019s a much-needed getaway and a break from the hospital.\n\nDuring the regular season, Tulo will see some of the kids at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cSome of them will be at the games and they will say hi and I try to remember their faces,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember them talking about how much fun they had at the hotel and playing at the pool. Like I said, it\u2019s a chance for them to get away.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki admits he often puts on a serious game face, but he lets his guard down around the kids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I like interacting with kids,\u201d Tulo said. \u201cI think people who know me, know that I can be pretty serious in the clubhouse, but you bring a kid around and I\u2019m probably a different guy. I think I have the patience and I enjoy being around them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Children's Hospital,Troy Tulowitzki", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki is providing a trip to spring training for kids from Children's Hospital Colorado's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders.", "title": "Rockies' Tulowitzki hosting trip for kids from Children's Hospital", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/02/28/rockies-tulowitzki-hosting-spring-trip-kids-childrens-hospital/19424/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/Tulo_homer-495x348.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki is providing a trip to spring training for kids from Children's Hospital Colorado's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders.", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/02/28/rockies-tulowitzki-hosting-spring-trip-kids-childrens-hospital/19424/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/Tulo_homer-495x348.jpg", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Tulowitzki hosting spring trip for kids from Children\u2019s Hospital", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki is providing a trip to spring training for kids from Children's Hospital Colorado's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded54\"", "article_summary": "Tulo is underwriting an all-expense paid trip to spring training for more than 20 patients from Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado\u2019s Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders.\nThe group will visit spring training from March 6-8, the hospital announced in a press release.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I like interacting with kids,\u201d Tulo said.\nScottsdale, Ariz. \u2014 Watch Troy Tulowitzki on the baseball diamond during the carefree days of spring training and you realize that he\u2019s still a kid at heart.\nSo it makes sense that Tulo would reach out to ailing kids to lift their spirits and induce some smiles."}
