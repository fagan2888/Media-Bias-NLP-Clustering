He has also become quite a fan of the Apple Watch, and today he suggested that one could replace the other. Here\u2019s the clip:\n\nSpeaking to an audience in Tempe, Arizona, Bush said the US government \u201cshould repeal Obamacare if given the opportunity\u201d and give people more control over their own health care decisions. Then he pointed to his wrist, which was sporting a new Apple Watch, and said that it and similar devices could help that process along:\n\nOn this device, in five years, will be applications that will allow me to manage my health care in ways that five years ago were not even possible\u2026. We\u2019ll be able to guide our own health care decisions in a way that will make us healthy. And ultimately, we have to get to a health system away from a disease system.\n\nThe exact connection between the watch and the government\u2019s health care incentives wasn\u2019t really clear.\n\nBush isn\u2019t the only Republican politician wearing the Apple Watch these days.
