ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) - Local leaders meet in Florissant to announce their support of a proposed two cent gasoline tax increase in Missouri.

The group will urge state lawmakers to increase the tax to help eliminate an expected funding shortfall for transportation. The current state gas tax is 17 cents.

Supporters say that without the tax hike Missouri would not have the matching funds needed to keep federal funding for highways beginning in 2017.
