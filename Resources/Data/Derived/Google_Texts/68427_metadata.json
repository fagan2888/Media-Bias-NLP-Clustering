LOUIS \u2014 When federal lawmakers agreed in 2010 to pass the Affordable Care Act, they recognized that the U.S. health care system was in desperate straits.\n\nNot only was the cost of health care significantly higher than in other industrialized nations, but Americans were among the unhealthiest populations in the Western world.\n\nNearly four years later, the system remains in crisis. While the growth of health care spending has slowed, it is still climbing. And despite higher costs, Americans\u2019 health outcomes have not significantly improved.\n\n\u201cOther wealthy nations achieve longer lives, lower infant mortality, better access to care, and higher care quality while spending far less,\u201d states a January 2013 report by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was never intended to immediately halt these basic trends; improving health outcomes and quality of life while cutting costs is a tall order. But the nation\u2019s volatile, partisan debate over what is popularly known as Obamacare seems to have missed that point.\n\nThe tech-savvy Obama administration was expected to deliver a user-friendly website that would increase Americans\u2019 access to health care by subsidizing insurance coverage. But HealthCare.gov was a bug-ridden disaster. And many consumers have voiced \u201csticker shock\u201d over the higher monthly premiums and higher deductibles of insurance plans for 2014 both on and off the online marketplaces, also known as health exchanges.\n\nThe stalled rollout has bolstered the new law\u2019s opponents, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, whose quasi-filibuster helped trigger a federal government shutdown last fall. Cruz has blasted the federal mandates on health insurance policies and vowed to \u201crepeal every syllable of every word of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most simple rule of economics is there ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch,\u201d Cruz told the Texas Tribune in 2012 when he was running for Senate. \u201cEverything you mandate that an insurance policy cover drives up cost, which means there are more and more people that can\u2019t afford to get insurance.\u201d\n\nBut where does that leave us? Regardless of how you view the overall merits, regulatory strictures, or societal costs of Obamacare, consider these facts:\n\n\u25a0 In the United States, health care spending eats up nearly 18 percent of the gross domestic product, which is the sum of all goods and services produced in the country. This figure could reach 21 percent by 2023.\n\n\u25a0 On average, the United States spends twice as much on health care per capita, and 50 percent more as a share of GDP, compared to other industrialized nations.\n\n\u25a0 Americans, whose life expectancy is about 78.6 years, live shorter lives than their counterparts in Western European nations.\n\nStatistics are worse in poverty zones. The shortage of primary care physicians is felt the hardest in inner cities and rural areas, where uninsured residents and those enrolled in the Medicaid program have a difficult time getting doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nThe infant mortality rate in Pemiscot County in Missouri\u2019s impoverished Bootheel is about 14 percent, according to the Delta Regional Authority. That statistic is echoed in the infant mortality rate of portions of north St. Louis.\n\n\u201cThe poor in America, compared to other industrialized nations, don\u2019t get as good care, don\u2019t live as long, and are more likely to die younger,\u201d said Thomas McAuliffe, a policy analyst for the Missouri Foundation for Health.\n\nHealth care spending gobbled up about $2.9 trillion in 2013. By 2023, it is likely to rise to $5.5 trillion, an increase of 90 percent over the decade, according to the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\u201cThere is broad evidence that much of that excess spending is wasteful,\u201d the fund\u2019s report states.\n\nStuart Guterman, the fund\u2019s executive director, said the United States spends nearly $9,000 a year per person on health care, more than twice as much as either France or Sweden, countries that offer universal health care for its citizens.\n\n\u201cBetter care in the end is the best way to get to lower-cost care,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he and other experts concede that achieving cost savings from better care is a long-term strategy \u2014 and may take generations. To lower overall health care costs, the United States needs to find ways to keep more people healthy.\n\nFormer presidents Harry Truman, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton all put forward health reform initiatives that failed to win congressional support. The Obama administration\u2019s plan was passed by a slim margin, without any Republican support.\n\nOne of the primary aims of Obamacare was to decrease the percentage of uninsured Americans as a first step toward providing affordable health care for all. Studies have shown that adults with health insurance are more likely to visit a primary physician, receive preventive care, stay healthy and live longer lives than those without coverage.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, roughly 50 million Americans were without health insurance coverage in 2011.\n\nFederal health officials hope that millions of Americans will buy a health plan on one of the new exchanges because of the law\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to become insured or face a governmental penalty.\n\nBut the Massachusetts health reform experiment \u2014 nicknamed \u201cRomneycare\u201d because it was spearheaded by former Republican Gov. Mitt Romney \u2014 has shown that access alone to health care is not a panacea for fixing a broken health care system; it is only a first step. Seven years after mandating near-universal health insurance coverage for state tax filers, Massachusetts is still struggling to contain spiraling health care costs.\n\nSince 2010, most of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s market reforms to rein in abuses in the insurance industry have been implemented nationwide. Insurers can no longer exclude applicants because of their pre-existing conditions. Children under age 26 can remain on their parents\u2019 insurance policies. Insurers can no longer apply lifetime or annual coverage limits. And insurance companies are subject to medical ratio rates that limit their administrative expenses.\n\nBut the Oct. 1 opening of health exchanges turned into a political nightmare for the Obama administration. Many consumers were unable to access HealthCare.gov, and only now, after three months of efforts to fix the website, is a growing number of applicants able to navigate the site and select a health plan.\n\nIn the past two decades, Missouri\u2019s health standing has plummeted. In 1990, Missouri\u2019s health ranking was 24th in the nation. In 2013, Missouri\u2019s health ranking was 39th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to the United Health Foundation.\n\nMissouri is in the bottom 10 among all states for stroke, high blood pressure, smoking, premature death, child immunizations, cardiovascular deaths, cancer deaths and public health funding.\n\nIn rural towns such as Poplar Bluff or Hayti, hospitals are caught in a vise: They receive shrinking reimbursements from the federal and state government for the care they provide to the poor; and if their quality metrics are below average, they receive even lower federal reimbursements.\n\nAccording to medical experts, one factor contributing to the state\u2019s poor health is its addiction to tobacco. Missouri\u2019s rate of smoking is 24 percent, the United Health Foundation states. And it has the lowest tax in the nation on cigarettes, at just 17 cents per pack.\n\nMissouri is also struggling with obesity. Missouri ranks 33rd for its high rates of obesity, according to the United Health Foundation.\n\nThe U.S. health care system excels in treating patients in crisis, such as those suffering heart attacks or cancer. But physicians have a much more difficult time preventing or treating chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease \u2014 two conditions that are often related with obesity.\n\nCardiology labs and cancer treatment centers are huge profit centers for hospitals. Medicare and private insurers pay top dollar to specialists who save or prolong the lives of patients in crisis, but much less to primary care physicians.\n\nHeidi Miller, a primary care physician with St. Louis-based Family Care Health Centers, said the best path to lowering health costs is to reduce the number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations by investing in primary care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing (as a society) on end of life care, rather than keeping people healthy,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere needs to be greater parity in reimbursement for talking to patients, engaging them, motivating them, winning their trust. It\u2019s that trusting relationship that causes them to make healthy decisions.\u201d\n\nStill, many uninsured prefer to go to a hospital emergency room when they are ill, rather than sign up for government insurance coverage for the poor.\n\nEfforts to streamline the delivery of health care have been hobbled by fights over politics and money.\n\nThe federal Medicare system covers 48 million elderly Americans at a cost of about $558 billion a year; the federal-state Medicaid programs cover 55 million poor at a cost of about $429 billion a year.\n\nResponding to industry pressure, Congress has forbidden Medicare from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies over the price of drugs.\n\nSince 1966, Medicare has paid hospitals a specific dollar amount per procedure performed. But this pay-for-service system has wasted vast sums of money on unnecessary tests and surgeries. For decades, physicians have provided medical care to the elderly with little regard for cost and also resisted attempts by Congress to lower their fees.\n\nMedicare is moving slowly toward an incentive system that will focus on a patient\u2019s total costs for an episode of care, and health outcomes. Hospitals that deliver lower quality care will be penalized with reduced payments; hospitals that deliver high-quality care at a lower cost will make money on a treated patient.\n\nFederal health officials are also encouraging health systems to experiment with the \u201caccountable care organization,\u201d or ACO \u2014 a network of providers that manages the health of a specific population of elderly patients. ACOs have built-in financial inducements to keep patients well, not just treat them when they are sick. But some health systems that have experimented with the ACO model have found that meeting the government\u2019s new quality metrics doesn\u2019t necessarily lower costs, at least in the short term.\n\nArmed with electronic health records, regulators also have sought through the \u201cHospitalCompare\u201d website to provide consumers with better data about the quality and cost of care. The new law also calls for greater disclosure of financial ties between health entities including physicians, hospitals, pharmacists and drugmakers.\n\nStill, other factors tend to boost health care costs. Hospitals continue to buy physician practices, which gives them greater leverage to demand higher charges from insurers \u2014 and leaves consumers with fewer means to negotiate better prices. Larger health organizations have built huge infrastructures that pay costly salaries to administrators. And health insurers have grown accustomed to passing on higher prices to consumers.\n\nThomas Getzen, a Philadelphia-based health care consultant and executive director of the International Health Economics Association, said investing in primary care is \u201ca sensible move in the right direction,\u201d but it\u2019s not a cure-all. \u201cThis is complicated stuff. No single initiative is going to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if Obamacare\u2019s rollout had been executed perfectly, Getzen and other analysts say, the new law would not have lowered the nation\u2019s health care costs or solved its fundamental health issues.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine has concluded that, to improve the nation\u2019s health, the government also needs to invest in preschool care, nutrition programs, assisted living for the elderly and other efforts to help the poor.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans, including a growing portion of the young, are either overweight or obese. Young Americans may comprise the first generation whose lives on average are shorter than their parents\u2019. But it\u2019s not easy to stay fit, especially if one is poor, when \u201cjunk food\u201d is heavily advertised and is often the most affordable food.\n\n\u201cThere are some easy answers, but all the easy answers are really difficult,\u201d said Getzen, stressing the economics of lifestyle choices. \u201cAll we have to do to get people healthier is have people eat better and exercise more. \u2026 This is going to be hard work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News", "og": {"site_name": "StAugustine.com", "description": "ST.
