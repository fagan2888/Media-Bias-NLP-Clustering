European Pressphoto Agency\n\nIV\u00c1N MART\u00c9N: Many still fail to appreciate the huge potential for using energy more efficiently, which is probably the best way to reduce carbon emissions. In the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s report The Energy Efficiency Opportunity: Winning Strategies for a High-Growth Market, which was published in May, we calculate potential energy savings of 200 megatons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in the U.S., which is equal to 20% of annual energy demand.\n\nIn Europe, we project that energy-efficiency technologies will represent a market worth approximately \u20ac30 billion ($38.2 billion) by 2020.\n\nThe most robust growth will be in countries with high energy prices, determined regulators, stable regulatory environments, and established energy-efficiency markets.\n\nSome important challenges remain in the residential market, however.\n\nOne challenge is that consumers perceive energy-efficiency projects as risky. They are unsure whether these projects can deliver the promised reduction in consumption. Utilities and service companies must make better efforts to explain the economics of these projects to residential customers and offer them attractive financing solutions.\n\nAnother obstacle is that not all buyers of energy-efficiency projects and services are themselves the beneficiaries. Take renters, for example. A landlord would have to invest in energy-efficient lighting for his building, but the tenants would realize the lower utility bills.\n\nResidential customers have shown interest in projects with short payback periods, such as lighting, but are less interested in projects with payback periods of three years or more\u2014even if they recognize that these projects will more than pay for themselves over the medium term.\n\nYet another hurdle is that energy costs in many houses and residential buildings do not rank high on the agenda compared with other expenses. Energy-efficiency projects require technical knowledge, specialization, and a good overall understanding of the services and products offered by utilities and services companies.\n\nFor these reasons, residential consumers often relegate energy efficiency to the back burner.\n\nIv\u00e1n Mart\u00e9n is a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group, and the global leader of its energy practice.\n\nRead the latest Energy Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Many still fail to appreciate the huge potential for using energy more efficiently, which is probably the best way to reduce carbon emissions.", "title": "Four Reasons Why Consumers Don\u2019t Reduce Energy Use", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/03/four-reasons-why-consumers-dont-reduce-energy-use/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EV438_expert_P_20141002204240.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Four Reasons Why Consumers Don\u2019t Reduce Energy Use", "description": "Many still fail to appreciate the huge potential for using energy more efficiently, which is probably the best way to reduce carbon emissions.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "Many still fail to appreciate the huge potential for using energy more efficiently, which is probably the best way to reduce carbon emissions.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-03T10:18:33-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/03/four-reasons-why-consumers-dont-reduce-energy-use/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-4278", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Many still fail to appreciate the huge potential for using energy more efficiently, which is probably the best way to reduce carbon emissions.", "title": "Four Reasons Why Consumers Don\u2019t Reduce Energy Use", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/03/four-reasons-why-consumers-dont-reduce-energy-use/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EV438_expert_P_20141002204240.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-4278", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-03T15:37:20-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Read the latest Energy Report.\nOne challenge is that consumers perceive energy-efficiency projects as risky.\nFor these reasons, residential consumers often relegate energy efficiency to the back burner.\nAnother obstacle is that not all buyers of energy-efficiency projects and services are themselves the beneficiaries.\nEuropean Pressphoto AgencyIV\u00c1N MART\u00c9N: Many still fail to appreciate the huge potential for using energy more efficiently, which is probably the best way to reduce carbon emissions."}
