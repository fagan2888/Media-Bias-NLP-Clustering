A township resident has been charged with theft after he allegedly stole approximately $1,500 in collection money belonging to St. Mary's of the Lake Church Sunday morning, police said Sunday afternoon in a press release.

Detective Sgt. Greg Staffordsmith said Lamberto Fattori, 37, is being held in the Ocean County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail without a 10-percent option.

Staffordsmith said an usher at the church said Fattori arrived at the church around 11 a.m. seeking monetary assistance due to a recent fire at his home.

The usher told Fattori the church would be happy to help and asked if he could wait until the conclusion of the Sunday morning service, Staffordsmith said.

A few minutes later, it was noticed by church personnel the bag containing the collection money was missing and police were immediately notified, Staffordsmith said.

Officier Christopher DeBiase located the man a short distance from the church as he tried to enter his car. The money belonging to the church was recovered.

An investigation by Detective Craig Fink resulted in Fattori being charged.
