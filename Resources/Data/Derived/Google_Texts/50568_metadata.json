That\u2019s the backdrop for fights between doctors, nurses and pharmacists, and those fights have become an annual occurrence at Florida\u2019s Capitol, as each group tries to increase or maintain its scope-of-practice.\n\nTo put it plainly, these are turf battles. At the center is this debate: access, versus quality.\n\n\u201cThere is a legitimate sincere concern about the quality of care implications and those concerns dovetail with the economic interest that physicians are concerned about protecting,\" says Marshall Kapp, Director of the Center for Innovative Collaboration In Medicine and Law at Florida State University. He\u2019s been watching the battles for years.\n\nThe Federal Affordable Care Act or \"Obamacare\" has created a vehicle for more people to enter the healthcare marketplace. And with more people comes a greater demand for services. But there are only so many doctors and nurses to go around. And an insurance card is worthless if you can\u2019t find anyone to see you.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s clearly putting a strain on the healthcare system and the workforce capacity now and for the foreseeable future is inadequate to handle the surge of demand we\u2019re encouraging,\" said Kapp.\n\nFor years, nurses with advanced training have wanted the ability to practice primary care independent of doctors, and they may get that authority this year. The proposal, sponsored by Representative Cary Pigman (R-Avon Park), a medical doctor himself, would create the \u201cIndependent Advanced Practice Registered Nurse\u201d, a position that could perform many of the same duties as primary care physicians\u2014including writing prescriptions -- without a doctor\u2019s oversight.\n\n\u201cI believe in the safety and benefits of this bill with the full breath of my heart,\" Pigman said during a recent hearing on a committee bill that would expand nurse's scope of practice.\n\nBut the bill is opposed by a powerful and vocal interest group: doctors. Erin VanSickle is the spokeswoman for the Florida Medical Association, and she argues nurses haven\u2019t had the same kind of training as doctors\u2014and the bill could set a dangerous precedent:\n\n\u201cThe Florida Center for nursing predicts the state will run short...by 2025. So, turning nurses into primary care doctors isn\u2019t going to alleviate that shortage, it only pushes it off and pushes the can down the road.\u201d\n\nThe FMA is also lobbying lawmakers to write clearer rules for telemedicine. During a recent committee hearing, a panel of lawmakers observed telemedicine in action, through a computer screen connected with a group of health practitioners in Georgia.\n\nFlorida is looking to Georgia\u2019s telemedicine policy as a guide. Paula Guy heads the Georgia Partnership for TeleHealth. She says physicians must support telemedicine for it to work, and the best way to ensure that is by paying them:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately or fortunately, they have to make a living. Docs don\u2019t do free care. If they think they\u2019re going to have to see a patient via telemedicine and not get paid, they\u2019re not going to do it. And you are not going to be successful,\" she said.\n\nTelemedicine is viewed as a way to reach rural patients who may not have easy access to doctors. Others see it as a cost-saving measure, with its focus on prevention.\n\nThe Florida Medical Association also has its hands full as it tries to fend off another challenge to members\u2019 authority: this one raised by pharmacies -- mainly large chains like CVS and Walgreens -- that want the ability to administer more vaccines. Those big chains also want to hire more technicians. Under current state law, a pharmacist can oversee up to three techs. Retailers want to boost that to six. But Florida Pharmacy Association CEO Michael Jackson worries those numbers could go higher, and that\u2019s a no-go:\n\n\u201cInstead of a pharmacist monitoring what three technicians are doing, that pharmacist may have to monitor what 12, 14, 15 technicians are doing,\" Jackson said. \"There have to be assurances that everything will be done correctly. If not, the fear is that a patient will get a medication they\u2019re not supposed to get, or not get a medication they should be getting,\"\n\nWhich brings the debate back to its center: how to balance demands without jeopardizing quality of care.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Lynn Hatter on twitter @HatterLynn", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "The nation\u2019s health care delivery system is undergoing major changes, and the lines between what different healthcare providers do is beginning to blur.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wfsu.org/post/nurses-pharmacists-doctors-gearing-annual-scope-practice-fights", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfsu/files/styles/medium/public/201403/Pigman.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The nation\u2019s health care delivery system is undergoing major changes, and the lines between what different healthcare providers do is beginning to blur.", "title": "Nurses, Pharmacists, Doctors Gearing Up For Annual Scope Of Practice Fights"}, "story_id": 277041559, "twitter": {"site": "@wfsunews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HatterLynn"}, "author": "Lynn Hatter", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Nurses, Pharmacists, Doctors Gearing Up For Annual Scope Of Practice Fights"}, "nid": 46065, "datePublished": "2014-02-14", "keywords": "healthcare, Nursing, pharmacy technicians, pharmacy, scope of practice, legislature 2014, Florida Medical Association, Florida Retail Association, Florida Pharmacy Association, Representative Cary Pigman, telemedicine", "wordCount": 853, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf9e\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s the backdrop for fights between doctors, nurses and pharmacists, and those fights have become an annual occurrence at Florida\u2019s Capitol, as each group tries to increase or maintain its scope-of-practice.\nIf they think they\u2019re going to have to see a patient via telemedicine and not get paid, they\u2019re not going to do it.\nFor years, nurses with advanced training have wanted the ability to practice primary care independent of doctors, and they may get that authority this year.\nBut there are only so many doctors and nurses to go around.\nTelemedicine is viewed as a way to reach rural patients who may not have easy access to doctors."}
