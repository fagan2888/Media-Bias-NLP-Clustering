The Starz series is based on a set of historical romance novels by Diana Gabaldon that have long been bestsellers, and that popularity has translated to the show. \u201cOutlander\u201d has become one of Starz\u2019s most successful shows, both with viewers drawn to the sumptuous historical details and the character-driven, soapy romance and with critics who appreciate \u201cOutlander\u2019s\u201d ultra-rare, ultra-precious female gaze.\n\nIt helps that the show is just practically very well done\u2014it\u2019s gorgeous, beautifully scored, and deliciously plotty, which one would expect from the showrunner who created the fantastic \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d reboot, Ronald. D. Moore. It also helps that the show\u2019s two stars, Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan, have sizzling on-screen chemistry. Their performances anchor the fantastical elements of the plot\u2014and there are plenty, ranging from time-travel to the fact that this improbably hot guy happens to be a virgin\u2014and make \u201cOutlander\u201d an enormously enjoyable show to watch.\n\nBut as readers of the book know already, Jamie and Claire are about to hit a big, problematic snag. In the last episode before the hiatus, Claire broke away from the camp to search for the standing stones that precipitated her time-traveling. She gets kidnapped as a result, and Jamie manages to barge into the British barracks just as sadistic Capt. Jack Randall is about to rape Claire. Jaime saves her in the first few minutes of Saturday night\u2019s episode, \u201cThe Reckoning,\u201d but the ordeal isn\u2019t over: Scottish patriarchal custom demands that Jamie punish his wife for \u201cdisobeying orders,\u201d i.e., whip her with a strap.\n\nThe book reads:\n\n\u201cI mean to do it, Claire! Now, if you cooperate wi\u2019 me, we\u2019ll call the account square with a dozen strokes.\u201d \u201cAnd if not?\u201d I quavered. He picked up the strap and slapped it against his leg with a nasty thwapping sound. \u201cThen I shall put a knee in your back and beat you \u2018til my arm tires, and I warn ye, you\u2019ll tire of it long before I do.\u201d\n\nClaire accuses him of being a sadist, to which he replies:\n\n\u201cI said I would have to punish you. I did not say I wasna going to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nAnd the next morning, Claire describes the punishment thusly:\n\nIt had been a most unpleasant night. My reluctant acquiescence had lasted precisely as far as the first searing crack of leather on flesh. This was followed by a short, violent struggle, which left Jamie with a bloody nose, three lovely gouges down one cheek, and a deeply bitten wrist. Not surprisingly, it left me half smothered in the greasy quilts with a knee in my back, being beaten within an inch of my life.\n\nWhich is not, you know, particularly sexy. And as Bryn Donovan writes at Persephone Magazine, the way that Claire\u2019s frostiness toward Jamie is resolved in the book doesn\u2019t really dispel the upsetting weirdness of the scene\u2014if anything, Claire comes to \u201cgrudgingly accept\u201d that Jamie was in the right, and then impetuously declares that she loves him; Jamie reaffirms how much he enjoyed it, and tells her, too, that she\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t try to have sex with her after he beat her (because that\u2019s how much he enjoyed it, presumably).\n\nNaturally, as I watched \u201cThe Reckoning,\u201d I felt some foreboding\u2014especially because the episode is narrated, for the first time, from Jamie\u2019s perspective, not Claire\u2019s. But the show takes several creative liberties with the shape of this scene\u2014and to my surprise, carries them off. The scene is not \u201cbeating within an inch of [her] life,\u201d it\u2019s spanking with a folded belt. And Claire doesn\u2019t forgive Jamie until he goes out of his way to make amends to her. The intimacy of the punishment in the first half of the episode is balanced out by the intimacy of mutual enjoyment and coming to terms with each other in the back half\u2014and each has its own share of power struggles. Most important\u2014in the book, the episode seems like a weird sideshow designed to bring Claire down a peg. In the series, it\u2019s a crucial relationship-building conflict, central to the narrative of the episode and to the series as a whole.\n\n\u201cOutlander\u201d has gotten criticism for centering violence against women so much in its narrative\u2014from perceived husbandly duties to the seemingly ever-present threat of rape and/or sexual assault for Claire in 1743. But what I\u2019m finding valuable about the series is the conversation it\u2019s opening up about pervasive violence against women, in that culture or in ours. \u201cOutlander\u201d is not a happy fantasy\u2014it\u2019s a horror story, too, to be banished from the relatively modern era to a nearly medieval society. I spoke to the stars about filming that spanking scene, how they\u2019re interpreting it for their characters, and in general, the challenges of inhabiting this sexually charged, violent world.\n\nCaitriona, what is it like playing a character who goes from a world that has very specific sexual mores to one that has very different ones? Such as, for example, on one of Claire\u2019s first nights in the castle, the laird\u2019s brother Dougal (Graham McTavish) tries to rape your character in a side passageway.\n\nCaitriona Balfe: That to Dougal is just flirting, by the way. (Laughs.)\n\nExactly. There\u2019s something weirdly casual about it in that context\u2014but obviously she\u2019s like, no, I do not want this, and has to be very violent.\n\nCB: When we began the show, it\u2019s quite shocking when you first read all the attempted rapes. And as a modern woman, your first instinct is that that would be such a traumatic event that it would be something that I don\u2019t think you would ever get over. And yet, sexual violence against women in that time is used so casually and is such a weapon. But it\u2019s not even the most treacherous one, in a sense.\n\nIt was hard for me. I remember saying to the writers, \u201cDoesn\u2019t she still feel affected by this? Surely there would be a greater\u2026 overhang.\u201d We\u2019re in such an analytical society now, and we take all of these things\u2014rightly so, I believe\u2014with such seriousness that it\u2019s hard to see how someone could just pick themselves up and move on. But one of the pieces of research I was doing was reading books on the nurses who had served on the front lines in the Second World War. Their stories, some of them, are so horrific, but some of the things that jumped off the pages to me were that in that immediacy of life, in that time when life and death are sitting \u2014 people just get on with things. You don\u2019t have the luxury or the time to wallow or have any sort of self-pity. The survival instinct really kicks in. And that\u2019s what Claire is, she\u2019s a survivor. I really tried to approach it from that point of view. It\u2019s not that these things don\u2019t affect her\u2014they do\u2014but she\u2019s a survivor, and she doesn\u2019t have the luxury of wallowing in these moments.\n\nFor Jamie, so much of his origin story in the books is this terrible flogging that he endured because his sister was being threatened by, again, this pervasive threat of rape. Sexual assault as a plot device is a much-discussed issue in our society, right now, especially.\n\nSam Heughan: Absolutely\u2014and also maybe how more accepting we are now of it. We were talking earlier about this spanking scene [in Saturday\u2019s episode, \u201cThe Reckoning\u201d] and how there was a cheer, and that was just interesting for us. Perhaps it was more about the fans were waiting to see these events happen and how they played out. But it is interesting, isn\u2019t it? Definitely a recurring theme in the story.\n\nCB: But I think it\u2019s important. Nowadays, obviously there\u2019s so much in the media about what happens in India or in a lot of war-torn countries. Unfortunately, it still exists\u2014no matter how much we think we\u2019ve moved forward as having equality for men and women, unfortunately sexual attacks still happen. We also deal with it in terms of between two men in our show, towards the end of the season. That also exists. In England in the last year, that whole [Operation] Yewtree situation where you have these pedophile rings. So I think in our culture we have to examine why this never goes away. It\u2019s constantly there. I don\u2019t have any answers but I think it\u2019s interesting to look at it and examine it and maybe keep people thinking about it and spark conversation. I think that\u2019s what entertainment should do. As much as it should be entertaining, it should evoke a feeling, and evoke some kind of conversation out of people, so they examine who we are and why we do things.\n\nWhat was this about the cheer during the spanking scene?\n\nCB: Apparently last night at the theater [for the \u201cOutlander\u201d premiere] the whole audience cheered or something.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sam Heughan (Jamie) and Caitriona Balfe (Claire) talk last night's premiere and the sexual politics of time travel", "title": "\u201cOutlander\u201d stars on spanking, TV sex and the female gaze: \u201cWomen have been starved for quite a while\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sam Heughan (Jamie) and Caitriona Balfe (Claire) talk last night's premiere and the sexual politics of time travel", "title": "\u201cOutlander\u201d stars on spanking, TV sex and the female gaze: \u201cWomen have been starved for quite a while\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/outlander_stars_on_spanking_tv_sex_and_the_female_gaze_women_have_been_starved_for_quite_a_while/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/outlander1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sam Heughan (Jamie) and Caitriona Balfe (Claire) talk last night's premiere and the sexual politics of time travel", "title": "\u201cOutlander\u201d stars on spanking, TV sex and the female gaze: \u201cWomen have been starved for quite a while\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/outlander1.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, caitriona balfe, diana gabaldon, Outlander, sam heughan, Sex, Spanking, starz, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But as readers of the book know already, Jamie and Claire are about to hit a big, problematic snag.\nAnd yet, sexual violence against women in that time is used so casually and is such a weapon.\nUnfortunately, it still exists\u2014no matter how much we think we\u2019ve moved forward as having equality for men and women, unfortunately sexual attacks still happen.\nShe gets kidnapped as a result, and Jamie manages to barge into the British barracks just as sadistic Capt.\nNow, if you cooperate wi\u2019 me, we\u2019ll call the account square with a dozen strokes.\u201d \u201cAnd if not?\u201d I quavered."}
