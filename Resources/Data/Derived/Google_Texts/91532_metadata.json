A task force of lawmakers who spent six months studying the state's Medicaid system gave initial approval for Gov. Asa Hutchinson to pursue his vision of change.\n\n\n\n\"Right now it is time to make a decisive statement,\" Hutchinson said.\n\n\n\nThe task force statement: expansion of Medicaid now known as the Private Option, which gave government-sponsored healthcare to more than 200,000 Arkansans, should continue.\n\n\n\n\"Whenever you're trying to achieve the objective of a healthy, active Arkansas, access to healthcare is important,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn order to keep the program going, the task force approved changes sought by the governor.\n\n\n\nThat means slashing nearly $850 million dollars in Medicaid spending over five years through negotiated cuts of $250 million to long-term care, $110 million to pharmaceuticals and $20 million to the dental program.\n\n\n\nThe governor and some lawmakers are looking at hiring a managed care company to hold down costs for behavioral health and the developmentally disabled.\n\n\n\nBut not all are on board.\n\n\n\n\"That money could be going toward care,\" said Sen. Linda Chesterfield, D-North Little Rock.\n\n\n\nOthers in the governor's Republican party don't buy predictions of cost savings achieved by continuing Medicaid expansion, pointing out it's a central tenant of the controversial Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\"We have a chance as a legislature to end the Obamacare/Private Option Medicaid expansion in Arkansas,\" said Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs. \"I think we need to do that.\"\n\n\n\nThe governor also wants to pursue Medicaid changes requiring federal approval.\n\n\n\nThey include forcing Arkansans to use employer-based insurance when available, referring able-bodied beneficiaries to work training and having those who earn over 100 percent of the poverty line pay a premium.\n\n\n\nAll of these issues will have to be worked out in a special session the governor says will be held in early April.\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
