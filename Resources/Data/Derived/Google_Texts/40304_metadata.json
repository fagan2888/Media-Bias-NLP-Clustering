The man, whose name hasn\u2019t been released, faces a misdemeanor charge of unlawful ownership of a dangerous dog, Kirby said. \u201cThe dogs have been taken by the Humane Society,\u201d she added.\n\nThe owner has 10 days to pay the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region the cost of caring for the animals, and if he doesn\u2019t he must relinquish the dogs to the organization, said Gretchen Pressley, Humane Society spokeswoman.\n\nThe Humane Society will keep the dogs until court proceedings in the case are finished, Pressley said.\n\n\u201cIn cases of dangerous animal charges, the court normally orders humane euthanization,\u201d Pressley said.\n\nThe dogs attacked the children in Rush, a small town at the east end of El Paso County, when a woman brought her five children with her to look at the dogs that belong to her boss.\n\nWhen she came out, she heard screaming and found that four of her children had been mauled by three of the dogs. Kirby said the children had been bitten around the head and torso, and possibly on their extremities.\n\nThe identities of the woman and her children have not been released.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "4 El Paso County children recovering after being mauled by 3 Great Danes", "title": "4 El Paso County children recovering after being mauled by 3 Great Danes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/4-el-paso-county-children-recovering-after-being-mauled-by-3-great-danes/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T11:40:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-21T11:40:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02f8\"", "article_summary": "Four children injured in a El Paso County dog attack are recovering, with one sent home from a hospital on Saturday night, Jackie Kirby, El Paso County Sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman, said Sunday.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when the one other will be released,\u201d Kirby said.\nThe dogs attacked the children in Rush, a small town at the east end of El Paso County, when a woman brought her five children with her to look at the dogs that belong to her boss.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office has issued a summons to the owner of the three Great Danes that attacked the children on Saturday.\nThe Humane Society will keep the dogs until court proceedings in the case are finished, Pressley said."}
