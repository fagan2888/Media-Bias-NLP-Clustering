State government got favorable ratings from 50 percent and unfavorable marks from 27 percent. Local government\u2019s numbers were a little lower: 46 percent positive and 24 percent negative.\n\nBut just because Texas voters are pretty happy with state government does not guarantee that they and the people they sent to Austin are in sync. They don\u2019t necessarily share the same priorities, the poll found.\n\nLawmakers are plugging away on the budget and taxes and border security, loosely mirroring overall voter priorities of limited government and border security. But the third item on voters\u2019 list \u2014 expanding Medicaid funding under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 has hardly been mentioned by legislative leaders.\n\n\u201cThe party split here is obvious,\u201d said Daron Shaw, a professor of government at UT-Austin and co-director of the UT/TT Poll. \u201cThe Democrats are pretty predictable. Within the Republicans, I don\u2019t think there is much of a consensus about what they want to do.\u201d\n\nTea Party Republicans topped their charts with \u201ccontinue to limit government by approving no new spending and no new taxes,\u201d followed by state funding for border security operations and lower property taxes. For non-Tea Party Republicans, the top three were border security, property taxes and increased funding for public schools. Democrats\u2019 top three were Medicaid expansion, public school funding and property taxes.\n\n\u201cYou really do see the roots of the Tea Party in these priorities,\u201d said Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin and co-director of the poll. \u201cTheir top priority is still no new spending and no new taxes. The core is still there.\u201d\n\nMashed together, limited government topped the list, followed by border security, expanding Medicaid, increasing funding for public schools and lowering property taxes. None of the remaining choices netted support from more than 5 percent of voters.\n\n\"If the opinion leaders are not in the bully pulpit talking about an issue, it\u2019s not going to rise,\u201d Henson said. \u201cWe saw that last [session] with water.\u201d\n\nThe absence of an overriding concern in state politics gives lawmakers more freedom to write their own agenda, Shaw said.\n\n\u201cWhen there is not some sort of major economic crisis going on, voters are free to pick and choose their priorities and legislators are free to sort of shape that,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe leadership seems to be kind of going their own way, not necessarily in response to public opinion. They have a lot of opportunity to shape priorities.\"\n\n\u201cIt sets up a sort of a la carte legislative session,\u201d he added.\n\nWith a few noticeable exceptions, voters don\u2019t appear to feel strongly about allowing city and county governments to regulate particular issues.\n\nEnforcement of federal immigration laws was the biggest exception: 70 percent support local enforcement, including 48 percent who strongly support it.\n\n\u201cIt is the idea that the federal government has failed at that and they think the local government ought to do something,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s a referenda: \u2018If you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it, somebody else needs to.\u2019\u201d\n\nA majority of voters support local regulation of smoking in public places and of using mobile devices while driving \u2014 two issues that have stymied legislative attempts at statewide regulation while cities have been able to put restrictive laws in place.\n\nOther issues land on the fence. While 46 percent support local limits on plastic shopping bags by retailers, 43 percent oppose it. Medicaid expansion at the local level under the Affordable Care Act got 43 percent support and 43 percent opposition. The regulation of guns at the local level sounded good to 49 percent and bad to 45 percent.\n\n\u201cSmoking and texting fit pretty well into a local safety thing,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cOn the others, there is too much of a policy judgment.\u201d\n\nHydraulic fracturing falls somewhere in between. While 45 percent support local limits \u2014 fewer than half \u2014 they outnumber the 34 percent who oppose it. That, unlike the other items on the list, found a significant number of voters \u2014 21 percent \u2014 saying they had no opinion.\n\nInside and Outside\n\nThe issues that preoccupy people in and around state government often go unremarked by voters.\n\n\u201cThe things that tend to preoccupy the close observers and the insiders are different from what preoccupies the public,\u201d Henson said.\n\nSome items break through. For instance, only 9 percent of voters said they have not heard anything about former Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s indictments; 77 percent said they have heard some or a lot.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, large majorities have heard nothing or only a little about other issues that have made news recently in state government, such as contracting issues at the Health and Human Services Commission, tuition reimbursements for state employees, oversight of the Texas Enterprise Fund, the investigation of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, the race for speaker of the House and the change in the Senate\u2019s rules that absorbed the members of that body.\n\n\u201cI think this stuff doesn\u2019t mean anything until there is an election,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much attention to what the media says about these things, but in an election, the media is paying lots of time on it and you have an opponent pounding on it. It\u2019s not sensitivity \u2014 it\u2019s that this is a session and not an election year.\u201d\n\nThe University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted from Feb. 6 to Feb. 15 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.83 percentage points.
