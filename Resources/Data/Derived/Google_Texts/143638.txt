New Haven police officers who normally work on their own are patrolling with a partner now, following the fatal shooting of two New York City officers in a squad car last weekend.

New Haven Officer David Hartman, the department’s media liaison, said doubling up assures better safety. He acknowledged that for many cops, the New York City tragedy hasn’t sunk in yet.

"We have been listening as quietly as possible to months, now, of anti-police sentiment in the wake of the Eric Garner death, and Michael Brown’s death," Hartman said. "And we wonder now: how many of those who protest the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown are also going to protest the death of these innocent, caring, dedicated officers?"

Hartman said police officers don’t choose which neighborhoods to protect; they’re responsible for the whole city. He said they must be able to protect themselves in order to do their job.
