People would come, but say, how can I have a house like this and I can\u2019t get to it\u2014little problem.\u201d\n\nHe ultimately bought it for $6.5 million.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thinking you need when you\u2019re dealing with the Chinese,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should be making deals just like this \u2026 phenomenal deals, where people say how do they do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it helps to have a terrible reputation,\u201d he quipped to an assembled crowd of well-heeled notables and patrons. \u201cWe use people who are incompetent,\u201d he added, of American negotiators abroad.\n\nIt was just the latest stop on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and business tour, which are often indistinguishable, and it came on the same day that Trump topped a Suffolk University/USA Today national poll of Republican voters, with 17 percent support.\n\n\u201cWe need to take back our jobs, we need to take back our factories,\u201d he said, at the event, before inviting guests to tour the property\u2019s wood-paneled and marbled halls and sip Trump-branded sparkling wine.\n\n\u201cWe make the finest wines,\u201d he boasted. \u201cWe make many different kind of wines, but the finest wines.\u201d\n\nTrump flew to a nearby airport aboard his private Boeing 757, arriving at the property aboard a helicopter emblazoned with the TRUMP logo.\n\nIt\u2019s his career as a negotiator, he argues, that will make voters overlook this largess. On Wednesday or Thursday, he promises, he will release his personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\u201cYou know what that\u2019s going to show, that I know how to make money,\u201d he retorts, when asked by TIME whether he was out of touch with voters. \u201cAnd because I know how to make money, that\u2019s what the country has to do\u2014because our country loses with everybody. \u201c\n\nStriking a populist tone, Trump broke publicly with the Republican Party, who he says is too focused on taking care of the wealthy.\n\n\u201cWe also have to take care of people who have no money,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I tell that to Republicans, and if they don\u2019t want to take care of people, then they probably shouldn\u2019t vote for me, because I\u2019ll take care.\u201d\n\nAsked how he would help the poor, Trump said he would work to repeal the Affordable Care Act, declining to discuss other specifics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about it now,\u201d he said in response to a question from TIME. \u201cI\u2019m going to release a plan.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump has long been out-of-step with conservative orthodoxy on the subject, having endorsed a single-payer health-care system 15 years ago as well as a one-time wealth tax to pay down the national debt.\n\nIn Phoenix on Saturday, Trump proclaimed that he was hoping to marshal a \u201csilent majority\u201d of voters who are dissatisfied with the American political system. And while he has risen to the top in national and statewide polls of Republicans, Trump faces skepticism.\n\nAsked about polling that shows that many Republicans believe he is simply running in order to boost his business interests, Trump spun it as a positive, suggesting that there are even more Americans who agree with him, but need to be convinced he is serious.\n\n\u201cI hope that\u2019s right that 40 percent think I\u2019m doing it [for publicity], because a lot of those people are voters for Trump, but they won\u2019t be in the polls if they think I\u2019m doing this for publicity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would I be doing this? \u2026 This isn\u2019t fun, I want to make American great again.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he rejects Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s criticism of his tone, for instance when he suggested that many people in the U.S. illegally are \u201crapists.\u201d He added that for every Republican that has criticized his hardline stance against illegal immigration, more have come around to his side.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Trump called Clinton a \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201csad\u201d candidate, asserting that she is going after him because he is now \u201cher real competition.\u201d\n\nTrump, who claims to have fielded threats from escaped Mexican drug cartel leader Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, said he is working with law enforcement on his security.\n\n\u201cWe have officials all over the place, including right outside hanging out in trees,\u201d he told reporters.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Business mogul Donald Trump cited his real estate deals as a sign of his political acumen during a stop in Virginia wine country.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "He cited his purchase of the vineyard as a sign of his political potential.", "title": "Trump Talks Politics at His Virginia Winery", "url": "http://time.com/3957783/donald-trump-real-estate-campaign/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/donald-trump-real-estate-campaign.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/donald-trump-real-estate-campaign.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "title": "Trump Talks Politics at His Virginia Winery", "description": "He cited his purchase of the vineyard as a sign of his political potential.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "donald trump, donald trump real estate, donald trump business, donald trump bed and breakfast, virginia, albemarle estates", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump real estate, Donald Trump business, Donald Trump bed and breakfast, Virginia, Albemarle Estates"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAnd because I know how to make money, that\u2019s what the country has to do\u2014because our country loses with everybody.\nAnd while he has risen to the top in national and statewide polls of Republicans, Trump faces skepticism.\nFor Donald Trump, business is politics.\n\u201cStriking a populist tone, Trump broke publicly with the Republican Party, who he says is too focused on taking care of the wealthy.\n\u201cYou know what that\u2019s going to show, that I know how to make money,\u201d he retorts, when asked by TIME whether he was out of touch with voters."}
