Nonetheless, rewarding hospitals of mediocre quality was hardly the stated goal when the Affordable Care Act created financial incentives to encourage better medical care from hospitals, doctors and other health care providers.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Health Affairs looked at the more than $1 billion in payments made last year in the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, which raises or lowers Medicare payments to hospitals based on the government\u2019s assessment of their quality. Medicare primarily uses death and infection rates and patient surveys to judge hospitals, but it also evaluates how much each hospitals\u2019 patients cost, both in treatment and recovery.\n\nUse Our Content This KHN story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nThe 231 hospitals the study identified had below average scores on quality measures but were awarded the bonuses because caring for their patients during their stays and in the 30 days following their discharge cost Medicare less than what it cost at half of hospitals evaluated in the program.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, began measuring cost in October 2014 to encourage hospitals to provide care in the most efficient way possible. In the period examined in the study \u2014 the federal fiscal year that ended in September 2015 \u2014 spending counted for 20 percent of a hospital\u2019s score in determining whether a hospital would get a bonus, penalty or regular payment.\n\nUnder this formula, hospitals with Medicare spending below the median hospital were able to qualify for bonuses even though their quality measures were below the median, the study found. Patients at those 231 hospitals cost Medicare on average nearly $16,000, about $2,300 less than the average spending for the patients at other hospitals that received bonuses, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Anup Das, a medical and health policy student at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe average bonus for those lower quality hospitals was an 0.18 percent increase in Medicare payments for each patient stay during that fiscal year. Most of the 1,700 hospitals that received a bonus that year had higher than average quality ratings, and their patients in some cases were more costly to Medicare.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality low-spending hospitals received the greatest financial benefit from the program,\u201d the study said. \u201cIn this respect, CMS achieved its goal with the new spending measure. However, some low-quality hospitals received bonuses because of their low spending.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, CMS said it would consider revising the program for future years so that hospitals scoring below the national median for quality would not receive a bonus. The statement also noted that this year, three-fourths of hospitals\u2019 scores were based on quality measures. \u201cWe believe that there needs to be a balanced consideration between quality and cost, which is reflected in our scoring methodology,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe study found the lower-quality hospitals that received bonuses in the last fiscal year had higher death rates for heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia than half of the nation\u2019s other hospitals evaluated in the program. These hospitals were also less likely to follow recommended procedures for care, like choosing the right antibiotic for patients or performing an angioplasty on a heart attack patient within 90 minutes of their arrival at the hospital.\n\nThe 231 lower-quality hospitals with bonuses also received less enthusiastic ratings from patients about how well doctors and nurses communicated, responded to issues and managed pain, the study found. The study did not name the 231 hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small decrease in quality, but the differences are significant,\u201d Das said in an interview.\n\nOther new federal quality payment programs created by the health law, such as accountable care organizations, deny bonuses to doctors or hospitals with substandard quality of care, no matter how efficiently they operate. The study suggested the government add a similar limitation to the Value-Based Purchasing program.\n\nThe study did not look at the current federal fiscal year, which runs through this September. This year, Medicare gave bonuses to 1,705 hospitals, averaging 0.51 percent, and reduced payments to 1,375 hospitals by an average of 0.34 percent, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis. Along with spending, Medicare\u2019s other criteria are: death and infection rates; how faithfully a hospital followed basic clinical guidelines; and how patients rated their experiences in surveys.\n\nSpending counts for a fourth of each hospitals\u2019 scores, more than last year, and is scheduled to continue to do so for the next two years. The study\u2019s lead author, Das, said in the interview that a preliminary analysis found some lower-quality hospitals again received bonuses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research highlights the paradox in the federal program to improve hospital quality.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Kaiser Health News", "description": "New research highlights the paradox in the federal program to improve hospital quality.", "title": "Medicare Pays Bonuses To 231 Hospitals With Lower Quality Because Of Cheaper Costs", "url": "http://khn.org/news/medicare-pays-bonuses-to-231-hospitals-with-lower-quality-because-of-cheaper-costs/", "image": {"width": 570, "identifier": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/money-lean-hospital.png", "height": 380}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/money-lean-hospital.png?w=640"}, "site": "@khnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@khnews"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khn.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "Kaiser Health News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-05-02T20:00:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T12:56:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "El-hccfbhMd9lv-h8wAfp8Qu5KhqI8hjJMi1-CefIoQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The study\u2019s lead author, Das, said in the interview that a preliminary analysis found some lower-quality hospitals again received bonuses.\nMedicare primarily uses death and infection rates and patient surveys to judge hospitals, but it also evaluates how much each hospitals\u2019 patients cost, both in treatment and recovery.\nThe federal government paid bonuses to 231 hospitals with subpar quality because their patients tend to be less expensive for Medicare, new research shows.\nThe average bonus for those lower quality hospitals was an 0.18 percent increase in Medicare payments for each patient stay during that fiscal year.\n\u201cHigh-quality low-spending hospitals received the greatest financial benefit from the program,\u201d the study said."}
