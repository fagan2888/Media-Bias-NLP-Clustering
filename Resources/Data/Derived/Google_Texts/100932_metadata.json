Remember the demand that the horrors that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School must never happen again?\n\nXavier University changed the name on the front of its uniforms to Sandy Hook. Providence College did the same on the back of its players\u2019 jerseys. The University of Connecticut wore green SH patches the entire season.\n\nProfessionally, the New England Patriots donned black ribbon decals. The headsets of New York Jets coach Rex Ryan carried the initials S.H.E.S. On Opening Day, every Major League Baseball team wore a \u201cTown of Newtown\u201d patch.\n\n1 of 18 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles on gun control View Photos A collection of cartoons about the debate.

The dollars went to Newtown, Conn., along with thousands more donated by teams and fans.\n\nAt least for one game, our nation played for Sandy Hook.\n\nMoments of silence were held across the country. Then, after the games, came unprecedented outbursts from coaches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really lucky,\u201d Winthrop University basketball Coach Pat Kelsey said during a postgame press conference on Dec. 18. After the bus ride home, he said, he planned to give his 5- and 4-year-old daughters \u201cthe biggest hug and the biggest kiss I\u2019ve ever given them. And there\u2019s 20 families in Connecticut that are walking into a pink room with a bunch of teddy bears with nobody laying in those beds. . . . This has to be a time for change.\u201d\n\nSyracuse Coach Jim Boeheim went further that same week after recording his 900th career victory: \u201cIf we in this country as Americans cannot get the people who represent us to do something about firearms, we are a sad, sad society,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, what are we?\n\nOne year and at least a half dozen school shootings later, including one Friday in Colorado , who\u2019s still playing for Sandy Hook?\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top opinions stories of 2013 View Photos From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers\u2019 interests over the past year.

We have read the conclusions of the official investigation. Numerous \u201chow they\u2019ve coped\u201d and \u201cforever in our hearts\u201d stories are coming this week.\n\nThe jerseys have been auctioned off, and the hat\u2019s been passed around. The athletes, like so much of the rest of the United States, have moved on.\n\nAnd nothing has changed.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if just once, a professional or college sports team or a million-dollar athlete turned those uniform patches into a relentless call for action?\n\nSports offers the largest stage of all, one where it is a slam dunk to raise awareness. But it\u2019s foul play to demand action.\n\nIn the corporate-sponsored sports world, professional athletes rarely protest anything beyond an official\u2019s call. Doing so is the fastest way to lose endorsements or one\u2019s career. But many athletes also have families. They are mothers and fathers who can sympathize.\n\nImagine if the Boston Red Sox had walked off the field during the final game of the World Series, demanding that the country act to protect its children from school shootings.\n\nImagine if the student-athletes in next month\u2019s major-college football championship were to release a pregame statement in protest: \u201cFor the children of Sandy Hook, the students of Columbine, our friends at Virginia Tech, we will not play this game.\u201d\n\nYes, imagine.\n\nIs the best we can do to hope that a rogue announcer might say: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, please stand and remove your caps. Ask yourselves if our country has taken any action since our last moment of silence for a school massacre, and join in the singing of our national anthem\u201d?\n\nA year has passed since 20 children, and others, were killed at Sandy Hook. Efforts to change national gun safety laws have failed. There have been shootings at middle schools, high schools and colleges.\n\nWhen will we, as a nation, learn from our inaction? When will we do more than hold a moment of silence for a slaughter that might have been prevented?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ted Mandell, notre dame ted mandell, heart stoppers and hail marys: The greatest college football finishes, sandy hook elementary school shootings, sandy hook shootings, newtown connecticut school shootings, newtown shootings 911 calls, official report sandy hook school shootings, adam lanza sandy hook, boston red sox world series, bcs championship game, us school shootings, gun control sandy hook, sandy hook athletic teams ribbons, pat kelsey winthrop university, syracuse coach jim boeheim, gun control sandy hook, new england patriots sandy hook ribbons, senate gun control legislation, connecticut school shooting, sandy hook anniversary", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Sports teams and figures should galvanize end to gun violence.", "title": "Sports offers the arena to raise awareness of gun violence", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sports-offers-the-arena-to-raise-awareness-of-gun-violence/2013/12/13/5f16ae00-61bd-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/11/Editorial-Opinion/Images/School_Shooting_The_First_Year-04781.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sports-offers-the-arena-to-raise-awareness-of-gun-violence/2013/12/13/5f16ae00-61bd-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ted Mandell, notre dame ted mandell, heart stoppers and hail marys: The greatest college football finishes, sandy hook elementary school shootings, sandy hook shootings, newtown connecticut school shootings, newtown shootings 911 calls, official report sandy hook school shootings, adam lanza sandy hook, boston red sox world series, bcs championship game, us school shootings, gun control sandy hook, sandy hook athletic teams ribbons, pat kelsey winthrop university, syracuse coach jim boeheim, gun control sandy hook, new england patriots sandy hook ribbons, senate gun control legislation, connecticut school shooting, sandy hook anniversary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5f16ae00-61bd-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Sports teams and figures should galvanize end to gun violence."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1857\"", "article_summary": "Remember the demand that the horrors that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School must never happen again?\nA year has passed since 20 children, and others, were killed at Sandy Hook.\nSports offers the largest stage of all, one where it is a slam dunk to raise awareness.\nOne year and at least a half dozen school shootings later, including one Friday in Colorado , who\u2019s still playing for Sandy Hook?\nXavier University changed the name on the front of its uniforms to Sandy Hook."}
