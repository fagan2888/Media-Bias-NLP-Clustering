He made the comments in the wake of the hijacking of an EgyptAir plane forced to land in Cyprus by a passenger claiming to be wearing an explosive suicide belt.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe alleged hijacker, named by Cypriot officials as Seif Eldin Mustafa, has been taken into custody amid conflicting reports about his motivation. Some are saying the hijacker was seeking to talk to his estranged wife who lives in Cyprus, while other reports are claiming the man presented political demands, including the release of female prisoners in Egypt.\n\nAnsari stressed that he does not know the hijacker or his motives. However, the jihadist warned that, regardless of today\u2019s incident, the Islamic State \u201chas successfully recruited collaborators among airport personnel around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I know is that our brothers invest a lot of effort in making it happen,\u201d he said, referring to the possibility of future attacks on airliners.\n\nHe further said on Tuesday that Wilayat Sinai, the IS affiliate in the Egyptian peninsula, has made significant gains and is ready to spread inland, toward Cairo and the Nile Delta.\n\nIn an earlier interview broadcast Sunday on \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d Ansari said that Wilayat Sinai will be at the forefront of IS\u2019s battle against Israel, and that the days until the group carries out attacks on the south of Israel are numbered.\n\nIn the same interview, Ansari claimed IS has agents working in Western airports, metro stations, and \u201cvery sensitive facilities in the world.\u201d\n\nAnsari is a well-known Gaza Salafist jihadi allied with Islamic State ideology. During his most recent interviews, Ansari seemed to be speaking as an actual IS member, repeatedly using the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d when referring to IS and even seemingly making declarations on behalf of IS.\n\nIS has been reluctant to officially declare its presence in Gaza for fear of a Hamas clampdown, but the group is known to be active in the coastal enclave and Ansari is a suspected IS leader. IS-aligned militants have taken responsibility for recent rocket fire from Gaza aimed at Israel.\n\nListen to the discussion of this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:\n\n\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
