The David V. Uihlein Sr. Ruffed Grouse Management Area was dedicated Oct. 21 at a ceremony on the public land near Crandon. The area covers 2,045 acres in the Forest County Forest.

The management area is a project of the Ruffed Grouse Society and Forest County Forestry and Parks Department and has received financial support from the family of David Uihlein. The area will be managed to promote young forest, a type of habitat critical for ruffed grouse and woodcock as well as many non-game species such as golden-winged warblers.

The parcel is open for public use and includes a snowmobile trail and hunter walk-in area. The county also has an ATV trail across the northern portion of the property.

The area is named in honor of Uihlein, a businessman and conservationist from Mequon who was "happiest hunting or fishing in northern Wisconsin or Canada," said Gary Zimmer of the Ruffed Grouse Society. Zimmer noted Uihlein as one of the earliest supporters of the RGS, which was formed in 1961.

Uihlein was founder and president of the Ruffed Grouse Society chapter in Milwaukee that now bears his name.

Margery H. Uihlein of Mequon, David's widow, as well as her son Gregg Kuehn of Grafton, daughter Kathy Kuehn of Grafton and grandson Andy Kuehn of Fox Point attended the dedication.

"It's a fitting tribute to David," said Margery, who often hunted with her late husband. "I know he would be pleased to see this land being managed to help wildlife."

Margery and David were married from 1965 until his death in 2010. Margery is known as "the best shot in the family," said Gregg Kuehn.

The David V. Uihlein Sr. Ruffed Grouse Management Area is about 4 miles southeast of Crandon. A parking lot and sign is located on Keith Siding Road about 1 mile west of County Highway W.
