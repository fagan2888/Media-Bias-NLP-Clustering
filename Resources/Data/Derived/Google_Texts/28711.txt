Mizzou Protesters Now Segregating Their Members By Race

Blake Neff

In an ironic development, to say the least, protesters at the University of Missouri (MU) segregated themselves by race Wednesday night, having white students leave a gathering in order to create a “black-only healing space.”

Supporters of the group Concerned Students 1950, which has spearheaded the protest movement at MU, assembled at the school’s student center Wednesday night for a meeting after a planned protest march was canceled due to bad weather. And then, according to activist Steve Schmidt, whites were asked to leave:

The seven groups amounted to six breakout groups for black (or at least non-white) students and one for the remaining white students. The deliberately segregated arrangement was confirmed by local reporter Jared Koller, who was there on behalf of local KOMU-TV news:

Johnetta Elzie, a national Black Lives Matter activist who is in Columbia after previously leading protest efforts in Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore, said the focus groups were intended to create a “black-only healing space.”

It’s not totally surprising that Concerned Student 1950 would attempt to create segregated areas as part of its protest movement. After protesters attacked reporters who were attempting to cover the drama Monday at MU, the group attacked “white media” for failing to “understand the importance of respecting black spaces” (though that tweet has since been deleted).
