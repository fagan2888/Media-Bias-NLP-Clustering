Bush\u2019s contentious war in Iraq won Congressional approval.\n\n\u2013 Managing expectations \u2013\n\nThe White House, facing a momentous defeat, has tried hard to lower expectations.\n\nIn public it has long appeared resigned to losing the initial vote, and to the need for a presidential veto.\n\n\u201cOur goal all along has been to build as much support in Congress as we possibly can,\u201d said spokesman Josh Earnest on Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat we have been focused on is building the kind of support that we need in both the House (of Representatives) and the Senate to sustain a presidential veto.\u201d\n\nBut with just two Democrats publicly opposed to the deal \u2014 with a half dozen waverers still undeclared \u2014 the vote in the Senate looks like being tight.\n\nBehind the scenes those in favor of the deal are lobbying furiously to avoid the veto, with campaign donors threatening to withhold future funding.\n\n\u201cA majority in the House for the resolution of disapproval is probably certain,\u201d said Corey Boles, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group.\n\n\u201cIt is an open question whether opponents of the deal will be able to muster the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to advance the measure.\u201d\n\nRepublicans need the support of a total of six Senate Democrats to pass a resolution against the deal.\n\nSo far they have won over two \u2014 New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer and New Jersey\u2019s Bob Menendez.\n\nThe White House needs 41 votes to forestall the resolution, and just 34 Senate votes to uphold Obama\u2019s veto.\n\nSo far 28 Democrats have declared their support for the deal.\n\n\u201cForty-one is definitely possible,\u201d said Jamal Abdi of the National Iranian American Council, which has been lobbying fiercely in favor of the agreement.\n\n\u201cA number of important swing votes have broken our way. The opposition still needs to find four more Democrats to cross lines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf I were them I would be sweating now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/President-Barack-Obama-thumbs-up-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "More legislators signal support for Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "The White House needs 41 votes to forestall the resolution, and just 34 Senate votes to uphold Obama\u2019s veto.\n\u2013 Managing expectations \u2013The White House, facing a momentous defeat, has tried hard to lower expectations.\nBut, with 15 Senate Democrats backing the deal in as many days \u2014 including Senate minority leader Harry Reid and Michigan\u2019s Debbie Stabenow on Monday \u2014 the White House may dodge a political bullet.\nA \u2018no\u2019 vote next month would not be enough to scupper the whole nuclear agreement \u2014 thanks to Obama\u2019s veto power \u2014 but it could foreshadow trouble ahead.\nSo far 28 Democrats have declared their support for the deal."}
