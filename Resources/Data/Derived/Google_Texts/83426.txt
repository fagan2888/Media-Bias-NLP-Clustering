KALAMAZOO (WKZO-AM) -- Application councilors with Enroll Kalamazoo have begun their tour of Kalamazoo County, trying to get people signed up for Affordable Care Act healthcare coverage before a deadline next month.

Dec. 15 is the last day to enroll if you want healthcare coverage to start Jan. 1st.

Enroll Kalamazoo representative Amy Terry says Healthcare.gov is more user-friendly this year, but, generally speaking, the sign-up process has changed little.

"The thing that's new this year, though, is people who did not reconcile their taxes, they will lose their tax credits unless they go back into the system."

The group held the first of nine enrollment events Thursday at the Portage Public Library.

They say around 35,000 residents last year signed up for Obamacare, either through the exchange or through an expansion in medicaid. People without insurance in 2016 can expect a $695 tax penalty.
