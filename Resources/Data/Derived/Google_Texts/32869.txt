Four men have been arrested in connection to a shooting in south Wichita that left a 21-year-old woman with serious injuries.

Officers were monitoring Norma's Cafe at Lincoln and Broadway when they heard several gunshots at around 2:30 a.m. Officers then tried to stop a vehicle that left the scene at a high rate of speed.

After a brief pursuit, police arrested four men, ages 25, 26, 27 and 28, for drugs and weapons charges. Police said the suspects had thrown several items out of the vehicle, including a weapon.

A 21-year-old woman was found near the after-hours restaurant with a gunshot wound to the arm. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment but is expected to survive.

Wichita Police Sgt. Matt Lang said the area has seen crime in the past. Officers patrol the area more on Friday and Saturday nights, when neighbors say they're most concerned.

Officers heard shots fired in the area. They saw a vehicle speed away from the scene. Several blocks down the road, four suspects were arrested for possible connection to the shooting.

Based on evidence at the scene, Lang said it's possible that two guns were used.
