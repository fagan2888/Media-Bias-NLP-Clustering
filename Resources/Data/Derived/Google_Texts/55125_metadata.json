When will Hillary\u2019s fans on Wall Street take notice?\n\nSure, she walked back the comment once people started laughing.\n\nBut this nonsense \u2014 coming from someone who should know better \u2014 is another sign that, for all the handwringing about the Tea Party and other \u201cextremists\u201d taking over the GOP, it\u2019s the Democratic Party that\u2019s been hijacked, by the left.\n\nFrom President Obama to Warren (the Massachusetts senator who has made a career out of bashing job-creators) to New York City\u2019s very own Comrade Bill de Blasio, the \u201cNew New Democrats\u201d believe entrepreneurs only exist because government has bestowed upon them . . . something, though they never really say what. And exist only in order to feed government with tax dollars.\n\nFor these Dems, the fulcrum isn\u2019t the \u201cradical middle\u201d successfully sought out by Hillary\u2019s husband, President Bill Clinton, in the 1990s, but an array of radical interest groups, public-employee unions, environmentalists and other assorted dingbats, joined in support of extremist policies and politics.\n\nThe details of their credo are as stupid as Hillary\u2019s comment: Small businesses can easily pay for big hikes in the minimum wage; large corporations are keeping money and hiring overseas because they\u2019re simply unpatriotic (it has nothing to do with high US corporate taxes); ObamaCare is working great.\n\nThe scary part is, those moderates in the Democratic Party who don\u2019t convert to such idiocies must prepare for the progressives\u2019 wrath, which is why Hillary is now converting with a vengeance.\n\nBut why do major elements in the business community \u2014 a community that has felt the wrath of leftist economic agenda for five years and counting \u2014 continue to shower Hillary Clinton and the Democratic flat-earth society with their love?\n\nAnd I will bet you Hillary\u2019s Wall Street network is assuring the money men that she will still govern as Bill did, from the middle of the pack and with lots of crony-capitalist love for the banks.\n\nAfter all, these cheerleaders \u2014 super bankers Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Larry Fink at Blackrock and Tony James at Blackstone \u2014 know Hillary well.\n\nThose like Blankfein have already shelled out hundreds of thousands to hear her speak since she left the Obama administration. So ignore what she says when you write those checks to her presidential campaign.\n\nMy advice: Look at the video tape, where Hillary\u2019s remarks hardly look like a slip of the lip. They seemed wholly contrived and possibly read from a script, which means she had more than a few moments to think before she spoke. Sorry, she wanted to sound like Warren, to appeal to the party\u2019s lunatic-fringe base.\n\nAfter all, that fringe is a bigger, more powerful part of the Democratic Party than ever before \u2014 something Blankfein, Fink (who\u2019d love to be Treasury secretary under Hillary) and James have yet to fully appreciate.\n\nThey\u2019re figuring that Obama and his jihad against business is an anomaly, that Hillary will restore the order of Clintonism once she gets into the White House.\n\nThe problem there is, a President Hillary Clinton would still have to contend with the new Democratic Powers That Be, including Warren, the new darling of her party, who wants to crush Clinton\u2019s buddies at Goldman.\n\nAnd she\u2019ll need to honor the deals she cuts on the way to the nomination.\n\nWhat will she promise to the unions who\u2019ve made minimum-wage hikes a litmus test for Democrats, even though every credible economic study shows that they also kill jobs?\n\nTo the environmentalists, who hate fracking and every other real source of energy, and don\u2019t give a damn about jobs or energy prices?\n\nI\u2019ve asked press people for Blankfein, Fink and James for comments on Hillary\u2019s job-creation remarks; they haven\u2019t responded. And to be fair, firms like Goldman have been giving more, overall, to Republicans than to Democrats in recent years.\n\nBut the Clintons are still Wall Street\u2019s first love. After all, they deregulated banks while they wined and dined with the financial fat-cat club. And now they\u2019re back to pursuing their manifest destiny to return to the White House and show us all how governing is really done.\n\nMemo to Lloyd, Larry and Tony: Before you start writing those big checks and twisting arms to get others to join the fun, take a look. This isn\u2019t Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic Party anymore.
