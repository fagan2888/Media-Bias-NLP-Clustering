But is Iran facing a similarly hardline atmosphere that\u2019s making progress difficult to achieve?\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei speaks at a public gathering at his residence in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2015. Khamenei said Wednesday the United States cannot be trusted to lift sanctions in a future nuclear deal and that Tehran should instead develop an \u201ceconomy of resistance.\u201d A portrait of the late revolutionary founder Ayatollah Khomeini hangs in background. Photo: Office of Ali Khamenei\n\nThe Iran nuclear negotiations are set to commence again in Geneva on Jan. 18, against the backdrop of a newly elected and hostile U.S. Congress.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mark Kirk from Illinois told Fox News in late December that new sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran will be one of the top priorities for the 114th Congress, which commenced work on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, on Dec. 30, the U.S. Department of Treasury added six people and three entities to the Specially Designated Nationals List for violating terms of the current sanctions regime on the Islamic Republic.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nWith this political climate on the United States\u2019 end, it\u2019s worth asking: What\u2019s going on in Iran?\n\nThe president and terms of an agreement\n\nOn Sunday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened to hold a public referendum on key economic issues. At an economic conference in Tehran, he specifically referenced the nuclear negotiations, and pushed back against hardliner politicians in the country, such as those from the Steadfastness Front that follow Ayatollah Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, who is opposed to democracy and in favor of absolute clerical rule.\n\nAl-Monitor quoted Rouhani as saying at the conference:\n\n\u201cUntil when should our economy subsidize our policies? It subsidizes both our foreign and domestic policies. Let\u2019s reverse this relationship for one decade. Let\u2019s have our foreign policy subsidize our economy, and let\u2019s see what happens to the people, their livelihood and the employment of their youth. Let\u2019s ask the people.\u201d\n\nWhile news outlets around the world focused on Rouhani\u2019s referendum threat, Farideh Farhi, a professor of political science at the University of Hawai\u2019i at Manoa, told MintPress News that the most interesting point in Rouhani\u2019s speech was not the referendum, but his mentioning a middle ground for resolving the nuclear negotiations.\n\nReferring to Rouhani saying, \u201cOur ideal is not attached to a centrifuge, our ideal is connected to the mind, heart, and will, is not attached to a centrifuge,\u201d Farhi said Rouhani is \u201cmaking the argument that \u2018we [Iran] shouldn\u2019t be stuck on this issue of enrichment, and the number of centrifuges.\u201d\n\nThe nuclear negotiations are currently centered on Iran\u2019s future enrichment capabilities, including the number of centrifuges it uses to enrich uranium \u2014 a focus which has resulted in a stalemate.\n\nTalks were postponed on Nov. 24, after the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S.) and the Islamic Republic of Iran failed to come to a comprehensive agreement following the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA), which was created on Nov. 24, 2013. The JPOA was extended until July 1, 2015.\n\nUnder the terms of the extension of the JPOA, Iran will continue to convert its 20 percent enriched uranium powder into fuel plates, which are less of a threat in terms of the creation of a nuclear weapon. It will also limit research and development, and give the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) greater access to its centrifuge production sites, which should \u201cprevent Iran from refining and mass-producing more efficient machines that could allow it to move more quickly to enrich material for weapons purposes,\u201d according to the Arms Control Association.\n\nThe P5+1, in return, will temporarily suspend specific U.S. and EU sanctions for Iran\u2019s trading of precious metals and petrochemicals, as well as sanctions on its automotive industry, which includes \u201cthe sale, supply, or transfer to Iran of goods\u2026 and services\u2026 used in connection with the automotive sector.\u201d Both the government and the people of Iran will also be able to import humanitarian goods, pay the medical expenses and student fees of some Iranians living abroad, and access some $4.2 billion in frozen assets.\n\nThe P5+1 has also committed to not passing any new nuclear-related sanctions as long as negotiations continue.\n\nAyatollah Khamenei, the minister of foreign affairs, and parliament\n\nMeanwhile, on Jan. 1, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, was summoned to a meeting in Iran\u2019s parliament, where he was asked about the negotiations.\n\nSome of the members of parliament (MPs) were reportedly concerned about his intentions as Iran\u2019s chief representative in the negotiations, and whether he was using his position for domestic political gain. In response to these allegations, Zarif said that \u201cfactionalizing\u201d foreign policy pursuits for political status was an \u201cunforgivable sin.\u201d He defended himself and the country by explaining that the nuclear discussions have enabled the foreign ministry to project an \u201cinteractive, stable and powerful\u201d image of Iran which has made the country more secure, according to the Tehran Times.\n\nHardliner MPs at the question and answer session asked about Zarif\u2019s negotiation tactics and his relationships in direct talks with the U.S. in an attempt to discredit his actions, explained Farhi. However, such questioning came from a relative minority, and the MPs were generally approving of his, and Rouhani\u2019s, efforts in the nuclear talks.\n\n\u201cSupport for negotiations remains strong [in Iran] even though the results have not necessarily been what they wanted, and that the U.S. is asking for too much and giving too little,\u201d Farhi said.\n\nShe described the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2019s role as \u201cextremely instrumental\u201d toward the continuation of the talks.\n\n\u201cWhen hardliners\u2019 criticisms began to pick up, he came in and said, \u2018These are children of the revolution and they\u2019re doing their best. And whatever is not working, it\u2019s not because of them, it\u2019s because of what\u2019s going on in the United States,\u2019\u201d Farhi explained.\n\nZarif answered a total of seven questions posed by 40 lawmakers. In a follow-up vote-of-confidence, 125 MPs voted in favor of him, 86 voted against, eight did not express a preference and 10 abstained.\n\nA debate\n\nFarhi explained that Iran is currently undergoing a public and official debate about the nature of the nuclear program and the country\u2019s relationship with Western powers.\n\nPeople have started coming forward to openly question the nuclear program as an energy program.\n\nIn December, the University of Tehran had an uproarious conference in which the panelists \u2013 Sadeg Zibakalam, Ahmad Shirzad and Davoud Hermidas-Bavand \u2013 bravely criticized the country\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nAhmad Shirzad, a nuclear physicist at Isfahan University of Technology and a former MP from the 2000s, said, \u201cDuring that time in parliament, I said that no water will come from the nuclear well. \u2026 Not even a glass of water,\u201d reported Al-Monitor.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me why the country went in a nuclear direction, I have to answer that I do not know,\u201d he continued.\n\nShirzad is also reported to have said that Iran does not have the technological capability to operate a nuclear program.\n\nAnother critic of the program at the conference was Sadegh Zibakalam, a political science professor at the University of Tehran, who said the economic consequences of the nuclear program have been more devastating to the country than the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.\n\nLikewise, Davoud Hermidas-Bavand, a professor of international relations at Allameh Tabatabaei University in Tehran, said, \u201cOn the nuclear issue, the process of resistance against bullying went in a direction that in the long run, reduced other inalienable rights. Every time the negotiations end without a resolution, it results in new sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe reformist voices were sharply denounced and threatened by hardline factions within Iran\u2019s government and media, while citizens engaged in the discussion \u2014 both for or against \u2014 online and in chat rooms.\n\nHowever, Farhi says their criticisms are not what is important. What is important, and what makes her \u201cnot hopeless\u201d about prospects for a deal, is that a debate is happening at all. She says it signals that among Iranian society there is some hope for reconciliation around the nuclear issue.\n\nRouhani\u2019s idea to have a referendum was not a threat, she explained. It was a \u201chint\u201d to the hardliners that the population wants some sort of resolution to the nuclear issue. \u201cThey are not necessarily that hung up on the idea of \u2018honor,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe United States\n\nMeanwhile, back in the U.S., the all too familiar sounds of the drums of war beating for Iran can be heard from powerful government officials and the country\u2019s preeminent news publications.\n\nJohn Hannah, national security adviser to former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, wrote an article for Foreign Policy on Monday, titled, \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Pursue Regime Change in Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently out of favor in many circles, regime change has a proven track record in helping put a number of bad actors out of the nuclear weapons business,\u201d Hannah wrote.\n\n\u201cFor all the subsequent problems that may have flowed from Operation Iraqi Freedom, the removal of Saddam\u2019s regime put to rest forever the legitimate fear that the \u2018Butcher of Baghdad\u2019 would one day find a way of getting his hands on the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons.\u201d\n\nYet his assessment overlooks the fact that Iraq and surrounding countries may be experiencing a fate far worse than a nuclear bomb, as a result of the U.S. excursion into the country.\n\nJuan Cole, professor of History at the University of Michigan, wrote in June that the rise of ISIS in Iraq is \u201can indictment of the George W. Bush administration, which falsely said it was going into Iraq because of a connection between al-Qaeda and Baghdad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIronically, by invading, occupying, weakening and looting Iraq, Bush and Cheney brought al-Qaeda into the country and so weakened it as to allow it actually to take and hold territory in our own time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our new Congress isn\u2019t warm to the notion of easing sanctions against Iran. is Iran facing a similar atmosphere that\u2019s making progress difficult to achieve?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sean Nevins", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Our new Congress isn\u2019t warm to the notion of easing sanctions against Iran. is Iran facing a similar atmosphere that\u2019s making progress difficult to achieve?", "title": "Forecasting 2015\u2019s Iran Nuclear Talks: From the Eyes of Tehran", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/forecasting-2015s-iran-nuclear-talks-eyes-tehran/200635/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP155585154044.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-13T08:37:05-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our new Congress isn\u2019t warm to the notion of easing sanctions against Iran. is Iran facing a similar atmosphere that\u2019s making progress difficult to achieve?", "creator": "@seannevins", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP155585154044.jpg", "title": "Forecasting 2015\u2019s Iran Nuclear Talks: From the Eyes of Tehran", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "Sanctions", "published_time": "2015-01-10T05:00:51-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-13T08:37:05-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Forecasting 2015\u2019s Iran Nuclear Talks: From the Eyes of TehranThe U.S. just installed a Republican Congress which isn\u2019t warming up to the notion of easing sanctions against Iran.\nPhoto: Office of Ali KhameneiThe Iran nuclear negotiations are set to commence again in Geneva on Jan. 18, against the backdrop of a newly elected and hostile U.S. Congress.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei speaks at a public gathering at his residence in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2015.\nShirzad is also reported to have said that Iran does not have the technological capability to operate a nuclear program.\nHowever, such questioning came from a relative minority, and the MPs were generally approving of his, and Rouhani\u2019s, efforts in the nuclear talks."}
