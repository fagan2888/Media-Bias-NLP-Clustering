On Nov. 20, 2013 as Fox News commentator Brit Hume's photo with his anti-Obamacare quote is steadily going viral, a Twitter attack on Hume is going largely unnoticed. An Obama Twitter defender who targeted Hume's integrity with accusations that Brit had wrongly predicted a win for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, was promptly set right by Hume.

The heated exchange began following a Hume tweet of a Weekly Standard link that Fred Barnes "diagnoses POTUS political condition. Hint: not good." That's all it took for chimezie ‏@iloanya1 to fire back: "Yes just like all you guys diagnosed and predicted a Romney landslide."

Fox News' Megyn Kelly GQ 'Hot Mama' never slept with Brit Hume

Schooling his distractor, Hume took issue with the fact that Hume had ever made a prediction about the election. Unfortunately for Hume, engaging the debate only caused his Twitter foe to escalate his tirade:

Brit Hume: Please cite me one instance where I said Romney would win the general election, let alone by a landslide. Just one.

chimezie ‏: like my last tweet said..You believed the Dick Morris, Gallup predictions as true..my point is u guys underestimate Obama always

Brit Hume ‏: So having falsely represented what I actually said, you are now claiming you can read my mind. You can't even read my words.

Whether "Chimezie" was enraged about what he could read, the quote from Brit Hume which read, "Insure the uninsured. Effect of Obamacare to date: Uninsure the insured," or not, the Obama defender wasn't ready to give up the fight. Chimezie moved in for the kill, responding, "whether u said it is semantics..you believed it cause that's what you wanted anyway." (Flashback: Brit Hume calls Obama an imposter, says he 'was not a real person')

That last comment rendered Hume speechless; because, after all, if Chimezie's comment spoke for itself and perhaps for thousands of other Obama defendersof the same ilk -- what could Brit add?
