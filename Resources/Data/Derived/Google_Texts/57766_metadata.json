Needless to say, he didn\u2019t win.\n\nBut Redlich is back in the news getting publicity for his method of dealing with police DUI checkpoints in Florida (where he lives now) while protecting one\u2019s constitutional rights. It\u2019s getting him attention from USA Today and the Associated Press, and a video he posted showing his method in action has gotten more than two million views on YouTube.\n\nHis method is fairly simple. Display your driver\u2019s license and proof of insurance in a plastic sleeve along with a flyer saying you remain silent, refuse search requests, and want a lawyer, among other things. Then hang them outside the fully closed driver\u2019s side window and approach the checkpoint. Then the driver has to commit to not speaking or rolling down the window, so as not to give police any sort of opening to say they smelled alcohol or that the driver slurred his or her words.\n\nSome police are, of course, not happy about this system. From the Associated Press:\n\nPolice across Florida have seen the video. A spokeswoman for a large metro police agency says Gray's experience at the checkpoint doesn't mean the no-talk tactic is legitimate. \"He was allowed to proceed because he clearly was not driving while intoxicated,\" said Veda Coleman-Wright, spokeswoman for the Broward Sheriff's Office. \"If those officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver was impaired, they would have investigated further.\"\n\nWell yes, but Redlich\u2019s system makes it harder for police to just fabricate a reason, which is his declared goal. He pointed out in a video to the Associated Press that this method is complex enough and requires enough patience and discipline to make it hard for actual drunken drivers to replicate.\n\nRedlich has a site here with the flyer, specifically designed for use in Florida.
