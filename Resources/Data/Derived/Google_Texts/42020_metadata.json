But the officials said that past experience with other federal programs has led them to believe that there is a whole underworld of fraud about to be unleashed when Obamacare comes online Oct. 1.\n\nTo show just how bad the administration expects the situation to be, consider what\u2019s being put in place to fight Obamacare fraud: a call center will have trained staff to take consumer complaints; the Obamacare website will connect consumers with the FTC\u2019s complaint center; a \u201crapid response mechanism\u201d will be established to sniff out privacy and cybersecurity threats; and a new public education campaign will be established to help consumers avoid scams.\n\nThe biggest issue the administration seems to fear is identity theft. Most Obamacare consumers will have to supply health, financial and personal information. Congress is currently checking to make sure that the federal data system is protected and can\u2019t be hacked. But that won\u2019t help consumers who are tricked into going into fraudulent Obamacare health insurance sites.\n\n\"At the FTC, we know all too well how scammers invariably try to take advantage of developments in the marketplace and new government programs,\" said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in the statement from HHS. \"We will be vigilant as always in cracking down on this type of opportunistic fraud.\"\n\nPaul Bedard, The Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With just 12 days before the president\u2019s new national health insurance program kicks in, the White House is warning that Obamacare users could face massive fraud, theft of their personal financial and health information, and even \u201ccybersecurity threats.\u201d\nThe problem is so serious that the administration held an 11th hour summit at the White House today to kick off a joint federal-state anti-fraud effort that will include building a whole new bureaucracy to handle consumer complaints and educate Americans about the anticipated Obamacare scams in the works.\n\u201cToday, we are sending a clear message that we will not tolerate anyone seeking to defraud consumers in the Health Insurance Marketplace,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in a statement issued after the summit. \u201cWe have strong security safeguards in the marketplace to protect people\u2019s personal information against fraud and we will work with our partners to aggressively prosecute bad actors, just as we have been doing in Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\u201d", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Washington Examiner.
