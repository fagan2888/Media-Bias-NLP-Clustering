Now, PBMs are an impenetrable barrier between drug makers, doctors, and pharmacists. PBMs decide which drugs will be covered by insurance, how much they\u2019ll cost, and how much pharmacies will make. They have the clout to dump medications that aren\u2019t profitable to them, denying patient access. One-half to two-thirds of a typical prescription\u2019s cost can go to PBMs.\n\nPBMs own a large share of the online pharmacies, and have a considerable interest in the mega-pharmacies. They also dictate which products drug manufacturers to produce, how much to produce, and how much they\u2019ll get paid.\n\nThis kind of power was given to PBMs just a few short years after the three largest PBMs faced six major court cases over allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, unjust enrichment through secret kickback schemes\u2014as well as failure to meet ethical and safety standards. All three PMBs settled with the plaintiffs. Their damages totaled hundreds of millions.\n\nObamacare gives big tax breaks to and few regulations for PBMs. As a result, the PBMs have become a darling of Wall Street. CVS Caremark is the largest PBM in the U.S. Their stock prices since the 1970s are shown below.\n\nThe greatest cost of the power wielded by PBMs, however, may be the human cost. The financial burden of these secretive PBMs will be borne by the elderly, the sick, businesses, and as always, the taxpayers.\n\nPBMs have used their power to decide what each pharmacy pays for their drug supplies and how much they can charge, putting a harsh squeeze on the little guys\u2014the 23,000 independent community pharmacies. These independent neighborhood pharmacies still account for 40 percent of prescriptions filled\u2014an $88.7 billion marketplace.\n\nPBMs use their clout to push through regulations that make it nearly impossible for many small and independent pharmacies to survive. Independent community pharmacies have long been a lifeline for many, providing personal care that online and mega pharmacies simply can\u2019t.\n\nBill Bulpin has owned Oak Harbor\u2019s Island Drug on Washington state\u2019s Whidbey Island for 28 years. His philosophy is simple: \u201cLook the customer in the eye, deal with them one-on-one and get to know them by name. Our customers love coming here because we\u2019re like family. We are their service and information center.\u201d\n\nPharmacist Theresa Tolle owns Bay Street Pharmacy in Sebastian, Fla. Bay Street sponsors \u201cStroke of Hope,\u201d a support group for stroke victims and their families.\n\nTolle explains her pharmacy\u2019s benefit to the community\u2019s most vulnerable:\n\nA mom came in who had a sick 4 year old child with acute asthma. The child was on a Medicaid HMO plan which required him to have the nebulizer mailed to his home several days later! (A nebulizer changes liquid medication into a mist for infants and small children, who have difficulty with an inhaler.) So, did I teach this mom how to use an inhaler with her 4 year old? NO! Because I have the autonomy to \u201ccall the shots\u201d as an owner, I donated a nebulizer and nebulizer medications to this family. I greeted a sobbing mom with this news and I had a follow-up call from her pediatrician and a neighbor thanking me! There is nothing more rewarding than simply being able to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d as a business owner! I could not have done that if I was employed by someone else. I am grateful that God has given me this platform in my community to help those in need.\n\nLike many independent pharmacies, Tolle\u2019s faces the challenge of making ends meet. Her income is declining from rising drug costs and lower allowable prices\u2014all decreed by PBMs.\n\nLast year, HR 4577 was introduced in Congress to help the independent pharmacies and their patients by sharing some of the breaks given to the online and mega pharmacies.\n\nAlthough the bill attempts to chip away at the PMBs\u2019 power, its focus is very narrow. Congress has yet to look at the big picture and ask why we need the PMBs. They are transistor radios in a Spotify world, eating up over half of a prescription\u2019s cost.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Thanks to Obamacare, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have become an impenetrable barrier between drug makers, doctors, and pharmacists.", "title": "Obamacare keeps pharmacy middlemen on life support - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/shutterstock_168523664-630x286.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-14T15:31:32+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/192608/obamacare-pbms/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "tag": "ObamaCare,PBMs,pharmacy,Pharmacy Benefit Managers", "published_time": "2015-01-13T12:06:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-14T15:31:32+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Thanks to Obamacare, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have become an impenetrable barrier between drug makers, doctors, and pharmacists.", "title": "Obamacare keeps pharmacy middlemen on life support - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/shutterstock_168523664-630x286.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Thanks to Obamacare, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have become an impenetrable barrier between drug makers, doctors, and pharmacists."}, "article_summary": "They are transistor radios in a Spotify world, eating up over half of a prescription\u2019s cost.\nAlthough the bill attempts to chip away at the PMBs\u2019 power, its focus is very narrow.\nLike many independent pharmacies, Tolle\u2019s faces the challenge of making ends meet.\nLast year, HR 4577 was introduced in Congress to help the independent pharmacies and their patients by sharing some of the breaks given to the online and mega pharmacies.\nPBMs use their clout to push through regulations that make it nearly impossible for many small and independent pharmacies to survive."}
