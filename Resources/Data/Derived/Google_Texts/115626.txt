Researchers have found one more incomplete and unsatisfying explanation for why LGBT people don’t have equal rights: Non-LGBT people just don’t think same-sex couples are “as in love” as heterosexual ones. A study out of Indiana University found that sexual orientation weighs heavily on how loving couples are perceived to be by other people, who tend to place opposite-sex partnerships on a pedestal. This perception, in turn, affects how many formal and informal rights LGBT couples “deserve” as far as the general public is concerned, according to study author Long Doan.

“If you ask what someone thinks of a same-sex couple or what they think of a straight couple, they usually have different images in mind for the same-sex and straight couples,” Doan said. “By taking away those preconceived differences in relationships, we can pinpoint that the differences in perception are due to sexual orientation alone, instead of other factors that complicate the picture like presumed marital status of same-sex and straight couples.”

Doan and his colleagues, Annalise Loehr and Lisa R. Miller, tested their hypothesis by providing participants with the exact same story — a romance — that featured one couple. For each participant, the couples’ names were randomly changed and clearly gendered, to imply that some couples were heterosexual and others homosexual. The researchers found that respondents reacted quite differently to each type of couple: Participants essentially ranked the amount of love partners had for one another hierarchically by sexual orientation, with opposite-sex couples being perceived as “most in love,” followed by same-sex female couples and then same-sex male couples.
