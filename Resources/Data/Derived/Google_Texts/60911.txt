I strapped on my gun belt before leaving the house. I didn’t want to be in violation of the Sovereign Nation of North Carolina’s decree that everyone over 12 had to openly carry. The counterintuitive reasoning was that with everyone displaying a gun, we’d stop shooting each other. It seemed to me that even more people were getting shot, but I couldn’t complain because The Junior NRA Patrol was working the streets and brokering no dissent.
