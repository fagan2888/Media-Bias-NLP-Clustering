But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When asked by CNNs Jake Tapper at the GOP debate on Thursday what he believed was wrong with Donald Trumps vision of the Republican Party, Sen.
