Why? Because the company can charge that much, Eli Lilly\u2019s insulin marketing director said.\n\nBecause it\u2019s an old drug that enjoys the monopoly advantage of being the only version of its kind available, Eli Lilly spent zero additional dollars on research and development related to Humulin. The price increase thus represents a bonanza of pure profit at no extra cost to the company.\n\nDr. Amber Taylor, director of the Diabetes Center at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, told the medical news service MedPage Today about the impact of the hike: \u201cI\u2019ve had patients with a $2,500 deductible who can\u2019t put down $1,200 for a bottle of insulin. \u2026 For them, it\u2019s pay the mortgage or buy my insulin\u2014what do you want me to do?\u201d\n\nMedPage Today asked Eli Lilly why the price on Humulin U-500, which is taken by less than 5 percent of diabetes patients, rose at all. In an article posted Sept. 11, the service reported:\n\nKevin Cammack, senior director of marketing for insulin at Eli Lilly, told MedPage Today that their sales representatives started getting more questions from doctors about U-500 over the last 5 years. As that demand rose, they began to educate all of their representatives about their concentrated insulin. \u201cOur product had been available and its use increased without promotion essentially,\u201d Cammack told MedPage Today. \u201cOnce [physicians] asked enough sales reps about it ... we stepped up and provided more information.\u201d That\u2019s also when the company started to increase the price. Cammack said the per-unit cost was raised to equal that of its regular human insulin, Humulin U-100\u2014hence the equivalent $0.12 per unit of insulin cost for both drugs. \u201cWe felt it was probably appropriate to allow U-500 to be priced the same as other human insulins in the marketplace,\u201d Cammack said.\n\nThe marketing man\u2019s choice of words is marvelous. He doesn\u2019t say, \u201cWe realized we could make more money off of these suffering people, so we did,\u201d but instead, after dutifully \u201cstepping up\u201d to provide physicians with information they needed, and realizing that consumer demand could support a rise in cost, the company \u201cfelt it \u2026 appropriate to allow\u201d the drug to become five times more expensive. How nobly minded, according to the neoliberal view that corporate profits take priority over the health and financial well-being of Americans.\n\nProtecting patients from such harmful manipulations was not a part of the much-lauded (among Democrats) 2010 Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark health insurance legislation. In its report on the hike in the drug price, MedPage Today went on to confirm that there are no regulations prohibiting drug companies from raising prices solely because they can.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of any laws that would prevent a pharmaceutical company from doubling the price of insulin,\u201d Kate Greenwood, a pharmaceutical law expert at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, told the service. \u201cThere are statutes and regulations governing the price that pharmaceutical companies can charge Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs,\u201d but \u201c[t]hese laws do not put a cap on the market price of a drug or drugs.\u201d\n\n\u2014Posted by Alexander Reed Kelly\n\nMore Below the Ad", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, amber taylor, diabetes, diabetes center, eli lily, humulin u 500, insulin, kate greenwood, kevin cammack, medpage today, mercy medical center, neoliberalism, regulation, seton hall university, unregulated capitalism", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Though Humulin has been on the market for many years for a relatively cheap price, a single monthlong dose of the insulin variety  manufactured by Eli Lilly costs $1,200 today\u2014more than five times the amount in 2007.
