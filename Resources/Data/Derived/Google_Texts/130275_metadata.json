I do recall Stewart pummeling the president over the botched ObamaCare rollout. But on the IRS scandal this week, he mocked the tax agency for almost criminal stupidity in losing all those emails\u2014but never questioned whether the Obama administration is engaged in a coverup.\n\nYes, Kurtz actually wrote that. He thinks Jon Stewart should have entertained the possibility that someone in the White House invented a time machine and wrote a bunch of emails in 2011 asking the IT department at the IRS to fix Lois Lerner's crashed hard drive. Maybe it was the same time machine that inserted Obama's birth record in the Honolulu Advertiser in 1961. Or, perhaps, Mission Impossible-like, a crack team of forgers ginned up a bunch of fake emails that just looked like they were from 2011.\n\nLook, I'm not saying that's what's happened. I'm just asking the question. It's what any responsible journalist would do.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Howard Kurtz wants to know.", "title": "Did the White House create a bunch of fake Lois Lerner emails?", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/06/did-white-house-create-bunch-fake-lois-lerner-emails", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Did the White House create a bunch of fake Lois Lerner emails?", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/06/did-white-house-create-bunch-fake-lois-lerner-emails", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Media,Obama", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Howard Kurtz thinks Jon Stewart is going too damn easy on our current president:When it comes to Obama, the humor is gentle.\nOr, perhaps, Mission Impossible-like, a crack team of forgers ginned up a bunch of fake emails that just looked like they were from 2011.\nHe thinks Jon Stewart should have entertained the possibility that someone in the White House invented a time machine and wrote a bunch of emails in 2011 asking the IT department at the IRS to fix Lois Lerner's crashed hard drive.\nMaybe it was the same time machine that inserted Obama's birth record in the Honolulu Advertiser in 1961.\nYes, Kurtz actually wrote that."}
