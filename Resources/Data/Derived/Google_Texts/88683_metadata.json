She\u2019s meeting with an acquaintance, a former drug addict, to get some advice. She\u2019s worried. Her husband, Rob Ford, has recently been elected mayor. She knows this new status is going to put her family under intense scrutiny. Renata doesn\u2019t have many friends, but she met John\u2014not his real name\u2014through someone in her small circle. He\u2019d faced addiction and come through it. She\u2019s hoping he can give her some tips to bring Rob on side. What she doesn\u2019t know is that John is secretly recording the conversation.\n\n\u201cHey, Renata,\u201d John says as she climbs into his front seat.\n\n\u201cYou want a coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nRenata trusts him completely. John steers the conversation into incriminating territory. He brings up Rob.\n\n\u201cHe still thinks he\u2019s going to party,\u201d Renata says. \u201cHe thinks that he, oh, you know, \u2018I\u2019ll get off the pills, but I\u2019m not giving up the blow.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a public figure, for Jesus Christ,\u201d John says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people after him \u2026 that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to be very careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Renata says. \u201cI told him, \u2018Fuck, you could ruin your whole fucking life.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone wants his ass, they\u2019re going to get him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell him that.\u201d\n\nNo one gets her, she says. She\u2019s tried to talk to people before, but they can\u2019t help her. She can\u2019t trust them.\n\n\u201cI got two kids. I\u2019ve gotta, you know, I\u2019ve gotta get this shit together. And like you said, we\u2019re in the public.\u2026 You know, it\u2019s just time. It\u2019s fucking time,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I really appreciate the help.\u201d\n\nJohn gives her some advice about methadone, withdrawal symptoms, and clinics that will be discreet. She thanks him again.\n\n\u201cI can trust you, because I know you\u2019ve gone fucking through it,\u201d she says before heading back to her car.\n\nThis is the other side of Rob Ford\u2019s world, the one that even his most trusted staff didn\u2019t fully know about until the crack cocaine scandal. For two and a half years while running the city, the mayor managed to keep it secret.\n\n*\n\nIt was November 2010, and councillor-elect Jaye Robinson was on her way to meet the mayor-elect. Robinson walked to the west elevator bank at City Hall and pressed 16. The transition team had summoned her. For now, they were working out of the tower offices until David Miller packed up and vacated the mayor\u2019s digs on the second floor. The group was small and mostly made up of familiar faces. There was Nick Kouvalis and Mark Towhey from the campaign. Brother Doug. Two former councillors, Gordon Chong and veteran conservative Case Ootes, former city bureaucrat Claire Tucker-Reid, and a man named Amir Remtulla. Remtulla was the director of government relations for brewing company Molson Coors, but before that he worked as Ootes\u2019s executive assistant at City Hall.\n\nThe transition team\u2019s work would be done by December, but many of its members would take up roles in the new Ford administration.\n\nRobinson was one of fourteen new councillors, although City Hall wasn\u2019t new to her. She\u2019d logged twenty years as a bureaucrat, most notably as the director of events. Many of Toronto\u2019s most treasured cultural initiatives\u2014the Nuit Blanche art festival, the Moose in the City statues, and the culinary event Winterlicious, among others\u2014were Robinson\u2019s work.\n\nThe team was trying to meet all the councillors, both veteran and newly elected. Each had been asked to fill out a form indicating which of the seven standing committees\u2014parks and recreation, economic development, public works, etc.\u2014he or she was interested in joining. The most prestigious was the mayor\u2019s executive committee. Robinson signed up for everything. \u201cI figured, I\u2019m not going to be a city councillor forever. I wanted to roll up my sleeves and get really involved in charting the course of Toronto,\u201d she said.\n\nShe entered a nondescript boardroom on the sixteenth floor. Three people were waiting for her: Rob Ford, Nick Kouvalis, and Doug Ford. She did a double take. Why was the mayor\u2019s brother here? The conversation lasted less than thirty minutes. The mayor-elect barely opened his mouth. Doug Ford, who was \u201cextraordinarily friendly,\u201d did most of the talking. Later, he would turn on her, but that was still two years away.\n\nKouvalis had three questions for Robinson. Would she support privatizing garbage collection in the city\u2019s west side? Would she vote to make the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) an essential service? And would she help kill the vehicle registration tax? \u201cIf you\u2019re comfortable with these three issues,\u201d Kouvalis said, \u201cthen we\u2019re happy to move forward with you being a member of our executive.\u201d\n\nRobinson was thrilled. All three issues had been part of her platform. But now she had a question. If she joined the executive committee, would she be expected to vote with the administration on every matter all the time? She said she couldn\u2019t commit to that. She considered herself an independent centrist. According to Robinson, Kouvalis made it clear that her allegiance was required only on those three issues. Kouvalis flatly denies this. He says every executive member was made aware that they were expected to vote with the administration on every issue. If a mayor couldn\u2019t rely on his team to support him, the agenda would never get passed, Kouvalis explained to me.\n\nCity Hall doesn\u2019t work like other levels of government. Ford would get just one vote on council\u2014one out of forty-five. Unlike in some American cities, the mayor of Toronto doesn\u2019t get to veto policy. The strength of the office is rooted in the individual mayor\u2019s powers of persuasion. On any given issue, Ford would need to woo twenty-two councillors to support him. And that wasn\u2019t necessarily going to be easy. About a third of those elected were hard-core lefties. Another half a dozen identified as centrists, and while the rest leaned right, only about ten were as conservative as the mayor-elect. Ford would need to bridge the vote gap. The mayor\u2019s best bargaining tool was that he got to pick the chairs of each standing committee as well as the members of the all-important executive. City councillors wanted these positions. It gave them profile and power. For members of Team Ford, that power would come at a price.\n\nFrom the outset, the Ford administration took measures to try to ensure that its agenda was supported. Ford staffers began to distribute \u201ccheat sheets\u201d to like-minded councillors, with suggested votes on dozens of issues. Robinson says it got so bad that members of the executive were expected to show solidarity on simple procedural votes, such as whether someone could speak for three or five minutes during a debate. And it wasn\u2019t just executive committee members who felt the administration\u2019s muscle. The mayor\u2019s office frequently used aggressive tactics to bring centrist votes on side. For example, the administration tried to bully Councillor Ana Bail\u00e3o to fall in line by holding up, of all things, the installation of a traffic light she had requested for her ward. Councillor Josh Colle, the leader of the so-called Mighty Middle, said of the tactic, \u201cIf it\u2019s a strategy to sway votes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a productive strategy.\u201d Later in that council meeting, Ford caused problems for a project in Colle\u2019s ward. The mayor relented after the councillor backed Ford\u2019s controversial plan to rip up a major bike lane.\n\nLike Robinson, Councillor Karen Stintz says that when she accepted the TTC chair position, she didn\u2019t think she had signed up for four years of following orders. \u201cNick [Kouvalis] had one question: Would I support making the TTC an essential service? I said, \u2018Yes, sure.\u2019\u201d Stintz didn\u2019t need selling on the broader Ford agenda. She was a stalwart fiscal conservative. Under the previous Miller regime, she had been a leader in a group of centre-right councillors who formed an unofficial opposition called the Responsible Government Group.\n\nFor his part, Councillor Paul Ainslie said he understood right away what he had gotten himself into. \u201cThey talked about running it in a cabinet style,\u201d typical of federal and provincial politics, where members are expected to vote as a bloc. Ainslie was offered the chair of the government management committee and a spot on the executive. He had been shut out from leadership during the Miller years, and now he had a chance to shape policy. He couldn\u2019t pass it up. But not long after he accepted, he received a letter distributed by Ford\u2019s staff to each member of the executive requesting him to pledge support for the Ford agenda. Each of them was to sign and return it immediately. \u201cSome of my colleagues were saying, \u2018Well, wait a second. We\u2019re not a cabinet-style government here. We didn\u2019t run on a Rob Ford ticket. We ran on our own tickets.\u2019\u201d Everyone started asking for amendments, and eventually the pledge was abandoned. But the tone was set.\n\nRobinson now admits she was a bit naive. \u201cI took a huge pay cut to take this job. I wanted to effect change. I thought we were going to do that. Turns out that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\n*\n\nOn one of his last days as mayor-elect, November 29, 2010, Ford unveiled his team. There wasn\u2019t a single left-winger or downtown councillor in the mix, and only two women had made it onto the executive. Both were rookies. In fact, eleven of the twelve councillors represented the former boroughs. David Miller had stacked his executive with enough sympathetic councillors to ensure his agenda would get through, but he was also mindful of geography, gender, and ideology. One conservative and three centrists served on his team, and fewer than half represented wards from pre-amalgamation Toronto.\n\nFord claimed that his approach reflected a new direction. \u201cThis is not about left or right. This is about bringing respect for taxpayers back to City Hall. They\u2019re hard-working, they understand customer service, and that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d the mayor-elect told reporters as his de facto caucus looked on. Doug Holyday would be deputy mayor; Karen Stintz, chair of the TTC. Suburban councillor Frances Nunziata was Ford\u2019s choice for council speaker. And the comically cantankerous Mike Del Grande, a right-winger from Scarborough, would be budget chief.\n\nCase Ootes said the transition team felt it was important to have \u201cunanimous support\u201d for the mayor\u2019s agenda. Former mayor David Miller might have had a few more centrist councillors, Ootes said, but he didn\u2019t invite any staunch conservatives onto his team either.\n\n\u201cThe mayor was elected on a platform to end the gravy train. The overwhelming majority of people wanted an end to the spending that was happening under Miller. The councillors on Ford\u2019s executive reflected that. Why would you put a guy like Adam Vaughan on the executive committee?\u201d Ootes said. Vaughan, a former journalist, was a downtown councillor and one of Ford\u2019s most passionate critics.\n\n\u201cWe did take into consideration male\u2013female representation and tried to balance that out in some form or another\u2014like Karen Stintz with the TTC\u2014and that was a challenge, because, as you know, there are more men on council than women,\u201d especially on the right, Ootes said.\n\nWith his team in place, Rob Ford used his first press conference as mayor to kill one of the pillars of Miller\u2019s legacy, Transit City. At a cost of $8.15 billion, and seven years in the making, this massive transit expansion plan was funded almost entirely by the province, apart from one arm of light rail in Scarborough, where the federal government was kicking in $330 million. The network relied heavily on above-ground light rail trains, or LRTs. Where subways cost $300 million per kilometre to build, above-ground LRTs come at a bargain $100 million per kilometre. But in Rob Ford\u2019s Toronto, the car reigned supreme, and anything that slowed drivers was bad.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the war on the car stops today,\u201d Ford said. \u201cWe will not build any more rail tracks down the middle of our streets.\u201d He called TTC general manager Gary Webster and instructed him to halt work on Transit City and start investigating how to build subways.\n\nThe new chair of the TTC was incredulous. Karen Stintz didn\u2019t believe the administration actually intended on ripping the whole thing up. \u201cIn my mind, we would kill Transit City, which was a David Miller plan, and rebrand it something else that was the Ford plan,\u201d she said. Scrapping the whole project wasn\u2019t financially prudent, and perhaps not even possible. The provincial transit agency, Metrolinx, had already spent $137 million on the project and signed a $770-million contract for the trains. Subways require high population densities to ensure sufficient ridership to pay back some of the increased costs, and many areas, particularly in Scarborough, didn\u2019t have the densities to support one. Most significantly, the Fords had no idea how to pay for it. Stintz thought killing off Transit City was just political showboating from a new mayor eager to demonstrate his authority.\n\nDuring the election, once it became apparent Rob Ford might win, some left-wingers warned he would never be able to govern. \u201cThis man can\u2019t even convince five people to vote with him. So if disaster happens and voters are sucked into this tale, the other members of council will steer the ship,\u201d progressive councillor Pam McConnell told me at the time.\n\nBut at the first meeting of city council in mid-December 2010, Ford proved his critics wrong. He scored a trio of quick victories with votes to spare. Council voted 39\u20136 to repeal the vehicle registration tax, 28\u201317 to make the TTC an essential service (the Ontario government had to approve of the change, which it did), and 40\u20135 to reduce councillors\u2019 office budgets from $50,445 to $30,000.\n\nThe momentum kept up in the New Year with his first budget. As promised, Ford balanced the books without service reductions or tax increases. \u201cThis is the beginning of a new era,\u201d he boasted. In truth, the mayor\u2019s maiden budget was an unexceptional, stay-the-course document that relied, ironically, on surpluses from the Miller years. Partly acknowledging this, Ford cautioned that the real hunt for waste, or \u201cgravy,\u201d as he had memorably called it during the election, would start in March. The city was going to hire outside experts to comb through each department searching for efficiencies. They would leave \u201cno stone unturned,\u201d and if managers pushed back, \u201cthen we will have to find new managers.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the Ford administration looked well-organized and professional. Pull back the curtain, and it was a different story. Stintz caught her first glimpse during budget discussions. The mayor\u2019s office had signed off on a ten-cent fare increase, so the TTC built its numbers around that revenue. Then, the night before the budget announcement, Kouvalis phoned. \u201cThe mayor doesn\u2019t want a fare increase,\u201d he told Stintz. \u201cGo figure it out.\u201d Officials spent the night altering months of work by hand. There would be no increase.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rob Ford may be the world's most infamous mayor. How did he melt down in public?
