Nowadays, we must also beware of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bill de Blasio.\n\nThe unholy trinity comprises the leaders of the Democratic Liars Club. Whether born or convicted, the president of the United States, his would-be successor and the mayor of New York are, to borrow a phrase, \u201cpeople of the lie.\u201d\n\nThis is not to accuse them of being merely imperfect humans. It is to say they are chronically dishonest and concoct such significant lies that they deserve zero public trust.\n\nThe latest clincher is the admission of a top White House aide that much about the Iranian nuclear deal was a fabrication sold to a lazy, gullible press corps. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes boasts that most reporters were too dumb to know or care they were being misled.\n\n\u201cThe average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns,\u201d Rhodes told The New York Times. \u201cThey literally know nothing.\u201d\n\nHe said that much of what passed for independent analysis of Iran in the media was a regurgitation of White House talking points. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he gloated. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\n\nRhodes thus joins the infamous Jonathan Gruber, the administration insider caught conceding that ObamaCare was designed to exploit the \u201cstupidity of the American voter.\u201d If people understood the plain meaning, Gruber said, the law would not have survived.\n\nThe twin admissions mean Obama\u2019s self-described legacy accomplishments \u2014 the Iran deal and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 are fraudulent to the core. Even worse, Obama himself led the charge for both scams, insisting that anyone who opposed the Iran deal wanted war, and that under ObamaCare, \u201cyou can keep your doctor.\u201d\n\nThe implications are enormous and resolve any doubts that Obama is a con man in a league of his own. Instead of getting the Nobel Peace Prize, he is worthy of the Joseph Goebbels Award for proving Goebbels\u2019 claim that \u201cif you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, both the Iran deal and ObamaCare will outlast Obama\u2019s term and do lasting damage to America, and in the case of Iran, the whole world. They make Watergate look like amateur hour.\n\nThese Democrats are chronically dishonest and concoct such significant lies that they deserve zero public trust.\n\nThe admissions bring new clarity to the stakes of Clinton\u2019s bid for a third Obama term. Already distrusted by the vast majority of Americans for career-long duplicity, her election would signal that the nation no longer values integrity and is willing to be lied to again and again.\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s charisma and appeals to a historic presidency blinded many Americans, there can be no excuses for electing Clinton. Her track record of dishonesty is matched by fresh evidence that she is beyond hope of change.\n\nIt is a reflection of Washington\u2019s hollowed-out morals, and Obama\u2019s personal corruption, that Clinton has not been charged in the email scandal. Her failure to protect national-security secrets make her unfit for any office, yet millions of Americans are ready to entrust her with their well-being and safety.\n\nAs for Mayor de Blasio\u2019s misconduct, it has not risen to such corrosive destructiveness, but that\u2019s only because his office limits his opportunities. But as the hydra-headed scandals swallowing his mayoralty suggest, he has rarely missed an opportunity to deceive the public by saying one thing and doing another.\n\nThe latest report has the feds investigating his 2013 campaign, which comes on top of probes focused on possible financial shenanigans in 2014, 2015 and this year. In short, much of his career is suspected of being one long crime wave.\n\nLike his pals in the Democratic Liars Club, de Blasio fights truth with imaginary victimization. \u201cHow convenient that when we\u2019re doing a lot of work to help everyday people, there\u2019s all sorts of efforts being made to obscure that work,\u201d he said of the probes.\n\nThat disinformation echoes Obama\u2019s nasty tendency to accuse dissenters of ignorance and corruption or, when that fails, racism. Clinton, of course, retreats behind charges of sexism and, when that fails, claims to spot a vast right-wing conspiracy.\n\nIn fact, there is a conspiracy. It comprises monstrous lies told not only against the truth, but also against the very soul of America.\n\nEchoes of \u2018The Ronald\u2019\n\nThe candidate \u201cknew what the sophisticates and elites did not \u2014 that the American people were thirsting for leadership and to be told that it was OK to cherish their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe passage sounds like every postmortem on Donald Trump\u2019s march through the Republican primaries. In truth, it was written about Ronald Reagan\u2019s quest for the 1976 nomination.\n\nIt comes from Craig Shirley\u2019s 2005 book, \u201cReagan\u2019s Revolution,\u201d and pinpoints the Gipper\u2019s losing \u201976 campaign against Gerald Ford as the foundation of the world-changing success that followed.\n\nI am not making a case that Trump is the second coming of Reagan, yet they share the distinction of stoking the enthusiasm of the party\u2019s rank-and-file despite powerful internal resistance. Reagan was regarded by top Republicans such as Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater as a dangerous simpleton. #NeverReagan would have been their hashtag.\n\nWorse things are said about Trump, and defectors include the 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, and some GOP senators. House Speaker Paul Ryan says he\u2019s not ready to endorse Trump, and both former Presidents Bush may not support him.\n\nThe resistance seems genuine and can be respected on one condition: that the dissenters acknowledge they are playing with fire.\n\nBecause the next president likely will be either Trump or Hillary Clinton, it is irresponsible for Republican leaders to say, as Romney and Jeb Bush have done, that they will vote for neither. Those who stay home could be helping elect Clinton.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some of those huffing and puffing the loudest actually prefer Clinton. Under her, they would keep their seats at the elites\u2019 table, while Trump will disrupt their comfort and turn over the table.\n\nIn his own way, that\u2019s exactly what Reagan did, and it saved the country and the party.\n\nRockets (& blame) loom for Israel\n\nWith Israel and Hamas exchanging military fire across the Gaza border, two things seem certain. Another summer war is brewing, and Israel will be blamed.\n\nNever mind that Hamas fired first and is stockpiling weapons and digging tunnels. Scapegoating Jews is a vile habit the world refuses to kick.\n\nCrossing potty lines\n\nColor me confused. The Justice Department accuses North Carolina of violating the civil rights of transgender people because a new law requires everybody to use public bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nHow is that discrimination? The same law applies to everybody. Isn\u2019t that the essence of equal rights?", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The old warning to beware of lies, damned lies and statistics deserves an update.
