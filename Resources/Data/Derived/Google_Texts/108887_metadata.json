It is: If you price labor too high -- pay workers more than they produce -- businesses will slow or stop hiring. They won\u2019t sponsor their own bankruptcy.\n\nEveryone knows that Europe\u2019s economy is in the doldrums. Growth in the eurozone (the 19 countries using the euro) is weak; in the second quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) advanced a modest 0.3 percent compared with the previous quarter.\n\nEurozone unemployment is 11.1 percent, barely down from the peak of about 12 percent. This contrasts with the United States, where the jobless rate has dropped from 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.3 percent now.\n\nThe standard explanation for the lackluster performance is \u201ctoo much austerity.\u201d Demand is held back by misguided efforts to curb budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. No doubt this plays a role. Joblessness varies. In Germany, July unemployment was 4.7 percent; in France and Italy, it was 10.2 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the whole story. In a fascinating article in the latest \u201cJournal of Economic Perspectives,\u201d economist Christian Thimann \u2014 a former top adviser at the European Central Bank and now at the French investment bank AXA \u2014 argues that Europe\u2019s debt crisis and the weak recovery both stem from high wage and compensation costs.\n\n\u201cJobs fail to be created in a number of [eurozone] countries not because of a \u2018lack of demand\u2019 as often claimed,\u201d Thimann writes,\u201d but mainly because wage costs are high relative to productivity, social insurance and tax burdens are heavy, and the business environment is excessively burdensome.\u201d\n\nIf the costs of new workers exceed the likely benefits in higher sales and profits, companies will hire less or not at all. Thimann shows that in many countries wage gains far outstripped productivity increases \u2014 output per worker. From 1999 (the year the euro was introduced) to 2008, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece increased nominal wages an average of 40 percent compared with real productivity gains of only 7 percent.\n\nIn these countries, consumers\u2019 purchasing power strengthened but profit margins eroded, and their appeal as locations for new investment \u2014 based on production costs \u2014 weakened.\n\nMeanwhile, other countries in the eurozone (most prominently, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria) gained competitiveness, as their gaps between wages and productivity gains were much smaller. Europe\u2019s trade became skewed, as the more competitive countries swung into surplus and the less competitive countries fell into deficit. These lopsided trade flows were unsustainable, Thimann argues, and drove Europe\u2019s distress.\n\nOvercoming this requires reducing \u2014 or eliminating \u2014 the high labor costs that discourage job creation, new investment and trade imbalances, he says. But he\u2019s skeptical that this will soon occur. A big obstacle is that \u201cthere are different economic models across eurozone countries, reflecting different social preferences and institutional frameworks.\u201d Dictating unpopular changes to countries is hard. The European Union, he writes, has trouble overriding national values, traditions and budget policies. (For proof, see Greece.)\n\nWhatever happens in Europe, we should not ignore the implications for the United States. Because the federal budget is already running large deficits, it\u2019s tempting to load the costs of social policies onto business. We\u2019ve increasingly been doing so. The Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) requires firms to provide health insurance for workers; a $15 minimum wage would raise labor costs sharply for many firms; and there are proposals mandating paid maternity and sick leave.\n\nAll these seem worthy causes, but we need to be alert to unintended consequences. If we make hiring too expensive, there will be less hiring. That\u2019s one lesson from Europe. Another is that once political and economic commitments are made, they are hard to withdraw, even if they have adverse long-term side effects. What\u2019s temporarily pleasurable could become permanently painful.\n\nRead the original article on The Washington Post. Copyright 2015.
