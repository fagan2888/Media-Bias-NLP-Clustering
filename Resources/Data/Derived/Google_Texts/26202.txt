Some Commodores were digging for history in Panama City.

Students from Gulf Coast State College's "Introduction to Archaeology" course were out at the site of the demolished Edgewater Hotel in downtown Panama City Saturday.

They were searching for historic and prehistoric items such as pottery or fossils. One student was excited for the opportunity to get out into the field for the first time.

This is excellent. This is a chance for us to get experience in our field, and I am very excited about that. It's a great opportunity for us to get in touch with history in Panama City and contribute to the knowledge of the history of Panama City," explain John Freeman, an Anthropology major at Gulf Coast State College.

All the items found at the dig site will go to Gulf Coast State College, the Panama City Marine Institute, and the Panama City Museum.
