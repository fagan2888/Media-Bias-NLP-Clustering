Colorado Springs police have charged a U.S. Olympic wrestler after he was caught bow hunting for deer in a Lexus dealership lot.

Dremiel D. Byers, 39, was charged with suspicion of hunting out of season and illegal possession of wildlife, said Matt Robbins, a spokesman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

Police were called to the Lexus dealership at 6:52 p.m. Thursday after bystanders reported seeing a man trying to shoot a deer with a bow and arrow, according to the Colorado Springs Police Department’s online blotter.

Police called wildlife officials, who helped locate a wounded buck. The buck’s injuries were severe, and he was euthanized, Robbins said.

Byers is a Greco-Roman wrestler and a member of the U.S. Wrestling Team. He placed ninth in his weight class (120 kg/264.5 pounds) in the 2012 Olympics and seventh in his weight class in the 2008 Olympics.

He is a 10-time U.S. Nationals champion.

Craig Sesker, USA Wrestling’s senior communications manager, told The Gazette he was shocked when he heard of Byers’ alleged actions.

“He’s been a great representative of our sport,” Sesker said. “He’s had a great career and is one of the best we’ve ever had.”

Byers also is a decorated U.S. Army sergeant first class, who is stationed at Fort Carson as a unit supply specialist. He is part of the army’s world-class athlete program.

Byers’ military medals include two meritorious service medals, five Army commendation medals, five Army achievement medals and six good-conduct medals.
