Washington featured a porous defense last season and is looking for leadership.\n\nKnighton served as one of the Broncos\u2019 team captains last season and won the \u201cGood Guy\u201d award for his professionalism in dealing with the media. The Broncos said last month they were willing to let Knighton hit the open market and have not yet made any counterstrikes to keep him.\n\nThe Raiders and Bears feature strong Broncos ties. Former Broncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio, who drafted Knighton out of Temple when he coached the Jacksonville Jaguars, identified Knighton as a favorite weeks ago. He refers to Knighton as a \u201cdancing bear\u201d because of his strength and mobility, and he admitted at last month\u2019s NFL combine that the Raiders required players like Knighton to become successful.\n\nFormer Broncos coach John Fox, who mutually departed from Denver after the Broncos\u2019 stunning playoff exit and accepted the Bears\u2019 top job, watched Knighton develop into a force the past two seasons. Knighton posted his highest grade by the Broncos\u2019 staff in the AFC championship game win over the Patriots two seasons ago.\n\nKnighton ranked ninth against the run as a defensive tackle last season, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nTamme update. The Broncos have interest in re-signing backup tight end Jacob Tamme, who will become a free agent. To date, no contract offer has been extended. A \u201creceiving\u201d tight end who had 67 catches for Indianapolis in 2010 and 52 for the Broncos in 2012, Tamme selflessly accepted a reduced offensive role the past two seasons in Denver.\n\nFor the most part, Tamme\u2019s receiving chances went to slot receiver Wes Welker.\n\nAs Tamme prepares to celebrate his 30th birthday Sunday, he would like to find a team for which he would have a larger role in the offense. That team might be the Broncos now that starting tight end Julius Thomas is expected to sign with Jacksonville and Welker is a free agent.\n\nIrving update. The Broncos also have interest in re-signing linebacker Nate Irving as a backup to Danny Trevathan and Brandon Marshall. Irving, though, is hoping free agency lands him a starting job.\n\nCarter update. The Broncos will decide Monday whether to tender a one-year, $1.542 million contract to restricted free agent Tony Carter. A backup cornerback who was inactive in nine of 17 games last season, it doesn\u2019t make sense for the Broncos to pay $1.542 million to Carter, although there\u2019s a slight possibility the Broncos may tender him the contract knowing they can rework the deal later.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Terrance Knighton gaining interest from several NFL teams", "title": "Terrance Knighton gaining interest from several NFL teams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/08/terrance-knighton-gaining-interest-from-several-nfl-teams/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150308__knightonp1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150308__knightonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-08T12:24:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T17:44:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5172\"", "article_summary": "Tamme update.\nKnighton served as one of the Broncos\u2019 team captains last season and won the \u201cGood Guy\u201d award for his professionalism in dealing with the media.\nIn the legal contact period of free agency, Washington, Oakland, Chicago and Indianapolis have expressed interest in the Broncos\u2019 run stuffer.\nThe Broncos have interest in re-signing backup tight end Jacob Tamme, who will become a free agent.\nThe Broncos also have interest in re-signing linebacker Nate Irving as a backup to Danny Trevathan and Brandon Marshall."}
