The good news for America is that the Senate just invoked cloture on a bill that will keep the government funded and won't repeal Obamacare. Which is to say that enough Republicans broke with Ted Cruz to shut down his insane effort to force the country into a government shutdown over his bitterness that Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election.

The bad news is that if the government doesn't shut down, the alternative may be worse.

There are now basically three options facing House Speaker John Boehner. One is to do the right thing, fund the government and raise the debt ceiling, relying on Democratic votes if necessary. That seems to be out of the question. Another option is to stand and fight on Ted Cruz's terms. That means the government will shut down on Oct. 1, and we'll have a couple of weeks in which to see if the absence of government services causes the conservative position to collapse, forcing them to cave on both government funding and the debt ceiling. The third and worst option is to strong-arm his caucus into giving Obama what he wants on avoiding a government shutdown by promising to demand the entire Mitt Romney economic policy agenda as the price for raising the debt ceiling.
