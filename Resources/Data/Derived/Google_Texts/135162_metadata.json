Timofey Mozgov had 11 rebounds.\n\nLeBron James and Richard Jefferson (rest) did not play for the Cavaliers.\n\nToronto\u2019s Anthony Bennett had 11 points against the team that drafted him. Bismack Biyombo led Toronto with 10 rebounds.\n\nWith forward Tristan Thompson locked in a contract dispute and point guard Kyrie Irving still recovering from a left knee injury suffered in Game 1 of last year\u2019s NBA Finals against Golden State, the Cavaliers are on counting on Love to be a healthy contributor.\n\nLove had six points and two rebounds in a 6 \u00bd-minute stint in the opening quarter, converting both free throws after he was fouled by Luis Scola, then connecting on two of three jump shots. His only miss was from 3-point range.\n\nLove missed all four shots he took in six second-quarter minutes but had two assists, including one where he stole the ball from Valanciunas and fired a behind-the-back pass to Williams for an open 3. Love headed to the bench at the next stoppage and did not return.\n\nTraded from Minnesota to Cleveland in a three-team deal in August 2014, Love reached the playoffs for the first time as a professional last spring, but his experience didn\u2019t last long.\n\nThe three-time All-Star, who averaged 16.4 points and 9.7 rebounds in 75 regular-season starts, didn\u2019t play again after injuring his shoulder on April 26 as the Cavaliers completed a first-round sweep over Boston.\n\nLove dislocated his left shoulder midway through the first quarter after getting tangled up with Boston\u2019s Kelly Olynyk as both players pursued a loose ball. During the play, Olynyk pulled on Love\u2019s arm and yanked it from the socket, which Love later called \u201cbush league.\u201d Love grabbed his shoulder and ran immediately to his locker room. He had surgery three days later.\n\nOlynyk was suspended for the first game this season.\n\nLove opted out of the final year of his contract to become a free agent, but returned to Cleveland by signing a five-year, $113.2 million contract in July.\n\nHEY JOE:\n\nFormer Blue Jays and Indians slugger Joe Carter attended the game. Fans chanted \u2018Let\u2019s go, Blue Jays!\u2019 after Carter tossed signed mini-basketballs into the crowd during a second-half timeout.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nCavaliers: Cleveland wraps up its exhibition schedule when it hosts Dallas on Monday night.
