The Sugar House mom is a single parent of three young children.\n\n\n\n\u201c... and I actually have two with autism with special needs,\u201d Floyd told Good 4 Utah's Ali Monsen.\n\n\n\nFloyd says it is always a struggle making ends meet, especially during Christmastime. She recently went to her local Toys \u201cR\u201d Us to pay off her remaining debt.\n\n\n\n\"I actually was thinking, on the way [there], of dropping some things off, because I couldn't afford the last amount that was due,\u201d Floyd explained.\n\n\n\nFloyd says she approached the casheirs and asked to adjust her order. That is when a manager handed her an unexpected recepit.\n\n\n\n\"It says, 'Paid in full,' and they're bringing out the boxes of everything...\u201d she recalled.\n\n\n\nAn anonymous donor had paid off every remaining layaway balance at the store\u2014a total of 35 accounts and more than $5,800 dollars.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can't believe it\u2014that somebody else would do that for me... I just kept crying,\u201d Floyd said.\n\n\n\nNow, the grateful mother is heading back in to Toy's \u201cR\u201d Us, this time, shopping for someone else's kids.\n\n\n\n\"I've been lucky enough to have this money that I don't have to use anymore for my children. I need to find another family in need...\u201d Floyd explained.\n\n\n\nFloyd says she has no idea who this Secret Santa is, but that his/her generosity is a 'Christmas Miracle' she will never forget.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you so much, I can't believe it.
