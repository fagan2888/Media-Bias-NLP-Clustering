Dear Republicans, I got you this card because you're not going to get anything else out of this vote.

Dear Republicans, I got you this card because you're not going to get anything else out of this vote.

The bill is not expected to be taken up at all in the Senate, but Republicans hope it can bolster their case for taking the Senate in this fall's midterm elections. The party wants to make the elections as much as possible about the problems of ObamaCare, and is hoping to exploit Democratic division on the issue.

You've got to give them credit for . . . for . . . persistence? House Republicans voted for the 50th time, voted 250-160 to roll back part of Obamacare. This time it was for a delay of the individual mandate, and a tacit acknowledgment that, yeah, the law is here to stay. Otherwise why vote to delay part of it?How many times have you read a variation on that paragraph in the last three years? At least 50! At a cost to taxpayers of something like $72.5 million , in case you're keeping track.

That's putting a lot of eggs into a one very flimsy basket, as Markos pointed out earlier. Obamacare isn't the same issue it was in 2010, and it's not hurting Democrats now. By November, lots of people will have gotten coverage, and lots of people in red states will have noticed that they didn't get health care because of their Republican leaders. That's gonna hurt.
