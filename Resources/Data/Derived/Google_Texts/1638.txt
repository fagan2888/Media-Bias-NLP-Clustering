Metro Detroit human resources staffing companies merge

Two Metro Detroit human resources companies have merged to better serve the needs of a rapidly-growing health care information technology staffing market, they announced today.

Farmington Hills-based AccessPoint, a professional employer organization company, acquired Jan. 11 Livonia-based Preferred Solutions, an IT staffing, training and consulting firm. Preferred Solutions will operate independently within the staffing unit and move to AccessPoint’s Farmington Hills offices, according to AccessPoint CEO Greg Packer.

The financial terms of the deal were not announced.

The companies together will manage more than 12,000 HR employees nationwide and consist of 150 internal employees, eight of which are coming from Preferred Solutions. Packer said no staff cuts are anticipated in the merger.

AccessPoint’s acquisition will boost its servicing of electronic health records implementations, mandatory audits required by the Affordable Care Act and other areas within health care IT staffing.

The global health care IT market is anticipated to reach $104.5 billion by 2020, according to market research.

“Our complementary market reaches make this a natural combination,” Packer said in a news release. “It will be a smooth and rapid operational consolidation given the business cultures, character and tight-knit leadership groups of each entity.”

As it will operate independently, Preferred Solutions CEO Marie Seipenko and her executive and operations teams will stay on. “Preferred Solutions will benefit greatly from AccessPoint’s market presence and identity, and their outstanding administrative and technical infrastructure,” she said in the release.
