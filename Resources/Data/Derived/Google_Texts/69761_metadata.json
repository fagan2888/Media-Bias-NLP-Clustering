The three people traveling to the Northwood Place Apartments on Highway 39 North in Meridian had no idea what they would be faced with when getting out of the car after a Saturday night trip downtown. That's when police tell us the three victims were approached by a man with a gun.\n\nDetective Dareall Thompson says one of the victims then punched the suspect while another victim attempted to run inside and find his gun. After the suspect was punched, detectives tell us the suspect fired his gun, hitting a female victim near the knee. She was taken to a local hospital for treatment and is expected to be okay. Meanwhile, the suspect got into a red 2008 Chevy Impala with three other people inside. Police say the shooter is a black male and that another black male and two black females were in the car with him.\n\nInvestigators are still working to track the suspects down. Police say the vehicle had an Alabama tag with the number 3246AH7.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Police are searching for four people in connection to a robbery and shooting at  Meridian apartment complex.", "language": "english", "author": "Chip Scarborough", "og": {"description": "Police are searching for four people in connection to a robbery and shooting at  Meridian apartment complex.", "title": "MPD Investigating Saturday Night Robbery Turned Shooting", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/MPD-Investigating-Saturday-Night-Robbery-Turned-Shooting--262323471.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4D2/4CD/4D24CD12CA2D4A8FAF95D1B254D6E712", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/CA2/614/CA2614CC0402427EBFA9EE23ED555A95.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Police are searching for four people in connection to a robbery and shooting at  Meridian apartment complex.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/MPD-Investigating-Saturday-Night-Robbery-Turned-Shooting--262323471.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/shooting+crime+scene.jpg", "title": "MPD Investigating Saturday Night Robbery Turned Shooting", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "MPD Investigating Saturday Night Robbery Turned Shooting", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "MPD Investigating Saturday Night Robbery"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef2d\"", "article_summary": "Police say the shooter is a black male and that another black male and two black females were in the car with him.\nOne woman is recovering after being shot Saturday night during a robbery turned shooting in Meridian.\nThe Meridian Police Department says three people were followed home late Saturday night after they left Rhythm and Brews in downtown Meridian.\nAfter the suspect was punched, detectives tell us the suspect fired his gun, hitting a female victim near the knee.\nDetective Dareall Thompson says one of the victims then punched the suspect while another victim attempted to run inside and find his gun."}
