Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an Army combat veteran of the Middle East conflict and arguably the single most vocal Republican opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, suggested this week to a group of Israeli journalists that the U.S. military has the capability of bombing Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u201cback to zero.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report in the Times of Israel, Cotton argued that Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration officials had not been adamant enough in convincing Iran that the U.S. was willing to use force to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear warhead.\n\n\u201cYou can destroy facilities,\u201d Cotton said, according to the report. \u201cI don\u2019t think any military expert in the United States or elsewhere would say the U.S. military is not capable to setting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities back to day zero. Can we eliminate it forever? No, because any advanced industrialized country can develop nuclear weapons in four to seven years, from zero.\u201d\n\nCotton, an articulate Harvard educated politician with real GOP star-power, fomented Republican opposition to the nuclear agreement with Iran months before the final version emerged from round the clock talks in Vienna last month.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Important Things to Know About the Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nIn March, Cotton authored a letter to Iranian leaders signed by him and 46 other Republican senators warning that any nuclear agreement without legislative approval could be reversed by the next president \u201cwith the stroke of a pen.\u201d\n\nCotton defied Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker (R-TN) and other Republican leaders by casting the lone vote against a bipartisan legislative agreement with the White House providing for congressional review and a vote on the final terms of the agreement, arguing that it would provide Obama with an advantage in overcoming congressional resistance.\n\nThen in April, he engaged Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, in dueling tweets, including one in which he accused Zarif of cowardice for hiding in the U.S., as a young man to avoid service in the bloody Iran-Iraq war.\n\nRelated: Senate OKs Oversight of Iran Nuke Deal, Leaving Cotton in the Dust\n\nNow with Cotton\u2019s loose talk about a military solution to preventing Iran from getting its hand on the bomb if the U.S.-Iran nuclear non-proliferation agreement collapses, supporters of the agreement can use Cotton\u2019s comments to persuade recalcitrant congressional Democrats to sign off on the agreement.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get back to reality for a second about what a military strike would mean,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. \u201cYou can set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program for a series of years, but you cannot bomb Iran back to day zero unless you are also prepared to assassinate everyone in Iran who has worked on the nuclear program. Why? Because you can\u2019t destruct knowledge.\u201d\n\nIndeed, President George W. Bush\u2019s administration concluded long ago that a military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear plants would be a serious mistake and would only make it more difficult to prevent Iran from eventually developing a nuclear weapon that would threat Israel and other U.S. allies in the Middle East.\n\nFormer CIA director and National Security Agency chief Gen. Michael Hayden told a group of experts and reporters that attacking Iran would push Iran to spare no effort to build a nuclear weapon in secret.\n\nRelated: Schumer Bucks Obama, Gives GOP Iran Plan a Green Light\n\nHayden told the group that without an actual occupation of Iran, which nobody wants to contemplate, the Bush administration concluded that a limited military campaign in Iran would be counter-productive.\n\nObama and his senior advisers in some way are complicit in this dangerous renewed speculation on the prospects for military action if a negotiated settlement over the future of Iran\u2019s nuclear program falls through. Cotton and other Republican opponents complain that the administration conceded too much to the Iranians and that the agreement is porous and difficult to enforce.\n\nDuring his nearly hour-long speech delivered at American University on Wednesday, Obama derided most of the agreement\u2019s critics, especially those who have insisted that the U.S. should hold out for a \u201cbetter\u201d deal. He accused them of \u201cselling a fantasy.\u201d\n\nYet Obama, Kerry and other administration officials in some ways have been inviting dangerous speculation about the prospects of war in the Middle East if the negotiations collapsed or were rejected by Congress or the Iranian government. And the president did that again yesterday during his lengthy defense of the agreement.\n\n\u201cNow because more sanctions won't produce the results that the critics want, we have to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cCongressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option, another war in the Middle East. I say this not to be provocative, I am stating a fact. Without this deal, Iran will be in a position, however tough our rhetoric may be, to steadily advance its capabilities.\n\n\u201cSo let's not mince words,\u201d he added. \u201cThe choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy or some form of war. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The debate over the Iran nuclear deal doesn\u2019t formally begin until September, but the", "title": "Iran Nuclear Dispute Triggers Saber Rattling on Both Sides", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/06/Iran-Nuclear-Dispute-Triggers-Saber-Rattling-Both-Sides", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Iranian_Oil_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/06/Iran-Nuclear-Dispute-Triggers-Saber-Rattling-Both-Sides", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Iranian_Oil_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The debate over the Iran nuclear deal doesn\u2019t formally begin until September, but the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccba3\"", "article_summary": "The debate over the Iran nuclear deal doesn\u2019t formally begin until September, but the public already is being treated to extraordinary saber rattling and scare tactics from both sides of the controversy.\nWithout this deal, Iran will be in a position, however tough our rhetoric may be, to steadily advance its capabilities.\n\u201cYou can set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program for a series of years, but you cannot bomb Iran back to day zero unless you are also prepared to assassinate everyone in Iran who has worked on the nuclear program.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any military expert in the United States or elsewhere would say the U.S. military is not capable to setting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities back to day zero.\n\u201cCongressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option, another war in the Middle East."}
