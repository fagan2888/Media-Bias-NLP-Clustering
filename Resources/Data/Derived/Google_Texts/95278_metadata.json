The Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in a similar appeal has given new life to Kennedy\u2019s crusade.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Autocam Corp. sold to Tennessee company for $300 million\n\nRELATED: Autocam's lawyers headed back to court after Supreme Court affirms their stance in Hobby Lobby ruling\n\nAutocam Corp. employs more than 2,100 employees in 15 factories in the U.S., Europe, South America and Asia. Autocam Medical employs about 200 in West Michigan, said Kennedy, adding he will devote most of his day-to-day activities to Autocam Medical.\n\nNN, which is headquartered in Johnson City, Tenn., will consolidate its precision machining business with Autocam\u2019s Kentwood-based operations, he said. Autocam\u2019s management team will oversee that part of the business from West Michigan, Kennedy said.\n\nAs NN\u2019s largest shareholder after the deal closes, Kennedy said he plans to join the company\u2019s board of directors. Although his final shareholdings will not be known until after the deal closes, Kennedy estimated he will own slightly less than 10 percent of NN\u2019s shares.\n\nKennedy, who has been part of Autocam since the 1980s, when it was a subsidiary of Autodie Corp., is taking Autocam into the public stock arena for a second time after he bought it from Autodie and went public in 1991.\n\nAfter eight years as a public company, Kennedy sold Autocam to a private equity firm and held onto 30 percent of the company. That move helped fund the acquisition of Autocam\u2019s operations in France and Brazil.\n\nSeveral years later, their owners sold the company to the Wall Street investment firm of Goldman Sachs with Penske Corp. as a partner. The new owners took on $300 million in debt and were teetering on the edge of default when the auto industry collapsed in 2008.\n\nKennedy was able to buy back the debt at 25 cents on the dollar on the condition he would have control of the company once again. That gave him and his family 60 percent of the company with two institutional shareholders.\n\nThe decision to sell was driven in part by his institutional shareholders\u2019 desire to cash in on their investment, Kennedy said.\n\nRather than pull cash out of Autocam to pay them off, Kennedy said the merger will allow them to continue to build on the growth they\u2019ve achieved in developing high precision parts that are used in direct injection systems that produce improved gasoline mileage in cars and trucks.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been incredibly blessed,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI think with the great people around me, that\u2019s the reasons the company has had so much success and been able to generate a business that is obviously attractive to somebody else.\u201d\n\nJim Harger covers business for MLive/Grand Rapids Press.
