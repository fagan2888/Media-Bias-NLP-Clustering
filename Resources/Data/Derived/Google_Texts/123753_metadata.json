But beforehand, he went to The Star Democrat for a one-on-one interview, in which he spoke of his biggest areas of focus as a hopeful senator.\n\nIn addition to being the vice president of executive communications for the National Association of Manufacturers, Kefalas was formerly an attorney with Gov. Bob Ehrlich's administration, and later an attorney with the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nOne of his biggest areas of concern is job creation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get Washington working again with someone who knows how to create a job and move our state and our country towards prosperity,\u201d Kefalas said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I know how to do. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done, and I think you obviously need a candidate and a leader who\u2019s willing to stand up to party leadership, to any interest group and put the people of Maryland first.\u201d\n\nHe said that at 14 years old, he started an online sports company that employed 20 people within four years.\n\nKefalas plans to spend time in every Maryland county and Baltimore City during his campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve visited a lot of Main Streets,\u201d Kefalas said, adding that the ones that most stuck with him on the Eastern Shore have been hammered by a loss of jobs. Cambridge, for instance, has lost a lot of manufacturing jobs and small businesses, he said.\n\nHe sees small manufacturers, those that employee 50 people or less, as the engines of economic growth in Maryland and the nation.\n\nThere are some fixes on the federal level that can brings jobs to Maryland and grow its current business climate, he said.\n\n\u201cFirst, we need to reform our taxes. We need fairer taxes for the businesses and individuals who create the jobs that are going to drive the economy forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need regulatory reform \u2014 a comprehensive overhaul of regulatory reform so that businesses are not overburdened by either unproductive, inefficient or duplicative regulations that hamper their potential to invest and to hire new workers.\u201d\n\nKefalas said the average small manufacturer in the U.S. and Maryland pays $35,000 per employee in regulatory costs. \u201cThat\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why businesses shutter.\u201d\n\nKefalas called for free and fair trade to other nations, to benefit not just manufacturers, but the Shore\u2019s agriculture industry, too. He said a priority of his would be to fight for the future of the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry in Maryland.\n\nBut when farmers are adjusting to state environmental regulations, Kefalas said Congress and the federal government can\u2019t make it any harder for the agriculture industry to prosper. On that point, he referred to Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s ideology to lift barriers that might hamper business growth.\n\nWith the global economy, particularly in Asia, looking poor, Kefalas said, the significant economic headwinds likely will not go away unless the United States finds new markets for its products and increases its economic growth, \u201cwhich is what the U.S. needs to fulfill its jobs obligations.\u201d\n\nOn partisan gridlock between political parties in Congress, Kefalas said he brings a record of working across the aisle. He said he is willing to stand up to party leadership and do what\u2019s right for Maryland \u2014 a trait he said people are seeking in Maryland\u2019s replacement for Mikulski, who was known to fight for her constituents\u2019 interests.\n\nWith an ongoing and heated 2016 presidential race, Kefalas said he would like to see another principled conservative in the Oval Office and work with that person to lower taxes and create economic activity.\n\n\u201cBut regardless of who the next president is, he or she \u2014 one United States senator from the state of Maryland, whose vote is going to be required to move every piece of legislation that the next president will need to further their agenda, gives me the leverage and the opportunity to actually get things done for the people of Maryland,\u201d he said.\n\nOne partisan and ongoing conversation in Congress is health care and the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders over the years have repeatedly voiced strong opposition to the legislation with calls to repeal it.\n\nKefalas committed, if elected as a Maryland senator, to put forward a plan that he said will bring substantive changes to the Affordable Care Act, which he said only managed to get more people insured under a broken system.\n\n\u201cIt did not do enough to lessen costs. We\u2019ve actually seen in some instances costs rise,\u201d Kefalas said. \u201cIt certainly has provided a lot of new mandates on small businesses that have made it harder to grow.\u201d\n\nKefalas\u2019 plan includes repealing an excise tax on medical devices, which he said stifles innovation and investment in the health care system.\n\nHe said another excise tax that can be repealed is on what he and others call \u201cCadillac plans.\u201d According to Cigna, a global health insurance services company, the Cadillac tax under the ACA is a 40 percent tax starting in 2020 on high-cost, employer-sponsored health coverage plans.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a plan that is going to fix the system, provide certainly for businesses, transparency, and continue to create an environment where you have research and development and investment in the system, but also do something finally to lower the spiraling costs of health care,\u201d Kefalas said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "MyEasternShoreMD", "description": "EASTON \u2014 Chrys Kefalas, the 36-year-old conservative Republican running in a highly contested race for Barbara Mikulski\u2019s U.S. Senate seat in Maryland, spent a day on the Eastern Shore Friday, March 11.", "title": "Kefalas talks jobs, economic growth in U.S. Senate race", "url": "http://www.myeasternshoremd.com/news/state_regional/article_b27c1b4a-6c72-5bf1-a223-dd0ab9ea2c20.html", "image": {"width": 945, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/myeasternshoremd.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/02/80259e25-9838-5c34-a449-2110a14501b1/56e6de9c9cd43.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "EASTON \u2014 Chrys Kefalas, the 36-year-old conservative Republican running in a highly contested race for Barbara Mikulski\u2019s U.S. Senate seat in Maryland, spent a day on the Eastern Shore Friday, March 11.", "msvalidate.01": "EE204038BCCB0840914BDEAC8247DD00", "fb": {"app_id": 194531137297170}, "keywords": "kent county news,star democrat,sentae,barbara mikulski,chrys kefalas,state_regional,kent_county,talbot_county,featured", "google-site-verification": "_7I094DNboGAPwP_XrW1JPjX4m0gmLBrHcY7vOH6s54", "news_keywords": "kent county news,star democrat,sentae,barbara mikulski,chrys kefalas,state_regional,kent_county,talbot_county,featured"}, "article_summary": "One partisan and ongoing conversation in Congress is health care and the Affordable Care Act.\nCambridge, for instance, has lost a lot of manufacturing jobs and small businesses, he said.\nHe sees small manufacturers, those that employee 50 people or less, as the engines of economic growth in Maryland and the nation.\nThere are some fixes on the federal level that can brings jobs to Maryland and grow its current business climate, he said.\nKefalas made a stop at a business in Easton and then headed south to make more rounds at businesses in Salisbury."}
