Kentucky\u2019s laws uniquely disadvantage small parties and prevent them from gaining ballot access easily.\n\n\n\nFrom Ballot Access News:\n\nOn December 4, the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party filed a lawsuit against the Kentucky definition of a qualified party. The case is Libertarian Party of Kentucky v Grimes, e.d. 3:15cv-86.\n\nKentucky is the only state in which it is impossible for a party to ever be ballot-qualified until it polls a particular share of the vote for President. The law requires 2% for President. No other index of support matters. Kentucky is one of only five states in which the only ballot-qualified parties since November 2000 have been the Democratic and Republican Parties. The others are New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania (however, the ballot-qualified Libertarian Party in Georgia is only qualified for statewide office, not district and county office).\n\nIn the last 100 years, only four parties have met the Kentucky 2% presidential vote test. They are the Progressive Party in 1924, the American Party in 1968, the Anderson Coalition Party in 1980, and the Reform Party in 1996. History shows that voters are far more likely to support a party, other than the Democratic and Republican Parties, for office other than President. The Libertarian Party of Kentucky polled 3.08% for U.S. Senate in 2014, but that doesn\u2019t count. Also it has almost 5,000 registered members, but that doesn\u2019t count either.\n\nThe Kentucky definition of qualified party makes it impossible for a party that isn\u2019t interested in running a presidential nominee from ever being qualified. Many states have one-state parties that do not participate in presidential elections, including the Working Families Parties in Connecticut, Oregon, South Carolina, and Vermont; many parties in Florida; the Independent Party of Hawaii; the United Independent Party of Massachusetts; the Independent Party of Oregon; the Moderate Party of Rhode Island; the American Party of South Carolina; and the Progressive Party of Vermont (except in 2000 the Vermont Progressives nominated Ralph Nader).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Libertarian Party of Kentucky and the Constitution Party of Kentucky are joining together in a vie for major party status.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "The Libertarian Party of Kentucky and the Constitution Party of Kentucky are joining together in a vie for major party status.", "title": "KY Libertarian and Constitution Parties File Lawsuit Over Definition of \"Party\"", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/American_Political_Parties.png", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/ky-libertarian-and-constitution-parties-file-lawsuit-over-definition-of-party/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/American_Political_Parties.png", "description": "The Libertarian Party of Kentucky and the Constitution Party of Kentucky are joining together in a vie for major party status.", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "KY Libertarian and Constitution Parties File Lawsuit Over Definition of"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "third party", "published_time": "2015-12-17T10:44:43+00:00", "author": "www.facebook.com/keithfarrellpublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9953\"", "article_summary": "From Ballot Access News:On December 4, the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party filed a lawsuit against the Kentucky definition of a qualified party.\nThe Libertarian Party of Kentucky and the Constitution Party of Kentucky are joining together in a vie for major party status.\nThe Kentucky definition of qualified party makes it impossible for a party that isn\u2019t interested in running a presidential nominee from ever being qualified.\nThe Libertarian Party of Kentucky polled 3.08% for U.S. Senate in 2014, but that doesn\u2019t count.\nThe case is Libertarian Party of Kentucky v Grimes, e.d."}
