Over and over, at doorsteps around Orange County, she asks the same question: \u201cAre you insured?\u201d\n\nGetting an answer isn\u2019t always easy. Doors slam in her face. She gets shooed from porches. And sometimes people cut her off mid-spiel.\n\nBravo is a paid health outreach worker for the Orange County Congregation Community Organization, a faith-based nonprofit. Her job is to inform people about getting health insurance under the nation\u2019s landmark health law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know about this new law \u2026 this opportunity for health insurance,\u201d said Bravo, a 19-year old Costa Mesa resident.\n\nUntil a few months ago, Bravo didn\u2019t actually know coverage was an opportunity for her, as well.\n\nShe is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Most people without papers can\u2019t get health insurance under the ACA. But last year, Bravo and her 21-year-old brother Daniel qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program \u2013 a 2012 initiative that grants temporary legal status to certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\n\nThe law applies to people who came to the U.S. before turning 16, are in school or a high school graduate and are now under the age of 33.\n\nThey can obtain a work permit, a driver\u2019s license, a Social Security number, a two-year reprieve from deportation and \u2014 as Bravo now realizes \u2014 the opportunity to get health insurance through Medi-Cal, California\u2019s insurance program for poor and disabled people. Only a few other states offer similar options.\n\nNow studying politics and ethnic studies full time at Golden West College in Huntington Beach, Bravo can\u2019t work as much as she used to. Her monthly income of $960 likely would make her eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\nFiguring out her options under the law was especially difficult for Bravo, whose family is of \u201cmixed status.\u201d That is, some have federal authorization to be in this country and others don\u2019t. While anyone can buy insurance privately, people without legal status are not allowed to buy insurance on the exchange or participate in most government program such as Medicare, non-emergency Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nHer parents are in the country without permission, as is her older brother Luis, 22, who did not qualify for DACA. Her other brother Daniel, 21, was granted DACA status and qualifies for the same benefits she does. And her brother Alex, 11, is a U.S.-born citizen, covered through California Kids \u2013 a nonprofit health insurance plan.\n\n\u2018Stuck in the middle\u2019\n\nThe family\u2019s history is complicated. After several failed visa attempts, her father Enrique Bravo crossed the border illegally in 1996. His wife, Virginia, tried to cross by hiding in a car but was caught by border patrol agents. Desperate to join her husband, she tried again and made it across six months later. Three-year-old Jessica and her older brothers later crossed with legal-resident relatives in a car.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent Mexican\u2026but all my memories growing up are from the United States,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in the middle\u2026I\u2019m neither from here or there.\u201d\n\nAs the older children grew up, getting health care proved dicey. The family tried to stay below the radar. This meant visiting the doctor only when absolutely necessary \u2014 and always paying cash.\n\nThey were, like many immigrants, fearful of exposing the family\u2019s unauthorized status and risking deportation, for themselves and their children.\n\nEventually Enrique, an electrician, found a job that offered health insurance, and for several years the family was insured. But he got laid off in 2006. From then on, they were forced to rely on local community clinics that provide care on a sliding pay scale.\n\n\u201cI remember my parents telling me that I was no longer going to be insured under their plan,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cI just tried to eat healthy.\u201d\n\nHer biggest concern now, she says, is that one of the others will get sick and the family won\u2019t be able to pay for care.\n\n\u201cEven though that fear is gone for me, it\u2019s still very real for my family,\u201d said Bravo, who is in the process of renewing her DACA status for another two years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to grasp that I have this privilege, yet my parents who worked twice as hard, don\u2019t have anything.\u201d\n\nRecent events have compounded the family\u2019s worries.\n\nJessica\u2019s brother Luis was recently detained by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a result of a tip arising from a prior conviction for driving under the influence. It\u2019s unclear what will happen until the immigration court hears his case and decides whether he can remain in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt all seems like a dream\u2026it happened so fast,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to stop his deportation.\u201d\n\nOne fall can change everything\n\nWeeks ago, Jessica\u2019s mother Virginia stumbled and fell to the ground in front of their Costa Mesa apartment, spilling the milk she\u2019d just bought. The 48-year-old former hairstylist hurt her arm, but despite feeling a sharp pain she won\u2019t be visiting the emergency room.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Virginia Bravo said. The mother of four has been unemployed for over a year and is more concerned about stocking the empty refrigerator than seeking treatment.\n\nShe knows all too well that without insurance an unexpected injury could leave them bankrupt.\n\nLast year, Enrique had to be rushed to the emergency room. He woke up in the middle of the night with extreme paranoia, unable to catch his breath, and feeling numb.\n\nHe was having a panic attack. The bill for the two-hour hospital stay was about $6,000. Already struggling financially, the family had to find a way to pay cash.\n\n\u201cAt first I refused to go to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it would be expensive.\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old says he struggles to earn at least $2,250 each month as a self-employed electrician \u2013 the exact amount he needs to pay rent.\n\nAny extra money is used to buy food and pay bills. Saving for an emergency is impossible, the family members said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re poor, but rich in health and family unity,\u201d Virginia Bravo said.\n\nLiving in a mixed-status family has been challenging, but it has also brought them closer, she said. The whole family has been involved in campaigning for immigration reform and hopes the ACA will eventually include coverage for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t know what we had to go through to get here,\u201d said Virginia. \u201cWe made it across \u2026 we\u2019re the lucky ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anything for free,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had an opportunity to buy health insurance, we would find a way to pay for it.\u201d\n\nThis story produced in collaboration with Univision\n\nTucsonSentinel.com's original reporting and curation of border and immigration news is generously supported in part by a grant from the Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation.
