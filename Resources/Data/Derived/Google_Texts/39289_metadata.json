Pelosi delivered her strongest rebuke yet against the Senate's emergency funding package during a press briefing Thursday. (More on that here: http://bit.ly/1RbOBnJ)\n\nThe Senate's funding is wrapped up in a major appropriations package, which includes military construction, veterans affairs and the housing and urban development. Details on the Senate's bill here: http://bit.ly/23YU0pk\n\nSessions/Cassidy replacement bill does not fully repeal ObamaCare\n\nIt's rare that a Republican alternative does not fully repeal ObamaCare, but that's true of a new bill from Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas).\n\nStill, it would eliminate many central aspects of ObamaCare, including the mandates for individuals to have coverage and for employers to provide it, as well as the requirements for what an insurance plan must cover.\n\nThe core of the plan is a $2,500 tax credit that any citizen is eligible for and can use to purchase health insurance. The lawmakers say this gives flexibility to people, whether they get employer-based insurance or not, to take control of their healthcare spending, for example by using a health savings account.\n\nSessions and Cassidy are putting forward their plan as a task force set up by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is nearing the release of its own plan to fully repeal ObamaCare and replace it with an alternative. http://bit.ly/1WFHbB5\n\nThe next big abortion battle?\n\nThe Oklahoma Senate on Thursday approved a bill that would virtually ban abortion by making it illegal for doctors to perform the procedure under almost all circumstances. The bill now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Mary Fallin, who has remained mum about whether she'll support it. If she does not act within five days, the legislation will automatically become law.\n\nThe bill has been called the first of its kind nationwide, and is certain to wind up in courts if it does become law. http://bit.ly/1XD3QgY\n\nCigna sets goals to curb opioid use\n\nOne of the nation's largest insurers is vowing to reduce the use of opioids among its customers by one-quarter over the next three years amid national attention on the issue. That would bring the rate of usage back to the \"pre-crisis\" levels of 2006, the company said in a release.\n\nThe insurer recently partnered with the American Society of Addiction Medicine in its effort, which will include tighter patient limits on opioid medication and expanding outreach and tools to physicians who prescribe the drugs.\n\nSpecialty drug spending up 26 percent\n\nThe per-patient cost of specialty drugs jumped 26 percent over the last two years, according to a report by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association released Thursday.\n\nSpecialty drugs \u2013 which are used to treat complex or rare conditions \u2013 now represent the largest driver in the growth of healthcare spending. The uptick in spending comes both from increased use and increased costs for the treatments.
