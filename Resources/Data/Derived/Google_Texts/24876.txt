Chicagoans at Beulah Shoesmith Elementary School in Hyde Park got a big surprise Tuesday morning when former president Bill Clinton arrived on scene, shaking hands and posing for photos outside the school, as reported by NBC Chicago.

Clinton stopped by the South Side polling place on Illinois’ primary election day, accompanied by Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County State’s Attorney candidate Kim Foxx.

The former president said he was hoping to “stir up voter interest” and “get the biggest possible turnout.”

Bill Clinton also stopped through the Austin neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side with Congressman Danny K. Davis and Attorney General Lisa Madigan Tuesday morning.

Per NBC News:

“Chicago has been really good to me and our family,” he added. “I love coming here and I thought it would the best place to be on Election Day.”

Clinton’s Tuesday appearances come on the heels of weekend visits to black churches in South Shore and west suburban Maywood, as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times.

The former president is trying to boost turnout among African American voters in the city; a critical voting demographic for Hillary Clinton.

Polls shows Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are neck and neck in Illinois’ Democratic presidential primary.

CBS News‘ most recent polling data shows Clinton at 46 percent, just shy of Sanders’ 48 percent.
