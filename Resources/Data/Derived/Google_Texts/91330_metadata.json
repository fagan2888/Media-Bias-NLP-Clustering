In 1996, he and his bodyguard were acquitted of murder charges after his bodyguard shot and killed a rival gang member, The Morning News reported.\n\nTrooper Spears\u2019 attorney, Ty Clevenger, said his client had no knowledge of Mr. Broadus\u2018 criminal past.\n\n\u201cBilly did not know about Snoop Dogg\u2019s criminal history,\u201d Mr. Clevenger wrote on his blog. \u201cBelieve it or not, some folks don\u2019t watch TMZ or read People Magazine. And of course DPS has no policy requiring a criminal background check on everyone who requests a picture with a uniformed trooper. In fact, DPS has no policy forbidding a photograph with someone who has a criminal conviction.\u201d\n\nBecause the action taken against Trooper Spears called for \u201ccounseling\u201d and was not a formal disciplinary action, the trooper has no means of appeal, even though it will become part of his personnel record, The Morning News reported.\n\nDuring counseling, Trooper Spears was instructed to say \u201cno\u201d when people ask to have their picture taken with him.\n\nMr. Clevenger said he believes the DPS is retaliating against Trooper Spears for reporting a Alcoholic Beverage Commission officer last year for unprofessional conduct. The complaint prompted an investigation against Mr. Spears, who was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, The Morning News reported.\n\nDPS spokesman Tom Vinger said they don\u2019t typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action, The Morning News reported.\n\n\u201cSupervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department,\u201d Mr. Vinger said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Texas Department of Public Safety trooper is reportedly being forced to undergo counseling after he posed for a photo with Snoop Dogg while working at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Texas Department of Public Safety trooper is reportedly being forced to undergo counseling after he posed for a photo with Snoop Dogg while working at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin.", "title": "Billy Spears, Texas trooper who posed for photo with Snoop Dogg, ordered to undergo counseling", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/2/billy-spears-texas-trooper-who-posed-for-photo-wit/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/02/billy_spear_snoop.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/02/billy_spear_snoop.jpg", "title": "Billy Spears, Texas trooper who posed for photo with Snoop Dogg, order", "description": "A Texas Department of Public Safety trooper is reportedly being forced to undergo counseling after he posed for a photo with Snoop Dogg while working at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Texas Department Of Public Safety, The Morning News, Calvin Broadus, Snoop Dogg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3d9\"", "article_summary": "During counseling, Trooper Spears was instructed to say \u201cno\u201d when people ask to have their picture taken with him.\nTrooper Spears\u2019 attorney, Ty Clevenger, said his client had no knowledge of Mr. Broadus\u2018 criminal past.\nThe complaint prompted an investigation against Mr. Spears, who was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, The Morning News reported.\nMr. Broadus has faced numerous charges related to drugs and weapons possession.\nMr. Clevenger said he believes the DPS is retaliating against Trooper Spears for reporting a Alcoholic Beverage Commission officer last year for unprofessional conduct."}
