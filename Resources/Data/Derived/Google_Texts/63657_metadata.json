I\u2019m baaack!\u201d\n\n2) When Hillary confessed to ABC News host Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were \u201cdead broke\u201d upon leaving the White House.\n\n3) When Hillary backtracked on her \u201cdead broke\u201d comment and described herself as merely \u201cnot truly well off\u201d in an interview with the Guardian.\n\n4) When, in its third week of sales, Hillary\u2019s memoir \u201cHard Choices\u201d dropped just above a book called \u201cPotty\u201d on Amazon\u2019s best sellers list.\n\n5) When Hillary claimed at a Democratic campaign rally in Massachusetts that businesses and corporations don\u2019t really create jobs (and that \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d doesn\u2019t actually work).\n\n6) When the former secretary of State suggested that the United States must \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cempathize with\u201d our enemies.\n\n7) When Hillary charged the University of Nevada-Las Vegas an enormous $225,000 to deliver a speech at the school\u2019s foundation dinner and then complained about student debt and the high cost of college tuition during said speech.\n\n8) When Hillary was photographed walking on the beach in the Hamptons during her summer vacation wearing what appeared to be a \u201cmuumuu,\u201d as the Washington Free Beacon so eloquently pointed out.\n\n9) When Hillary and daughter Chelsea crashed New York Fashion Week (and, more specifically, Oscar de la Renta\u2019s show) with a herd of plush elephants. I\u2019m still upset Hil didn\u2019t show up wearing her signature look:\n\n10) And, finally, I couldn\u2019t resist: That awesomely bad pro-Hillary country song. You might just feel compelled to \u201cstand\u201d up \u2026 and walk away from your computer when you hear it. Sure, Mrs. Clinton didn\u2019t directly contribute to this, but she sure did inspire it!", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "From her book tour to her granddaughter to her outrageously expensive private plane flights during the midterm election, Hillary Clinton has pretty much been everywhere this year.", "title": "Top 10 HILLARY-ous moments of 2014 - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 551, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/12/Hillary-Clinton-Women_Chal-551x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/12/24/top-10-hillary-ous-moments-2014/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "top-ten-hillaryous-moments", "published_time": "2014-12-24T08:00:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-24T09:20:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce985\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps looking back on a year\u2019s worth of ill-advised comments, negative media coverage and rather unflattering photographs will help Hillary figure out whether or not she can take another several years of the limelight.\n6) When the former secretary of State suggested that the United States must \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cempathize with\u201d our enemies.\nSure, Mrs. Clinton didn\u2019t directly contribute to this, but she sure did inspire it!\nI\u2019m still upset Hil didn\u2019t show up wearing her signature look:10) And, finally, I couldn\u2019t resist: That awesomely bad pro-Hillary country song.\nI\u2019m baaack!\u201d2) When Hillary confessed to ABC News host Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were \u201cdead broke\u201d upon leaving the White House."}
