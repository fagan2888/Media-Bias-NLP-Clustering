The Golden State has recently taken several steps toward strengthening insurance coverage for reproductive health services.\n\nOn Friday, health department officials in California determined that insurance companies in the state can\u2019t refuse to cover abortion, ensuring that even the people who are employed at religiously-affiliated colleges won\u2019t have to worry about losing access to coverage for those services. The announcement came after two Catholic institutions, Santa Clara University and Loyola Marymount University, decided to drop coverage for elective abortions for more than 2,000 employees. Since California law requires insurers to cover both abortion services and maternity care as equal aspects of women\u2019s health care, the state stepped in, reminding the colleges that the state\u2019s insurance providers are prohibited from \u201cdiscriminating against women who choose to terminate a pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe decision was widely hailed as a victory for abortion rights. \u201cThe move by the Department of Managed Health Care is one of the strongest statements in favor of women\u2019s reproductive health rights you\u2019re likely to hear from officials of any state, at a time when those rights are under systematic attack,\u201d a recent op-ed in the Los Angeles Times noted.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. Also at the end of last week, the California legislature approved the Contraceptive Coverage Equity Act, a measure that strengthens the coverage for FDA-approved birth control methods under Obamacare. It now heads to the governor, who is expected to sign it.\n\nWhile California has had a law on the books since 1999 that requires health insurers to cover contraception along with other prescription drugs, the new measure goes even further to ensure that women will be able to select the birth control method of their choice without being required to try other methods first. \u201cMedical management techniques that create barriers to particular methods deprive women of their reproductive freedom, increase their risk of unintended pregnancy and disproportionately impact low-income women,\u201d California Sen. Holly J. Mitchell (D), who introduced the legislation, said in a press release after her bill\u2019s passage.\n\nCalifornia has long been pursuing an agenda that\u2019s particularly friendly to reproductive rights. Last fall, Gov. Jerry Brown (D-CA) signed two pieces of legislation \u2014 one that widened the pool of medical professionals allowed to perform abortions, and another that removed unnecessary restrictions on abortion clinics \u2014 to set his state on a very different path than the rest of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in other states, lawmakers are eliminating insurance coverage for abortion and forcing abortion clinics to close. This type of legislation has effectively created an artificial division between certain types of reproductive health care and the rest of women\u2019s medical services. It\u2019s also undermined efforts to keep the health care system free from junk science; abortion restrictions that aren\u2019t based in science or medicine are now in place in the majority of the country.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Golden State has recently taken several steps toward protecting reproductive rights.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The Golden State has recently taken several steps toward protecting reproductive rights.", "title": "California Bucks The National Trend, Protects Coverage For Birth Control And Abortion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/08/25/3475468/california-coverage-abortion-birth-control/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Golden State has recently taken several steps toward protecting reproductive rights.", "title": "California Bucks The National Trend, Protects Coverage For Birth Control And Abortion", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/California.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T16:05:06+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a54\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, in other states, lawmakers are eliminating insurance coverage for abortion and forcing abortion clinics to close.\nThis type of legislation has effectively created an artificial division between certain types of reproductive health care and the rest of women\u2019s medical services.\nThe Golden State has recently taken several steps toward strengthening insurance coverage for reproductive health services.\nHealth California Bucks The National Trend, Protects Coverage For Birth Control And Abortion CREDIT: ShutterstockAs legislators around the country try to figure out what the recent Hobby Lobby decision means for their constituents\u2019 birth control access, as well as continue to find ways to make it harder to get an abortion, lawmakers in California are taking the opposite approach.\nCalifornia has long been pursuing an agenda that\u2019s particularly friendly to reproductive rights."}
