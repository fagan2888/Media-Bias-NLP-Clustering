Klint Carlson scored 12 points, Wyatt Lohaus had 11 and Northern Iowa held on to beat No. 25 Wichita State 53-50 on Saturday, ending the Shockers' nation-leading 43-game home winning streak.

The Panthers (16-11, 8-6 Missouri Valley) blew a 15-point second-half lead before pulling back ahead on consecutive baskets by Lohaus with about 6 minutes left in the game.

The Shockers (18-7, 12-2) got within 53-50 when Shaq Morris made the second of two free throws with 40.2 seconds left, then got the ball back when Wes Washpun had his shot blocked with 10 seconds to go.

Ron Baker missed a potential tying 3 at the other end, but the ball bounced off a Northern Iowa player out of bounds. Given another chance, the Shockers got the ball to Connor Frankamp in front of his own bench, but his 3-pointer bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded.
