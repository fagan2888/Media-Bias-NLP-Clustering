Following is an excerpt from the first part of a series that spelled out doctors\u2019 concerns about the system they would soon face.\n\nTwo of every three practicing physicians oppose the medical overhaul plan under consideration in Washington, and hundreds of thousands would think about shutting down their practices or retiring early if it were adopted, a new IBD/TIPP Poll has found.\n\nThe poll contradicts the claims of not only the White House, but also doctors\u2019 own lobby \u2014 the powerful American Medical Association \u2014 both of which suggest the medical profession is behind the proposed overhaul.\n\nIt also calls into question whether an overhaul is even doable; 72% of the doctors polled disagree with the administration\u2019s claim that the government can cover 47 million more people with better-quality care at lower cost.\n\nThe IBD/TIPP Poll was conducted by mail, with 1,376 practicing physicians chosen randomly throughout the country taking part.\n\nMajor findings included:\n\n\u0095 Two-thirds, or 65%, of doctors say they oppose the proposed government expansion plan. This contradicts the administration\u2019s claims that doctors are part of an \u201cunprecedented coalition\u201d supporting a medical overhaul.\n\nIt also differs with findings of a poll released Monday by National Public Radio that suggests a \u201cmajority of physicians want public and private insurance options,\u201d and clashes with media reports such as a front-page story in the Los Angeles Times with the headline \u201cDoctors Go For Obama\u2019s Reform.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the Times story does it say doctors as a whole back the overhaul. It says only that the AMA \u2014 the \u201cassociation representing the nation\u2019s physicians\u201d and what \u201cmany still regard as the country\u2019s premier lobbying force\u201d \u2014 is \u201clobbying and advertising to win public support for President Obama\u2019s sweeping plan.\u201d\n\nThe AMA, in fact, represents approximately 18% of physicians and has been hit with a number of defections by members opposed to the AMA\u2019s support of Democrats\u2019 proposed health care overhaul.\n\n\u0095 Four of nine doctors, or 45%, said they \u201cwould consider leaving their practice or taking an early retirement\u201d if Congress passes the plan the Democratic majority and White House have in mind.\n\nMore than 800,000 doctors were practicing in 2006, the government says. Projecting the poll\u2019s finding onto that population, 360,000 doctors would consider quitting.\n\n\u0095 More than seven in 10 doctors, or 71% \u2014 the most lopsided response in the poll \u2014 answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if they believed \u201cthe government can cover 47 million more people and that it will cost less money and the quality of care will be better.\u201d\n\nThis response is consistent with critics who complain that the administration and congressional Democrats have yet to explain how, even with the current number of physicians and nurses, they can cover more people and lower the cost at the same time.\n\nThe only way, the critics contend, is by rationing care \u2014 giving it to some and denying it to others. That cuts against another claim by plan supporters \u2014 that care would be better.\n\nIBD/TIPP\u2019s finding that many doctors could leave the business suggests that such rationing could be more severe than even critics believe. Rationing is one of the drawbacks associated with government plans in countries such as Canada and the U.K.\n\nStories about growing waiting lists for badly needed care, horror stories of care gone wrong, babies born on sidewalks, and even people dying as a result of care delayed or denied are rife.\n\nIn this country, the number of doctors is already lagging population growth. From 2003 to 2006, the number of active physicians in the U.S. grew by just 0.8% a year, adding 25,700 doctors.\n\nRecent population growth has been 1% a year. Patients, in short, are already being added faster than physicians, creating a medical bottleneck.\n\nThe great concern is that, with increased mandates, lower pay and less freedom to practice, doctors could abandon medicine in droves, as the IBD/TIPP Poll suggests.\n\nUnder the proposed medical overhaul, an additional 47 million people would have to be cared for \u2014 an 18% increase in patient loads, without an equivalent increase in doctors. The actual effect could be less because a significant share of the uninsured already get care.\n\nEven so, the government vows to cut hundreds of billions from health care spending to pay for reform, which would encourage a flight from the profession.\n\nThe U.S. today has just 2.4 physicians per 1,000 population \u2014 below the median of 3.1 for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the official club of wealthy nations.\n\nAdding millions of patients to physicians\u2019 caseloads would threaten to overwhelm the system. Medical gatekeepers would have to deny care to large numbers of people. That means care would have to be rationed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like giving everyone free bus passes, but there are only two buses,\u201d Dr. Ted Epperly, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told the Associated Press.\n\nHope for a surge in new doctors may be misplaced. A recent study from the Association of American Medical Colleges found steadily declining enrollment in medical schools since 1980.\n\nThe study found that, just with current patient demand, the U.S. will have 159,000 fewer doctors than it needs by 2025. Unless corrected, that would make some sort of medical rationing or long waiting lists almost mandatory. Experiments at the state level show that an overhaul isn\u2019t likely to change much.\n\nOn Monday came word from the Massachusetts Medical Society \u2014 a group representing physicians in a state that has implemented an overhaul similar to that under consideration in Washington \u2014 that doctor shortages remain a growing problem.\n\nIn 2006, Massachusetts passed its medical overhaul \u2014 minus a public option \u2014 similar to what\u2019s being proposed on a national scale now. It hasn\u2019t worked as expected. Costs are higher, with insurance premiums rising 22% faster than in the U.S. as a whole.\n\nOther states with government-run or mandated health insurance systems, including Maine, Tennessee and Hawaii, have been forced to cut back services and coverage.\n\nThis experience has been repeated in other countries where a form of nationalized care is common. In particular, many nationalized health systems seem to have trouble finding enough doctors to meet demand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When we hear of problems cropping up in health care, such as word last week of a coming doctor shortage, we can't help thinking back on the red flags that", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "When we hear of problems cropping up in health care, such as word last week of a coming doctor shortage, we can\u2019t help thinking back on the red flags that physicians waved in a one-of-a-kind \u2026", "title": "Doctors Warned Us About ObamaCare Before It Became Law", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/viewpoint/ibd-poll-finds-doctors-will-quit-under-affordable-care-act/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-03-06 15:15:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-06T15:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc118\"", "article_summary": "This contradicts the administration\u2019s claims that doctors are part of an \u201cunprecedented coalition\u201d supporting a medical overhaul.\nThe only way, the critics contend, is by rationing care \u2014 giving it to some and denying it to others.\nUnder the proposed medical overhaul, an additional 47 million people would have to be cared for \u2014 an 18% increase in patient loads, without an equivalent increase in doctors.\nUnless corrected, that would make some sort of medical rationing or long waiting lists almost mandatory.\nEven so, the government vows to cut hundreds of billions from health care spending to pay for reform, which would encourage a flight from the profession."}
