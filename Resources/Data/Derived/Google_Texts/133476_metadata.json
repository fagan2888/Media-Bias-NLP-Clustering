Something about that fact made it seem as if it wasn\u2019t a full entry in Springsteen\u2019s canon. The notion that an artist known for his specific brand of storytelling was defining his record with another songwriter\u2019s words seemed to condemn \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d as a detour before it arrived. The grab-bag nature of it compounded this feeling, given his historically exacting nature when it comes to sequencing tracks or staying true to a specific arc over the course of a record. Even for myself and those of my friends who readily identify Bruce as our favorite artist, it was too easy to make halfhearted jokes about how a title like \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d attached to an album such as this seemed to challenge us to have anything but low hopes.\n\nCorrespondingly, the tone of interviews leading up to \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d have almost been preemptively defensive. Springsteen and his producer of late, Ron Aniello, gave extensive interviews to Rolling Stone, both making the case that the songs collected on \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d do actually tell a connected story. For Springsteen, this meant tying together the loose ends of the last 15 years or so \u2014 the fact that these were the lost dogs was, in itself, the story. There was something in the air, though \u2014 a sense that they knew they were offering up something they had to actively sell to fans, and that never bodes well.\n\nThe prominence of covers is a big departure for Springsteen, sure, but some of those other qualities weren\u2019t as different as they were made out to be. Throughout his career (as he pointed out himself in the Rolling Stone interview), Springsteen has recorded lingering songs from former projects for new ones (songs from \u201cThe River\u201d like \u201cSherry Darling\u201d and \u201cIndependence Day\u201d date back to \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town\u201d) or as springboards for something else entirely (\u201cEasy Money,\u201d originally written for a record that has yet to see release, became the genesis point for 2012\u2019s \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d). What\u2019s conspicuous when you listen to \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d though, is the overbearing presence of Tom Morello, whom Springsteen has repeatedly referred to as a muse of sorts for the new record. As much as those in the E Street camp seem to feel Morello helped bring some modern edge to their sound, his guitar theatrics are awkwardly lopped all over Springsteen songs in which they make no sense. It\u2019s not quite enough to sink the experience, as a slew of reviewers have alleged, but it is enough to hinder it, and to tell you all you need to know about \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d: that it\u2019s a confused and confusing album. It\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s not his best work, and is indeed best enjoyed as a stopgap release of hit or miss material rather than as a full-fledged release.\n\nThat\u2019s the conspicuous stuff. What\u2019s less noticeable, perhaps, is how \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d was recorded, and the circumstances surrounding its inception in general, even though those facts, as well, have been dissected in interviews. The reason Morello is so heavily involved goes back to the E Street Band\u2019s 2013 tour of Australia. Steve Van Zandt had to sit that one out due to filming obligations with \u201cLilyhammer,\u201d so Springsteen called Morello \u2014 who had previously guested onstage for seething takes on \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d and \u201cDeath to My Hometown,\u201d and had soloed on the \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d track \u201cJack of All Trades.\u201d Morello suggested they revive Springsteen\u2019s version of \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d a song by an obscure L.A.-based band called the Havalinas that the E Street Band had originally covered for the (also obscure) 1996 EP \u201cBlood Brothers.\u201d Springsteen always seems to be working on one thing or another these days, but Morello\u2019s contribution seemed to inspire his direction. Soon, the Boss became interested in giving a proper studio treatment to a set of his lost songs, and Morello\u2019s guitar was supposedly the skeleton key that made everything work where it hadn\u2019t before.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice a trend, then: that \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d requires a lot of explanation. It\u2019s a shaky whole built from a contorted assembly of trivia and music that goes back nearly two decades. You might also start to notice the far-flung nature of its origins: Australia, a Southern California band as source material, Midwesterner-turned-Angeleno Morello as muse, a famous Jersey native at the helm. It gets even more spread out the more you parse it. For the first time, Springsteen recorded while on the road, having spontaneous recording sessions in Brisbane and Sydney. While the band was abroad, Aniello might check in via iChat. When they were in the country, people recorded all over, separately. Various members lived and recorded in Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York and Nashville. Many of these songs might be unstuck from time, but they are just as much unstuck from place. In either case, there is no specific center grounding \u201cHigh Hopes.\u201d\n\nIn the context of Springsteen\u2019s career and given his tendency to revisit old material, that murkiness of place is one of the more striking \u2014 and, potentially, detrimental \u2014 characteristics of \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d because the role of place in Springsteen\u2019s music has always been crucial. There are, of course, the classic settings: depressed New Jersey towns, the enchantment of the shore and the boardwalk, the mythology of New York City streets in the \u201960s and \u201970s. The realist and romantic strains in Springsteen\u2019s music alike stem from these recurring locales. They\u2019re the text he continues to draw inspiration from, whether it\u2019s the factory towns of the tri-state area giving way to post-industrial dilapidation over the course of his career, or the events of 9/11 giving his music a new sense of purpose in the 21st century. In some senses, you could argue that the latter example, in particular, is one of Springsteen talking about America in broad strokes, as an abstraction. But whenever Springsteen plays with legends and classic Americana imagery, it is rooted in the experience of the place both he and his music inextricably hail from. The desolation of the American spirit and the Midwest plains alike on \u201cNebraska\u201d or the spectral archetypes walking through the Southwest desert of \u201cDevils and Dust\u201d and \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d are both extensions of stories he\u2019d already told. They make sense, in his work, only in relation to his Northeast home. They are the haunted expanse at the end of the highways every Jersey-born character in his music dreams of escaping down.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Boss' latest album isn't grounded in a sense of place, and that makes it a frustrating listen", "title": "Springsteen gets lost: The rootlessness of \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Boss' latest album isn't grounded in a sense of place, and that makes it a frustrating listen", "title": "Springsteen gets lost: The rootlessness of \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/26/springsteen_gets_lost_the_rootlessness_of_high_hopes/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bruce_springsteen2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Boss' latest album isn't grounded in a sense of place, and that makes it a frustrating listen", "title": "Springsteen gets lost: The rootlessness of \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bruce_springsteen2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ryan Leas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bruce Springsteen, Editor's Picks, high hopes, Music, New Jersey, The Rising, Tom Morello, Wrecking Ball", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Bruce Springsteen, Editor's Picks, high hopes, Music, New Jersey, The Rising, Tom Morello, Wrecking Ball, Entertainment NewsWhen Bruce Springsteen announced his new album, \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d there was an uncommon tone to the reactions: wariness.\nCorrespondingly, the tone of interviews leading up to \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d have almost been preemptively defensive.\nYou\u2019ll notice a trend, then: that \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d requires a lot of explanation.\nFor the first time, Springsteen recorded while on the road, having spontaneous recording sessions in Brisbane and Sydney.\nWhat\u2019s conspicuous when you listen to \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d though, is the overbearing presence of Tom Morello, whom Springsteen has repeatedly referred to as a muse of sorts for the new record."}
