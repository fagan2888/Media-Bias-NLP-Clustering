The program was supposed to be a 12-month grace period, but President George W. Bush created a program that allows foreign former students who got degrees in certain math, science or technology fields to remain an additional 17 months.\n\nPresident Obama expanded the definitions to allow more foreigners to qualify for the program, and late last year, as part of his deportation amnesty, announced he would expand the program even further \u2014 though no details have been released yet.\n\nMr. North said the government has missed out on $4 billion in Social Security and Medicare taxes that would have been paid by workers who are subject to the payroll tax.\n\nUse of the 12-month program has risen 34 percent from 2009 to 2013, when there were 93,143 applications approved. But the 17-month tech program has grown much faster, more than tripling from fewer than 6,000 applications granted in 2009 to 19,115 approved in 2013.\n\nThe program is run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which polices the schools, who in turn are supposed to make sure their tech graduates are only working in the fields they studied.\n\nBut Mr. North, who pried records loose from the Homeland Security Department through open-records requests, said he found little evidence of schools being monitored, and he said counting on schools to police their graduates on their own is a tall order.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine, after finding a violation, that a college official would call ICE saying \u2018deport these alumni\u2019?\u201d he said. \u201cCan you imagine ICE doing anything with that information if it received it in the first place?\u201d\n\nThe University of Southern California was the heaviest user of both the 12-month OPT program and the 17-month extension program for science and technology workers, according to the report.\n\nUSC didn\u2019t respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said while the agency hasn\u2019t seen the report, its system does try to enforce the rules on record keeping and ensuring a student\u2019s work is associated with his degree.\n\nShe said the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which oversees OPT, has made improvements such as asking for more information for non-tech participants, and calculating the risk factor for students to break the rules, such as working too many hours.\n\nMs. Christensen said more enhancements are coming, including better guidance to schools about how to handle the program, and new reporting requirements for the schools to meet.\n\nThe OPT program is just one part of the intersection of immigration and tax laws that has gained attention recently.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s deportation amnesty, announced last year, creates a $3,000-per-worker incentive for some businesses to hire the illegal immigrants approved for that program. Those granted the amnesty are allowed to work in the U.S., but are ineligible for Obamacare, meaning that some companies who hires them but choose not to provide insurance for them won\u2019t have to pay the $3,000 per-worker penalty under Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate.\n\nGuest-worker programs, which is what the OPT program is closest to, are also coming under scrutiny after some tech workers at Southern California Edison, a tech firm, told Congress last month that they were laid off, then forced to train their replacements, who were foreigners brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa for high-skilled workers.\n\nMr. North said employers often use the OPT programs as a test-run before turning fully to H-1B guest-workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businesses are increasingly making use of a little-known program that lets them hire high-skilled foreign workers for internships, without having to pay their payroll taxes \u2014 creating what critics say is yet another perverse incentive to pick would-be immigrants over American workers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Businesses are increasingly making use of a little-known program that lets them hire high-skilled foreign workers for internships, without having to pay their payroll taxes \u2014 creating what critics say is yet another perverse incentive to pick would-be immigrants over American workers.", "title": "OPT program may cause Americans lose jobs to foreign workers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/13/opt-program-may-cause-americans-lose-jobs-foreign-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/11/Obama_Americas_Summit.JPEG-05c5c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/11/Obama_Americas_Summit.JPEG-05c5c.jpg", "description": "Businesses are increasingly making use of a little-known program that lets them hire high-skilled foreign workers for internships, without having to pay their payroll taxes \u2014 creating what critics say", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "OPT program may cause Americans lose jobs to foreign workers"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Labor, David North"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0125\"", "article_summary": "The OPT program is just one part of the intersection of immigration and tax laws that has gained attention recently.\nBut the 17-month tech program has grown much faster, more than tripling from fewer than 6,000 applications granted in 2009 to 19,115 approved in 2013.\nMr. North said employers often use the OPT programs as a test-run before turning fully to H-1B guest-workers.\nUse of the 12-month program has risen 34 percent from 2009 to 2013, when there were 93,143 applications approved.\nICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said while the agency hasn\u2019t seen the report, its system does try to enforce the rules on record keeping and ensuring a student\u2019s work is associated with his degree."}
