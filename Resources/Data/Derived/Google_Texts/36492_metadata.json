HOOD SHOOTING\n\nEven as Americans were still learning the horrible details of a shooting at Texas\u2019 Ft. Hood (stay with Fox News for the latest updates) the endless political struggle over firearms was already reasserting itself. But this time, there\u2019s a new wrinkle. Billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s gun-control group quickly produced statements on the shooting that asserted its agenda, with one saying \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know all of the facts, we do know that preventable gun deaths are a public health epidemic\u2026\u201d But the well-funded efforts for and against general gun control measures won\u2019t likely advance very far on the news of the Texas tragedy. The issue that\u2019s sure to become a focal point is the military policy requiring troops to be unarmed on base.\n\n[WaPo provides details the rules on carrying firearms on Fort Hood.]\n\nDisarmed - As details of the shooting came in Wednesday, Homeland security chairman Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, told Megyn Kelly he thinks soldiers should be able to carrying arms on base. \u201cThe problem here, and with Fort Hood, the prior Nidal Hasan case, is that they couldn\u2019t defend themselves because they were not allowed to carry weapons\u201d McCaul said, adding he thinks lawmaker need to revisit the current restrictions. In Hawaii, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was asked about the safety and security of military posts and bases. \u201cWhen we have these kinds of tragedies on our bases, something\u2019s not working,\u201d Hagel said. When the Army, especially the combat-ready brigades at Ft. Hood, need to call 911 to deal with a lone gunman, Americans might be understandably perplexed.\n\n[Speaking at a fundraiser shortly after the killings became public knowledge, President Obama told donors he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d and promised to get answers as to the cause.]\n\nLingering discussion - After this second shooting at Ft. Hood, the September massacre at Washington\u2019s Navy Yard and other on-base incidents, the idea of re-arming at least some of the uniformed personnel other than MPs is gaining momentum. It will soon visit Capitol and select races across the country.\n\nSTATES START UNDERCUTTING OBAMA\u2019S ENROLLMENT CLAIMS\n\nHow is the White House celebration of 7.1 million ObamaCare enrollees going so far? Well, judging by the president\u2019s proclamation that it \u201cwon\u2019t be news\u201d anymore when program stumbles, not so spiffy. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports on the findings from one of the first states to provide details on ObamaCare signups. While the state\u2019s ObamaCare program boasted 41,823 enrollments, only 25,899 had actually paid for and received coverage. That\u2019s bad. It\u2019s worse, in fact, than the current national estimate for how badly ObamaCare numbers have been padded by those who have clicked the box but not actually paid. But that one\u2019s not great either. National Journal reports that the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents a huge swath of the industry, is finding 15 to 20 percent didn\u2019t pay. If top drawer plans like those offered by the Blues see that kind of drop off, some cut-rate options are likely to be far worse.\n\n[Washington Free Beacon: \u201cPresident Barack Obama contended that the government did not \u201cmake a hard sell\u201d for Obamacare, despite his administration spending nearly $700 million to promote the law.\u201d]\n\nKOCH BRO. COMES OUT SWINGING AGAINST \u2018COLLECTIVISTS\u2019\n\nKoch Industries CEO Charles Koch offers a robust defense of his political activities in a WSJ OpEd today: \u201cInstead of encouraging free and open debate, collectivists strive to discredit and intimidate opponents. They engage in character assassination\u2026 Far from trying to rig the system, I have spent decades opposing cronyism and all political favors, including mandates, subsidies and protective tariffs \u2013 even when we benefit from them. I believe that cronyism is nothing more than welfare for the rich and powerful, and should be abolished\u2026 This is what happens when elected officials believe that people's lives are better run by politicians and regulators than by the people themselves. Those in power fail to see that more government means less liberty, and liberty is the essence of what it means to be American. Love of liberty is the American ideal.\u201d\n\nReid takes Koch habit to government Web site - Daily Caller: \u201cSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has escalated his war of words against the billionaire Koch brothers by publishing an anti-Koch hit piece on his Senate.gov page, despite official rules prohibiting the use of U.S. senators\u2019 .gov websites for political purposes. The Senate.gov web page belonging to the Nevada Democrat currently features a list a list of \u201cfacts\u201d about the Koch brothers, their limited government views and financial support for candidates that support these views. \u2018The Kochs want to abolish Social Security,\u2019 reads the page. \u2018The Kochs spent $400 million on misleading attack ads in the last election cycle.\u2019\u201d\n\nMEET MCCUTCHEON\n\nWSJ looks at the background of the man behind Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court Ruling easing campaign donations: \u201cShaun McCutcheon describes politics as a hobby, but on Wednesday he helped overhaul the rules of campaign finance. The Alabama businessman and Republican activist was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that spurred the Supreme Court to strike down limits on overall campaign contributions that donors can give to candidates and political parties. Mr. McCutcheon, an electrical engineer who founded Coalmont Electrical Development Corp., began his journey to the Supreme Court after bumping up against the $123,200 cap on what individuals can give to candidates, political parties and political-action committees.\u201d\n\nSENATE DEMS BALK AT OBAMA WEB AGENDA\n\nBreitbart: \u201cTwo more key Democrats are questioning the Obama administration's decision to cede some of America's control over the Internet. Sen. Edward Markey (D-MA) told Breitbart News there should be a \u2018high burden\u2019 for making such a change and that he's reviewing the decision, while Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) said he's inclined against the change.\u201d\n\nTHE JUDGES RULING: THE SIRENS OF SECRECY\n\nNew Today at Fox News Opinion: Judge Andrew Napolitano asks What if secrecy trumps the Constitution?: \u201cWhat if secrecy has replaced the rule of law? What if that replacement has left us in the dark about what the government knows and what it is doing? What if few in government believe in transparency? What if few in government believe in the Constitution? What do we do about it?\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nNew Yorker\u2019s David Remnick looks at the new nationalism animating the media in Putinist Russia: \u201cAll winter, [Russian ruler Vladimir Putin] has been tightening his hold on the few remaining media outlets that have not fallen into line\u2014TV Rain, Echo of Moscow radio, and Internet news sites like Lenta.ru. He dismantled the relatively professional RIA Novosti news agency and replaced it with a new entity, Rossiya Sogodnya (Russia Today), headed by Dmitri Kiselyov, the host of a program called \u2018News of the Week.\u2019 Kiselyov is an unforgiving propagandist. When talking about the Maidan\u2014the square that was the scene of the main anti-government demonstrations in Kiev\u2014well before the Crimean crisis, Kiselyov said, \u2018And what is Maidan? A very small dot on the body of Ukraine. If you burn it with a soldering iron, it will hurt. But if you apply the correct political technology\u2014bring it to the point of overheating, then show it through the magnifying glass of TV and the Internet to create the impression that the whole country is now supposedly like this\u2014it may prove to be fatal. In fact, Ukraine is more complicated than Maidan.\u2019\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

It's a record haul for the RGA, which is chaired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R).\u201d\n\nRebound? - A new poll from Monmouth University finds Gov.

His approval rating now stands at 51 percent, far from its once-command height but back in positive territory. Christie may not yet be out of the woods, though. The same poll shows nearly half of respondents felt he was involved in the retaliatory closing of traffic lanes to punish a politically uncooperative mayor.\n\nCRUZ: RELIGIOUS LIBERTY UNDER ATTACK\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas made his pitch to conservative Christian college students in a visit to Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., Wednesday. \u201cAs believers, we are called to action; not just sitting quietly and hiding our faith under a bushel but to stand and speak no matter what the consequence,\u201d the Texas senator told students at the school founded by the late Rev.

Handel\u2019s campaign pushed back on the remark. \u2018It is disappointing that David would demean someone who\u2014by no fault of her own\u2014moved out of an abusive home at age 17, and with her own hard work and determination, is the embodiment of the American Dream,\u2019 Handel campaign manager Corry Bliss said in a statement.\u201d\n\n[Karen Handel has launched a new radio ad touting former Gov.
