About 50 of America\u2019s top wrestlers live and train in Colorado Springs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so relieved,\u201d said Denver\u2019s Adeline Gray, a reigning world champion who watched the IOC drama unfold with teammates via television feed. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to know we\u2019re secure for 2020 and 2024. To know that the younger girls coming up are able to have that dream of Olympic gold is unbelievable.\u201d\n\nIn February, the IOC executive board voted to drop wrestling from its list of 25 \u201ccore sports,\u201d forcing wrestling to fight its way back in as a \u201cprovisional\u201d sport. The International Wrestling Federation (FILA) made its case Sunday before the full IOC, along with squash and a combined baseball-softball bid. All three sports knew only one would survive the vote.\n\nTo many, the retention of wrestling seemed like a no-brainer because it\u2019s a sport that traces its roots to the ancient Olympics in Greece. FILA president Nenad Lalovic began his presentation to the IOC by saying it was \u201cthe most important day in the 3,000-year history of our sport.\u201d\n\nAt USA Wrestling, that only served to emphasize what was at stake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of situations in life where things are a sure thing and they end up not being a sure thing,\u201d said Gray, a Bear Creek High School graduate who will defend her world title this month in Budapest, Hungary. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting that it\u2019s official. I\u2019ve had a lot of support from USA Wrestling and social media, everyone just being positive about it. But at the same time, you never know. It\u2019s nice to have this secure and know that we are going to be in those future Olympics.\u201d\n\nJoining Gray in her tense vigil were her parents and two grandparents.\n\n\u201cNow we can smile,\u201d said Gray\u2019s father, George, a Denver police detective. \u201cIt should never even have been on the table. But it kind of woke the sport up, and everybody\u2019s changing their viewpoints, \u2018Hey, we need to promote our sport even more.\u2019 I think wrestling\u2019s going to take off even more.\u201d\n\nGray and other members of the women\u2019s team leave Monday for training in Europe before the world championships Sept. 16-22. Gray, who wrestles at 158 pounds, competes Sept. 20. Men\u2019s teams already are overseas.\n\n\u201cI am very relieved,\u201d said women\u2019s coach Terry Steiner. \u201cSix months ago, things didn\u2019t look so good, but I think it was a blessing in disguise for the sport, maybe the best thing that ever happened to us. We really did unite, got together and fought.\n\n\u201cThey did what wrestlers do: They got together and they fought to the end. That\u2019s why we\u2019re feeling relieved today.\u201d\n\nGray was relieved not only for herself but for Reese Larramendy, a 9-year-old girl from Reno, Nev., who made bracelets for all of the U.S. women going to worlds.\n\n\u201cReese Larramendy was on my mind the whole time \u2014 now she can have that Olympic dream,\u201d Gray said. \u201cShe did an Olympic tour with me, and she\u2019s one of my biggest fans. I draw so much strength from her, it really is awesome.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jmeyer26", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wrestlers in Colorado Springs relieved after IOC votes to retain sport", "title": "Wrestlers in Colorado Springs relieved after IOC votes to retain sport", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/08/wrestlers-in-colorado-springs-relieved-after-ioc-votes-to-retain-sport/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130908__0909olywrestle2.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130908__0909olywrestle2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-08T11:37:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:06:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e33\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019ve had a lot of support from USA Wrestling and social media, everyone just being positive about it.\n\u201cI\u2019m so relieved,\u201d said Denver\u2019s Adeline Gray, a reigning world champion who watched the IOC drama unfold with teammates via television feed.\nCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Wrestlers around the world breathed a collective sigh of relief Sunday when the International Olympic Committee retained the sport in the Olympic program for the 2020 and 2024 Summer Games.\n\u201cReese Larramendy was on my mind the whole time \u2014 now she can have that Olympic dream,\u201d Gray said.\nAbout 50 of America\u2019s top wrestlers live and train in Colorado Springs."}
