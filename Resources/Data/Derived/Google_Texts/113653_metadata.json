The rule is expected to be finalized this spring. The FAA has also required all small-drone users to register on its website.\n\n\n\nThe new alliance of drone manufacturers includes 3D Robotics, DJI and GoPro \u2013 all three of which previously belonged to the Small UAV Coalition \u2013 as well as Parrot SA. Calvert said the new coalition will have a narrower focus on issues that specifically pertain to manufacturers.\n\n\n\nThe group will closely monitor the FAA rulemaking as well as a bill to reauthorize the agency that is moving through Congress, though the alliance is still working to develop official policy positions.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy highlighting innovation and emphasizing education, we intend to work with policymakers to ensure drones continue to be safely integrated into the national airspace,\u201d Calvert said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Drone Manufacturers Alliance will emphasize innovation and safety for all small drone users.", "description": "The Drone Manufacturers Alliance will emphasize innovation and safety for all small drone users.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Melanie Zanona", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Drone Manufacturers Alliance will emphasize innovation and safety for all small drone users.", "title": "Drone-makers launch advocacy group", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/275113-drone-makers-launch-advocacy-group", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/ciadrones_050115.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-04T16:44:35-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-04T16:44-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/275113-drone-makers-launch-advocacy-group", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-04T16:22-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Melanie Zanona", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-04T16:22:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T16:44:35-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/275113-drone-makers-launch-advocacy-group", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Drone Manufacturers Alliance will emphasize innovation and safety for all small drone users.", "card": "summary", "title": "Drone-makers launch advocacy group"}, "dcterms.title": "Drone-makers launch advocacy group"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2eb0\"", "article_summary": "Drone manufacturers are launching a new advocacy group as federal regulators work toward plans to integrate unmanned craft into the national airspace.\nThe Drone Manufacturers Alliance will push for policies that emphasize innovation and safety for people who operate small commercial and recreational drones.\nThe agency proposed a rule last year to allow the routine use of certain small commercial drones in the aviation system.\nThe new alliance of drone manufacturers includes 3D Robotics, DJI and GoPro \u2013 all three of which previously belonged to the Small UAV Coalition \u2013 as well as Parrot SA.\n\u201cBy highlighting innovation and emphasizing education, we intend to work with policymakers to ensure drones continue to be safely integrated into the national airspace,\u201d Calvert said."}
