For most people, the answer is ordinary \u2013 math class, the grocery store, the dentist \u2013 but no less forgettable.\n\nAri Fleischer, President George W. Bush's press secretary on September 11, is not one of those people. His front row seat to history is a compelling story and 12 years after the day the towers fell, Fleischer is tweeting his historic perspective on the day that changed America.\n\nIt caught \u2013 and held \u2013 our eye on the day that #UnitedWeStand, #wherewereyou and #neverforget trended on Twitter. Here is a sampling of compelling tweets from @AriFleischer:\n\n9:49 AM: The scene in the presidential holding room at the Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, FL. http://instagram.com/p/eH1FWHyvNb/\n\n9:58 AM: Here's a copy of one page from my 9/11 notes. pic.twitter.com/juDmalWMod\n\n10:35 AM: At 10:32, info came in saying \"Angel is next\".

Tillman ordered an armed AF Security man 2guard the stairs leading 2the cockpit.\n\n11:40 AM: Bush: \"I can't wait 2find out who did it.

Below us, the smoldering Pentagon was visible from Marine One.\n\nFor more on Fleischer's unique vantage point on this tragic day, check out his Twitter feed \u2013 @AriFleischer.

Shear\n\nHOT SOTS\n\nThe political bites of the day\n\n- Trust issues -\n\nPRESS SECRETARY JAY CARNEY AT THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING: \u201cIt is simply the case that Russia has not been constructive or helpful on this matter for the last two years, but there is an opportunity here, and they have laid it out pretty specifically. \u2026 It is absolutely the right thing to do and the responsible thing to do to explore this potential avenue.\u201d\n\nSPOKESWOMAN JEN PSAKI AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT BRIEFING: \u201cWe are going into this eyes wide open.

A lot of details still to be worked out and we will get into those tomorrow, but the upshot is that America will not attack Syria for gassing its citizens if they give up their chemicals weapons. \u2026 It is like if you decapitated a co-worker, so they are taking away your ax but you get to keep your job and your hatchet.\"\n\nTOP TWEETS\n\nWhat stopped us in 140 characters or less\n\nAndrew Kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew)\n\nAnthony Weiner's campaign ended with a dead last 5% finish, a run through McDonalds, the Lawrence interview & Sydney Leathers $40k implants.\n\nAlex Burns (@aburnspolitico)\n\n\"And that was the last anyone ever heard of Anthony Weiner.\"\n\nShira T.

But what was heartening was the outpouring of support from countries around the world.\n\nOne such country was Canada \u2013 who organized \u201cOperation Yellow Ribbon\u201d in response to the terrorist attack.\n\nThe humanitarian effort aimed at accommodating the tens of thousands of air passengers who were unable to reach their final destination because all air traffic in the United States was shut down following the attack.\n\nA total of 239 international flights were diverted to Canada in the day following September 11 and the government of Canada hosted thousands of stranded passengers in gymnasiums, schools and hotels.\n\nOn airport, Gander International Airport in Newfoundland, hosted a total of 38 flights, including 6,122 passengers and 473 crew. At the time, the total population of Gander was 10,000 people.\n\nThe generosity of the Canadian people and government were heralded after \u201cOperation Yellow Ribbon.\u201d\n\nGUT CHECK WINNER\u2019S CIRCLE\n\n(why aren\u2019t you in it)\n\nCongrats to Oliver B Janney (@CNNewsCrew) for correctly answering today's Gut Check trivia question.\n\nGOT NEWS?\n\nTips or comments?
