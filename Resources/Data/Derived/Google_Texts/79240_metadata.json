People are having their health plans canceled, and they are now stranded, unable to replace their old insurance policies with new plans purchased through the insurance exchanges because the Obamacare website is dysfunctional. President Obama is trying to prevent a chain reaction from getting out of control by proposing a system restart, requiring insurance companies to reinstate canceled plans for a year to give the administration time to \u201cfix\u201d the website and get the exchanges operational.\n\nThe turmoil with Obamacare is best understood not as an unexpected explosion, but rather as a case of controlled demolition gone haywire, in which the control mechanisms were short-circuited and the timing of the charges were out of sync. Rather than blowing up, the website and insurance exchanges were meant to manage and control the demolition of the rest of the private health insurance market. The president\u2019s latest maneuver is a damage-control effort to fix the website\u2019s wiring, delay and re-sync the demolition charges, in effect restarting the controlled demolition of private health insurance.\n\nObamacare is doomed to fail eventually, not because of a website failure, but rather because the law itself is internally contradictory and in violation of the fundamental laws of economics, the hallmark of all grandiose schemes of central planning and government control. In the process of failing, Obamacare will destroy not only the individual health insurance market (which there is now little doubt was an integral and intentional design objective of the measure), but also eventually eliminate the employer group health insurance market as well, which will doom Obamacare as we know it.\n\nFascinating isn\u2019t it? By signing onto Obamacare, the health insurance industry signed its own death warrant, and just as Lenin predicted, the industry also provided the rope with which to hang itself. When Obamacare goes, so goes the private health insurance industry. That\u2019s what happens when the business community allows its own greed to lure it into a Faustian bargain.\n\nWhether or not destruction of the private insurance market was an intentional booby trap planted by Obamacare\u2019s architects, there is no doubt that forward-looking activists and politicians on the left are now gleefully anticipating the destruction of private health insurance in the hopes of using the Obamacare implosion as the catalyst for replacing it with the president\u2019s and their own true objective: a centralized, single-payer system \u2014 real socialized medicine. The trick for them is to control the demolition process.\n\nFor opponents of Obamacare, the fact that the law will fail is of little consolation because the manner in which it fails and the configuration of political power that exists when it occurs will determine whether something better or worse arises from its ruins.\n\nWhatever the original intention of Obamacare\u2019s congressional architects, the intention of the Obama administration is now to preside over a controlled demolition of the private health insurance system while it hides behind a disingenuous, faux effort to \u201csave\u201d it through the insurance-exchange monstrosity, which it knows cannot possibly work even with the best possible website. Voters should not be as gullible as the health insurance industry continues to be about the law. Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to \u201cfix\u201d Obamacare are not about saving the private insurance industry. At the end of the day, the administration\u2019s efforts are all about damage control as the industry disintegrates so Obamacare can be replaced by real socialized medicine.\n\nThe destruction of the individual health insurance market already is well underway with millions of policy cancellations and rate hikes beginning to plow it under. Corrosion of the employer-provided, group health insurance market also has begun, as smaller employers rejigger their workforce to keep the number of full-time employees below the magic number of 50, which triggers the employer mandate in 2015. Even large firms that will not be able to avoid the employer mandate are refusing to hire full-time employees, preferring instead to fill the ranks with as many part-timers as possible, who are not covered under Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate.\n\nUnless the American people rise up in opposition to Obamacare soon, it will be too late to defuse the booby trap. The entire private health insurance industry will be effectively demolished within five years if the demolition is allowed to continue unabated. The 2016 presidential election will be the last exit before the abyss.\n\nWithout pushback, odds are on the administration\u2019s being able to manage the failure successfully between now and 2016. Mr. Obama is a master at outlasting the outrage, and in doing so preventing voter outrage from boiling over and bringing about a political realignment in Washington over Obamacare\u2019s failure. If the president successfully regains control of the demolition process, there will be no stopping the transformation of Obamacare into real single-payer, socialized medicine.\n\nThe bad news is millions of Americans will be harmed as Obamacare collapses. The good news is, with the 2014 midterm elections providing a skirmish ground and the main presidential battle still three years off, the continuing daily horror stories surrounding Obamacare will provide an opportunity, if handled properly, to persuade the public that the law cannot be fixed, that a socialized, single-payer system will be worse, and that a political realignment in Washington is necessary to prevent the Obamacare disaster from becoming a socialized-medicine catastrophe.\n\nLawrence A.
