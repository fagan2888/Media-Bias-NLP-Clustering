On Thursday, a conservative blog reported that the former senator will keynote an April GOP fundraiser \u2026 in Iowa.\n\nIf Brown plans to challenge Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), something he\u2019s flirted with for the better part of a year now, the former Massachusetts senator has chosen a very unusual way to lay the groundwork. But those who know the 54-year-old Republican say it doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t. He\u2019s just a one-man band who will do it on his own terms and timetable.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHalf a dozen people who have spoken with Brown recently about his future say he is genuinely conflicted about whether to run. Several of them said Brown thinks he has until April to make up his mind, or possibly even closer to the June 13 filing deadline. But another person familiar with his thinking cautioned an announcement might come as early as the first week of March.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Scott Brown on Twitter)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an enigma, this guy,\u201d said one person in touch with Brown. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel pressure \u2026 Scott\u2019s a unique person. That\u2019s why he thinks he can wait until April. He\u2019s pretty much holding the cards.\u201d\n\nUnique, detached, aloof \u2014 call it what you like.\n\n\u201cDoing what I said I would do,\u201d Brown emailed POLITICO nonchalantly last week, in response to the latest query about what he\u2019s up to. \u201cI\u2019m settling in, adjusting, introducing myself and helping \u2026 Keep you posted.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Scott Brown's career)\n\nNational Republicans are salivating over the possibility of a Brown candidacy. His name ID and fundraising prowess would instantly put a safe Democratic seat in play, and tilt a fall election map that already favors the GOP even more in the party\u2019s direction. The GOP needs to pick up six seats to win a majority.\n\nThe will-he-or-won\u2019t-he conjecture has become the biggest parlor game in New Hampshire politics since Brown packed up a U-Haul in December and moved from Wrentham, Mass., to his longtime vacation home in Rye, N.H.\n\nThe conflicting clues can be perplexing \u2014 and sometimes strange. One day, he changes his Twitter handle to remove the reference to Massachusetts (must be running). Then an email blast to his supporters warns of \u201c5 Signs You\u2019ll Get Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\u201d (maybe not). One hour, Fox News says Brown is no longer under contract (looks like he\u2019s in); later in the day it turns out he\u2019s renewed his on-air analyst deal (never mind).\n\nSince the start of the year on Twitter, Brown has posted a picture of himself hanging out at D.C.\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Milano, announced he signed up for a charity bike ride this summer in Massachusetts and accidentally tweeted out gibberish during a morning jog. At 11:45 p.m. Friday, he posted that he\u2019s heading to Taiwan for a speech.\n\n( PHOTOS: Republican 2016 contenders)\n\nAdding to his seat-of-the-pants operating style is the fact that Brown has no formal advisers. He fields his own press inquiries, sometimes texting directly with reporters and sending late-night missives that have not been spell-checked.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown has made some calls to prominent New Hampshire GOP politicians, but many rings remain unkissed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just freelancing,\u201d said a top Granite State operative. \u201cThis is all coming from him \u2026 He\u2019s acting like a lone ranger.\u201d\n\nAllies say Brown\u2019s rawness and accessibility speak to his authenticity. A hardscrabble upbringing toughened him up and gave him an independent streak that he has long carried; it\u2019s just more pronounced now because he has no handlers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a stuffed suit in D.C. who walks around and sounds like a politician,\u201d said a Republican strategist who has worked for Brown in the past and remains in touch. \u201cHe drinks beers, roots for the Red Sox and drives a real truck.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats call him an unserious attention seeker and predict he won\u2019t actually go through with it.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Fox News: Brown contract renewed)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to look like Brown is playing a cheap trick on New Hampshire Republicans,\u201d said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s Matt Canter.\n\nThose who have spoken with Brown say he has entered a new phase of his deliberations \u2014 from whether he can win to whether he really wants to run.\n\nIn December, he was exploring whether Shaheen could be defeated. He asked the National Republican Senatorial Committee to hold off on running an internal poll until after the holidays, once he had officially relocated from Massachusetts and a conservative super PAC finished running a six-figure TV buy attacking the incumbent over her support for Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The 54-year-old Republican is called unique, detached and aloof and his next step is a mystery.", "title": "Scott Brown, man of mystery", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/scott-brown-keeps-everyone-guessing-103807.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/22/scott-brown-plunge-union-leader.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Scott Brown,Massachusetts,New Hampshire", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The 54-year-old Republican is called unique, detached and aloof and his next step is a mystery.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0de3\"", "article_summary": "( Also on POLITICO: Scott Brown on Twitter)\u201cHe\u2019s an enigma, this guy,\u201d said one person in touch with Brown.\nThose who have spoken with Brown say he has entered a new phase of his deliberations \u2014 from whether he can win to whether he really wants to run.\nMeanwhile, Brown has made some calls to prominent New Hampshire GOP politicians, but many rings remain unkissed.\nBut those who know the 54-year-old Republican say it doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t.\n\u201cI\u2019m settling in, adjusting, introducing myself and helping \u2026 Keep you posted.\u201d( PHOTOS: Scott Brown's career)National Republicans are salivating over the possibility of a Brown candidacy."}
