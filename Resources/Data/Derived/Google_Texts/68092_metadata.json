The argument is that its Independent Payment Advisory Board \u2013 which has been dubbed a \u201cdeath panel\u201d by critics \u2013 is unconstitutional because it would make life-and-death decisions for patients.\n\nThe government argued, in a brief that the justices had required, there\u2019s no real issue, nothing to determine and the case should be dropped.\n\nBut the Goldwater Institute says if that happens, it will violate the constitutional rights of Americans and damage them irreparably.\n\nWND reported when the institute filed its petition alleging Obamacare \u201cintroduces sweeping intrusions into the personal lives of Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe act\u2019s linchpin is the \u2018individual mandate,\u2019 which forces virtually every American to purchase government-approved health insurance or pay a penalty for refusing to do so,\u201d the petition said.\n\nFrom the past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is available some critically important advice, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIt argues that \u201cto purchase a health insurance plan, a person must disclose medical and other personal information to various third parties, including the insurance company issuing the policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce the person relinquishes that information to the insurance company, it is subject to seizure by the government without a warrant under the voluntary relinquishment to private third parties doctrine, and a host of federal and state laws,\u201d the petition says.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, data forfeited to obtain insurance is subject to broad and irremediable government appropriation, and the threat of further dissemination is increased by the many well-publicized incidents of security breaches involving the ACA\u2019s insurance hub, healthcare.gov.\u201d\n\nThe case is on behalf of Nick Coons, a small business owner in Arizona, and Dr. Eric Novack.\n\nThe case also asserts IPAB was given \u201cvirtually unlimited power over both public and private health care in America\u201d and would make \u201crecommendations\u201d that automatically would become law without approval of Congress or the signature of a president.\n\nAnd those decisions are set above \u201cjudicial review.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur government is designed to check and balance itself \u2013 if one branch overreaches, another branch is there to correct it. Ultimately, we want the court to strike down IPAB,\u201d said Olsen.\n\nGovernment attorneys said the lower court held that the privacy claim was \u201cunripe,\u201d because the plaintiff had not explained \u201ca specific disclosure\u201d of information, so it could not \u201cevaluate his claim\u201d of a violation of his constitutional right.\n\nAnd the lower court held Novack\u2019s challenge failed because \u201cCongress may delegate authority to an administrative body so long as it \u2018clearly delineate[s] the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court of appeals correctly held that petitioners\u2019 claims are unripe, and its decision does not conflict with any decision of this court or another court of appeals. No further review is warranted,\u201d the administration argued.\n\nHowever, the one successful challenge to Obamacare was turned down at the appellate level, only to be given life by the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd Goldwater responded that Obamacare \u201crequires Coons to either purchase government-approved health insurance \u2013 compliance with which would inevitably require Coons to disclose the personal information to third parties such as insurance companies \u2013 or to pay the monetary penalty to preserve his privacy. \u2026 The only way for Coons to legally avoid disclosing the information is for him to pay the penalty. This is sufficient to state a claim for an unconstitutional condition on the exercise of his privacy rights.\u201d\n\nIn other words, citizens can\u2019t be forced to pay to exercise their constitutional rights.\n\nAnd the attorneys for the plaintiffs warned that if the IPAB is not evaluated now, there may never come another opportunity.\n\n\u201cHe [Novack] has a personal stake because he is subject to, and affected by, IPAB. \u2026 His facial separation-of-powers claim challenges the creation of IPAB itself, not any particular action,\u201d the latest brief explains.\n\n\u201cThe unconstitutional provisions governing IPAB are already operating now, and because the ACA frees the board of any meaningful checks and balances, waiting to consider this constitutional challenge could cause irreparable injury.\u201d\n\nThe filing cites Obama\u2019s attempt to bind future Congresses to his plan, in that \u201coutside of a short window in 2017 where IPAB can only be repealed by an unprecedented super-majority vote the ACA completely insulates IPAB from repeal and forever prohibits Congress from replacing IPAB proposals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus if this court does not take this case now, doctors like Novack will be left without recourse,\u201d the Goldwater brief explained. \u201cIt is this unprecedented consolidation of government power in this unaccountable board \u2013 not any action IPAB may or may not take \u2026 that cries out for immediate review. IPAB\u2019s absolute immunity from judicial or administrative review separates it from its administrative predecessors.\u201d\n\nIPAB will have the authority to approve or disapprove payments for services and set the level of payment, in an attempt to control Medicare costs.\n\nMembers of Congress previously submitted a friend-of-the-court brief expressing just how dangerous the panel can be for Medicare recipients.\n\n\u201cWe already know what will happen with IPAB. We had experience with something similar in my home state of Tennessee with TNCARE. As reimbursement rates are cut to doctors, access was reduced for the needy. I fear for Medicare recipients,\u201d said Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., a doctor.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., a dentist, said the panel \u201cputs government between me and my patients.\u201d\n\nIn a commentary published in the Wall Street Journal, Roe and Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., also a doctor, called IPAB a patient\u2019s nightmare and bad for doctors.\n\n\u201cWhy is this board dangerous? Because there is nothing \u2018advisory\u2019 about its vast powers. IPAB\u2019s mandate is to deliver on one of Obamacare\u2019s central promises: Medicare cost-containment,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cThe law gives this board sweeping authority to do so, with virtually no constraints. The statute says IPAB can take any and all actions necessary to control Medicare costs. Although it is prohibited from \u2018rationing,\u2019 that term is nowhere defined in the Affordable Care Act. Hence IPAB can control costs by lowering physician reimbursements \u2013 thus driving more doctors away from treating Medicare patients \u2013 or by reducing the services eligible for reimbursement. In other words, by rationing care.\u201d\n\nThe rationing of care is why, critics say, it is being called a \u201cdeath panel.\u201d IPAB members would only need to lower physician reimbursement for a particular life-saving procedure to an impossible level, and doctors would be unable to provide the service, meaning some patients could die.\n\n\u201cIPAB will consist of 15 members appointed by the president, all of whom may be from the same party. If the president does not nominate anyone to the board, or if the Senate fails to confirm nominees, IPAB\u2019s powers must be unilaterally exercised by the Health and Human Services secretary. In short, the power to alter Medicare potentially can be consolidated in a single individual,\u201d the two doctors wrote in the Journal.\n\n\u201cExecutive agencies ordinarily are subject to open meetings and to notice and comment procedures. Not IPAB. The Affordable Care Act characterizes IPAB\u2019s actions as \u2018recommendations.\u2019 This is a misnomer; its recommendations automatically become law unless Congress acts to stop it.\n\n\u201cFinally, the Affordable Care Act insulates IPAB\u2019s decisions from judicial review, thus achieving an unprecedented trifecta of bureaucratic rule: an administrative agency whose actions cannot be checked by the executive, legislative or judicial branches. This setup shreds the separation of powers that is fundamental to the U.S. Constitution, under which no agency can be rendered exempt from democratic processes and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nYet another still-developing case against Obamacare alleges it is unconstitutional because it was a tax bill that originated in the U.S. Senate, instead of the House as the Constitution requires, and because Obama has made numerous changes to the law without approval from Congress.\n\nFrom the past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is available some critically important advice, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "It\u2019s not like the justices at the U.S. Supreme Court are unfamiliar with Obamacare.
