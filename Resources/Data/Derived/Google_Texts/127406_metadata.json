Government has become so oppressive, restricting us with new regulations, that our only hope is for some of us to refuse to cooperate.\n\nMurray\u2019s suggestion -- laid out in \u201cBy the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission,\u201d will make some people nervous. He argues citizens and companies should start openly defying all but the most useful regulations, essentially ones that forbid assault, theft and fraud.\n\nHe writes, \u201cAmerica is no longer the land of the free. We are still free in the sense that Norwegians, Germans and Italians are free. But that\u2019s not what Americans used to mean by freedom.\u201d\n\nHe quotes Thomas Jefferson\u2019s observation that a good government is one \u201cwhich shall restrain men from injuring one another (and) shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut our government today tries to do much more.\n\nWhile we try to invent new things, government constantly seeks new ways to control us. The number of federal crimes on the books is now 50 percent larger than back in 1980 -- a time when many people mistakenly thought the U.S. would cut the size of government.\n\nMurray says, correctly, that no ordinary human being can ever be sure how to obey the 810 pages of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 1,024 pages of the Affordable Care Act or 2,300 pages of Dodd-Frank.\n\nWhat if we all stopped trying? The government can\u2019t put everyone in jail. Maybe by disobeying enough stupid laws, we can persuade judges that only rules that prevent clear, real harm to individuals should be enforced: \u201cno harm, no foul.\u201d\n\nLaw is not always the best indication of what is good behavior. Riots in places such as Ferguson and Baltimore remind us that even cops sometimes behave badly.\n\nNo one wants to see law break down so completely that people get hurt, but historian Thaddeus Russell reminds us that many freedoms we take for granted exist not because the government graciously granted liberties to us but because of lawbreakers.\n\nBootleggers, \u201crobber barons\u201d who did things like transporting ferry passengers in defiance of state-granted monopolies and tea-dumping American revolutionaries ignored laws they opposed. Sometimes these scofflaws loved liberty more than our Founders. George Washington led troops against whiskey makers to enforce taxes.\n\nMore recently, Uber decided it would ignore some cab regulations. It\u2019s good they did because Uber usually offers better and safer service. Today, Uber is too popular for government to stamp out.\n\nEdward Snowden knew the legal consequences he\u2019d face for revealing NSA spying on American citizens but did it anyway. I\u2019m not yet sure if he did the right thing, but conservatives and leftists alike should admit that sometimes laws ought to be bent or broken.\n\nInstead, each political party defends civil disobedience unless the people doing it are people that faction doesn\u2019t like. The right loves ranchers who resist federal land managers but doesn\u2019t like people who flout immigrations laws. The left likes pot smokers but whines about corporations ignoring complicated environmental regulations.\n\nMaybe most of these laws should be ignored by most of us.\n\nPoliticians themselves don\u2019t always play by the rules. My last column was about how the Clintons get away with breaking rules. But I made a mistake that I must correct: I said the Clinton Foundation donated only 9 percent of its money to charity. Sorry, that was wrong. The Clintons and their flunkies were worse than that.\n\nIn 2013, the foundation collected $144 million but spent only $8.8 million on charity. That\u2019s only 6 percent.\n\nWhen Bill and Hillary say they want to \u201chelp people,\u201d they\u2019re talking about themselves. I don\u2019t want to be forced to obey such people.\n\nJohn Stossel writes for Creators Syndicate.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, West Chester Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "title": "Commentary: Maybe some government rules are made to be disobeyed", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20150514/LOCAL1/150519885", "image": {"width": "1958px", "identifier": "http://local.dailylocal.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailylocal.png?052016", "height": "1025px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Commentary: Maybe some government rules are made to be disobeyed"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailylocal.com", "description": "Charles Murray, already controversial for writing books on how welfare hurts the poor, on ethnic differences in IQ and on happiness and good government, has written a new book that argues that it\u2019s time for civil disobedience.
