Authorities say a helicopter carrying three people has crashed near the Baltimore airport.

Lt. Ariel Jackson with the Anne Arundel Fire Department said the helicopter went down Saturday near the Amtrak tracks by the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. He said three people in the helicopter were evacuated and are currently being evaluated for injuries. He said no fatalities have been reported.

Jackson said crews are battling a large brush fire caused by the crash.

BWI says the incident is not affecting airline operations. But train travelers experienced some delays.

All Amtrak service between Baltimore and Washington was temporarily placed on hold due to the incident. Service resumed Saturday afternoon but officials said to expect residual delays.
