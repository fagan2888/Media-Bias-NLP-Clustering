The Republican Party of Kentucky got lots of money in June from out-of-state givers who have already given the maximum - or near the maximum - allowed to the re-election campaign of U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.

Among them are wrestling promoter Vince McMahon and his wife Linda McMahon, of Greenwich, CT, who each gave $5,000 to McConnell's re-election campaign way back in 2012.

According to a report posted Sunday on the website of the FEC, Vince and Linda McMahon each gave $10,000 to the Republican Party of Kentucky on June 30.

They are among scores of out-of-state contributors who have given to McConnell and are following up with contributions to the RPK, whose priorities in the fall election - naturally - include McConnell's re-election.

Besides the contributions of the McMahons, a bigger bundle of contributions to the RPK in June came from executives of Leon Medical Centers in Miami, Florida, who long ago maxed-out in their contributions to the McConnell campaign. Those June RPK contributions: Benjamin Leon III, Miami, Fla., Leon Medical Centers, $10,000; Benjamin Leon Jr., Miami, Leon Medical Centers, $10,000; Silvia Leon, Miami, Leon Medical Centers, $10,000; Albert Maury, Miami, Fla., Leon Medical Centers, $10,000.

The RPK also got lots of money in June from the Frankfort lobbyist corps. Here are the contributions I spotted to the Kentucky GOP in June from lobbyists and spouses of lobbyists:

Kelley Abell, Louisville, $1,000; Laura Babbage, Lexington, $500; Greg Brotzge, Louisville, $150; Virginia Gray, Hopkinsville, $250; Prentice Harvey, Frankfort, $1,000; David Huber, Louisville, $1,000; Patrick Jennings, Goshen, $3,000; Ann B. McBrayer, Lexington, $1,000; Cynthia McCarthy, Louisville, $10,000; John T. McCarthy III, Louisville, $5,000; Libby Milligan, Louisville, $750; Kevin Payton, Frankfort, $250; J. Ronald Pryor, Goshen, $1,000; Karen M. Pryor, Goshen, $1,000; Michael Rust, Louisville, $1,000; Nancy Rust, Louisville, $1,000; Leigh Thacker, Louisville, $250; David Thompson, Georgetown, $500; Amy Wickliffe, Lexington, $2,595; Marc Wilson, $1,000.

Out-of-state givers and lobbyists helped push total receipts to the RPK to $576,478 for the month.

The party reported $1,915,647 on hand as of June 30.

The Kentucky Democratic Party's finance report for the month of June had not yet been posted on the FEC website as of Sunday morning.
