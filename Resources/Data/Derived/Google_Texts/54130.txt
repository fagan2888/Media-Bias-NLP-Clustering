Beaufort County Deputies say a drunk driver led them on a chase before crashing into a house.

Deputies say James Byrd was driving slowly and swerving on Highway 264 early Saturday morning.

Deputies say they tried to pull him over but he refused to stop.

Eventually he crashed the vehicle into a residence on Hackney Avenue. No one in the residence was hurt.

Byrd faces several charges related to this incident. He was also served with three outstanding orders for arrest from Pitt and Wilson Counties.

Byrd's passenger, Ian Peed, was arrested and charged with possessing an open container in the vehicle and intoxicated and disruptive behavior.

The vehicle was seized under the state's "run and done" law.
