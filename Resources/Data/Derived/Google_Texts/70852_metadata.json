That criticism has grown more fierce in recent months, as the terrorist network has initiated or inspired attacks beyond those borders \u2014 in Paris; in Beirut; in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt; and, perhaps, last week in the United States.\n\nObama has delivered formal remarks to the nation from the Oval Office twice before \u2014 in the summer of 2010, as oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico from a broken well, and a few months later, as he announced the end of combat operations in Iraq, declaring that he had made good on a central promise from his campaign.\n\nHe has not done it since.\n\nMost of the dramatic moments of Obama\u2019s presidential oratory have happened outside the Oval Office. He announced the killing of Osama bin Laden in a speech from the East Room, a location that allows him to stride up to the lectern through the Cross Hall of the White House as the cameras are rolling.\n\nHe used the same location to hail the passage of his signature health care initiative, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd throughout his presidency, Obama and his aides have sought backdrops outside Washington. A speech directed toward Muslims worldwide was delivered at Cairo University in Egypt. He talked about the economy at Georgetown University. He celebrated civil rights at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. And he discussed the war in Afghanistan at the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nAides have said the Oval Office is suited more for a short address than the longer speeches Obama sometimes favors. And in today\u2019s media age, it can sometimes be difficult to persuade networks to carry a short Oval Office address live in the middle of a lucrative prime-time television lineup.\n\nSome of Obama\u2019s media advisers have long believed that sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office, as presidents like Ronald Reagan usually did, is no longer an effective image in a fast-paced, YouTube world. The desk, sitting between the viewer and the president, becomes an obstacle for those watching, a distraction from the president\u2019s message, they said.\n\nThose aides \u2014 some of whom have left the White House \u2014 also believed in the power of the image of Obama walking up to a lectern in the East Room.\n\nBut there is also history to think about, and there is no doubt that the Oval Office backdrop conveys the historic nature of a moment. In addressing the terrorist threat on Sunday, Obama clearly hopes to achieve that goal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When the cameras blink on for Sunday night\u2019s address on the San Bernardino, California, shootings and the threat from the Islamic State, President Barack Obama will deliver it from the Oval Office, a venue for speechmaking that he has largely shunned during his presidency.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When the cameras blink on for Sunday night\u2019s address on the San Bernardino, California, shootings and the threat from the Islamic State, President Barack Obama will deliver it from the Oval Office, a venue for speechmaking that he has largely shunned during his presidency.", "title": "For speech, Obama selects a setting he usually shuns: The Oval Office", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/BDC_b_logo_transparent_background_og.jpg", "creator": "@BostonDotCom", "site": "@BostonDotCom", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/smalltile.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Boston.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When the cameras blink on for Sunday night\u2019s address on the San Bernardino, California, shootings and the threat from the Islamic State, President Barack Obama will deliver it from the Oval Office, a venue for speechmaking that he has largely shunned during his presidency.", "title": "For speech, Obama selects a setting he usually shuns: The Oval Office", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/e6222b06af2a4f93ae1492bd3cecc065-a826db64b1e64b908d1aac7f45cf0eb1-0-850x478.jpg", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2015/12/06/for-speech-obama-selects-a-setting-he-usually-shuns-the-oval-office", "type": "article"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boston", "section": "News", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-12-06T21:16:26-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mediumtile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Aides have said the Oval Office is suited more for a short address than the longer speeches Obama sometimes favors.\nBut there is also history to think about, and there is no doubt that the Oval Office backdrop conveys the historic nature of a moment.\nAnd in today\u2019s media age, it can sometimes be difficult to persuade networks to carry a short Oval Office address live in the middle of a lucrative prime-time television lineup.\nMost of the dramatic moments of Obama\u2019s presidential oratory have happened outside the Oval Office.\nIn addressing the terrorist threat on Sunday, Obama clearly hopes to achieve that goal."}
