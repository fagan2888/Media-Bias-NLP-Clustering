But since she\u2019s the major wage earner in her household, she doesn\u2019t have much choice. Six days a week, she drags herself to the Santa Cruz restaurant where she works 10- and 12-hour days as head prep cook. She rarely gets a break and often goes the entire shift without sitting down. She\u2019s developed arthritis in her fingers.\n\n\u201cHere in California, in America, people still aren\u2019t making enough money to survive.\u201d\n\nLizeth Vizcaya, UCSC student interviewer\n\n\u201cThere are times I want to quit,\u201d she says in Spanish, while eating a breakfast of tortillas and frijoles in the dim light of her tiny kitchen. \u201cBut I can\u2019t, because many jobs pay less for more work.\u201d\n\nD\u00edaz, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy, has to work more than 60 hours a week in order to make ends meet on her $11.50 per hour wage. Still, her paycheck \u2014 which never includes overtime pay (she\u2019s paid in cash for anything above 40 hours) \u2014doesn\u2019t come close to covering the cost of living in this coastal California town. She, her husband, their two small children and four other adults share a cramped two-bedroom apartment. A metal-framed bunk bed dominates the living room. The other adults in the house earn less money per hour than D\u00edaz.\n\nThey are all members of Santa Cruz County\u2019s working poor. This population of low-wage earners was the focus of a recent UC Santa Cruz study, \u201cWorking for Dignity.\u201d Based on interviews with more than 1,300 people, researchers looked at working conditions of the county\u2019s lowest-paid workers, and put a human face on the unseen labor force that supports the base of the Central Coast\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThis was a \u2018census of the invisible,\u2019 \u201d says lead author Steve McKay, an associate professor of sociology who also directs the UC Santa Cruz Center for Labor Studies. \u201cOur goal was to look at the numbers, but also tell the stories of low-wage workers in Santa Cruz County.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s release is timely. The Santa Cruz City Council is debating raising the minimum wage and recently commissioned a study looking at the impact of an increase. Other California cities have already begun raising their local minimum wage with San Francisco planning to reach $15 an hour by 2018 and Los Angeles planning to do the same by 2020.\n\nBridging the Town-Gown Gap\n\nMcKay conceived of the \u201cWorking for Dignity\u201d study after he was contacted by the Watsonville office of California Rural Legal Assistance. The agency was looking for data on the low-wage earners of Santa Cruz County.\n\nNo such data existed.\n\nSo McKay launched the project, with an idea to use students to survey low-wage workers. He connected with the Chicano Latino Research Center on campus to train students how to conduct surveys and collect data. He also redesigned his \u201cWork and Society\u201d class into a research-based course. Students learned research methods, and then McKay sent them off on interviews.\n\n\u201cThere is often a town-gown split in university towns,\u201d says McKay, referring to the divide that can exist between a campus that generally has money and people in the surrounding community who may not. \u201cThis project epitomizes the role that the university should play in the state, building new knowledge and training people to identify and respond to the needs of the local community.\u201d\n\nStudents met with interviewees at bus stops, parks, laundromats and the farmer\u2019s market in Watsonville\u2019s central plaza. In addition to interviewing workers, students handed out information about workers\u2019 rights and where they could go for help if they suspect their rights are being violated.\n\nMore than 100 students were involved in different aspects of the two-year project.\n\n\u201cIt was an eye-opening experience,\u201d says Lizeth Vizcaya, a community studies major. She described interviewing a strawberry picker who was paid $9 for each box he filled with smaller cartons of fruit. After sorting through berries and discarding unripe or rotten fruit, labor he didn\u2019t get paid for, Vizcaya says his average wage amounted to $4 an hour. \u201cHere in California \u2014 in America \u2014 people still aren\u2019t making enough money to survive,\u201d Vizcaya said.\n\nTo define low-wage worker, the study used the California Poverty Measure (CPM), an index designed by the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality to factor cost of living into the measure of poverty. By that measure, the poverty line for a family of four living in Santa Cruz County is $32,884, or an hourly wage of $15.81. Twenty-two percent of county residents live below the CPM.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a living wage \u2013 it\u2019s subsistence level,\u201d says McKay. \u201cPeople will be in real trouble if they fall below that.\u201d\n\nThe median wage of those surveyed fell short of that poverty measure \u2014 $10 an hour. And, like D\u00edaz, nearly two-thirds of the surveyed group (62 percent) said they were the major earner for their household.\n\n\u201cJust try to imagine living in Santa Cruz on $10 an hour,\u201d says McKay. \u201cIt would be really, really tough.\u201d\n\nThe result is a vulnerable workforce, living paycheck to paycheck, dependent upon the whim of employers. Interviewees reported a high rate of labor violations, including wage theft, health and safety violations, sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Forty-one percent said they worked overtime hours and, of those, 38 percent did not receive overtime wages. More than seven in 10 (71 percent) said they either did not get breaks or did not get paid for breaks.\n\nThere was also racial disparity between the experiences of low-wage white workers versus low-wage Latino workers, the two main racial groups in Santa Cruz County. Of those who worked overtime, 28 percent of whites reported not receiving overtime pay, and 58 percent of Latinos reported not receiving overtime pay.\n\nPutting a human face on labor\n\nA primary goal of the \u201cWorking for Dignity\u201d project was to document the human experience behind low-wage labor \u2014 and to put a face on the often-invisible working poor. McKay partnered with the university\u2019s Everett Program, which helps students develop skills to generate social change, to create a website that would feature digital stories and photographs of low-wage workers.\n\nStudent Edward Ramirez led the project\u2019s documentary team during his senior year at UC Santa Cruz. Ramirez, a Los Angeles native, was attracted to the project because his parents, who immigrated to the U.S. from El Salvador during its Civil War, had scraped by as low-wage workers throughout his entire life. \u201cI always wanted to give them honor, because society didn\u2019t honor them,\u201d he says.\n\nWorking with the local day labor center, Ramirez set out to photograph people who sought day work in various jobs in the area.\n\nOne of the biggest rewards for Ramirez was giving the workers their portraits, mounted in wooden frames that he made by hand. \u201cIt was great seeing their faces looking at images of themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were filled with pride.\u201d\n\nA version of this story first appeared in the California Health Report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A UC Santa Cruz professor and his students interviewed 1,380 low-wage workers, finding reports of wage violations and vulnerable lives.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Santa Cruz Students Track Working Poor with 'Census of the Invisible'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/11\\/santa-cruz-students-track-working-poor-census-invisible\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-11 11:00:11\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-12 16:18:14\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":96312,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Latino Health\",\"News\",\"Working Poor\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/DayLabo2.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "A UC Santa Cruz professor and his students interviewed 1,380 low-wage workers, finding reports of wage violations and vulnerable lives.", "title": "Santa Cruz Students Track Working Poor with \u2018Census of the Invisible\u2019", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/11/santa-cruz-students-track-working-poor-census-invisible/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/Stirringg2-400x322.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "latino health,news,working poor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Six days a week, she drags herself to the Santa Cruz restaurant where she works 10- and 12-hour days as head prep cook.\nThey are all members of Santa Cruz County\u2019s working poor.\n\u201cOur goal was to look at the numbers, but also tell the stories of low-wage workers in Santa Cruz County.\u201dThe report\u2019s release is timely.\nStudent Edward Ramirez led the project\u2019s documentary team during his senior year at UC Santa Cruz.\n\u201cThis was a \u2018census of the invisible,\u2019 \u201d says lead author Steve McKay, an associate professor of sociology who also directs the UC Santa Cruz Center for Labor Studies."}
