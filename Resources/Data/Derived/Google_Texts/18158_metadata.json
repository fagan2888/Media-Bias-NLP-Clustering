Medical students begin rotations in clinical areas, including hospitals, private practices, clinics and nursing homes, during their third and fourth years.\n\nJack Billi, M.D., associate vice president for medical affairs at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor, said some medical schools, like Michigan\u2019s, have changed their curriculums to add patient-care experiences in the first two years.\n\nBilli said patient contact includes learning physical diagnosis and a concept known as the family-centered experience. Using family volunteers, students learn to see patients as whole persons and how various illnesses affect their daily lives.\n\nShortage of doctors needs a federal solution\n\nHoven said another problem the AMA has recognized is the 17-year freeze on Medicare payments for resident training at teaching hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe are supporting a bill (Resident Shortage Act) in Congress to add 15,000 slots over the next five years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe not only want to open up slots, but we want to look at alternative ways to pay for residency training.\u201d\n\nHoven said some teaching hospitals and states currently pay to expand residency slots to meet patient demand. She said insurance companies could chip in more, as well.\n\nDespite predictions that the U.S. by 2025 will face a shortage of more than 100,000 physicians, including up to 8,000 in Michigan, Congress has not lifted the cap on Medicare-funded residency slots since 1997.\n\nArsiwala, who also is president of Michigan Urgent Care Centers in Livonia, said a good thing is that Michigan has increased the number of medical schools to train students.\n\n\u201cBut graduate medical education (residency) slots have decreased, so the students graduating from our medical schools are doing their residency outside the state, and most of them don\u2019t return,\u201d Arsiwala said.\n\nPractice sustainability threatened by regulations, growing practice costs\n\nWhile the AMA supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Hoven said the rollout of the law hasn\u2019t helped physicians manage the financial side of their practices.\n\n\u201cWe are getting killed with regulations\u201d from government and private insurers, Hoven said. \u201cThe more regulatory burden the government and insurers put on physicians in practice, the more difficult it gets\u201d to financially sustain practices.\n\nLast year, the AMA funded a study conducted by the Rand Corp. that showed doctors were unhappy whenever things interfered with their delivering high-quality care to their patients, Billi said.\n\n\u201cThey were very concerned that new electronic health records took too much time away from their focus on the patient,\u201d said Billi, who is on the board of the Michigan State Medical Society and also chairs the society\u2019s committee on quality.\n\nThe Rand study on physician satisfaction showed that EHRs, long hours, loss of ability to practice as they think best for the patient, rigid schedules, and bureaucratic rules from their practice leaders, including hospitals, are other causes of burnout, Billi said.\n\nOne of the unintended consequences of Obamacare, said Hoven, is the resurgence of the limited, or narrow, provider networks in state and federal health insurance exchanges.\n\nTo cut costs, health insurers have created health plan products with hospitals and physicians that have agreed to lower prices in exchange for expected higher volumes.\n\n\u201cNarrow networks or tiered networks are not being done for quality purposes,\u201d Hoven said. \u201cIt is for cost reasons. Access to specialists (and specialty hospitals) is getting difficult. We are seeing that.\u201d\n\nAnother way to ensure practice sustainability is to offer patients a variety of care and treatment options at the doctor\u2019s office, including a comprehensive team-based approach.\n\nHoven said the AMA supports \u201cphysician-led health care teams\u201d that include nurses, pharmacists and other health care providers to improve patient outcomes.\n\nBilli said the team works to manage the needs of the patient.\n\n\u201cThe nurse might do care coordination for a complex patient seeing multiple physicians, and the pharmacist might help a diabetic patient with his/her medications,\u201d Billi said.\n\nHoven said: \u201cPatients have been getting care, but it is often at the wrong time and at the wrong place.\u201d Too many patients still use the hospital emergency department as their primary care delivery site, she said.\n\nWhen asked if Hoven believes advanced-practice nurses should be granted more independence to improve patient access, as many in Michigan have been trying through the legislative process, the AMA president said she has been unimpressed.\n\nShe said expanding the independence of advanced-practice nurses and other allied health providers has not solved primary care access issues, improved health outcomes or lowered costs.\n\n\u201cWe have demographic studies that show these facts,\u201d she said, noting a report that showed little difference in Michigan between where physicians and nurses are located.\n\nIn a similar study, Hoven said a 2013 Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies report showed that the geographic distribution of nurse practitioners and physician assistants is similar to that of physicians.\n\nThe AMA and state medical societies, including the Michigan State Medical Society, has consistently opposed expanding nurses\u2019 scope of practice to give them more independence.\n\nLast year, Senate Bill 2 in Michigan, narrowly approved in the Senate, would have allowed for the licensure of advanced practice registered nurses. The House never took up the issue.\n\nThe bill would have allowed advanced-practice registered nurses to diagnose and treat patients, and prescribe certain drugs, without physician supervision. About 6,500 nurses might have qualified, according to the Michigan Nurses Association.\n\nOn advanced-practice nurses providing high-quality care and increased access in underserved areas, the MNA cited research that shows there is \u201cextensive, consistent evidence that nurse practitioners provide care of equal or better quality at a lower cost than comparable services provided by other qualified health professionals.\u201d\n\nImproving care of heart disease and diabetes\n\nMost physicians treat patients who either have heart disease or diabetes at some time in their lives, Hoven said. Together these diseases cost more than $500 billion to treat annually, a number that could be reduced with coordinated and preventive care.\n\nAs a result, the AMA has agreed to work with Johns Hopkins University on an initiative to reduce the incidence of hypertension, with a goal of bringing down the blood pressure of more than 10 million Americans by 2017.\n\nThe AMA is working with Hopkins\u2019 Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality to find clinical solutions and share best practices.\n\nOn diabetes, 33 percent of Americans have pre-diabetes symptoms, but only 11 percent are aware they might develop the disease.\n\nHoven said the AMA is trying to increase educational efforts in communities by encouraging physicians to increase primary care diabetic screenings.\n\nAs a primary care physician, Arsiwala said he is encouraged that the Accountable Care Act places a focus on health care outcomes, encouraging improved care of such chronic diseases as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nMedicare 'data dump'\n\nIn April, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released Medicare billing data for 2012 on nearly 900,000 physicians. The release, which Hoven called a \u201cdata dump,\u201d angered some physicians, including those in leadership positions at the AMA.\n\n\u201cWe believe in data transparency, where appropriate, but this data was not quality, risk-adjusted data,\u201d Hoven said. \u201cPractices were hurt by this release. There was an oncology practice I know that was negotiating a contract with a hospital. When the data was released, that stopped.\u201d\n\nHoven said the AMA has been working with Medicare to correct many inaccuracies in the data and make it more useful to the public.\n\n\u201cMisinterpretation of the data could hurt some physicians,\u201d she said. \u201cSome physicians with large billing numbers were actually representing their entire practice.\u201d\n\nBut Ewa Matuszewski, CEO of Medical Network One, an 800-physician independent practice association, said the data release provides patients with additional information to help them select physicians or create opportunities for conversations about medical care.\n\n\u201cWhether intentionally or not, the public posting of provider claims will also provide Medicare with an additional means of policing itself while also helping achieve The Triple Aim of increased patient satisfaction, reduction in the cost of care and an increase in the quality of care,\u201d Matuszewski said in a letter to Crain\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe Greater Detroit Area Health Council has been posting quality scores of select physician groups for several years, and the knowledge of such postings has certainly driven member groups such as ours to increase quality measures and improve our outcomes,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile some patient advocates, including Medicare officials, said making Medicare billing information publicly available could alert the public and authorities to the possibility of fraud, Hoven dismissed that potential benefit.\n\n\u201cMedicare (and the Department of Justice) knows who the high physician billers are,\u201d said Hoven, adding that publicizing billing data will not reduce health care fraud.\n\nHoven said she did not believe publishing billing information on Farid Fata, M.D., an Oakland Township oncologist who was arrested last year for Medicare fraud, would have alerted his patients to report him.\n\nAccording to the Medicare billing data report, Fata was paid $10 million by Medicare in 2012. He allegedly falsely billed Medicare for more than $35 million.\n\nFata was one of a small group of physicians who billed Medicare for more than $3 million. Overall, Medicare paid doctors $64 billion in 2012.\n\nIn a statement, CMS said one of the goals of the physician billing data release was to reduce fraud, waste and abuse within the Medicare program. Click here to read a variety of comments about the billing data release.\n\n\u201cThe department concluded that the data to be released would assist the public\u2019s understanding of Medicare fraud, waste and abuse, as well as shed light on payments to physicians for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries,\u201d CMS said in a letter to the AMA.\n\nLast week, the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute announced it is working with UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana on making a health care claims database available to the public in 2015. Other health insurers are expected to join.\n\nLike Medicare\u2019s decision to release physician billing data, health insurers are realizing they have to be more transparent to consumers about payments they make. At least 11 states have mandated creation of all-payer claims databases to share such information, and six other states are developing online systems.\n\nExperts say cost transparency is being spurred by a number of developments in health care. One is the trend toward consumer-driven, high-deductible health plans that transfers risk and medical decision-making to insured patients.\n\nThe offering of health plans on federal health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act also requires greater understanding of health care costs by consumers.\n\n\u201cWe believe the Medicare data has to provide value to patients. We don\u2019t think raw billing data does that,\u201d Hoven said.\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
