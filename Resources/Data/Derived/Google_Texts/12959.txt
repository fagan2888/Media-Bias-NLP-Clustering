Riverside Invests in Video Surveillance Business Pro-Vigil

The transaction follows the PE firm's recent investments in Bike24, Greenphire, Bionic Pet and Brookson Group

The Riverside Co. has invested in Pro-Vigil Inc., a video surveillance business.

Pro-Vigil, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, provides remote video surveillance and monitoring services to automotive dealerships, construction sites, utilities and oil and gas companies with large outdoor properties. The company provides equipment and monitoring, so authorities can be alerted to suspicious activity.

Riverside, which is based in Cleveland and New York, says it plans to grow the company through add-on acquisitions and organically. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Deerpath Capital provided financing for the deal. Jones Day and Deloitte acted as Riverside's advisers. The news came two days after the firm announced an investment in German cycling e-commerce specialist Bike24, which sells bike parts and equipment.

Riverside's other recent deals include Greenphire, a software company, and Bionic Pet Products, a pet toy business, both of which the firm bought in January. Before that, in December, Riverside invested in cloud-software business Brookson Group Ltd.
