Twenty-nine percent of respondents said they would vote for Trump, compared to eight percent for his closest challenger, Marco Rubio \u2013 who is statistically tied with Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. Still, a plurality of Republican and Independents are undecided.\n\nOrion Strategies today released the first results of a new, wide-ranging statewide poll that measured voter attitudes toward next year's election and significant national issues \u2013 including questions about Obamacare, Planned Parenthood, the use of body cameras by police and the treaty with Iran.\n\n\"Every year or two, Orion Strategies compiles a list of all the questions we ourselves want to ask,\" said Curtis Wilkerson, president and CEO of Orion Strategies. \"We poll often, but almost all of the polling we do on a regular basis remains proprietary. So this is always a fun and enlightening project.\"\n\nOrion Strategies also asked a number of questions regarding West Virginia-based state issues. The results of the state-oriented poll questions will be released tomorrow.\n\nThe live-interview telephone survey was conducted among historic, likely voters in West Virginia. A total of 406 respondents completed the entire survey \u2013 giving the poll a 4.9 +/- margin of error with a 95 percent confidence rate. The sample was proportionate to each of the three congressional districts in the state. All 55 counties were called, and results were collected from 54 of those counties. Partisan registration among respondents was 52 percent Democratic, 34 percent Republican and 14 percent Independent.\n\nOrion Strategies conducts polling and research surveys on behalf of various clients, including trade associations, law firms, universities, media outlets and political campaigns. The firm also conducts surveys for change of venue requests on prominent court cases.
