That\u2019s been seen in the third case that arose at a prestigious Dallas hospital\u2014the eighth largest in Texas\u2014where a second nurse in a team of 100 that treated Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who died of the virus, became infected from that care-giving.\n\nCompounding that development was the fact that federal health officials overseeing the nation\u2019s Ebola response gave permission to a nurse to fly on a commercial jet to Ohio after she reported a low-grade fever. The nurse has since been taken to a special infectious disease center in Georgia, with biohazard isolation rooms and other protocols that are not commonly found in most hospitals.\n\n\u201cThey are learning infection control on the fly,\u201d DeAnn McEwen, chief of infection control for National Nurses United, the country\u2019s largest union of nurses, said on Wednesday, saying both federal officials and hospitals have been far too lax.\n\nOne infectious disease specialist contacted by AlterNet who runs that department for a major urban hospital made these and other similar points earlier this week, which have been borne out as hospitals across the U.S. begin to look at more thorough protocols than previously recommended by federal officials.\n\nThe infectious disease specialist\u2019s major points are:\n\n1. Most American hospitals are not equipped to handle Ebola. They are not like Emory University or the country\u2019s handful of bio-containment centers. They don\u2019t have the space suits, isolation rooms, and training to deal with Ebola patients.\n\n2. Nobody knows how the Texas nurses got the virus when treating Duncan. They didn\u2019t have the training or precautionary gear, even after the Presbyterian Hospital emergency staff failed to correctly diagnose Duncan at first and discharged him.\n\n3. Initial assurances by the top officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that they have the situation under control were not true, just as instituting airport screening of travelers will not do much to identify carriers.\n\n4. Physicians are concerned about doing too little\u2014and doing too much, because they do not want to be seen as racially profiling potential victims or feeding into what has already been negative stereotyping of West Africans in media.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A leading infectious disease specialist explains why we're not as prepared for an outbreak as we'd like to think", "title": "6 real problems with America\u2019s Ebola response", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A leading infectious disease specialist explains why we're not as prepared for an outbreak as we'd like to think", "title": "6 real problems with America\u2019s Ebola response", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/18/6_real_problems_with_americas_ebola_response_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/ebola_sierra_leone.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A leading infectious disease specialist explains why we're not as prepared for an outbreak as we'd like to think", "title": "6 real problems with America\u2019s Ebola response", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/ebola_sierra_leone.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, cdC, ebola, Liberia, West Africa", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2864\"", "article_summary": "This week\u2019s news has shown that even major hospitals and their staffs have not been sufficiently trained nor equipped to detect the virus or handle patients with it.\nCompounding that development was the fact that federal health officials overseeing the nation\u2019s Ebola response gave permission to a nurse to fly on a commercial jet to Ohio after she reported a low-grade fever.\nThey don\u2019t have the space suits, isolation rooms, and training to deal with Ebola patients.\nMost American hospitals are not equipped to handle Ebola.\nNobody knows how the Texas nurses got the virus when treating Duncan."}
