The state agency would be required to complete its report by Aug. 1, meaning changes could then be implemented by 2017 and rates might come down.\n\nHealth insurance rates for self-employed workers and people unable to obtain insurance through their employers have skyrocketed in recent years, and Western Slope lawmakers have been grappling with a variety of strategies to combat the problem in a region where healthcare providers can be scarce or they charge inflated rates due to the high cost of living.\n\nAvon mortgage broker Chris Neuswanger started a website called \u201cEqualrates.com\u201d to track the bill\u2019s progress and advocate for its passage. It\u2019s sponsored in the House by Summit County Democrat Millie Hamner and Carbondale Republican Bob Rankin and in the Senate by Durango Republican Ellen Roberts and Vail Democrat Kerry Donovan.\n\n\u201cWe need to find out what\u2019s truly driving costs,\u201d Donovan told the Vail Daily last week. \u201cWe aren\u2019t all rich second-home owners. We need to overcome those perceptions.\u201d\n\nRoberts told Real Vail in January that she would target the high cost of healthcare on the state\u2019s Western Slope this legislative session. She primarily blames the Affordable Care Act, passed by Congress in 2010. The Denver Post ran a story in January pointing to a variety of factors for the 25 percent increase in health insurance rates between 2015 and 2016.\n\nOne factor in the overall increase in health insurance costs may be the runaway spike in the prices of pharmaceutical drugs. Legislative efforts to shed light on those costs were shot down in committee earlier this session.\n\nAs for the lack of providers, Eagle County at least should become increasingly competitive with the addition of Kaiser Permanente in Edwards and Centura Health in Avon. Real Vail spoke to those providers and a local health insurance broker for the following story that ran in the winter 2015-16 issue of The Parents Handbook:\n\nYoung families battle the high cost of healthcare in Eagle County\n\nEverything in the Vail Valley costs more than other parts of the country. It\u2019s an expensive place to visit, and it\u2019s a very expensive place to live. Locals will tell you it\u2019s the cost of calling paradise home, and many local families feel it\u2019s well worth the extra expense to avoid the stress and insanity of living in the big city.\n\nBut full-time residents of Eagle and Summit counties will often go to extremes to avoid paying premium prices for everything from gas to groceries to healthcare. That may mean driving on fumes all the way to Denver, going without groceries until you can make it to Costco, or heading all the way to the Front Range for medical procedures that can cost a lot less in the city.\n\nAs more and more people move to the Vail Valley, retail options have expanded significantly, so working families now have a Costco in Gypsum that charges Denver prices for gas and other necessities while \u2018up-valley\u201d grocery stories still charge top dollar, especially during ski season.\n\nHealthcare, however, remains a very pricey proposition. If you\u2019re not on a good company health plan, it can be very expensive to get basic healthcare in the Vail Valley. Part of it is the higher cost of living for healthcare workers and the expensive real estate facilities operate on, but mostly it\u2019s the seasonality of the local economy and the basically rural nature of the area that doesn\u2019t provide a large enough and consistent enough pool of patients. Those factors have contributed to a lack of competition over the years.\n\nAll of that is starting to change in 2016, with two major players in the healthcare arena moving into or expanding their presence in the mountain ski-resort markets. Starting in January, Kaiser Permanente will open new offices staffed with physicians and nurses in Edwards and Frisco. And next summer, Centura Health, which already operates the St. Anthony Summit Medical Center in Frisco, will open up in the new Buck Creek Medical Plaza in Avon.\n\nAll of this is occurring as the Vail Valley Medical Center, the dominant healthcare provider in the Vail Valley for 50 years, is expanding its Vail campus. The question, of course, for readers of The Parents Handbook, is how all of this expansion and competition will impact the cost of medical services in the Vail Valley, and whether it will in any way lower sky-high insurance rates. The answers to those questions may take some time to fully sort out.\n\nKaiser offers insurance option\n\nNon-profit Kaiser is unique among the current players because it\u2019s both an insurance company and a care-delivery system, albeit one that is in its very nascent stages. New offices will be located in the Edwards Corner building in Edwards and near Whole Foods Market in Frisco.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what we\u2019re going to be able to offer families, number one we think is an affordable option for health insurance, and along with that comes the care-delivery system,\u201d said Brent Bowman, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s executive director of the mountain Colorado service area. \u201cIn the Edwards medical office building specifically, we will have the ability to see members of all ages, including children.\u201d\n\nIn November, Kaiser inked a deal with one of the largest medical groups in the valley, Colorado Mountain Medical, a network with 26 doctors, three physician assistants and one nurse practitioner. CMM will offer primary and specialty care services to Kaiser members starting in January, and those specialties include everything from cardiology to urology.\n\nThat\u2019s a big plus for local residents weighing insurance options during the hectic December sign-up period. Kaiser is one of the most competitive insurance options, but there was a concern that new members in the mountains would have to travel to Denver or elsewhere on the Front Range for many services until Kaiser increases its physicians and specialty offerings locally.\n\nA family of five making $95,000 a year in Eagle County can get health insurance from Kaiser for $1,194 a month compared to $1,408 a month from the next cheapest option, for-profit Anthem (Blue Cross Blue Shield), according to Eagle insurance broker Bethe Wright of The Wright Insurance Company. That family would then qualify for a $743-per-month tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, bringing their monthly payments down to $451.\n\nKaiser conducted an extensive study using in-person interviews of local residents and businesses last summer that found healthcare costs are prohibitively expensive for mountain dwellers.\n\n\u201cWe learned there are the people there who have two homes and the people there who have two jobs,\u201d Bowman said, \u201cand we\u2019re focusing more on the people who are the full-time residents there, making a living and making it work in a very challenging environment from a cost-of-living standpoint.\u201d\n\nKaiser, which has had talks with the Vail Valley Medical Center, says it will continue to try to partner with local healthcare providers while expanding its virtual visits program that allows patients to conference with physicians locally and elsewhere in the state using video.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to offer the choice to be able to see a local provider but we also want to be able to make it as easy as possible for you to leverage the care and capabilities of physicians on the Front Range,\u201d said Bowman, who in addition to video visits and an on-call nurse who can answer questions 24/7 also touted the company\u2019s online capabilities that allow patients to manage their care and prescriptions through mobile apps.\n\n\u201cThe local community has been really receptive to seeing another option because people are astute enough to know that if more options are available, that\u2019s going to help create over time a more competitive market for the price of care to come down,\u201d Bowman said.\n\nWhen the new offices in Edwards and Frisco open in January, they will be open during normal business hours Monday through Friday. Eventually, they\u2019ll be open until 7 p.m. one night a week and one Saturday morning a month for a few hours.\n\nEmergency options in Avon\n\nThe new three-story, 48,500-square-foot Buck Creek Medical Plaza in Avon, which is slated to open in July or August depending on how construction progresses, will house a 12,000-square-foot emergency department on the first floor, with parking in a garage beneath the building.\n\nBeing built by medical-facility developer NexCore, Centura is master leasing the first and third floors, with the developer leasing the second floor to medical providers as well. Specialty services will be added as Centura gauges local needs, according to St. Anthony CEO Paul Chodkowski. The first-floor emergency department will include both urgent care and an ER, and both will operate around the clock.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful is you\u2019ll have first floor, easy access, walk-in service, 24-7 to both levels of care, and we\u2019ll have board-certified or board-eligible emergency physicians staffing it, so that\u2019s a very high level of capability,\u201d Chodkowski said, adding the department will also have a CT scanner, general X-ray imaging and ultrasound.\n\nSomeone with a broken arm can utilize the ER, while a child with a high-spiking fever might be able to go to urgent care at a significantly lower cost, he added. All of this will be located next to the new Avon fire department in an area that\u2019s right off Interstate 70 in the mid-valley region, as opposed to the Vail Valley Medical Center\u2019s ER, which is located on the east side of Dowd Junction farther away from where many local residents live.\n\n\u201cWe saw it as an unmet need for this kind of comprehensive service, and we thought that we could bring to the community some benefits in terms of options and lower costs at a very high level of service,\u201d Chodkowski said.\n\nBecause it doesn\u2019t have its own insurance product like Kaiser, Centura has to work with and offer discounted services through local insurance providers, Chodkowski said. However, he acknowledges the high costs of healthcare in the high country, so another tool Centura is using to lower costs is direct-employer contracting for self-insured companies or organizations.\n\nIn Summit County, Centura works with the county, the school district, Arapahoe Basin ski area, the town of Frisco and others companies to provide healthcare at lower costs by eliminating middle-man fees. Centura hopes to do the same as it moves into Eagle County next summer.\n\n\u201cWe have our resort community and our guests, and then we have our local community and our local residents,\u201d Chodkowski said, \u201cso while healthcare is very seasonal and we do have high pricing to make up for that seasonality, we hope that through some of these different types of insurance products and direct employer relationships we can bring down our costs, particularly for our local residents.\u201d\n\nThat will likely take time and may not be as significant as some locals would hope, according to insurance broker Wright.\n\nThe high cost of health insurance\n\nWright says it was a huge blow to mountain-dwellers when the Colorado Division of Insurance shut down Colorado HealthOP in October, especially for Summit County residents. Colorado Mountain Medical was close to signing a deal with HealthOp but instead had to go with Kaiser. The prices for Eagle County residents wouldn\u2019t have been much better than Anthem, but it would have been another option. HealthOP offered much lower rates in Summit County.\n\nNow that Anthem and Kaiser are the two primary insurance options in Eagle County, Wright says it\u2019s important to know as much as possible about what each insurance product covers and what services and healthcare provider networks are available under your plan.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, 100 percent of wellness for children and adults is covered, and for children under 19, pediatric dental and vision is also covered without having to buy a separate policy. Many people don\u2019t know all of that, just as many people don\u2019t know about the tax credits, Wright said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s valuable information for people to have, because most people if they hear $1,400, they\u2019re just going to shut down and say, \u2018You know what, we can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Wright said. \u201c[With the IRS credit] a family of five would be paying $650 or less, which really isn\u2019t a lot of money when it comes to unlimited millions and millions of dollars of coverage \u2013 that kind of protection.\u201d\n\nUnder the ACA, Colorado was one of the states that expanded Medicaid benefits, so people can qualify for Medicaid and kids can be put on CHP Plus, Wright added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of help out there people don\u2019t know how to get to, and that\u2019s the thing that we need to educate people about,\u201d Wright said, adding licensed local insurance brokers, who can be found on the state Connect for Health Colorado insurance exchange website, can walk people through their options free of charge.\n\n\u201cPeople need to know that using a broker does not cost them any money,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost any more to go through me than to go direct to the carrier or direct through Connect for Health Colorado. The broker gets paid by the insurance company.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re extremely unhappy with your insurance company, another benefit of the ACA is that even people with chronic illnesses can switch to a different carrier each year when they re-up their insurance\n\nGo to Connect for Health Colorado\u2019s website for more information at connectforhealthco.com or call The Wright Insurance Company at (970) 328-6300 or email bwright@vail.net.\n\nNew and improved VVMC\n\nFinally, Vail\u2019s main hospital for 50 years began an ambitious expansion project over the summer that will eventually relocate the Vail hospital\u2019s main entrance and ER to South Frontage Road, taking approximately 1,400 vehicle trips a day off West Meadow Drive.\n\nThat street is a key connector between Vail Village and Lionshead, and the hospital expansion allows it to stay in the heart of Vail while solving a major traffic issue for the town. Experts agree it\u2019s vital to have an ER at the base of one of the nation\u2019s busiest ski resorts, but it\u2019s been challenging to expand and upgrade services on such valuable land in a relatively tight space.\n\nThe expansion, which kicked off construction on the east wing last summer while maintaining services in the west wing, allows the hospital and its world-renowned orthopedic partner, the Steadman- Philippon Clinic, to stay in Vail.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the hospital is a $30 million contributor to the Vail economy and our second largest employer, and the efforts that they\u2019re taking to remain in the town of Vail shouldn\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d Vail Community Development Director George Ruther said.\n\nFormer Vail Mayor Andy Daly added the expansion and redevelopment allows the VVMC and the Steadman Clinic to continue to be a global leader.\n\n\u201cFor the hospital it really charts its future for the next 20 years, and it\u2019s a vibrant, exciting future that allows it to be one of the top orthopedic centers in North America if not in the world,\u201d Daly said. \u201cSome of the things the hospital is doing with Steadman-Philippon supporting new stem-cell research to promote the use of joints is going to be very, very exciting and continue to keep Steadman-Philippon and the Vail Valley Medical Center in the limelight for quite a while.\u201d\n\nAnd for many local residents, whose kids were born at the VVMC or who have gone there for years for a number of family health concerns, the Vail hospital will remain their first choice, even as healthcare options expand down-valley.\n\nSIDEBAR\n\nFast facts from Bethe Wright insurance", "article_metadata": {"description": "The runaway increase in health insurance in Colorado's mountain resort communities, including Eagle County, has prompted legislative action.", "og": {"site_name": "Real Vail", "description": "The runaway increase in health insurance in Colorado's mountain resort communities, including Eagle County, has prompted legislative action.", "title": "Western Slope lawmakers scramble to bring down runaway health insurance costs in high country - Real Vail", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 5312, "identifier": "http://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vail-valley-medical-center-032816.jpg", "height": 2988}, "url": "http://www.realvail.com/skyrocketing-health-insurance-costs-prompt-legislative-action-in-colorado/a2963", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The runaway increase in health insurance in Colorado's mountain resort communities, including Eagle County, has prompted legislative action.", "creator": "@davidowilliams", "image": "http://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vail-valley-medical-center-032816.jpg", "title": "Western Slope lawmakers scramble to bring down runaway health insurance costs in high country - Real Vail", "site": "@realvail", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "Western Slope lawmakers scramble to bring down runaway health insurance costs in high country", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/realvail", "section": "News", "tag": "state Sen.
