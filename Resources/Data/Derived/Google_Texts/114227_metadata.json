A board-certified clinical psychologist with critical experience in the delivery of mental-health services to the poor, Sister Donna will be the first woman to serve as the president of Catholic Charities USA, and her appointment sparked headlines when it was announced in January.\n\nWhen she takes up her new role in June, she will engage U.S. lawmakers, influence legislation and provide guidance to diocesan Catholic Charities.\n\n\u201cWe looked in the corporate world, academics, nonprofits and within and outside the Church,\u201d Sister Linda Yankoski, chair of CCUSA\u2019s board of trustees and president and CEO of the Holy Family Institute, told the Register.\n\n\u201cBe it interpersonal acumen, a healthy spiritual life, a commitment to combat poverty or an ability to build relationships and influence, Sister Donna\u2019s name surfaced from a number of stakeholders.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with the Register, Sister Donna said she was committed to the mission of Catholic Charities USA.\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of our work is to advocate on behalf of those who are poor and marginalized, to bring a voice to the table of power where they are not represented,\u201d Sister Donna said, noting that the organization\u2019s mission is \u201cfirmly rooted in the Gospel mandate that we love one another and extend mercy and compassion.\u201d\n\nShe succeeds Father Larry Snyder, who led Catholic Charities USA for a decade and will now return to special ministry in his home Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, and her appointment drew endorsements from Catholic nonprofit leaders and U.S. bishops.\n\nHowever, the Cardinal Newman Society published a news story that raised questions about her past involvement with the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), which has been investigated by the Vatican for doctrinal problems, as well as her role as the prioress general of a congregation that backed the passage of the Affordable Care Act over the U.S. bishops\u2019 objections to the bill\u2019s weak language on abortion.\n\nAdvancing Services\n\nSister Donna received her doctorate from the University of Detroit and was named a fellow in the American Association of Clinical Psychologists. In past decades, she has served in a number of leadership positions, including CEO of the Canada-based Southdown Institute, which treats religious and clergy with addiction problems, before joining Mercy Health, formerly known as Catholic Health Partners. Along the way, she also served for eight years as a member of CCUSA\u2019s board of trustees.\n\nLast year, the Catholic Health Association (CHA), an industry lobby, showcased Sister Donna\u2019s work at Mercy Health, explaining that the network \u201chas re-envisioned how it provides behavioral health services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe system is a year and a half into work to standardize evidence-based treatment across continuums of care. It has increased the amount of group therapy behavioral-health patients receive, so that they may benefit from increased structured time in treatment,\u201d read the CHA story.\n\nSister Linda, the present CCUSA chair, said that Sister Donna\u2019s successful efforts to expand Mercy Health\u2019s delivery of mental-health services across seven geographical regions could be shared with local Catholic Charities affiliates that face new criteria for obtaining grants, as well as new opportunities to access outside funds for treatment and other services.\n\nToday, she said, Catholic nonprofits are increasingly required to develop grant proposals and services aligned with \u201cevidence-based\u201d research, which helps provide assurance that a program\u2019s stated goals to help the needy are likely to succeed.\n\n\u201cPoor people have a new opportunity to get those services, and her background will help us be ready with the right training and services,\u201d said Sister Linda.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act offers federal subsidies for a range of mental-health services, and this will fuel the expansion of treatment programs for underserved groups.\n\nBut the landmark federal law also authorized the Health and Human Services\u2019 contraceptive mandate. The mandate has sparked lawsuits from religious nonprofits, including some diocesan Catholic Charities, which argue that it violates their religious freedom by requiring their employee health plans to cover contraception.\n\nSister Linda explained that diocesan Catholic Charities operate independently, but at the national level, \u201cwe work together with our bishops to deal with issues and tensions that do come up,\u201d including the dispute with the administration over the HHS mandate.\n\nInspired by Encyclicals\n\nDuring an interview with the Register, Sister Donna said she would begin her new duties by \u201cgetting to know the home office staff and the diocesan directors of Catholic Charities across the country.\u201d\n\nAsked about the new effort to orient Catholic Charities programs around \u201cevidence-based\u201d research, she said, \u201cThe broad picture is that in whatever work we are doing we need to show that what we are doing is effective, and we need to develop [mechanisms] that measure effectiveness.\u201d\n\nWhile Sister Donna will help prepare local affiliates to meet such challenges, she is also expected to oversee formation programs for the largely lay leadership of diocesan Catholic Charities.\n\nAnd based on her deep reading of the Church\u2019s social encyclicals, it seems likely that they will be a part of CCUSA-sponsored formation for diocesan directors.\n\n\u201cI was brought up on the social encyclicals,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has been a part of my training, background and theology.\u201d\n\nThe Adrian Dominican said she was inspired by Pope Francis and his 2013 apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel), where he called for the faithful to get dirty and \u201cbruised\u201d as they work among the poor and others on the \u201cfringes\u201d of society. That exhortation has helped to sustain her own efforts to provide mental-health services to the poor.\n\n\u201cThe largest provider of this care is the prison system; we have to do better than that,\u201d she said. \u201cCatholic [services] should expand access to care to the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nFemale Leadership\n\nPope Francis has also called for more women to take positions of leadership in the Church, and Catholic Charities USA has celebrated the fact that Sister Donna will be the first woman to lead the organization in its 100-year history.\n\nIn the past, Sister Donna has been engaged in fostering leadership by women and in promoting institutional change.\n\nHer biography page at Mercy Health notes her previous efforts to advance \u201cglobal peace initiatives directed toward building bridges of ... collaboration among international women leaders\u201d and notes her published book, Spiritlinking Leadership: Working Through Resistance to Organizational Change.\n\nAdrian Dominican Sister Rosa Monique Pe\u00f1a, who was vicaress general of the congregation when Sister Donna was prioress general, described her leadership style as \u201ccreative, visionary and no-nonsense.\u201d\n\nShe \u201cknows how to team up with thinkers and doers able to bring projects to completion,\u201d said Sister Rose in an email message, which noted that there are now 734 sisters in the congregation.\n\n\u201cAs head of the Adrian Dominican congregation, she maintained an open and transparent communication with the sisters.\u201d\n\nSister Donna served as prioress from 2004 to 2010, a period that saw the initiation of the Vatican\u2019s apostolic visitation of U.S. religious institutes of women. Yet she effectively \u201ccollaborated with the investigation without compromising the integrity of our identity, lifestyle and ministerial occupation,\u201d recalled Sister Rose.\n\nNow, Catholic Charities USA has provided a compelling opportunity for the Dominican sister to apply her leadership skills at the national level.\n\nSome Questions\n\nHowever, this milestone has prompted scrutiny as well as celebrations.\n\nThe Cardinal Newman Society raised questions about Sister Donna\u2019s qualifications for leading the national office, given her record on the Affordable Care Act and the LCWR.\n\nIn March 2010, near the end of Sister Donna\u2019s service as prioress general for the Adrian Dominicans, two members of her congregation, including \u201cKathleen Nolan, OP, Adrian Dominican Sisters Office of the General Council,\u201d signed a letter that endorsed the ACA \u201cpro-life\u201d provisions over the U.S. bishops\u2019 objections to the bill\u2019s weak language on abortion and conscience protections.\n\nDuring her interview with the Register, Sister Donna was not asked about her congregation\u2019s endorsement of the ACA. But after the Register\u2019s story was posted, CCUSA contacted the reporter to clarify that the signatures did not reflect Sister Donna\u2019s official position or that of the Adrian Dominican congregation.\n\n\u201cThis letter was signed by two members of the Adrian Dominican congregation as a sign of individual support,\u201d stated an email message from Maureen Varnon, a CCUSA senior vice president for communications.\n\nThe 2010 letter, distributed to members of Congress and the media by \u201cNETWORK, a national Catholic social-justice lobby,\u201d stated that the signatories represented \u201cthe heads of major Catholic women\u2019s religious orders in the United States; we represent 59,000 Catholic sisters in the United States.\u201d Later, NETWORK corrected that statement, noting that only one signatory, the LCWR president, represented the 58,000 sisters.\n\nCCUSA confirmed that Sister Donna did not issue any statement of clarification following the letter\u2019s release because \u201cno public comment was deemed necessary.\u201d\n\nBut with respect to the HHS mandate litigation \u2014 which arises directly from the ACA\u2019s requirement that all employee health plans include contraception, sterilization and abortifacient drugs \u2014 she seemed unaware of the issue.\n\n\u201cI am not on board yet, so I don\u2019t know those things,\u201d she said.\n\nSister Donna\u2019s appointment has also prompted questions about her involvement with the LCWR, which has been under the scrutiny of the Vatican, in part for its approach to Catholic teaching on issues like abortion and homosexual relations, as well as the appearance of heterodox speakers at the group\u2019s annual conference.\n\nSister Donna served as the LCWR president in 1991, well before the Vatican launched its investigation, and she told the Register that she is not a member now. But during her years as the Adrian Dominicans\u2019 prioress general, she was active in the LCWR.\n\nAt a 2013 College of the Holy Cross forum, \u201cThe Vatican and the Nuns,\u201d Sister Donna acknowledged that some past speakers at the LCWR\u2019s annual conference had stirred controversy and \u201cticked\u201d her off.\n\nShe contended, however, that such missteps did not justify an investigation of the LCWR. \u201cInvestigate the speaker!\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the LCWR\u2019s national assembly in St. Louis in August 2012, Sister Donna was one of three LCWR members delegated to serve on a panel discussing the assessment. Asked how the LCWR sisters had coped with the \u201churt and pain\u201d caused by the assessment, Sister Donna responded that, initially, she felt \u201cextremely hurt\u201d and \u201cbetrayed by my Church,\u201d to the point that it took \u201ceverything\u201d to attend Mass the following Sunday.\n\nBut the words of the priest celebrating the Mass, praising the witness of religious sisters as good shepherds, had helped ease the hurt, she added. And in response to another question, Sister Donna stressed the need for the LCWR to seek reconciliation.\n\n\u201cThe thing I don\u2019t think we ought to be risking is further splitting our Church and getting into more and more fragmentation. \u2026 We have to figure out: How are we going to get through this together in a way that is respectful of the integrity of both parties?\u201d\n\nSpiritual Pilgrimage\n\nSister Donna\u2019s remarks at the Holy Cross forum also noted the touchstones of her own spiritual pilgrimage.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a parish that was alive with the spirit of John XXIII, with a very forward-thinking pastor,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe never studied the Baltimore Catechism; we studied the Scriptures and social encyclicals of the Church.\u201d\n\nLater, as a young adult, the assassinations of President John Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. left her torn between joining the Dominicans or the Peace Corps.\n\nNow, Sister Donna will be working more closely with the U.S. bishops to address policies that threaten the religious freedom of local affiliates. In late February, the USCCB raised concerns about a new interim final rule, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, which would require Church agencies that receive government funding to assist undocumented minors to also provide emergency contraception and abortion referrals.\n\nYet, even as she prepares to address such challenges, Sister Donna clearly relishes the opportunity to work with affiliates who share her desire to help the needy access programs that will benefit their lives.\n\n\u201cI have spent much of my life dealing with people who are struggling,\u201d she said, reflecting on her life as a woman religious, a psychologist and a health-care executive.\n\n\u201cI hope that, in any way, I can \u2014 at a personal and systemic level \u2014 alleviate their suffering. I am excited to join with diocesan directors in that great effort.\u201d\n\nJoan Frawley Desmond is the Register\u2019s senior editor.\n\nEditor's Note: A clarification regarding Sister Donna's and the Adrian Domincan's offical position on the ACA was made at the request of CCUSA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adrian Dominican Sister Donna Markham assumes role as CCUSA president in June as humanitarian aid\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "Adrian Dominican Sister Donna Markham assumes role as CCUSA president in June as humanitarian aid organizations face new challenges to re...", "title": "\u2018Brought Up on Social Encyclicals,\u2019 First Woman Preps to Lead Catholic Charities USA", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/brought-up-on-social-encyclicals-sister-donna-markham-gears-up-to-head-cath/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Sr_Donna_Markham_OP_President_of_Catholic_Charities_USA_Credit_CCUSA_CNA_1_12_15.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/brought-up-on-social-encyclicals-sister-donna-markham-gears-up-to-head-cath/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Sr_Donna_Markham_OP_President_of_Catholic_Charities_USA_Credit_CCUSA_CNA_1_12_15.jpg", "description": "Adrian Dominican Sister Donna Markham assumes role as CCUSA president in June as humanitarian aid organizations face new challenges to re...", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Brought Up on Social Encyclicals,\u2019 First Woman Preps to Lead Catholic Charities USA"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, cardinal newman society, catholic charities, catholic charities usa, joan frawley desmond, lcwr, leadership of council of women religious, sister donna markham", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fa0\"", "article_summary": "Updated March 5, 2015ALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA), the national office for Catholic Charities agencies across the country, will soon welcome a new president, Adrian Dominican Sister Donna Markham.\nWhen she takes up her new role in June, she will engage U.S. lawmakers, influence legislation and provide guidance to diocesan Catholic Charities.\nNow, Catholic Charities USA has provided a compelling opportunity for the Dominican sister to apply her leadership skills at the national level.\nIn the past, Sister Donna has been engaged in fostering leadership by women and in promoting institutional change.\nDuring her interview with the Register, Sister Donna was not asked about her congregation\u2019s endorsement of the ACA."}
