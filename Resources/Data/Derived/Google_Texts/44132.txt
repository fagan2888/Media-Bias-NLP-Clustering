CNA News questions Fr. Joseph Fessio, founder of Ignatius Press, the publisher of the book which apparently annoyed Pope Francis this week. “Remaining in the Truth of Christ: Marriage and Communion in the Catholic Church,” features five cardinals including Raymond Burke and head of the CDF, Gerhard Muller. The cardinals address the speech made last February by Cardinal Walter Kasper where he proposed a method to give Holy Communion to remarried Catholics.

Cardinal Kasper reacted to the book this week. CNA has Fr. Fessio's response.

In the interview, Cardinal Kasper complained of learning about the book from journalists who had received advance copies of it. The cardinal said that he had not received an advance copy, adding, “In my entire academic life nothing like this has ever happened to me.”

“You chose to leave academia to enter public life. Get used to it,” Fr. Fessio responded.

The priest also referenced Cardinal Kasper’s statement, “If cardinals who are the closest collaborators of the pope intervene in this organized and public manner, at least in regard to the most recent history of the Church we are facing an unprecedented situation.”

“Well, you did something unprecedented,” Fr. Fession replied. “And it was organized and public. Well, it was supposed to be done in secrecy, but then you published your consistory intervention as a book.” Furthermore, Fr. Fessio responded to Cardinal Kasper’s statement that his consistory remarks had not offered “a definitive solution” but rather “posed some questions and offered considerations for possible responses.”

“Well, what are you complaining about then?” Fr. Fessio asked. “You got some answers and some responses to your considerations. Or weren’t those the answers you were expecting?”

Rocco Palma reports:

At Roman Noon, the report became reality: the Pope accepted the resignation of Cardinal Francis George for reasons of age, naming Blase Cupich the Ninth Archbishop of Chicago.

As previously relayed, the archbishop-elect will be introduced at a 9.30am Central press conference at the Archbishop Quigley Center, now the Chancery of the nation's third-largest diocese. Livestreams, etc. will follow here then.

Cupich's installation in Holy Name Cathedral has been set for Tuesday, November 18th. On a wider level, meanwhile, the last 48 hours have now brought what could well end up being Francis' two most consequential appointments of his entire pontificate in the English-speaking church.

The notorious dissent ‘catholic’ group Call to Action praised incoming Chicago bishop Blasé Cupich in a press release:

“Call To Action USA and Call To Action Chicago are relieved to learn that Bishop Blasé Cupich, a moderate, has been named the new bishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago. At a time when numerous U.S. Bishops are choosing to fight ideological battles, Pope Francis’ selection of Cupich demonstrates a desire for a humbler, more pastoral church.

CNA reports:

Jesuit Brother Guy Consolmagno, the new president of the Vatican Observatory Foundation, has no doubt that life exists elsewhere in the universe and that when humanity discovers it, the news will come as no big surprise.

He suggested that the likely discovery -- whether next month or a millennium from now -- will be received much the way that news of planets orbiting far off stars has filtered in since the 1990s.

The Jesuit Vatican astronomer continued:

"When we say human, human as compared to what?" he asked.

While the discovery of life elsewhere will not prove nor disprove the existence of God, Brother Consolmagno expects that it will open the door to ponder what form salvation history may take in other intelligent societies.

Rorate Caeli’s New Catholics is sorely disturbed at the unfortunate complaints of Cardinal Kasper:

The shamelessness of Cardinal Walter Kasper is astonishing. After throwing an ideological nuclear bomb in the February 2014 Consistory of Cardinals, with a pronouncement filled with historical and doctrinal falsehoods to justify a joint attack on the dogma of the indissolubility of marriage, on Penance, and on the integrity of the Blessed Sacrament, in an interview published today he now pretends that, with the release of the book of the Cardinals (and other pronouncements by other Cardinals, including Cardinal Pell), he is the victim of "an ideological war," and that the real "target" of criticisms directed at him is Pope Francis. Therefore, he says other cardinals cannot criticize him because, in effect, he is merely speaking for the Pope on this matter. The destroyer and attacker claims victimhood status!...

*************************************************************

The fallout from a straightforward book where cardinals of the Church explain its teachings on marriage, is telling. Following the deflections of Cardinal Kasper and the unprecedented demotion of contributor Cardinal Burke; the contortions of CDF’s Cardinal Muller are particularly painful to hear.

Rorate reacts:

An upside-down Church: Kasper, the heresy-promoting destroyer of Church dogma wants to demolish Catholic doctrine on Matrimony with an explosive anti-Catholic theory, but others cannot even react. It is Müller who has to excuse himself for standing with the permanent doctrine of the Church on the matter.

Zenit reports:

Archbishop Paul Coakley has used various tacticts over the last three months to protest the black Mass. He was successful in legal proceedings that asserted the consecrated Host to be used for the mass was stolen property and thus couldn't be defamed or abused in any way. A representative for the satanic group returned the Host to a priest of the archdiocese after a judge ordered a stay.

The archbishop has also gathered a worldwide community of prayer and reparation. On Sunday, a Mass and Eucharistic procession will be held.

In his letter to the faithful Abp. Coakley concludes:

I am aware that other groups are planning to show their opposition to the blasphemous event that evening at the Civic Center. I urgently ask everyone to avoid confrontations with those who might oppose them. Our witness ought to be reverent, respectful and peaceful. I urge those who might plan to attend the black mass in order to pray or to protest not to do so! Please do not enter the venue. It would be presumptuous and dangerous to expose oneself or others to these evil influences.

Finally, let us demonstrate our faith in the power of the Lord’s grace by praying for the conversion of those who are perpetrating this sacrilege and are bound by the Evil One. “But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your heavenly Father, for he makes his sun rise on the bad and the good, and causes rain to fall on the just and the unjust.”

Liberty News’ Eric Odom writes:

Yesterday House Republicans waved the white flag in a bid to get home and campaign as quickly as possible. They not only passed a bill that funds ISIS terror allies in the Middle East, they also fully funded Obamacare and passed funding for Planned Parenthood. All without even a serious debate.

Odom adds, “With friends like the GOP, who needs enemies?”

And Republicans are wondering why a “wave” of support hasn’t shown up for the November elections?
