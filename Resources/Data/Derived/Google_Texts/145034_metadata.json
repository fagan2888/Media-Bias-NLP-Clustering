Biden Jr. running about as well as Mrs. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner, or ahead of her in head-to-head match-ups against three leading Republican contenders.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers are like a leaky faucet: drip \u2026 drip \u2026 drip. She is now getting less than half the vote in all three states\u2019 Democratic primaries,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. \u201cPerhaps most telling is how poorly she scores when all voters in these three key states are asked about her empathy, honesty and temperament.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Donald Trump tops GOP field in Florida, Pennsylvania, second in Ohio\n\nMajorities of respondents in all three states said they don\u2019t think she \u201ccares about the needs and problems of people like you.\u201d A slim majority of voters in Pennsylvania said she has the right kind of temperament and personality to handle an international crisis as president, as did a 49 percent to 47 percent plurality in Ohio. Fifty-one percent of Florida voters said she does not have the right kind of temperament and personality to do so.\n\nMajorities in all three states did say she has strong leadership qualities.\n\nIn Florida, she has the support of 48 percent of Democrats, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent and Mr. Biden at 11 percent. Overall, she had a 55 percent unfavorable rating, with 37 percent of voters viewing her favorably. By a 64 percent to 32 percent margin, Florida voters said she was not honest and trustworthy.\n\nShe also trailed in head-to-head match-ups with Republicans: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush led her by 11 points, 49 percent to 38 percent, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida led her by 12 points, 51 percent to 39 percent, and businessman Donald Trump led her by 2 points, 43 percent to 41 percent.\n\nMr. Biden also trailed Mr. Bush by a similar 13-point, 51 percent to 38 percent margin, but was down 6 to Mr. Rubio, 48 percent to 42 percent, and led Mr. Trump by 3 points, 45 percent to 42 percent.\n\nIn Ohio, Mrs. Clinton was at 47 percent, followed by 17 percent for Mr. Sanders and 14 percent for Mr. Biden. She had a negative 36 percent/54 percent favorably/unfavorable split overall and voters said by a 60 percent to 34 percent margin that she is not honest and trustworthy.\n\nShe did lead Mr. Bush in a head-to-head match-up in Ohio by 2 points, 41 percent to 39 percent, and she led Mr. Trump by 5 points, 43 percent to 38 percent. But she trailed Mr. Rubio by 2 points, 42 percent to 40 percent.\n\nMr. Biden, meanwhile, led Mr. Bush by 3 points, 42 percent to 39 percent, he led Mr. Rubio by 1 point, 42 percent to 41 percent, and he led Mr. Trump by 10 points, 48 percent to 38 percent.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton had the support of 45 percent of Democrats, followed by 19 percent for Mr. Sanders and 17 percent for Mr. Biden.\n\nShe had a negative 38 percent/55 percent favorable/unfavorable split and voters, by a 63 percent to 32 percent margin, said she is not honest and trustworthy.\n\nMr. Bush led Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania by 3 points, 43 percent to 40 percent, and Mr. Rubio led her by 7 points, 47 percent to 40 percent. Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Trump by 5 points, 45 percent to 40 percent.\n\nMr. Bush led Mr. Biden by 1 points, 43 percent to 42 percent, Mr. Rubio led Mr. Biden by 3 points, 44 percent to 41 percent, and Mr. Biden led Mr. Trump by 8 points, 48 percent to 40 percent.\n\nIn contrast to Mrs. Clinton, pluralities of voters in each state also had a favorable view of Mr. Biden, with about 60 percent of voters in each state saying the vice president is honest and trustworthy.\n\n\u201cVice President Joseph Biden, who is spending his time in seclusion, contemplating whether to take on Secretary Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries for president, has some new information to consider,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIn head-to-head matchups against the three leading contenders for the Republican nomination, he runs as well or slightly better than she does.\u201d\n\nFrom Aug. 7-18, Quinnipiac surveyed:\n\n\u2022 1,093 Florida voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The survey includes 345 Democrats, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.\n\n\u2022 1,096 Ohio voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
