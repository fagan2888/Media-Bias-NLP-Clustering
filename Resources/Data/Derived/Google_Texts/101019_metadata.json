She said Thursday by email that a new set of rules passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives this week presents \u201cinnumerable problems.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dynamic Scoring \u2018Voodoo\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Have to Hurt Dems\n\nThe rule requires budget scorekeepers at CBO and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation to do an analysis of \u201cmajor\u201d legislation that projects the macroeconomic effects of the policy changes over time. The analysis, known as \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d is controversial among economists because it\u2019s so imprecise. A Joint Committee analysis of a tax reform plan presented last year by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI) determined that its effect on GDP would be somewhere between a .1 percent increase and a 1.6 percent increase over ten years, a difference of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nRepublicans have been working since O\u2019Neill\u2019s tenure as CBO head to implement a dynamic scoring approach. A driving reason is that many Republicans believe it will show that tax cuts are cheaper, from a budgetary perspective, than current analysis suggests. The thinking is when citizens keep more of their earnings it drives up economic activity \u2013 thereby increasing tax receipts.\n\nO\u2019Neill, who directs the Center for the Study of Business and Government at Baruch College\u2019s Zicklin School of Business in New York, recalled that when she led CBO, there was an effort to introduce dynamic scoring into budget analysis.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to CBO, there was a rule put out by the Ways and Means Committee that \u2026 the results could not be used in an actual cost estimate. CBO often included \u2013 especially in our midyear report \u2013 an analysis of the possible economic effects of any major legislation that had been passed (can't recall if that included proposed but not passed).\u201d\n\nRelated: How the GOP\u2019s 40-Hour Workweek Bill Could Backfire\n\nO\u2019Neill at the time clashed with congressional Republicans over even that inclusion of dynamic scoring in the process, but the current rule goes further.\n\n\u201cThe difference now is that the results presumably would be used in an actual budget estimate,\u201d she said.\n\nDetails are still somewhat vague. It is unclear how many bills would be affected; unclear what time frame the estimate is expected to cover; and unclear whether scorekeepers would be expected to deliver a point estimate or just a range of possible outcomes. O\u2019Neill said asking forecasters to extrapolate macroeconomic effects of legislation years into the future is perilous.\n\n\u201cThere are innumerable problems in making such an estimate \u2013 short or long term \u2013 because one would need to estimate the added effect of the bill on the economic forecast,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut other things may change, and those are often not predictable, which is why the economic forecast of CBO and other forecasters are seldom on the mark.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Threatens Veto Before Congress Is Sworn In\n\nShe added, \u201cThink back to the Clinton tax increase of 1993. Most economists \u2013 at least the ones I know \u2013 anticipated that the sharp rise would have a negative effect on growth. Initially that seemed to be happening\u2026 But shortly thereafter the economy took off.\u201d\n\nThe economic boom, she noted, had nothing to do with the tax increases.\n\n\u201cI believe that Bill Clinton later acknowledged that his tax hike was a mistake. The force responsible for the surge in economic activity was the dissemination of the fruits of the tech revolution \u2013 likely themselves the result of the decline in regulation and taxes dating from the Reagan years. All of which shows how difficult dynamic estimates could be to execute.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans have reportedly determined they will not reappoint current CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf, whose term expires this month. Some in the budget community have suggested that by shackling the next CBO director to the introduction of dynamic scoring, Republicans may drive away some qualified candidates.\n\nRelated: 25 House Mutineers Who Could Kill Boehner\u2019s Agenda\n\nStan Collender, a former House and Senate Budget Committee staffer and now director of financial communications for Qorvis MSLGROUP, a public affairs firm, wondered if candidates otherwise interested in the job would be reluctant to have their fingerprints on the introduction of dynamic scoring to CBO\u2019s cost estimates.\n\n\u201cPeople question it,\u201d Collender said of the process. There is a strong chance, he said, that \u201cthe Senate is going to go back to being under Democratic control again in two years.\u201d That could expose a new CBO director to contentious hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\nOthers noted that a relatively small number of proposals would be affected; only bills with an impact equal to 0.25 percent of GDP in a given year would be automatically subject to the new analysis. This means it would have little effect on qualified candidates\u2019 interest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is going to limit the pool of candidates interested in working at CBO,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cThe next director does have some important decisions to make, but I think any director of CBO could make the decisions necessary to have fair and reasonable dynamic scores if they have to. I don\u2019t think it is going to play out every day in the director\u2019s job.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill, for her part, said any future director\u2019s decision would likely be based on one-on-one discussions with members of Congress, in advance of taking the job. \u201cIt really depends on the details that are conveyed in person to the candidate,\u201d she said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House Republicans\u2019 plan change the way major pieces of legislation are assessed by Congress\u2019s budget scorekeepers is seriously problematic, said a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.", "title": "Dynamic Scoring Adds More Problems to an Already Flawed CBO Process", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/09/Dynamic-Scoring-Adds-More-Problems-Already-Flawed-CBO-Process", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312012_CBO_Deficit_Projections_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/09/Dynamic-Scoring-Adds-More-Problems-Already-Flawed-CBO-Process", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01312012_CBO_Deficit_Projections_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "House Republicans\u2019 plan change the way major pieces of legislation are assessed by Congress\u2019s budget scorekeepers is seriously problematic, said a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe023d\"", "article_summary": "Republicans have been working since O\u2019Neill\u2019s tenure as CBO head to implement a dynamic scoring approach.\nThe analysis, known as \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d is controversial among economists because it\u2019s so imprecise.\nSome in the budget community have suggested that by shackling the next CBO director to the introduction of dynamic scoring, Republicans may drive away some qualified candidates.\n\u201cThe difference now is that the results presumably would be used in an actual budget estimate,\u201d she said.\nAll of which shows how difficult dynamic estimates could be to execute.\u201dCongressional Republicans have reportedly determined they will not reappoint current CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf, whose term expires this month."}
