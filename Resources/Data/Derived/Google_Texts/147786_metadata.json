About 73% of that amount came a combination of uninsured victims ($193.8 million) and those on government insurance ($294.2 million).\n\n\u201cThe bulk of those costs come out of the public\u2019s pockets,\u201d said Sam Bieler, a criminologist who co-authored the report for the Urban Institute\u2019s Justice Policy Center.\n\nThe study\u2019s data were gathered prior to the full rollout of the Affordable Care Act. Since most of the new enrollees in Obamacare were previously uninsured, it\u2019s possible the public toll of treating gunshot wounds could go down in the future. But that remains to be seen.\n\nIn some states the cost on taxpayers was significantly high. In New Jersey, 59% were uninsured victims, while in Arizona, 64% were under public insurance.\n\nMost of the public insurance is picked up by Medicaid instead of Medicare, since the majority of gunshot victims are young. About 43%, or most, gunshot victims are males aged 15 to 24.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of gun violence are disproportionately concentrated among male youth, specifically young black males,\u201d said the study. \u201cFirearm-assault injuries impose a tremendous burden on some of America\u2019s most vulnerable youth, the health care system and the American public.\u201d\n\nThe study concluded \u201cthat significant public resources could be saved or redirected if effective gun-violence prevention strategies could be identified.\u201d\n\nThe gun industry sees the statistics as a reflection of the country\u2019s health insurance and poverty issues, rather than anything to do with firearms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not particularly surprising that a disproportionally large number of the victims of gun violence live in impoverished areas because that\u2019s where the crime occurs: in impoverished areas,\u201d said Larry Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the gun industry. \u201cAnd people who live in impoverished areas tend not to have health insurance.\u201d\n\nKeane said the statistics shouldn\u2019t be used as a motive for more gun control.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem of people in impoverished areas not having insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t infringe on individuals\u2019 Second Amendment rights because societal ills befall on impoverished neighborhoods, and one of those ills is lack of insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Gunshot wounds are costing the American taxpayer some half a billion dollars a year, according to a study from the Urban Institute.
