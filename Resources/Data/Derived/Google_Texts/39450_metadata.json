The states that have actually done things the way the law envisaged are the ones that are, at this early stage, doing the most toward those goals.\"\n\nShe added that, \"But the 'Just Say No' states are putting all their lower income residents at risk, not just by refusing to expand Medicaid but also, in many cases, by failing to help people get subsidized private coverage through the exchange.\"\n\nAnd Republican sabotage in these \"Just Say No\" states isn't just keeping Americans from having access to health care. It's keeping money out their wallets too.\n\nIn a recent Daily Take, I discussed how thanks to their refusal to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, Republican lawmakers in 25 states are preventing people in their states from getting their own tax dollars back in the form of expanded Medicaid.\n\nSince the government is picking up 100% of the costs of Medicaid expansion for the next three years, by refusing to expand the program, Republican lawmakers aren't saving their states any money. Instead, they are preventing their constituents from reaping the rewards of their tax dollars.\n\nEven the Conservative-leaning fact-checking site PunditFact agreed with that claim, saying that, \"We rate that statement Mostly True.\"\n\nThe sabotage we are seeing today from the Republican Party is unprecedented, costly, and deadly.\n\nRepublicans lawmakers are willing to let people die, just to put a permanent stain on the Obama presidency.\n\nAnd that's just wrong.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republicans in Washington and across the nation are so committed to sabotaging President Obama's presidency that they're willing to let people die.", "title": "The Republican Sabotage of America", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "Republicans in Washington and across the nation are so committed to sabotaging President Obama's presidency that they're willing to let people die.", "title": "The Republican Sabotage of America", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/21086-the-republican-sabotage-of-america", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2014_01/2014.1.7.DT.Main.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans in Washington and across the nation are so committed to sabotaging President Obama's presidency that they're willing to let people die.", "title": "The Republican Sabotage of America", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2014_01/2014.1.7.DT.Main.jpg", "creator": "@truthout", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "candice", "keywords": "GOP, Republicans, GOP, Republicans", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaede\"", "article_summary": "Millions of Americans in these states are being denied access to life-saving health care thanks to Republican sabotage.\nAnd Republican sabotage in these \"Just Say No\" states isn't just keeping Americans from having access to health care.\nTheda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, has compiled data showing just how successful Republican sabotage efforts over Obamacare have been.\nFrom Texas to Florida, Republicans are preventing millions of Americans from having access to affordable, life-saving health care.\nThe sabotage we are seeing today from the Republican Party is unprecedented, costly, and deadly."}
