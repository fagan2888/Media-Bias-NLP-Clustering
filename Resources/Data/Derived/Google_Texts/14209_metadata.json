A plethora of California residents eagerly signed a petition which would require Obamacare to include medical insurance for pets, with Americans making over $80,000 per year footing the veterinarian bills.\n\nMark Dice uses \u201cprankster\u201d videos to highlight how little some Americans know about current laws and their rights and protections under the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Last year, Dice made a video of himself circulating a petition calling for the repeal of the Third Amendment. Founding Father James Madison introduced the Third Amendment during the drafting of the Bill of Rights in 1789. The soldier-quartering text was crafted in direct response to laws passed by the British during the Revolutionary War. Government officials in England passed the Quartering Acts, which would have permitted British soldiers to live in American homes, regardless of whether or not the owner objected.\n\nAlmost all the San Diego residents who Mark Dice encountered while circulating the faux Obamacare pet coverage petition signed the document. The document was entitled the \u201cAffordable Care Veterinarian Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because you own a pet doesn\u2019t mean you should have to pay the veterinarian bills. When someone out there\u2019s making $80,000 a year, they can help you pay for the veterinarian bills and take care of your pets,\u201d Mark Dice tells one woman \u2013 who signed the Obamacare for pets petition.\n\nDice posed this question to another California man, who also signed his name on the Affordable Care Veterinarian Act petition, \u201cIf you have a pet and it needs some veterinarian care, why should you have to pay for that?\u201d\n\nWhen Dice told one woman that Obamacare was about to begin covering pets, she exclaimed, \u201cOh that\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s so d**n expensive.\u201d\n\nThe woman also noted that she was just thinking about getting a puppy.\n\n\u201cThis will help to alleviate the burden of having to pay for the veterinarian bills yourself and you will now have a collective health insurance policy for the animals,\u201d Mark Dice responds while handing her the Obamacare for pets petition to sign.\n\nWhat do you think about the Obamacare for pets petition responses garnered by Mark Dice?\n\n[Image via: Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare pet coverage should be added to the mammoth Affordable Care Act mandate \u2013 at least according to those polled in San Diego by political activist Mark", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Obamacare pet coverage should be added to the mammoth Affordable Care Act mandate \u2013 at least according to those polled in San Diego by political activist Mark", "title": "Obamacare Pet Coverage Coming Soon?", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1808478/obamacare-pet-coverage-coming-soon/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamacare-pet-coverage.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-02T13:49:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-02T14:44:17+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamacare-pet-coverage.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-02-02T13:49:16+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care veterinarian act,mark dice,obamacare for pets,obamacare pet coverage,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamacare-pet-coverage.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Obamacare pet coverage should be added to the mammoth Affordable Care Act mandate \u2013 at least according to those polled in San Diego by political activist Mark"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88b4\"", "article_summary": "Almost all the San Diego residents who Mark Dice encountered while circulating the faux Obamacare pet coverage petition signed the document.\nObamacare pet coverage should be added to the mammoth Affordable Care Act mandate \u2013 at least according to those polled in San Diego by political activist Mark Dice.\nWhat do you think about the Obamacare for pets petition responses garnered by Mark Dice?\nMark Dice uses \u201cprankster\u201d videos to highlight how little some Americans know about current laws and their rights and protections under the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\nThe document was entitled the \u201cAffordable Care Veterinarian Act.\u201d\u201cJust because you own a pet doesn\u2019t mean you should have to pay the veterinarian bills."}
