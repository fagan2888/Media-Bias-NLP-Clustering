Shereen Siewert/Daily Herald Media\n\nThe Marathon County E911 Dispatch center receives and processes all 911 calls for Marathon County, in addition to all routine service calls, administrative calls, and dispatches for all police, fire and emergency medical services in Marathon County.\n\nThe communications division dispatches for 12 law enforcement agencies, 33 emergency medical agencies and 33 fire departments. It annually handles over 32,000 911 calls and over 143,000 non-emergency calls for service. Staff is composed of 23 dispatchers and six supervisors working 12-hour shifts with a minimum of five people.\n\nNot many people are able to handle the long hours, rollercoaster stress, multi-tasking and emotional toll it takes to keep the citizens and officers of Marathon County safe. However, this is the life of a public safety telecommunicator, better known as the 911 dispatcher.\n\nA 911 dispatcher plays many roles: therapist, doctor, lawyer, teacher, psychic, weatherman or -woman, sounding board, guidance counselor, parent, priest, secretary, politician, peacemaker, repairman, phone directory and negotiator. Each dispatcher on a daily basis deals with angry or frantic citizens, terrified victims, suicidal people and sometimes grouchy officers. These dedicated individuals are expected to gather information from agitated callers (many of whom either can\u2019t remember answers to the questions or just simply can\u2019t understand why they are being asked any questions at all), type everything into a bank of computers, assess priority, dispatch appropriate help, continue gathering information, listen for calling officers, keep officers and field personnel safe and field all sorts of non-emergency calls \u2014 all at the same time.\n\nThese professionals sit at a bank of computer screens with a headset and a phone for a 12-hour shift, speaking with people whose faces they will never see, being taken for granted, criticized or sworn at, rarely receiving accolades or even a thank you and usually only getting the beginning of a story, as there is rarely any closure. Don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s a 24/7 operations, meaning they also work weekends and holidays. Every dispatcher is expected to be the calm or sanity in any storm, have the patience of a saint, answer every question, be an encyclopedia, ignore his or her own stress and emotions, have the speed of \u201cFlash\u201d and above all, be perfect all the time.\n\nIt has been my privilege and honor to work with many such people in 18 years at the Marathon County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Faces have come and gone over the years, but they have all found in one way or another that this is not just a job \u2014 it is a calling. They have been my coworkers, friends, a shoulder to lean on, inspiration and my mentors.\n\nThese public safety telecommunicators, each talented and unique, deserve much more than simply a week in their honor! You are heroes every day and I\u2019m proud to work with each of you!\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1yv9l7z", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "For National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week, a tribute to 911 dispatchers.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "For National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week, a tribute to 911 dispatchers.", "title": "Job of a 911 dispatcher is busy, heroic", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2015/04/15/job-dispatcher-busy-heroic/25794557/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week, a tribute to 911 dispatchers.", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/809dcc0f9c58644904734c77ba00afe143c7082d/c=120-0-840-720&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2015/04/14/B9316976301Z.1_20150414204448_000_G4DAGKHJA.1-0.jpg", "title": "Job of a 911 dispatcher is busy, heroic", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2b6\"", "article_summary": "However, this is the life of a public safety telecommunicator, better known as the 911 dispatcher.\nIt annually handles over 32,000 911 calls and over 143,000 non-emergency calls for service.\nA 911 dispatcher plays many roles: therapist, doctor, lawyer, teacher, psychic, weatherman or -woman, sounding board, guidance counselor, parent, priest, secretary, politician, peacemaker, repairman, phone directory and negotiator.\nShereen Siewert/Daily Herald MediaThe Marathon County E911 Dispatch center receives and processes all 911 calls for Marathon County, in addition to all routine service calls, administrative calls, and dispatches for all police, fire and emergency medical services in Marathon County.\nThese public safety telecommunicators, each talented and unique, deserve much more than simply a week in their honor!"}
