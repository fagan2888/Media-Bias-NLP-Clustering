A new video released today recounts the gruesome details of harvesting of aborted baby brains. It’s the seventh video released in as many weeks by the Center for Medical Progress.

A former procurement technician at StemExpress—a company that previously did business with Planned Parenthood—describes in the newest video her observation of a brain removal from a late-term male baby.

The video details the practice of harvesting fetal body parts in abortion clinics. In this case, the baby’s heart was still beating after the abortion.

The technician, Holly O’Donnell, said her supervisor once asked if she wanted to see something cool.

“And she just taps the heart, and it starts beating,” O’Donnell says. “And I’m sitting here and I’m looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think.”

The Center for Medical Progress has alleged that Planned Parenthood is breaking federal law for the illegal sale of body parts. Three congressional committees have launched investigations, and five states have cut Planned Parenthood funding following the release of the undercover videos.

“I know why it was happening, because an electrical current in its nodes were still firing,” O’Donnell admits in the latest video. “And I don’t know if that constitutes it’s technically dead, or it’s alive.”

The video also has audio of Dr. Ben Van Handel, executive director at fetal research lab Novogenix Laboratories, LLC.

“There are times when after the procedure is done that the heart actually is still beating,” he says.
