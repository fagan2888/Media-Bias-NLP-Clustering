Photo: Jay Cronan\n\nMr Davis-Meehan said many of the guests were elderly and living alone, often in the public housing towers on the outskirts of the CBD.\n\nSt John's central location made it readily accessible and contributed to the success of the day.\n\nThe Christmas lunch is just one of a range of social supports offered by the social welfare organisation at this time of the year.\n\nThe annual present room, which lets parents in receipt of a Centrelink benefit pick a present for each of their children and collect a Christmas hamper, was open from December 8 to 18.\n\n\"We had 278 families come through [the present room] this year,\" he said. \"More than 660 major presents were given away along with numerous books and stocking fillers. If that was not a record then it has to be very close.\"\n\nThe volunteers weren't only busy on Christmas Day. About 25 hams were prepared earlier in the week and 75 chickens were quartered on Christmas Eve.\n\nAt the end of the lunch guests were taken into the storeroom and asked to choose from a wide selection of fresh fruit and vegetables including mushrooms, mangoes, cherries and even Christmas bon bons to take home with them.\n\n\"Affordable accommodation in Canberra is very hard to find,\" Mr Davis-Meehan said.\n\n\"Many of our guests are on a benefit and, after they pay their accommodation, there just isn't enough left to survive on.\n\n\"Choices have to be made between bills and food and fresh food is often the first thing to go.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many of the 300 people who attended Friday's Christmas lunch at St John's in Canberra were as much in need of fellowship and compassion as they were of a meal ...", "application-name": "Canberra Times", "author": "David Ellery", "og": {"site_name": "Canberra Times", "description": "Many of the 300 people who attended Friday's Christmas lunch at St John's in Canberra were as much in need of fellowship and compassion as they were of a meal organisers have said.", "title": "St John'sCare Christmas lunch provided food for the heart and soul", "url": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/st-johnscare-christmas-lunch-provided-food-for-the-heart-and-soul-20151221-glsi7t.html", "image": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/l/u/y/c/u/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.glsi7t.png/1451018843305.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many of the 300 people who attended Friday's Christmas lunch at St John's in Canberra were as much in need of fellowship and compassion as they were of a meal organisers have said.", "title": "St John'sCare Christmas lunch provided food for the heart and soul", "image": {"src": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/l/u/y/c/u/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.glsi7t.png/1451018843305.jpg"}, "creator": "@DavidJohnEllery", "site": "@canberratimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open Canberra Times", "fb": {"app_id": 106020559517129}, "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/favicon.ico;", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au", "article": {"section": "ACT News", "published_time": "2015-12-25T04:47:23+0000", "modified_time": "2015-12-25T04:47:23+0000"}, "pubdate": "2015-12-25T04:47:23+0000", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christmas, St John'sCare, lunch, Canberra, St John's, Sambridge, Stuart Davis-Meehan"}, "article_summary": "Volunteers Cameron, 16, Callum, 18, Isobel,12, Malcolm and Julie Sambridge helping out at the St John's Care lunch on Christmas Day.\nThe Christmas lunch is just one of a range of social supports offered by the social welfare organisation at this time of the year.\nOne of the two tables of presents at the St John's Care lunch.\nVolunteering at this year's Christmas lunch at St John's in Reid was an opportunity to reflect on the lives and needs of others Isobel Sambridge\u200b, a 12-year-old Canberra school student, said.\nThe volunteers weren't only busy on Christmas Day."}
