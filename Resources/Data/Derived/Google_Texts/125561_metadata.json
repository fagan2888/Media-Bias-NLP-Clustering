Their cases can be presented to tumor boards made up of Mayo specialists and others from Mayo\u2019s care alliance, which is rapidly expanding across the country.\n\nMansfield said Methodist has about 1,500 affiliated physicians and Mayo has about 4,000 physicians and scientists.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic Care Network began in 2011 and now has 31 members in 18 states, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Methodist is the first member from Texas, and, with more than $1.1 billion in annual revenue, one of the largest, Hayes said.\n\n\u201cWe know Methodist Health System is an organization of excellence,\u201d Hayes said, citing months of due diligence before the agreement was signed. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect match for Mayo Clinic Care Network.\u201d\n\nLast month, The Dallas Morning News first reported plans for the partnership. At the same time, The News reported that Baylor Scott & White Health was near an agreement that would make three of its Dallas-area hospitals part of the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s national cardiology network.\n\nWith full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, some health care executives have said they\u2019ve never seen more rapid change in the industry. Outright mergers and acquisitions continue. And other types of alliances, such as Mayo-Methodist, are emerging.\n\nMansfield and Hayes said the deal announced Tuesday makes Methodist the exclusive Mayo affiliate in Methodist\u2019s market area of North Texas. Network members pay Mayo a fee, which was not disclosed. Mansfield called it \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\nThe two executives said talks between the organizations began more than a year ago. Mansfield said Methodist was looking for ways to accelerate its pursuit of quality care.\n\n\u201cWe felt the best option for Methodist was the Mayo Clinic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic is based in Rochester, Minn., where it has embarked on a major expansion. It has more than $9 billion in annual revenue. The clinic also has large satellite facilities in Arizona and Florida, and dozens of small community clinics and other facilities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Georgia.\n\nHayes said Mayo has no plans to build more major satellite locations.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, our strategy is affiliations, not bricks and mortar,\u201d he said.\n\nMayo has had its eye on the fast-growing North Texas market, and vice versa.\n\nIn 2011, Mayo ran a marketing campaign here using TV and print ads supplemented by a Web page aimed specifically at Dallas residents. \u201cWhy should I choose Mayo Clinic rather than seeking care in Dallas?\u201d the Web page asked.\n\nIn the late 1980s, The News reported that Ross Perot and Ross Perot Jr. courted Mayo officials, trying to get them to open a satellite facility at their development north of Fort Worth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The alliance allows Methodist Health System physicians to collaborate on patient care with Mayo Clinic specialists.", "og": {"description": "The alliance allows Methodist Health System physicians to collaborate on patient care with Mayo Clinic specialists.", "title": "Methodist becomes the first Texas member of Mayo\u2019s Care Network", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140909-methodist-becomes-the-first-texas-member-of-mayos-care-network.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140909-nb_9mayo1.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_9Mayo1.jpg", "height": 490}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-09-10T04:43:28Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-09-10T00:58:37Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Methodist becomes the first Texas member of Mayo\\u2019s Care Network\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140909-methodist-becomes-the-first-texas-member-of-mayos-care-network.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140909-nb_9mayo1.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_9Mayo1.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1908546\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-10T00:58:37Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"GARY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140909-nb_9mayo1.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NB_9Mayo1.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-10T00:58:37Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4299\"", "article_summary": "He referred to Methodist becoming the newest member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, calling it a \u201cwonderful opportunity\u201d for health care in the Dallas area.\nThe Mayo Clinic Care Network began in 2011 and now has 31 members in 18 states, Puerto Rico and Mexico.\nWith full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, some health care executives have said they\u2019ve never seen more rapid change in the industry.\nOperating for a century and a half, the Mayo Clinic is probably the strongest health care provider brand in the country.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect match for Mayo Clinic Care Network.\u201dLast month, The Dallas Morning News first reported plans for the partnership."}
