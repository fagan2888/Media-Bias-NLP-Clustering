Lawmakers held a slew of hearings in the aftermath and many proposed legislation intended to ensure that consumers are warned promptly when their information is put at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut a legislative solution has a long way to go, as bill dealing with privacy must travel through several committees with jurisdiction, including three in the House alone.\u201cWhenever you're going through that many gauntlets, it's hard. It's the reason we haven't had a privacy bill in 10 years,\u201d said a financial services lobbyist who asked not to be identified. \u201cNo one in the industry thinks a bill might move in the next couple months.\u201dWith action in Congress unlikely to happen soon, the nation\u2019s largest retailers and financial groups are taking it upon themselves to increase safeguards for consumer information. With their reputations and business on the line, both industries are determined to make progress.\u201cCustomers are counting on everyone to keep their data safe and secure. It\u2019s critical to recognize that the real enemy here is the hacker,\u201d said Richard Hunt, the head of the Consumer Bankers Association, in an announcement of a massive collective spearheaded by the Financial Services Roundtable and the Retail Industry Leaders Association earlier this year.More than a dozen financial and merchant groups \u2014 including the National Restaurant Association, the American Bankers Association, the American Hotel & Lodging Association and the Electronic Transaction Association \u2014 have teamed up to work on data security.Jason Kratovil, the Roundtable\u2019s vice president of government affairs for payments, said the talks have been productive and are helping industries share information about looming security threats.\"The partnership is a good opportunity to discuss data security challenges facing the current payment system, talk about technologies on the horizon, and how our industries can better coordinate and communicate on cyber threats going forward,\u201d Kratovil told The Hill.Data breaches have become fairly common in recent years, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a California-based nonprofit that tracks leaks.This year alone, there have been 33 breaches at businesses or financial institutions both large and small that compromised more than 1.1 million records. Those breaches came in the form of credit card fraud, exposure to hackers or unintended disclosure.Since 2009, there have been 636 data breaches that have been made public, involving 443 million records, according to the Clearinghouse database. The numbers are high because one person can have multiple records compromised in a single hack.Though movement in Congress on data-security legislation has slowed recently, lobbyists who spoke with The Hill said that another high-profile cybersecurity breakdown could spur lawmakers into action.\u201cIt maybe only takes one more galvanizing moment, one more significant data breach and things [on Capitol Hill] could happen very quickly,\u201d Kratovil said.All told, more than 75 groups and companies actively lobbied policymakers on data-breach issues during the first three months of 2014, according to the most recent lobbying disclosure records available.Major industry players lobbying on data security include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Realtors, General Motors, American Express, the National Retail Federation the American Association for Justice and Aflac insurance.Consumers spend trillions of dollars through electronic payments every year, which includes credit card transactions and newer ways of paying for goods, such as mobile wallet apps.That has made data security a top priority on K Street, with lobbyists at Facebook, Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and CTIA-The Wireless Association all keeping tabs on new developments, according to reports.A tech lobbyist said that policymakers still have a long way to go before addressing the security challenges posed by new technology.\u201cCongress and Washington are not focused on what's to come in the future of payment innovation, and I hope that they inject a level of innovation into the discussion to really get a sense of what's going on,\u201d the lobbyist, who asked not to be identified, said.Cybersecurity efforts are also a focus at financial institutions, which are more steeped in technology than ever before.Scott Talbott, the Roundtable\u2019s former chief lobbyist, moved to the Electronic Transactions Association, a group that represents companies involved in the intricate chain of how consumers pay for goods electronically.He said that lawmakers are becoming more interested in emerging technologies that could make credit cards more secure and allow people to use their phones safely for transactions.\"Electronic payments will continue make consumer transactions easier, safer \u200eand faster. It is an exciting time as ETA members develop and deploy new payments technology around the world,\" Talbott said. \"It was a driving force in my decision to join the ETA team.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Rise in electronic payments sharpens security focus", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Rise in electronic payments sharpens security focus", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/212176-rise-in-electronic-payments-sharpens-security-focus", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/creditcardswiping2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Megan R.
