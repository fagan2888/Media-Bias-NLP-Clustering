Company and hospital officials say local patients are reaping the benefits of quality health care that is now available right here at home.\n\nThis developing philosophy of \u201cKeeping care local\u201d was the capstone speech by the hospital\u2019s management team during the 2016 Ashe County Chamber of Commerce\u2019s annual luncheon on May 17.\n\nOver a light lunch, the hospital\u2019s team regaled attendees of the hospital\u2019s many accomplishments since taking control of the provider in 2013 and the challenges the provider will be facing in the coming years due to possible changes to the Affordable Care Act and the evolving nature of the health care industry.\n\nWhen Novant first took control of the hospital\u2019s day-to-day operations, the management team listed four goals that demanded their immediate attention, said Chief Financial Officer Curt Shaw, who was one of two keynote speakers at Tuesday\u2019s luncheon.\n\nAlong with stabilizing the hospital, which included making certain calls that didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cfeel good,\u201d Novant needed to obtain a new high performing CEO, said Shaw. That turned out to be Laura Lambeth, who has helped spearhead Novant\u2019s initiatives at AMH.\n\nIn the spirit of returning to the program\u2019s overarching theme of localized care, Shaw said Novant then went about recruiting new positions that would expand services to the community so Ashe County patients wouldn\u2019t have to \u201cdrive down the road\u201d in search of care.\n\nLately, the company has turned it attention to updating the hospital\u2019s dated emergency department. Lambeth was subsequently able to help raise more than $2 million dollar for the department.\n\n\u201cWhen you get all these things right, you see what Ashe Memorial is today,\u201d said Shaw. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier to be here.\u201d\n\nMargaret DeNarvaez, president of Novant\u2019s shared services division, spoke to the programs guests, which mostly included chamber members and business owners, on the importance of rural health care facilities.\n\nShe said that 23 percent of the nation\u2019s population receives health care from a rural facility and that hospitals like AMH are often the top employers in their community.\n\nThe hospital is also in \u201cprime position\u201d to weather the storm looming on the horizon with possible changes coming under a new president. The goal is to keep health care affordable, she said.\n\n\u201cThe best, cheapest care is local health centers,\u201d she said.\n\nReach Jesse Campbell at 336-846-7164.\n\n(Jesse Campbell|Jefferson Post) Novant Health Chief Financial Officer Curt Shaw speaks about his company\u2019s management transition with Ashe Memorial Hospital in West Jefferson on May 17, 2016. http://jeffersonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/web1_ChamberLuncheon2.jpg (Jesse Campbell|Jefferson Post) Novant Health Chief Financial Officer Curt Shaw speaks about his company\u2019s management transition with Ashe Memorial Hospital in West Jefferson on May 17, 2016.
