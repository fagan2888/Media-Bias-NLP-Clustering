What would they change? How can you collaborate with the community and people around you to have a positive impact on Denver? How can millennials best activate a plan for positive change?\n\nWith police nearby, the group\u2019s focus was improving the reputation of the park, a gathering place for thugs and the homeless after dark.\n\n\u201cGetting people to come down here is one of the most important things we can do as a community,\u201d said Eric Lazzari, events coordinator for the Civic Center Conservancy. \u201cPositive activity is the best deterrent to negative activity.\u201d\n\nCityBuild hopes to generate ideas and enthusiasm on a range of topics at social functions. The organization\u2019s first event was a happy hour last month.\n\n\u201cMillennials have creativity to offer,\u201d said Borin, the human resources director for Denver restaurants Snooze, an AM Eatery. \u201cThey want to be engaged in their community, and there\u2019s no other organization in Denver offering this.\u201d\n\nMillennials nationwide are considered key to revitalizing downtowns by living there and creating a market for fun things to do. A Brookings Institute report last year ranked Denver first in the nation for attracting residents between 25 and 34 years old.\n\nIn a 2011 report, the institute indicated that millennials can drive the relocation of corporations. \u201cHighly educated young workers, the life\u2019s blood of many industries, have been flocking to center cities in recent years,\u201d according to the report.\n\nEducation is a big part of the program, said CityBuild spokeswoman Jenny Starkey, 30. Those who participate learn about their subjects before discussing their ideas, she said.\n\nThe next gathering hasn\u2019t been planned, but \u201cit could be something that involves arts and culture,\u201d Starkey said.\n\nThose interested in participating can visit the CityBuild website.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Downtown Denver Partnership feeds young people, reaps their ideas", "title": "Downtown Denver Partnership feeds young people, reaps their ideas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/13/downtown-denver-partnership-feeds-young-people-reaps-their-ideas/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__citybuildp1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__citybuildp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-13T19:56:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:13:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Downtown Denver Partnership helped launch the group in September to get young adults more involved in planning the city\u2019s future.\n\u201cPart of what the Downtown Denver Partnership wanted was to develop the next generation of civic leaders,\u201d said Tami Door, the partnership\u2019s president and CEO.\nHow can millennials best activate a plan for positive change?\nHow can you collaborate with the community and people around you to have a positive impact on Denver?\nAbout 200 millennials discussed a series of questions:What do they like best about Denver?"}
