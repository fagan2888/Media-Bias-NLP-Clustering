To get the lowdown, The Daily Signal checked out Politico Playbook\u2019s meet-the-cast-and-crew event Friday at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill featuring stars Leoni and Tim Daly and producers Morgan Freeman, Lori McCreary and Barbara Hall.\n\nWhether or not you tune in, here are nine facts to brief you on the new \u201cpolitical drama\u201d about power in Washington:\n\n1. Despite taking place largely in Washington, \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d was mostly shot in New York City because the producers got tax incentives.\n\n2. Although the producers say the show drew inspiration from Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state (and to a lesser extent Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice), they didn\u2019t meet with Clinton or her team before filming.\n\n3. The pilot episode of \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d centers around a hostage situation in Syria. Barbara Hall, executive producer and writer, said she chose Syria because she \u201cthought that\u2019s a place where we\u2019re going to be dealing with troops for a long time.\u201d\n\n4. The second episode, although titled \u201cAnother Benghazi,\u201d continues to focus on Syria. Darn.\n\n5. T\u00e9a Leoni, who plays Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord, said she drew inspiration for the character from the \u201cstrong\u201d women who helped raise her.\n\n6. Tim Daly, who plays the secretary of state\u2019s husband, Henry McCord, said he met former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Albright, he said, is a big fan of his show \u201cPrivate Practice.\u201d During casting, Morgan Freeman added during the Politico event, he thought Daly looked too young for the part.\n\n7. The president and administration Elizabeth McCord serves have yet to be named as Republican or Democrat because, the producers said, they hope to highlight \u201cprocess,\u201d not politics. \u201cI think a lot of the time, the way we consume politics is to take a stand and take a position, and to ignore the process,\u201d Hall said. \u201cEspecially in the State Department \u2026 You have international relations to consider, you have domestic relations to consider, and you have interoffice relations to consider.\u201d\n\n8. Hall, second from right above, was a co-executive producer of \u201cHomeland,\u201d the Emmy-winning Showtime drama. She grew up in Chatham, Va., and attended James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va.\n\n9. Lori McCreary said she was inspired to create \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d after seeing Hillary Clinton make her \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d remarks before a Senate committee in testimony last year about the deadly Sept. 11, 2012 terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n>>> The Benghazi Moment That Inspired \u2018Madam Secretary\u2019\n\n[This article has been modified.]", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Madam Secretary,\" a new CBS political drama about a female secretary of state, premieres Sunday night.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Madam Secretary,\" a new CBS political drama about a female secretary of state, premieres Sunday night.", "title": "9 Diplomatic Facts to Know About \u2018Madam Secretary\u2018", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140919_MadamSecretary2.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-22T16:40:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DoZAGZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Madam Secretary,\" a new CBS political drama about a female secretary of state, premieres Sunday night.", "title": "9 Diplomatic Facts to Know About \u2018Madam Secretary\u2018", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140919_MadamSecretary2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2014-09-20T17:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-22T16:40:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "T\u00e9a Leoni, Madam Secretary, Barbara Hall, Tim Daley, Morgan Freeman, Lori McCreary, Benghazi, Elizabeth McCord, Madeleine Albright, White House Correspondents Dinner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f6c\"", "article_summary": "Sunday night, CBS will debut \u201cMadam Secretary,\u201d a series starring T\u00e9a Leoni as a newly appointed U.S. secretary of state.\nDespite taking place largely in Washington, \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d was mostly shot in New York City because the producers got tax incentives.\nThe pilot episode of \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d centers around a hostage situation in Syria.\nTim Daly, who plays the secretary of state\u2019s husband, Henry McCord, said he met former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the White House Correspondents Dinner.\nT\u00e9a Leoni, who plays Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord, said she drew inspiration for the character from the \u201cstrong\u201d women who helped raise her."}
