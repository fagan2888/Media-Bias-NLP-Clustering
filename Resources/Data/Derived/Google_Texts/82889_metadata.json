The competition is called M-town Showdown: Buck or Go Home. If you've ever seen Lifetime's show \"Bring It,\" that's a taste of what these girls are doing. Team TNT Promotions co-owner Yolanda Edmonds says majorette dance competitions like this are a great hobby for young girls.\n\n\"I got involved because it's about the kids, it's about the youth,\" she says. \"People are always saying there's nothing for the kids and they're staying in trouble. Anything that I can do that is youth-based, I'm for it. Yes, you can look for me to do this again because I'm excited about it, and it's a good turnout. \"\n\nEdmonds says they sold every ticket they had for the show, and these girls have been working for years to perfect their dancing techniques.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Dancing groups from across the state went head-to-head in a dance battle at the Temple Theatre.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "Dancing groups from across the state went head-to-head in a dance battle at the Temple Theatre.", "title": "Dancers Compete in M-Town Showdown", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Dancers-Compete-in-M-Town-Showdown-288939751.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/39A/000/39A00016ADE54184A249C286CECD6865", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/6E5/22C/6E522C241C1844789091398AFF8DBB2B.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Dancing groups from across the state went head-to-head in a dance battle at the Temple Theatre.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Dancers-Compete-in-M-Town-Showdown-288939751.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/dancers8.jpg", "title": "Dancers Compete in M-Town Showdown", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Dancers Compete in M-Town Showdown", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Dancers Compete in MTown Showdown"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff93\"", "article_summary": "Anything that I can do that is youth-based, I'm for it.\nTeam TNT Promotions co-owner Yolanda Edmonds says majorette dance competitions like this are a great hobby for young girls.\nThe competition is called M-town Showdown: Buck or Go Home.\nThe dancers were all girls in grades K-12 from Meridian to Hattiesburg.\nDancing groups from across the state went head-to-head in a dance battle Saturday afternoon at the Temple Theatre."}
