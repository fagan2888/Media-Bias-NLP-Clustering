The numbers do not include the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nMany of the new positions would be at the Veterans Affairs and Treasury departments. The request would allow VA to add 11,600 full-time employees to its staff, while Treasury could add 9,400. The new VA staff would help \u201cstrengthen the timeliness and quality of services to veterans\u201d and implement the Veterans Choice Act, which allows veterans facing long wait times or travel times to their closest VA health facility to receive care from outside providers. The new Treasury staff would help reverse cuts at the Internal Revenue Service and \u201cimprove customer service, program integrity efforts and tax enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe budget does, however, propose cuts in Defense Department jobs. Defense\u2019s full-time civilian workforce would decrease by 2,900 positions from 2015 levels, shrinking 0.4 percent to 741,600 jobs, according to the document.\n\nCheck out the chart below to see whether your agency will be hiring.\n\n(Top image via Lightspring /Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ross Gianfortune,Amelia Gruber", "description": "A look at which agencies would be able to hire the most under the proposal.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "A look at which agencies would be able to hire the most under the proposal.", "title": "Obama's Budget Adds 34K Federal Jobs.
