But advocates want triggers that require a company to initiate a recall after a certain number of animals are sickened or die after eating a certain type of pet food.Cathleen Enright, president and CEO of the Pet Food Institute, said she was confused by the request.\"FDA has that authority,\" she said. \"Are all those who are mandating a recall wishing to put that food safety authority into the hands of industry? It's a question.\"The Washington, D.C.-based industry group, which represents 98 percent of dog and cat food manufacturers with 22 members, supports the FDA\u2019s plan to issue federal labeling standards, but said the agency should avoid using human food labels as a model in it\u2019s rulemaking.\u201cCurrently if you look on packages for human food there\u2019s a serving size, but that doesn\u2019t translate when you are talking about a dog,\u201d she said.In food for humans, the protein, fat and vitamin content of a product are listed by a percentage of a balanced diet. On dog and cat food labels now, Enright said nutrients are listed by percentages based on minimum and maximum levels.Each state is responsible for regulating the labels on pet food sold in their states. The laws are drafted based on model legislation from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).Stan Cook, chair of AAFCO\u2019s pet food committee, said a federal standard for labels could have a positive effect by simplifying the regulatory efforts of the states depending on what\u2019s proposed. But cited industry worries that making them too similar to packaging in human food would only add to confusion because what people need for a complete and balanced diet and what dogs need for a complete and balanced diet are different.\u201cSome consumers want pet food labels to more closely resemble human food labels,\u201d he said in an email response to questions. \u201cMany in the regulatory arena are concerned that making the labels appear the same as a human food label is a food safety issue.\u201dAnimal protection advocates are also calling for a ban on food coloring since cats and dogs aren\u2019t affected by the color of their food.Enright said food coloring is an issue of personal preference, and should not be banned.\"We need to ensure that all ingredients are acceptable for pet food,\" she said \"If it's not a safety issue or health issue or nutrition issue it's approved.\"The FDA is scheduled to issue the regulations by September. They can\u2019t come soon enough for groups calling for tighter restrictions.\u201cWe know the wheels of the government turn very slowly and when animals are involved even slower, but it\u2019s unfortunate it has taken since 2007 to get this rolling,\u201d Guillermo said. \u201cI think it has been mostly left to the industry to decide what is adequate and what is proper and that\u2019s why this is a good idea to have a federal regulation to make sure it\u2019s consistent across the board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The FDA is expected to issue a labeling rule in the coming months.", "description": "The FDA is expected to issue a labeling rule in the coming months.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The FDA is expected to issue a labeling rule in the coming months.", "title": "Feds face pressure on pet food regs", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244915-feds-face-pressure-on-pet-food-regs", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/petfood_052715getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244915-feds-face-pressure-on-pet-food-regs", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-13T17:05-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Pet foods, Food and Drug Administration, Food and drink, Dog food, Cat food,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-13T17:05:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244915-feds-face-pressure-on-pet-food-regs", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The FDA is expected to issue a labeling rule in the coming months.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds face pressure on pet food regs"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds face pressure on pet food regs"}, "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration regulations, due out in the coming months, fulfill a mandate from 2007 legislation requiring updated nutritional and ingredient information on pet food.\nAnimal protection groups are pressing for strict new pet food labeling restrictions as part of a long overdue federal rule now in the works.\nOn dog and cat food labels now, Enright said nutrients are listed by percentages based on minimum and maximum levels.Each state is responsible for regulating the labels on pet food sold in their states.\n\"We need to ensure that all ingredients are acceptable for pet food,\" she said \"If it's not a safety issue or health issue or nutrition issue it's approved.\nBut cited industry worries that making them too similar to packaging in human food would only add to confusion because what people need for a complete and balanced diet and what dogs need for a complete and balanced diet are different.\u201cSome consumers want pet food labels to more closely resemble human food labels,\u201d he said in an email response to questions."}
