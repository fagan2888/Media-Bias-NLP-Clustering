The 3rd annual New Hampshire auto show wrapped up Sunday in Bedford.

More than 150 cars from 20 manufacturing brands have been on display since Friday at the New Hampshire Sportsplex in Bedford.

Show Director Michael Duffy said people can research cars and get a feel for new models in a relaxed atmosphere.

“No pressure environment. There are sales people here to talk to, but there is no hard sell,” Duffy said.

Duffy said attendance was up 12 percent at last year’s show. He expected that this year, even more people came out.
