I joined the Navy because radicals were trying to spread communism throughout the world and I wanted to stop them\u201d\n\nGuillory\u2019s video message invokes the words Martin Luther King, the \u201cinjustices of Jim Crow,\u201d his service in the U.S. Navy, the \u201cso-called Great Society,\u201d the American experiment, the importance of personal responsibility, and the government \u201cdisease masquerading as the cure.\u201d\n\nGuillory says of his military service and the state of America:\n\nWearing that uniform I felt that no one could tell me that I had to sit on the back of the bus,\u201cFreedom is being threatened once again. In 2016, America will be at an important crossroads. 50 years since the genesis of this so-called \u2018Great Society\u2019 it has come time once and for all for Americans to decide which nation we will be. This is a battle of ideas between the way the world has always been \u2014 where one small group of elite delve out food and supplies to the legions of poor people \u2014 or a brave new idea now just over 200 years old: the American experiment.\n\nGuillory asks Americans to suspend for a moment what he calls the symptoms \u2014 Obamacare, Omnibus, Congress, Obama \u2014 and address the greater problem.\n\n\u201cIf America is to survive, Americans must once and for all realize that government is NOT the solution to our problems. Government IS the problem,\u201d he says.\n\nGuillory goes on, entreating:\n\nPower in America still resides with the people. It is our responsibility to take back our government; it is our responsibility to take back our country. We have a duty to preserve America. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, because the salvation of America won\u2019t begin in the Oval Office, it will not flourish in the Supreme Court, it will not begin on the floor of the Congress, it won\u2019t even begin in the voting booth. The deliverance of our shining city on the hill must begin in one place and one place alone \u2014 the mirror. \u201cYou and I have a rendezvous with destiny and that time is now.\n\nGuillory is seeking election to Louisiana\u2019s 4th Congressional District. Republican Rep. John Fleming will vacate the seat as he seeks to replace retiring U.S. Senator David Vitter. The former Louisiana State Senator made his initial campaign announcement in front of property that his grandfather once worked as a slave, according to The Advertiser.\n\nGuillory has released several video shorts on issues including the use of the N-word, the defense of second amendment rights, and his decision to leave the Democratic Party and become a Republican.\n\nSee the full announcement here:\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elbert Guillory for Congress: 'Government Is a Disease Masquerading as the Cure'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Elbert Guillory for Congress: 'Government Is a Disease Masquerading as the Cure'", "title": "Elbert Guillory for Congress: 'Government Is a Disease Masquerading as the Cure' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Elbert-Giullory-Video.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/25/elbert-guillory-for-congress-government-is-a-disease-masquerading-as-the-cure/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Elbert Guillory for Congress: 'Government Is a Disease Masquerading as the Cure'", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Elbert-Giullory-Video.jpg", "title": "Elbert Guillory for Congress: 'Government Is a Disease Masquerading as the Cure' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, Elbert Guillory, Louisiana, Rep.
