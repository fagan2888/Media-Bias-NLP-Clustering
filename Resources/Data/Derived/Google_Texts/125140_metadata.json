The ACCESS study is funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).For the first study, patients who were illicit drug users and were initiating HIV therapy for the very first time were more likely to transition out of homelessness, start addiction treatment, and begin a romantic relationship, when compared with those who did not start ART. For the second study, Richardson and colleagues found that adherence to ART\u2014defined in the study as patients having their HIV medication dispensed at least 95% of the time\u2014increased the probability that patients would transition out of homelessness and cease involvement in risky behaviors, such as sex work, drug dealing, or street-based income generation.\u201cThese studies find HIV treatment and care may be able to help reduce inequities by promoting improved health, socio-economic stability and improved quality of life,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cThis research points to how HIV care and treatment can open doors to improvements in other areas relevant to people's social determinants of health. Both studies reinforce the benefits of early ART initiation and consistent ART treatment, particularly for marginalized and hard-to-reach individuals.\u201dThe research team feels their findings indicate additional benefits of HIV treatment that could be enhanced by income and housing support, as well as other services.\u201cTreatment as Prevention (TasP)\u2014providing full and early access to antiretrovirals to those living with HIV\u2014provides a path to ending AIDS in our lifetime that is founded on firm scientific evidence,\u201d said Julio Montaner, OC, MD, OBC DSc, FRCPC, FCCP, FACP, FRSC, director of the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia. \u201cDr. Richardson's groundbreaking research indicates TasP\u2019s open and accessible approach to healthcare can have significant social and economic implications.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Findings from two studies presented July 22 at the International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference in Vancouver, Canada indicate that HIV treatment for illicit drug users appears to improve their social and socioeconomic wellbeing, in addition to their overall health.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "Findings from two studies presented July 22 at the International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference in Vancouver, Canada indicate that HIV treatment for illicit drug users appears to improve their social and socioeconomic wellbeing, in addition to their overall health.", "title": "The Social and Socioeconomic Benefits of HIV Treatment", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/medical-news/the-social-and-socioeconomic-benefits-of-hiv-treatment", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/HIV.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "HIV, infectious disease, hospital medicine, addiction medicine, antiretroviral therapy, Treatment as Prevention, TasP", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd149e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis research points to how HIV care and treatment can open doors to improvements in other areas relevant to people's social determinants of health.\nRichardson's groundbreaking research indicates TasP\u2019s open and accessible approach to healthcare can have significant social and economic implications.\u201d\nThe ACCESS study is funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).For the first study, patients who were illicit drug users and were initiating HIV therapy for the very first time were more likely to transition out of homelessness, start addiction treatment, and begin a romantic relationship, when compared with those who did not start ART.\nFor the second study, Richardson and colleagues found that adherence to ART\u2014defined in the study as patients having their HIV medication dispensed at least 95% of the time\u2014increased the probability that patients would transition out of homelessness and cease involvement in risky behaviors, such as sex work, drug dealing, or street-based income generation.\u201cThese studies find HIV treatment and care may be able to help reduce inequities by promoting improved health, socio-economic stability and improved quality of life,\u201d said Richardson.\nBoth studies reinforce the benefits of early ART initiation and consistent ART treatment, particularly for marginalized and hard-to-reach individuals.\u201dThe research team feels their findings indicate additional benefits of HIV treatment that could be enhanced by income and housing support, as well as other services.\u201cTreatment as Prevention (TasP)\u2014providing full and early access to antiretrovirals to those living with HIV\u2014provides a path to ending AIDS in our lifetime that is founded on firm scientific evidence,\u201d said Julio Montaner, OC, MD, OBC DSc, FRCPC, FCCP, FACP, FRSC, director of the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia."}
