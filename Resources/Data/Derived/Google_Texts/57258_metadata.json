Upon news of his rapid decline, Brandi Lynn Wallberg, a stay-at-home mom from Wisconsin, started the Facebook page, \u201cFred Phelps Death Watch,\u201d which as of this writing has more than 3,000 likes. The page is filled with lolcat images featuring the likes of Hitler and what I can only interpret as jokes about his being anally raped in Hell.\n\nIn the hours following the announcement of his death, the tone did not soften any. The page displayed an image of Phelps with the all-caps epitaph, \u201cREST IN PISS.\u201d There were photos of a dead Wicked Witch of the West and a Photoshopped image of Phelps being flushed down a toilet. \u201cI\u2019m a little sad,\u201d read a status update. \u201cI hardly think he suffered enough.\u201d\n\nThe Satanic Temple has announced that it will attempt a \u201cpost-mortem homosexual conversion\u201d on Phelps. Some tweeters were quick to enthusiastically ring the death knell. Auragasmic wrote, \u201cAnyone have an appropriate gifset for celebrating the death of Fred Phelps? I\u2019ve waited so long for this and I\u2019m UNPREPARED.\u201d Another suggested that Phelps \u201cenjoy the continental breakfast\u201d in Hell, followed my a fire emoji.\n\nAll rather understandable anger \u2014 and an infinitesimal fraction of the hate that Phelps, founder of the Westboro Baptist Church, showed the word, even on his tamest of days.\n\nBut Phelps\u2019 detractors \u2014 a group including approximately everyone outside of his immediate family \u2014 are doing in his decline what he himself could never do: surprise. The truth is that, overwhelmingly, people are responding to this cruel man\u2019s demise with startling humanity. One, even this strident atheist, might go so far as to call it Christlike.\n\nEarlier this week, Thomas Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas, set the tone. \u201cThis is our moment as a community to rise above the sorrow, anger, and strife he sowed, and to show the world we are caring and compassionate people who respect the privacy and dignity of all.\u201d Blogger Azariah Southworth, who once had an encounter with Westboro protesters, urged, \u201cLet\u2019s go all the way with the message and show love to the most unlovable person.\u201d Sounding a similar note, Kristen Hotham Carroll wrote, \u201cTruly, the best way to avenge hurt inflicted by our enemies is to simply forgive them, and not allow them to have a stronghold in our hearts,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRest in peace, Fred. I forgive you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some are celebrating the Westboro Baptist Church leader's death, but most are showing a kindness that he never did", "title": "Bye, Fred Phelps!
