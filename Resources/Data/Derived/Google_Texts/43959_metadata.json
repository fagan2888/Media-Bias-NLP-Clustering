He pays a small premium each month and, like the rest of us, thought that meant he was covered in the event of an emergency. He would pay his deductible\u2014and the insurance would pick the rest, right?\n\nBut that, Elfrank-Dana quickly discovered, is not how it actually works.\n\nFive weeks after sustaining that head injury, Elfrank-Dana started feeling dizzy, checked into the nearest emergency room in Bergen County, New Jersey, and was rushed in for a craniotomy, a surgical procedure that removes part of the skull. After that, the hospital visits started piling up. He was treated for a fistula, then another surgery to drain the blood from his head again, then a series of appointments to address a brain infection related to the original craniotomy. It just never ended.\n\nAt one point in that nightmare, the medical bills started rolling in. A few thousand here. Ten thousand there. Twenty-two thousand more. By end of the year, Elfrank-Dana was staring down roughly $106,000 in medical bills. And none of it was covered by his insurance.\n\n\u201cMy insurance had made payments to the hospital and anesthesiologist but it was a fraction of what they were asking,\u201d Elfrank-Dana told TIME recently. \u201cSo they started going after me for the balance.\u201d\n\nWhile Elfrank-Dana didn\u2019t know it at the time, he had become the latest victim of what is known, aptly, as \u201csurprise medical bills.\u201d They arise when what an insurer pays a provider doesn\u2019t match up with what a doctor, physicians\u2019 group or out-of-network hospital actually charges. It happens all the time.\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by Consumer Reports, surprise medical bills are extremely common. An estimated 1 in 3 American adults with private health insurance fell victim to a surprise medical bill in the past two years.\n\nThis week\u2019s TIME magazine has a feature, \u201cThe Hidden Cost of Surprise Medical Bills,\u201d describing the problem, its causes, and solutions, an includes more stories from people like Elfrank-Dana. Here\u2019s the Cliff\u2019s Notes version.\n\nSurprise medical bills happen most often when a hospital contracts with medical providers\u2014including doctors, surgeons, anesthesiologists, lab technicians\u2014that do not accept the same insurance plans that the hospital does. That means that patients, like Elfrank-Dana, can walk into an in-network hospital, see an in-network doctor, and suddenly find himself on the hook for thousands of dollars anyway, just because he inadvertently received care from a provider, such as a lab technician or physician, who was out-of-network.\n\nSurprise medical bill are especially common in emergency rooms and surgical theaters. Often, a patient will go in for a procedure with an in-network surgeon at in-network hospital, but then wake up from anesthesia to discover that, at some point, an out-of-network physician had popped into the room to provide a consultation or help with the surgery. And when that happens? Boom: the patient receives an out-of-network bill.\n\nThe whole problem of \u201csurprise medical bills\u201d arises from the convoluted way that medical billing works in this country. As it is, an insurance company, like Emblem or Blue Cross Blue Shield, negotiates a set of repayment rates with hospitals and medical providers, which they then list as \u201cin network.\u201d If a hospital or physicians group refuses to accept the insurance company\u2019s repayment rates\u2014often because they\u2019re too low\u2014then those providers are listed as \u201cout-of-network.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s where it gets complicated. Often times, an insurance company will successfully negotiate with a hospital, but the hospital will then turn around and sign a sole contract with a group of, say, anesthesiologists or surgeons, who do not accept that same type of insurance.\n\nThat puts the patient in the awkward middle. A patient\u2019s insurance covers all in-network costs after the patient reaches his deductible, but meanwhile, the patient himself is receiving bills from any and every out-of-network provider that contributed to his care. In many cases, insurance plans pay just a small percentage of such out-of-network bills, or nothing at all.\n\nObamacare was supposed to fix these sorts of problems, and the 2010 law does go part of the way there. But it leaves open two big loopholes.\n\nThe first has to do with emergency medical care. Under Obamacare, Americans don\u2019t have to worry about whether the nearest hospital is in-network or out-of-network. During medical emergencies, insurance companies are required to bill patients as if the hospital where they end up is in-network, even if it\u2019s not. That means that if a patient usually pays a 20% co-pay for care at an in-network facility and 80% for care at an out-of-network facility, the insurers must abide by the 20% in-network co-pay.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge step in the right direction, but it still leaves patients wide open to surprise bills. After all, there\u2019s nothing stopping any out-of-network medical provider at that hospital, including emergency room doctors, from sending patients a separate bill later, charging them for whatever their insurance company didn\u2019t cover. That\u2019s what happened to Elfrank-Dana.\n\nThe second issue has to do with the total amount that patients can be charged out-of-pocket. Under Obamacare, insurers are required to cap out-of-pocket payments at $6,850 (and $13,700 for families). Again, that\u2019s progress. But those caps only include in-network care. If a patient like Elfrank-Dana reaches the $6,850 cap, but then receives $80,000 in surprise, out-of-network bills, after leaving the hospital, then, well, he\u2019s out of luck.\n\nThe big question on most people\u2019s mind is who\u2019s to blame. And the answer is a political hot potato: if you pass a law that prohibits saddling patients with \u201csurprise bills,\u201d then someone else is going to be on the hook. And that someone else will be one of the three most powerful players in the American medical industry: insurance companies, hospitals and the physicians lobby. None of them want to be left holding the bag.\n\nJay Kaplan, the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, says his heart goes out to patients, who he and his association work with on a person-to-person basis. \u201cWe want patients out of the middle as much as everybody does,\u201d he told TIME recently. He puts the onus on insurers to offer higher reimbursement rates, in order to include more providers in-network. \u201cInsurance companies use their own black box database to determine how much they\u2019re going to repay physicians,\u201d he says, and often times, those reimbursement rates are just not enough for doctors to accept them.\n\nTom Nickels, an executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, agrees: it should be the insurance companies that pay more, expand their networks, and eliminate the problem.\n\nInsurance companies, meanwhile, say that\u2019s not realistic. Insurers already offer medical providers reimbursement rates that are as high as possible, while keeping costs for consumers\u2014you, me, our employers\u2014are low as possible, said Clare Krusing, who represents America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. If insurers began paying doctors and hospitals as much as they asked for, insurance premiums would spike.\n\n\u201cProviders that choose not to participate in a network plan have a variety of reasons, the main one being that they want to charge higher rates for their services,\u201d Krusing told TIME. \u201cWhen you have a pricing structure like that that, patients are being asked to write a blank check.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 2015 Medscape survey, the average compensation for $284,000 for specialists and $195,000 for primacy care doctors. Average salaries have increased modestly but consistently since the passage of Obamacare in 2010. Emergency room physicians made a mean salary of $306,000 in 2015, up from $270,000 in 2013.\n\nA year after his accident, Elfrank-Dana says his billing saga continues. His insurance company and the surgeon at the New Jersey hospital eventually reached a settlement totaling about $56,000, but he\u2019s still on the hook for roughly $50,000 more for both the hospital bill and the anesthesiologist. He recently got help from a consumer rights advocate and a billing secretary at a New York-based hospital, both of whom are \u201ccoaching him,\u201d he says, on how to fight the charges. Despite two brain surgeries, Elfrank-Dana said that by last September, he started firing off one letter a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard figuring out who\u2019s the bad guy,\u201d he added. \u201cI know some people who take out a second mortgage to pay for these kinds of bills. For me, if I paid these bills, it would deplete my college savings for my kids. And I was saving for half of state school tuition for three kids. That\u2019s the opportunity cost here. It makes me all the more indignant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An estimated 1 in 3 American adults with private health insurance fell victim to a surprise medical bill in the past two years.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Even if you have health insurance.", "title": "How You Could Get Hit With a Surprise Medical Bill", "url": "http://time.com/4246845/health-care-insurance-suprise-medical-bill/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/medical_bill.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/medical_bill.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Even if you have health insurance.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How You Could Get Hit With a Surprise Medical Bill"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "surprise medical bills, health care, health insurance, affordable care act, out-of-network bills", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "surprise medical bills, health care, health insurance, Affordable Care Act, out-of-network bills"}, "article_summary": "The whole problem of \u201csurprise medical bills\u201d arises from the convoluted way that medical billing works in this country.\nAccording to a 2015 survey by Consumer Reports, surprise medical bills are extremely common.\nSurprise medical bills happen most often when a hospital contracts with medical providers\u2014including doctors, surgeons, anesthesiologists, lab technicians\u2014that do not accept the same insurance plans that the hospital does.\nThis week\u2019s TIME magazine has a feature, \u201cThe Hidden Cost of Surprise Medical Bills,\u201d describing the problem, its causes, and solutions, an includes more stories from people like Elfrank-Dana.\nAt one point in that nightmare, the medical bills started rolling in."}
