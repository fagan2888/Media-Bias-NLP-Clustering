This is just a month after brain-eating amoebas killed a teen living in Minnesota.\n\nHealth officials reported his death was caused by Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), a disease that results from contracting the single-celled amoeba Naegleria fowleri. This deadly, brain-eating organism is found in most lakes, ponds, and rivers, but multiplies most rapidly in warm, stagnant water. People are more likely to contract the amoeba when they dive or otherwise submerge their head underwater. In this position, amoebas can easily travel up the nose and into the brain, where it proceeds to destroy tissue.\n\nOnce infected with PAM, a person's symptoms range from high fever, to headache and vomiting, which worsens as the disease spreads. Severe symptoms associated with brain-eating amoebas include seizures, hallucinations, even coma. The disease cannot be spread from person to person.\n\nSouthern states tend to have more cases of PAM, and since 1998, seven cases have occurred in Oklahoma alone. This latest tragedy highlights the importance of certain safe swimming behaviors, especially in late summer when water temperatures are increased. Making a point not to dive in stagnant water, which increases the chance of water going up a swimmer's nose, in addition to using earplugs or simply holding the nose during swims can reduce overall risk.\n\nWatch the news segment below for more on the case, and how to swim safe during the summer.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "oklahoma, man, dies, brain, eating, amoeba, he, contracted, while, swimming, lake, murray", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Health officials warn against certain swimming behaviors that could increase the risk of contracting a brain-eating amoeba.", "title": "Another Swimmer Dies From Brain-Eating Amoebas [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/oklahoma-man-dies-brain-eating-amoeba-he-contracted-while-swimming-lake-murray-348016", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/15/shutterstock15379294.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health officials warn against certain swimming behaviors that could increase the risk of contracting a brain-eating amoeba.", "title": "Another Swimmer Dies From Brain-Eating Amoebas [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/oklahoma-man-dies-brain-eating-amoeba-he-contracted-while-swimming-lake-murray-348016", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/15/shutterstock15379294.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/15/shutterstock15379294.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-15T17:23:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-15T17:29:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health officials warn against certain swimming behaviors that could increase the risk of contracting a brain-eating amoeba."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a8e\"", "article_summary": "This is just a month after brain-eating amoebas killed a teen living in Minnesota.\nAn Oklahoma man has died after being infected with a rare amoeba during a swim in Lake Murray, the NY Daily News reported.\nSevere symptoms associated with brain-eating amoebas include seizures, hallucinations, even coma.\nThis latest tragedy highlights the importance of certain safe swimming behaviors, especially in late summer when water temperatures are increased.\nHealth officials reported his death was caused by Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), a disease that results from contracting the single-celled amoeba Naegleria fowleri."}
