After last year becoming the fourth men's cross country team in University of Colorado history to win a national title, eight athletes who helped bring the championship trophy back to Boulder on Monday will meet President Barack Obama in Washington D.C.

The team back in November overcame top ranked Northern Arizona, a dangerous Oklahoma State team, and 28 other schools to claim CU's fourth men's cross country title since 2001, according a school press release.

The team had to overcome 20 mph winds, below freezing temperatures, and muddy conditions at the Lavern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course in Terre Haute, Ind. to earn the trophy.

On Monday afternoon, they will become the third sports team in school history to meet a sitting president when they are recognized by Obama during a traditional ceremony at the White House, according to the school's release.

The 2006 men's cross country team met then President George W. Bush after winning a national title, according to school officials.

The student athletes who will attend the ceremony are Ammar Moussa, Pierce Murphy, Morgan Pearson, Zach Perrin, Ben Saarel, Dillon Shije, and the teams' co-captains Blake Theroux and Connor Winter.

Senior Athletic Director Jim Senter, associate head coach Heather Burroughs and assistant coach Billy Nelson will accompany the team, according to CU.
