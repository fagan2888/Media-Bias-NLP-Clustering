The goal was produced by two great champions that decided a match that otherwise would have gone toward (a draw).\"\n\nWhile Juventus has won the past three titles, Milan finished eighth last season and failed to qualify for Europe.\n\n\"I've got to be a realist,\" Inzaghi said. \"I can't sell smoke to people. I know where we're coming from. Even though I'm ambitious and I want to compete on the same level as everyone else I'm healthily realistic.\"\n\n___\n\nCLOSING THE GAP\n\nRoma visits Juventus on Oct. 5 and coach Rudi Garcia is already starting to feel that the Giallorossi have closed the gap behind the title holder.\n\nRoma spent more than twice as much as any other Italian club in the preseason transfer market \u2014 55 million euros ($71 million) \u2014 and appears much more confident in Garcia's second season in charge.\n\n\"We did everything we could in terms of bringing in players to close the gap with Juve and time will tell whether we've managed it,\" Garcia said following a 2-0 win over Cagliari on Sunday.\n\nHowever, injuries are starting to take their toll.\n\nWinger Juan Manuel Iturbe, who Roma purchased for 22 million euros ($30 million) from Hellas Verona, is out for a couple more weeks with an injured groin after exiting a 5-1 win over CSKA Moscow last week.\n\nCenter back Davide Astori is out for three weeks with a sprained right knee and midfielder Kevin Strootman won't return until at least November from left knee surgery.\n\nAlso, veteran midfielder Daniele De Rossi was being evaluated after he was injured against Cagliari.\n\n___\n\nA MOLDOVAN IN VERONA\n\nSubstitute Artur Ionita became the first player from Moldova to score in Serie A when he netted in a 1-0 win for Hellas Verona at Torino on Sunday.\n\nVerona went on a spending spree after selling Juan Manuel Iturbe to Roma and Ionita joined from Swiss club FC Aarau.\n\n\"I put him on during an important phase of the match and he showed that he was ready,\" Verona coach Andrea Mandorlini said.\n\nVerona finished 10th last season as it returned to Serie A after an 11-year absence and with former Italy forward Luca Toni still leading the way has higher expectations this season.\n\nAgainst Torino, which has yet to score this season, Verona goalkeeper Rafael saved a penalty kick from Omar El Kaddouri in the 87th minute.\n\n\"Other squads are having trouble and we can still improve,\" Mandorlini said.\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf can be followed at www.twitter.com/asdampf", "article_metadata":
