It's about Sen. Mike Lee of Utah\u2014who plans to offer yet another amendment to repeal Obamacare, but this time with a special super-duper secret sauce added to the upcoming highway funding bill:\n\nLee said he will try to re-offer the Obamacare repeal as a special amendment that is directly related to highway funding. Under Senate rules, amendments that are directly related, or germane, to the underlying legislation can pass with just 51 votes. Lee knows that the chair of the Senate is likely to reject his logic that Obamacare repeal is germane to highway funding, so he plans to use the nuclear option. That means he will formally object to the ruling of the chair, which requires a 51-vote simple majority \u2014 then he plans to move on to the coveted simple majority vote. ....If his plan works, Lee gets to tell his supporters that he\u2019s responsible for a major vote to kill the health care law he reviles. The House voted to repeal the law in February, so the two chambers could then theoretically conference the bills \u2014 leaving it up to Obama to veto a bill to kill his own signature policy achievement.\n\nSo the plan is simple: have Republicans declare ex cathedra that repeal of Obamacare is germane to highway funding, and then pass Lee's amendment with 51 votes. It's brilliant! All that's missing are the sharks with lasers attached to their heads!\n\nAside from being mind-numbingly stupid1, it also won't work. Democrats will just filibuster the entire highway bill, or else they'll vote for it and then Obama will veto the entire mess. Result: Obamacare stays in place but our highways continue to crumble into dust. Nice work, Senator! It's good to see that the Republican Party remains committed to the sober, responsible kind of leadership that makes our great nation the envy of the world.\n\n1It's times like this that I regret the recent banishment of \"retarded\" from polite conversation. Because I think we all know that it's the word that really fits here.2\n\n2Though I suppose there's no reason to insult the developmentally disabled by comparing them to Mike Lee.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/07/republicans-weird-summer-2015-edition", "type": "article", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "title": "Republican is weird, summer 2015 edition"}, "twitter": {"creator": "kdrum", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/07/republicans-weird-summer-2015-edition", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "title": "Republican is weird, summer 2015 edition", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "So the plan is simple: have Republicans declare ex cathedra that repeal of Obamacare is germane to highway funding, and then pass Lee's amendment with 51 votes.\nUnder Senate rules, amendments that are directly related, or germane, to the underlying legislation can pass with just 51 votes.\nLee knows that the chair of the Senate is likely to reject his logic that Obamacare repeal is germane to highway funding, so he plans to use the nuclear option.\nDemocrats will just filibuster the entire highway bill, or else they'll vote for it and then Obama will veto the entire mess.\nThat means he will formally object to the ruling of the chair, which requires a 51-vote simple majority \u2014 then he plans to move on to the coveted simple majority vote."}
