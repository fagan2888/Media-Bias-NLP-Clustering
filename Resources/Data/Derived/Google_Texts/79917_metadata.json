According to the complaint, Sabrdaran was part of a small group of employees charged with shepherding InterMune\u2019s drug Esbriet through the regulatory process for marketing the drug in the European Union. In this role, Sabrdaran became privy to material non-public information about the drug\u2019s progress in the regulatory process, and allegedly tipped this information to his close friend, Defendant Farhang Afsarpour. Before a public announcement about the drug\u2019s approval, Afsarpour allegedly bought InterMune common stock and urged other friends to buy additional InterMune securities. Following the public announcement, InterMune\u2019s stock prices soared, resulting in more than $1 million in illicit profits for Afsarpour.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Sabrdaran and Afsarpour with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The SEC seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest, financial penalties and injunctions. Additionally, the SEC seeks an officer-and-director bar against Sabrdaran.\n\nSEC v.
