My Cousin Ray Sixkiller defended Pryor. \u201cWalmart has an economy the size of Belgium. Do you expect they limp along with only one senator?\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that a group has been founded in Waco, Texas called \u201cCookiecott 2014\u201d to advocate a national boycott of Girl Scout cookies because, they claim, most of the famous women offered for admiration by young girls are pro-choice. The spokesman and main organizer for Cookiecott 2014 is John Pisciotta, director of Waco Pro-Life. Cousin Ray said, \u201cI\u2019ll have the Thin Mints.\u201d\n\nLiveScience reported that maritime archaeologists are mounting an expedition to excavate a 2,000 year old shipwreck, the oldest known in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Sri Lanka. \u201cProbably Olmecs looking to trade cocoa beans to real Indians,\u201d chuckled Cousin Ray.\n\nThe New York Times reported on a corruption trial in Greece, the country that recently required a bailout from the European Union to stave off bankruptcy. The story was headed \u201cSo Many Bribes, a Greek Official Can\u2019t Recall Them All,\u201d and detailed the purchase of tanks without ammunition, fighter jets without guidance systems, and submarines that never got wet. After some discussion about US \u201cdefense\u201d spending, Cousin Ray remarked \u201cat least the Greeks have sense enough to laugh about it.\u201d\n\nIn this hard winter, the Standing Rock Sioux reservation has opened shelters for people without propane, The New York Times reported, not mentioning that Standing Rock lost a woman to hypothermia. Production of propane is up 15 percent over last year, but exports of propane and retail prices are up as well. \u201cI am shocked, shocked to hear of price gouging,\u201d said Cousin Ray.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal attributed the stall on immigration reform in spite of agreement on all political sides that it would boost the US economy to \u201cRepublicans dancing to talk radio.\u201d Cousin Ray attributed it to \u201cthe white descendants of immigrants dancing away from brown immigrants.\u201d\n\nAlex Rodriguez has dropped his lawsuit challenging his record suspension\u2014a full season\u2014for using \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs.\u201d A-Rod had called the proceedings against him \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d Cousin Ray figured that since A-Rod had plenty of money to continue the lawsuit, \u201cthe witch hunt must\u2019ve found a witch.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of witch hunting, the February 9 New York Times carried a gruesome story about the whipping of alleged gay men in Nigeria while a mob outside the court rioted to demand that they be killed rather than just whipped. This version of \u201cjustice\u201d comes from a country whose largest trading partner is the US and whose principal exports are oil and email fraud. \u201cThe US,\u201d Cousin Ray remarked, \u201cproduces enough oil and email fraud domestically.\u201d\n\nThe same paper had a hilarious report of the disarray among the protocol mavens at the White House caused by French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s high profile split with his de facto First Lady Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler. Invitations to the State Dinner had to be reprinted, and there was worry over whether to cancel dancing, since Hollande would have no partner---after making sure that the new girlfriend would not be attending. \u201cLook at the bright side,\u201d said Cousin Ray. \u201cMichelle Obama had some major openings in her schedule.\u201d\n\nTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott, expected to cruise to becoming the next Texas governor past Sen. Wendy Davis because he\u2019s a male Republican, told KXAN-TV in Austin that he will never ever raise any taxes under any circumstances. Cousin Ray was embarrassed again. \u201cRead my lips,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cbad government.\u201d\n\nMeet the Press on February 9 featured an interview with Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes flogging their new book, HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton. On Clinton in 2016: \u201cThe question is not whether she starts running but whether she stops running.\u201d Cousin Ray noted that since Chris Christie jumped off the George Washington Bridge, \u201cthe strongest GOP candidate outside the clown car is Jeb Bush, if the GOP can look outside the clown car.\u201d\n\nThe National Registry of Exonerations reports a record number in 2013, 87. A third were cases where no crime occurred and 15 were guilty pleas. I\u2019m personally not prepared to risk the lives of others in this system unless I would risk my own life. \u201cThe death penalty is a no-brainer,\u201d Cousin Ray commented, \u201cin a couple of ways.\u201d\n\nIn related news, Gov. Jay Inslee (D) of Washington, noting that over half of death penalties imposed had been reversed, joined the governors of Oregon and Colorado in refusing to order executions on his watch. Cousin Ray wanted to know if \u201cthese guys ever heard of \u2018close enough for government work?\u2019\u201d\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-MT), appearing on Morning Joe, came out in favor of raising the minimum wage and extending unemployment benefits. Wages, adjusted for inflation, are down by .1 per cent in spite of numbers that show a general growth rate of over 4 per cent, which economists consider an adequate growth level. \u201cIf Tester keeps this up,\u201d Cousin Ray said, \u201cwe might have to quit making fun of his haircut.\u201d\n\nThe Weekly Standard, organ of the neo-cons, published a notice of Pete Seeger\u2019s passing somewhat different from this publication, entitled \u201cThe Red Warbler\u201d and quoting at length from Seeger\u2019s \u201cBig Joe Blues,\u201d an anti-Stalin song, to prove that Pete had been mistaken early on about the Soviet Union. Cousin Ray reminded me they call themselves neo-cons because they used to be leftists. \u201cNo finer authorities on political error.\u201d\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman kicked off \u201cOperation Angry Birds\u201d on February 10, arresting nine humans and about 3,000 chickens in major cockfighting bust. According to Al Jazeera America, authorities also seized paraphernalia to inject the birds with \u201cperformance enhancing drugs.\u201d \u201cThere is no truth to the rumor,\u201d Cousin Ray remarked, \u201cthat A-Rod was a consultant.\u201d\n\nAs far as we can tell, \u201credskins\u201d are welcome at Gary\u2019s Chacaros in Enid, Oklahoma, \u201cWhere the Great Whites Gather.\u201d Just not \u201cniggers,\u201d \u201cfaggots,\u201d \u201cfreaks,\u201d Hispanics, Muslims, Democrats, persons on welfare or in a wheelchair. Cousin Ray cautioned me to say that we really don\u2019t know if Gary James, the owner, will in fact serve American Indians or he just didn\u2019t think of us when making his list or printing his T-shirts (\u201cNigger-Free Zone\u201d).\u201cHere\u2019s hoping he doesn\u2019t claim to have a Cherokee grandmother.\u201d\n\nViolence between Sunni and Shia fired up again in Iraq as soon as US troops left, and recently there have been suicide bombings of mosques, funerals, soccer games, and a popular falafel shop. This may have been why The New York Times reported celebration among ordinary Iraqis when an instructor at a terrorist training camp north of Baghdad set off the live explosives in a suicide belt, killing himself and 21 \u201cstudents.\u201d Fifteen others were injured and eight were captured as they tried to escape. Cousin Ray was amazed at the number of \u201cstudents.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never understood the attraction dead guys have for virgins,\u201d he mused, \u201cbut I do understand how hard it is to find a good falafel shop.\u201d\n\nTennessee Republican legislators warned workers at a Chattanooga Volkswagen plant that if they voted to join the United Auto Workers, this might mean an end to state tax incentives to expand the plant. \u201cIf you let high wages get started in the South,\u201d Cousin Ray observed, \u201cthere\u2019ll be no end to it.\u201d\n\nIn a radio interview, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minnesota) said she expected Obamacare to be repealed by an act of God. \u201cJesus wouldn\u2019t cooperate,\u201d suggested Cousin Ray, \u201cbecause crucifixion is a preexisting condition.\u201d\n\nMichael Dunn\u2019s case went to a Florida jury on Wednesday to decide whether he had a right to stand his ground against loud music or, as he put it, \u201crap crap.\u201d \u201cThe older generation is always down on the younger generation\u2019s sounds,\u201d\n\nVideo of Pride (produced by Mr. Lones)\n\nCousin Ray remembered, \u201cbut there was never a death penalty for Elvis or Beatles fans.\u201d At our deadline, the jury was still out on whether Floridians can stand their ground against annoying music.\n\nSpeaking of music that annoys some people and delights others, Rolling Stone reports that the reunion of Courtney Love with her late husband\u2019s band mates on the occasion of Nirvana\u2019s induction into the Rock \u2018n Roll Hall of Fame might be \u201cawkward.\u201d \u201cPublic bad-mouthing, lawsuits, copyright claims,\u201d Cousin Ray laughed, \u201cthe public will line up for this, with or without a Hole reunion.\n\nVideo of Hole - Samantha (Official Music Video)\n\nThe New York Times reported that Michael Sam, who came out as gay before the NFL draft, had the support of his Missouri teammates but not his homophobic father. The \u201cfamily values\u201d of Michael Sam, Sr. led him to abandon his eight children, three of whom are dead and two in prison. Sam\u2019s parents are both fundamentalists of differing flavors. Anti-gay bigotry in the NFL will show up or not in the draft. \u201cSurely,\u201d Cousin Ray speculated, \u201cthe NFL can\u2019t be as anti-gay as it is anti-Indian?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Morning Joe reported on February 7 that the Senator from Wally World, Mark Pryor (D-Arkansas), came out against raising the minimum wage.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/14/how-did-i-miss-suicide-belts-witch-hunts-deadly-music-153568", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/joe-suicide_bomber_belt.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "How Did I Miss That?
