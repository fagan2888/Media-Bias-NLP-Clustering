Judges are trained as religious scholars and have a broad scope to base verdicts and sentences on their own interpretation of religious texts.\n\nThe new Saudi terrorism law issued early this year casts a wide net over what it considers to be \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nHuman rights organizations and activists have called on Saudi Arabia to end death sentences and other brutal punishments, accusing the Saudi regime of curbing freedom of speech and opinion.\n\nWestern-allied Saudi Arabia has beheaded six since the start of 2015 in the oil-rich kingdom.\n\nLast year, Saudi Arabia executed 87 people, up from 78 in 2013, according to an AFP tally.\n\nRape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are punishable by death in the kingdom.\n\nPolitical activism can also be penalized by death, as US-ally Saudi Arabia, like neighboring Bahrain, has taken a zero tolerance approach to all attempts at protest or dissent in the kingdom, including by liberal rights activists, Islamists, and members of the Shia minority.\n\nSaudi judges have this year passed death sentences down to five pro-democracy advocates, including prominent activist and cleric Nimr al-Nimr, for their part in protests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even though US-ally Saudi Arabia just condemned the attacks on Charlie Hebdo, it is still quick to enforce its own draconian anti-freedom of speech laws.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Al Akhbar", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Even though US-ally Saudi Arabia just condemned the attacks on Charlie Hebdo, it is still quick to enforce its own draconian anti-freedom of speech laws.", "title": "Saudi Arabia flogs blogger for insulting Islam.", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/video-condemning-paris-attacks-saudi-arabia-flogs-blogger-insulting-islam/200639/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MintPressLogo200x200new-filled1.png", "updated_time": "2015-01-09T23:40:06-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even though US-ally Saudi Arabia just condemned the attacks on Charlie Hebdo, it is still quick to enforce its own draconian anti-freedom of speech laws.", "title": "Saudi Arabia flogs blogger for insulting Islam.", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Raif-Badawi.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "women's rights", "published_time": "2015-01-10T05:00:51-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T23:40:06-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbdf\"", "article_summary": "VIDEO: After Condemning Paris Attacks, Saudi Arabia Flogs Blogger For \u201cInsulting Islam\u201dEven though US-ally Saudi Arabia just condemned the attacks on Charlie Hebdo, it is still quick to enforce its own draconian anti-freedom of speech laws.\nUS-ally Saudi Arabia flogs liberal activist Raif Badawi in public Friday near a mosque in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, receiving 50 lashes for \u201cinsulting Islam,\u201d witnesses said.\nLast year, Saudi Arabia executed 87 people, up from 78 in 2013, according to an AFP tally.\nWestern-allied Saudi Arabia has beheaded six since the start of 2015 in the oil-rich kingdom.\nBadawi\u2019s website included articles critical of senior Saudi religious figures and others from Muslim history."}
