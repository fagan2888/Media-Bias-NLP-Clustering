Bush\u2019s Republicans in 2006 and 2008 were not able to hold together the 51-percent coalition that re-elected him in 2004. Barack Obama\u2019s Democrats in 2014 were not able to hold together the 51-percent coalition that re-elected him in 2012.\n\nAnd, while the media and the voters are transfixed by the antics of Donald Trump, and speculating on possible damage to Republicans, Democrats are having some trouble holding their coalition together in the run-up to 2016.\n\nThat trouble was apparent at last weekend\u2019s Netroots Nation conference. Martin O\u2019Malley, the former Maryland governor whose candidacy has made few ripples so far, was faced with \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protesters. His response, one that almost all Americans would agree with: \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\u201d At which point he was booed off the stage.\n\nRELATED: Iowa\u2019s Democratic Establishment Unmoved by \u2018Bernie-Mentum\u2019\n\nSimilar treatment was given to Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who\u2019s been challenging Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in polls in heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire. Sanders emphasizes economic issues \u2014 single-payer health care, a 90 percent top income-tax rate \u2014 but he appeals primarily to gentry liberals.\n\nThe different priorities of gentry liberals and black activists, two heavily Democratic constituencies, are sparking heated arguments.\n\n\u201cIt would be a terrible mistake for the progressive movement to split into a \u2018black lives matter\u2019 movement and an \u2018economic justice\u2019 movement,\u201d laments Clinton administration Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. But the fact is that the different priorities of gentry liberals and black activists, two heavily Democratic constituencies, are sparking heated arguments.\n\nThere may be some heated arguments as well over how to respond to the recently released videos of high-ranking Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal body parts. The blithe statements that fetus\u2019 bodies should be crushed in ways preserving the option of selling livers, hearts, and lungs for $30 to $100 strikes many as grisly.\n\nSome liberals have rushed to Planned Parenthood\u2019s defense. The videos were taped by abortion opponents operating under false pretenses, they say, as if that made them inauthentic. And they deny that the fetal parts are sold at a profit (which is illegal) though the officials seem unconcerned about the possibility that their fees will exceed expenses.\n\nRELATED: Democrats Should Live Up to Their Lectures\n\nThe 2012 Obama campaign appealed to single women by suggesting that without Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate, contraceptives would somehow be unavailable \u2014 a favorable way to frame the abortion issue. But the Planned Parenthood videos are, in the words of Democratic columnist Kirsten Powers, \u201cstomach-turning stuff.\u201d\n\nMost mainstream media outlets are carefully avoiding the subject, as the Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway points out. The New York Times and Washington Post ran 773 stories on the Confederate flag over the last month but only 31 on the Planned Parenthood video. Heavily pro-choice newsrooms have no appetite to discredit the nation\u2019s leading abortion provider, but may be forced to as members of Congress hold hearings and propose legislation.\n\nRELATED: Bernie\u2019s Strange Brew of Nationalism and Socialism\n\nThen there is the issue of sanctuary cities, highlighted by the murder on July 1 of Kathryn Steinle by a five-times-deported illegal immigrant whom the San Francisco sheriff set free rather than turn over to federal authorities.\n\nDemocrats have defended sanctuary-city policies by arguing that illegal immigrants won\u2019t cooperate with law enforcement if they\u2019re afraid of being deported. But, for some, the San Francisco murder was too much. House minority whip Steny Hoyer, with evident sincerity, decried San Francisco\u2019s action. So, perhaps more tactically, did Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut some Hispanic leaders and liberal city officials defend sanctuary cities\u2019 policies. And so, as congressional Republicans press the issue, Democrats are likely to be split.\n\nIt is natural for a party\u2019s wingers \u2014 right-wing Republicans or left-wing Democrats \u2014 to be restive near the end of their party\u2019s president\u2019s second term. They take his accomplishments for granted and lament goals not achieved. Barack Obama\u2019s increasingly leftward lurch has encouraged the party\u2019s left wingers to angrily air their views, often in terms unappealing to those outside their narrow groups.\n\nThe result is tension between the party\u2019s major constituencies and highlighting of positions unpopular with the larger general electorate. Shouting down speakers who say \u201call lives matter\u201d is not popular. Neither is the sale of fetal organs. Nor are sanctuary cities.\n\nRepublicans certainly have their problems, not all of them labeled Trump. But so do the increasingly divided Democrats.\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a92015 the Washington Examiner.
