As disheartening as that is, what\u2019s even more baffling is his unwillingness, as of late, to even look like he\u2019s trying.\n\nTake for instance the situation at the Texas border; unaccompanied minors were marching towards the U.S. amid the veiled promise of citizenship promoted by this administration\u2019s flawed immigration policies. American border towns were flooded with illegal minors, and officials were left scrambling for solutions. It turned into serious humanitarian crisis as the kids were basically warehoused.\n\nIn an odd coincidence, the president was scheduled for three fundraisers in Texas during a week in July that attention over the dislocated children was reaching its peak. Texas lawmakers, including Gov. Rick Perry, urged the president to visit the border and witnessed what his own administration described as a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn a maddeningly frustrating decision, the president declined, instead opting to duck into the state for two days to raise cash and then leave without seeing the impact his flawed immigration promises had brought.\n\nFast forward to a little later that month when MH-17 had been shot down near the Russian-Ukranian border. This had all the makings of a major global crisis, including obvious evidence of Russian involvement.\n\nMaking matters worse, there were even reports of an American onboard the flight that eventually, and thankfully, proved to be false.\n\nStill, with the possibility still lingering that one of his countrymen was killed at the hands of pro-Putin forces, the president again showed a grotesque ambivalence, departing the White House for New York within the immediate hours of the tragedy for, you guessed it, another fundraiser.\n\nAnd who can forget the now famous vacation from Hell? You know, the one Mr. Obama took to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in August when American journalist James Foley was brutally executed and Ferguson, Missouri proved to be a tinderbox.\n\nAnd how did Mr. Obama respond to these crises? Well, on the night Ferguson grew violent, Mr. Obama was photographed dancing the night away, and minutes after delivering a hollow statement on Foley\u2019s death, Mr. Obama decided to go golfing. Sure, the president\u2019s entitled to some downtime, yet a real leader knows when to play and when to be serious. Mr. Obama seemed almost bothered by these crises, and his statements seemed almost obligatory.\n\nThis of course is a long list of offenses, but it raises a serious question: What\u2019s the difference between the Ebola threat, which Mr. Obama\u2019s own White House is saying has a slim chance of hurting more Americans, and those that the president blew off?\n\nThe answer is, proximity to the midterm elections. This is a clear last ditch effort to gain support from disillusioned Democrats who will likely stay ay home this November.\n\nThat\u2019s a scary thought. It seems like Mr. Obama is more afraid of elections than he is the true threats facing this country. That would explain why he waited until the 2012 election to share his true thoughts on gay marriage and now promises to wait until after the midterm elections to bring about what promises to be controversial immigration reform.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m sure Mr. Obama will spend the rest of October trying to shape up his act in a last ditch effort to mitigate this November\u2019s oncoming train wreck, but it\u2019s too little too late. Americans are already know the real Barack Obama and will be thinking of his party when they head to the polls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week, President Obama decided to cancel campaign appearances on both Wednesday and Thursday so that he could huddle in the White House and monitor the emerging Ebola crisis.
