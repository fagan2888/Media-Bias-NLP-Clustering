Although the definition of frequent user varied by study, the most common definition was someone who visits the ER four or more times per year.\n\nAlthough the definition of frequent user varied by study, the most common definition was someone who visits the ER four or more times per year. The study found that frequent ER users tend to be high-risk patients with unmet needs.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAccording to the study authors, frequent ER users, also known as \"frequent flyers\" or \"super-users\", often have mental health issues, addiction issues or chronic conditions. Many of them are also homeless.\n\nAlthough ER staff often view frequent users as a nuisance or drain on resources, the authors say to do so \"represents a narrow, biased and potentially dangerous view of this issue.\" Instead, the researchers suggest that frequent ER users need focused attention and implementation of interventions designed to meet their unmet needs not only from practitioners, but also from health administrators and policymakers. The authors also say that frequent ER users could benefit from case management in many instances.\n\nWant to read more?
