Scars resulting from breast removal were clearly evident.\n\nThe young man even mentioned that he had not had bottom surgery and that it was possible he might conceive and bear a child someday.\n\nWhat was not mentioned is the same thing that has not been clarified in the local transgender milieu, namely this: Will preoperative transgender students use open bay showers with the opposite sex?\n\nNo one seems to know. Taxpayers are entitled to know.\n\nGene A. Russell, Nashville 37201\n\nWhat bathroom to use?\n\nI would like to ask all those who are opposed to the so-called \"bathroom bill\" currently being considered by the Tennessee legislature a question: If a 14-year-old person, born a male, walked into your daughter or granddaughter's school dressed as a female and stated that he/she was a girl, which restroom would this person use?\n\nThink about it.\n\nJim Hitt, Goodlettsville 37070\n\nBathroom bill leaves people unprotected\n\nRe: \u201cTransgender bathroom bill advances over businesses\u2019 opposition,\u201d April 5.\n\nOne point mentioned for the bathroom bill states that the bill is placed as a protective measure to ensure that no one will violate the gendered bathrooms as a means of sexual assault, but in other areas that has not exactly happened at all.\n\nConnecticut, for example, has had anti-discrimination laws in place and the government is unaware of any sexual assault cases that have involved public restroom violations since the bill\u2019s passing.\n\nIn addition, for the worry about transgender individuals being sexual predators, they are the ones who have a 50 percent chance of being sexually assaulted in their lifetime. That leads to the train of thought of what might happen to the women forced to use the men\u2019s restroom because of their biological sex, and the possibility of them being unsafe in that setting.\n\nThe point of the law, as expressed by Rep. Mark White, is \u201cto protect the children\u201d and the people in public restrooms, but by protecting one group of people from the possibility of a crime that has not been a problem in other places, the bill places transgender women at possible risk for sexual assaults.\n\nSo who is the bill really protecting this way?\n\nPaige Hurley, Franklin 37069\n\nReject corporate tyranny\n\nThreatening states with economic reprisals is nothing short of corporate tyranny.\n\nIf the voters and their representatives believe that people of faith need protection in faithfully living their convictions, it is malicious arrogance for such corporations to attempt to force their values on those citizens. I hope that Tennessee legislators (and those of other states) do not succumb to this insolent blackmail.\n\nTom Oglesby, Ashland City 37015\n\nDNA gives us answers\n\nWhy all the confusion about which restroom to use, better known as the \u201cbathroom bill\"?\n\nThe answer is in the DNA. Regardless of surgery, shots, hormones and pills, our DNA cannot be changed. For over 30 years we have been using this genetic blueprint to distinguish who a person is in courts, lawsuits, paternity suits and even to identify the remains of a body.\n\nThe evidence is in the DNA. All the hype and ideology prove nothing. We have the scientific proof, what more do we need? The evidence remains the same; it is in the DNA.\n\nBrenda Bradley, Mt.
