More than 130 people in California were infected.\n\nThe outbreak cast a spotlight on the small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Many who fell ill in the Disneyland outbreak were not immunized or had only one of the two recommended doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.\n\nPublic health officials have said vaccinations rates must be high to protect a population from infection. While measles has been declared eliminated from the U.S. for years, outbreaks still occur because the virus can be imported from overseas and spread among people who skip shots for personal reasons or who are too young to be immunized.\n\nThe Disneyland outbreak \u201creminds us that we are part of a global medical community\u201d and the U.S. should help tame measles raging in many parts of the world, said Dr. Richard Wenzel, an infectious disease expert at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nThe U.S. has experienced measles outbreaks in recent years, including a 2014 episode that sickened 383 people in Ohio\u2019s Amish country.\n\nSymptoms can appear up to two weeks after exposure and include fever, cough and watery eyes followed by a telltale rash. A measles outbreak is considered over when 42 days \u2014 or two incubation periods \u2014 have passed since the last onset of the rash. The most recent confirmed measles case in California had rash onset on March 2, according to state data.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s international destinations, Disneyland was the perfect place to launch a widespread measles outbreak, health experts said. The theme parks attract tens of thousands of visitors from around the globe, who could then return home with the virus.\n\nForty people were exposed to measles while visiting or working at Disney theme parks in December. They then spread the virus to 30 family members. The rest caught measles in the community or from an unknown source, according to state health officials.\n\nDisease detectives have said they likely may never find patient zero \u2014 or the person who triggered the outbreak \u2014 but believe it\u2019s someone who brought measles into the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The outbreak, which sickened 134 Californians, will be declared over on Friday if no new cases pop up.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Disneyland Measles Outbreak to be Declared Over\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/04\\/16\\/disneyland-measles-outbreak-to-be-declared-over\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-16 11:04:35\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-19 11:19:32\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24967,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Measles\",\"Science\",\"Vaccine\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/04\\/RS13944_53249939-e1429207363678.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The outbreak, which sickened 134 Californians, will be declared over on Friday if no new cases pop up.", "title": "Disneyland Measles Outbreak to be Declared Over", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/04/16/disneyland-measles-outbreak-to-be-declared-over/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/04/RS13944_53249939-640x427.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "measles,science,vaccine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2f9\"", "article_summary": "As one of the world\u2019s international destinations, Disneyland was the perfect place to launch a widespread measles outbreak, health experts said.\nBy Alicia Chang, APThe state\u2019s measles outbreak that began at Disneyland and reignited debate about vaccinations is nearing an end.\nMany who fell ill in the Disneyland outbreak were not immunized or had only one of the two recommended doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.\nA measles outbreak is considered over when 42 days \u2014 or two incubation periods \u2014 have passed since the last onset of the rash.\nThe outbreak will be declared over in California on Friday if no new cases pop up, according to the California Department of Public Health."}
