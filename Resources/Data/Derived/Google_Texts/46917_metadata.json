We regret that,\u201d said Matthew Gutwein, CEO of the Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County, the governmental agency that is the parent of Eskenazi Health.\n\n\n\nThe two hospital systems announced in February 2013 a joint operating partnership that would create a joint board to form common strategies, pricing and clinical collaborations. They staged a splashy press conference at City Market, with public officials in attendance.\n\n\n\nTheir plan would have created a primary care behemoth here, with more front doors to access health care than any other hospital system in the area. That would have put Community and Eskenazi in a position to scoop up customers newly insured under Obamacare.\n\nMills Mills\n\nBut in late September, Community CEO Bryan Mills called off the deal so the two organizations could focus on the changes coming from Obamacare and so Eskenazi could focus on completing its new 315-bed hospital, which opened in December.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still hard to admit we couldn\u2019t find a way to do this,\u201d said Mills, during a discussion with Gutwein and Dr. Lisa Harris, Eskenazi\u2019s CEO, on the top floor of Eskenazi\u2019s executive offices, which overlook the campus of the Indiana University School of Medicine downtown.\n\n\n\nThe plan ran into two legal problems. First, federal antitrust laws require that two competing organizations be joined before they start discussing sensitive things like pricing and strategy.\n\n\n\nSecond, the rules for the special bonds Eskenazi sold to finance its $754 million hospital require that the recipient of proceeds be separate from any private organizations. The bonds were part of the Build America section of President Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus package, and offered lower interest rates for publicly funded projects.\n\n\n\nGutwein, Mills and Harris all said they were aware of those legal obstacles when they announced their working agreement in February 2013. But they thought they could find a structure that would thread the needle between those two laws.\n\n\n\nIn mid-2013, they realized they couldn\u2019t. But they still pushed forward on three fronts:\n\n\n\n\u2022 They explored whether they could refinance the Build America bonds to get out from that program\u2019s rules. But to be refinanced, Eskenazi would have been forced to repay all remaining interest\u2014about 25 years\u2019 worth\u2014at once, a big financial hit. Harris said Eskenazi even looked at whether it could offset that financial penalty with efficiencies gained by combining functions with Community, but concluded the penalty would still far outweigh the savings.\n\nHarris Harris\n\n\u201cWe realized both our organizations are very tightly run organizations,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\n\nEskenazi employs about 4,000 people serving mostly the indigent and uninsured in Indianapolis. In 2013, Eskenazi\u2019s revenue reached $465 million, which allowed it to break even.\n\n\n\nCommunity employs 11,000 people at eight hospitals and hundreds of other health care locations around Indianapolis and in Kokomo. In 2013, revenue was nearly $1.8 billion and profit from operations topped $54 million.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Eskenazi and Community hired lobbyists to petition the federal government to change the laws or rules governing the Build America bonds. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Health & Hospital Corp. spent $167,500 last year lobbying the federal government\u2014more than double the amount it typically does\u2014and $60,000 so far in 2014.\n\n\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Treasury Department listened to the Eskenazi representatives, but said the issue was too small for them to get involved in.\n\n\n\nSeveral members of Congress, from the House and Senate, also listened. The problem was that virtually no bills that change the U.S. tax code are even moving through Congress and any that do get close scrutiny for \u201cearmarks\u201d that help projects in specific localities.\n\n\n\nThe Community-Eskenazi request was not a typical earmark, in that it was not a petition for federal funding, but members of Congress worried it would be perceived that way, Gutwein said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe opportunities for a fix are exceedingly rare,\u201d Gutwein said of the congressional legislative process.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Community and Eskenazi explored trying to work together in a structure that still kept them legally separate. But what they came up with was a labyrinthine collection of joint ventures reporting to joint ventures that would have made it especially difficult to get teams of nurses, let alone executives, in a room to share data and talk strategy.\n\n\n\n\u201cInefficient doesn\u2019t even begin to describe how unworkable it would have been,\u201d Harris said. And that would have prevented Eskenazi and Community from achieving their overarching goal for the integration\u2014to pool resources in order to serve more patients.\n\n\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, Community and Eskenazi assembled nearly 20 people in a conference room at a downtown law firm for two all-day meetings. Each side had its top managers there, as well as lawyers in three specialties: tax law, antitrust law and mergers & acquisitions.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the first day, however, Mills concluded it was hopeless and \u201ccalled a timeout.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t get it done because of the complexity of trying to deal with a governmental agency,\u201d Mills explained during an internal presentation in February, when for the first time he told Community\u2019s employees the deal was off.\n\n\n\nSome Community employees have suggested Community backed out of the deal because it suffered a spike last year in patients who couldn\u2019t pay their bills.\n\n\n\nCommunity spent $25.5 million more last year on charity care than it did the previous year, and $10.3 million more on bad debt.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur charity care went through the roof,\u201d Mills acknowledged in an interview, but he said that development played no part in his decision to halt the deal.\n\n\n\nSince September, the two sides have kept quiet about the change in plans as they continued their lobbying efforts and had smaller discussions about ways in which they could collaborate.\n\n\n\nCommunity and Eskenazi have for years collaborated on behavioral health care, working through an organization called InteCare. That relationship will continue and is even set to expand soon with the launch of a suicide-prevention program.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Community has turned to Eskenazi to handle trauma patients, particularly orthopedic traumas.\n\n\n\nMore broadly, Mills said that he, Harris and Gutwein\u2014as well as many other people in their respective organizations\u2014have become friends through the hours they spent working to integrate the hospitals. And those relationships will help as both organizations try to navigate changes coming from health care reform.\n\n\n\nEven though their full-integration deal is not going forward, both Gutwein and Mills stopped short of saying the deal was completely off.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually ended yet,\u201d Gutwein said. \u201cWe still would like to get a change in the rules.\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Community Health Network and Eskenazi Health quietly called off their engagement months ago, when they found out federal laws effectively prohibited their marriage.
