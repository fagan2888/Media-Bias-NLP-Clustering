President Obama should invite Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar to the State of the Union address. Major Hegar flew medevac missions in Afghanistan as an Air National Guard search-and-rescue pilot. While flying a rescue mission in 2009, her helicopter was shot down, and she was forced to engage in combat. She was awarded the Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor for her actions.

In November 2012, she became the lead plaintiff in an A.C.L.U. lawsuit against the Department of Defense to end the ban on women in ground combat. A year later, the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs announced the end of that policy -- all thanks to Major Hegar.
