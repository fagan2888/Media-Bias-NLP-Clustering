Now you are looking to cast a male actor who can play the trumpet, but you can\u2019t for the life of you remember his name. Short of stalking actors who like jazz on Facebook, which is creepy, how are you ever going to find him?\n\nThere is now an app for that \u2014 or, more specifically, a database. TheatreWork.org is a new online database of Washington area performers who are looking for gigs. The site officially launches this week, but in the first month that it\u2019s been functional, more than 200 performers have created profiles, listing everything from their musical skills to whether or not they have visible tattoos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve described it as something like an online dating site,\u201d said Jennifer Clements, communications manager for \u00adTheatreWashington, the umbrella organization that is setting up TheatreWork. \u201cYou can weed out what you don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nBrad Watkins, TheatreWashington\u2019s director of theater services, summarizes the need for TheatreWork this way: \u201cIf a director sees Bob, Sue and Sally at a theater across town but doesn\u2019t have their contact information, he no longer has to play six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon in order to find them.\u201d\n\nThe Alexandria-based design and marketing firm Unconformity is creating the site, using modeling agency databases as, well, models. Which is not to say \u00adTheatreWork is the first database of its kind \u2014 two Minnesota nonprofit groups run similar Web sites, but those are open to the public and are not searchable according to specific details, such as Zip code and 23 designated performance skills, from juggling to martial arts training.\n\nThus far, TheatreWork is open only to performers. Barring any Affordable Care Act-type snafus, Watkins hopes to give approved theater professionals \u00adpassword-protected access to search the database by late spring. For performers, basic profiles will always be free, but after the first six months, they\u2019ll need to pay $29.95 a year to keep a full profile online, complete with a work sample video and multiple head shots.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the price of a few trips to Starbucks,\u201d Watkins said.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: The performer creates a user name and password and then encounters a page with more than 50 questions and fields to fill in. It starts with the basics, such as contact information, address and whether or not the performer is a member of a union. He or she uploads a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and pictures. Then the site poses more than two-dozen questions about physical appearance. How do you describe your physique: Muscular? Stocky? Overweight? Are you willing to cut or dye your hair for a role? Do you have an identical twin? Better yet, are you a triplet?\n\nPerformers can select multiple age brackets but are asked to identify just one \u201cethnic type,\u201d which seems unfair to biracial actors or performers who may personally identify with one ethnic type \u2014 say, \u201cMediterranean\u201d \u2014 but know they could play a part written for a \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d actor.\n\nForced categorization aside, TheatreWork has the potential to improve the racial diversity of casting on area stages, or at least make it easier for directors to find local performers of color. As an example, Clements cited Studio Theatre\u2019s 2010 panicked search for a young African American actor to star in \u201cSuperior Donuts,\u201d which required chartering a bus from New York.\n\n\u201cThat may not have to happen next time,\u201d she said.\n\nYet improving racial diversity on \u00adstages was not a driving rationale behind creating TheatreWork. Talk to local drama people, and a phrase that keeps coming up is \u201ccasting local.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a fabulous way to get the names and faces of local actors out there,\u201d said J. Fred Shiffman, an agent with the Capital Talent Agency. He represents about 100 professional actors from the Washington area, and he\u2019s encouraging his clients to create profiles on TheatreWork. Watkins called Shiffman early in the development process and was surprised to find the agent so enthusiastic. \u201cI do not view this in any way as competition,\u201d Shiffman said.\n\nTheir common goal is to help find work for local actors and discourage theaters from defaulting to New York auditions. Watkins points out that hiring local actors is often cheaper, because if a union performer lives more than 50 miles from a venue, the theater company has to provide housing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that Zip code function that people are going to be searching,\u201d Watkins said.\n\nThere are no restrictions on who can sign up, however, and nothing to keep an actor who is actually based in Chicago from registering using the address of a college pal who lives in Columbia Heights.\n\nLocal college acting programs are a big potential market for TheatreWork. Not only could students potentially get plugged in sooner, they might form relationships with directors and be more inclined to stay in town after they graduate.\n\nMichael Dove, artistic director of \u00adForum Theatre, has turned to both the University of Maryland and Howard University to find young actors of color. But to him, as the director of a small theater with limited resources, the biggest benefit is going to be speeding up the casting process, while reaching a larger talent pool.\n\n\u201cTo be quite honest, sometimes when I\u2019m casting I\u2019ll use Facebook, so I friend a lot of actors, but that\u2019s not an efficient way to do it,\u201d Dove said. He described his casting director as a \u201cvery, very part-time\u201d employee. Sometimes when theaters appear to be casting the same people, he said, it\u2019s not because there\u2019s some kind of exclusive club but because it\u2019s tough to find the time and money to do a more thorough search.\n\n\u201cWe are acting so much on memory and a stack of head shots, even just having all the actors out there in the same place is going to be a huge improvement,\u201d Dove said. TheatreWork will lead directors to performers they \u201cdidn\u2019t know, and that can only be a good thing.\u201d\n\nLewis Black, playwright\n\nEven though TheatreWashington\u2019s efforts are all about promoting local talent, many Washington arts organizations benefit from connections to entertainers who were in the area in their formative years but moved elsewhere. There\u2019s Mo Rocca, serving on the board of Imagination Stage, Shirley MacLaine dropping by the Washington Ballet\u2019s studios, and now a community theater in Annandale putting on plays by the comedian Lewis Black.\n\nZemfira Stage is mounting three of Black\u2019s 40 plays during a three-week run that starts tonight at the James Lee Community Center Theater. Black graduated from Springbrook High School in Montgomery County. Though his work as a playwright may come as a surprise, his dramatic subject matter makes sense. The plays include a drama about a trip to the Outer Banks and \u201cCrossing the Crab Nebula,\u201d a surrealist story about \u201ca very strange journey across the U.S.A. to California.\u201d Sounds like the perfect title for a play by a now-famous comedian who grew up near the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n\u2018Beaches\u2019 goes musical\n\nAlthough Signature Theatre has a reputation for casting local actors and for seeking out young performers who have worked at smaller theaters, director Eric Schaeffer has gone the New York route for casting the world premiere of \u201cBeaches.\u201d Yes, that would be the musical based on the 1985 novel by Iris Rainer Dart, which was adapted into the classic 1988 tear-jerker movie starring Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey. In the musical, Mara Davi, who was wonderful when she came through town in 2012 to play the tap-dancing younger sister in \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d will play Bertie, while Alysha Umphress, whose Broadway credits include \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d and \u201cOn a Clear Day You Can See Forever,\u201d takes on Midler\u2019s role of C.C. Previews of \u201cBeaches\u201d begin Feb. 18.\n\nRitzel is a freelance writer.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "TheatreWork, theatrewasington, backstage", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Say you\u2019re the director of a small theater company in the District, and about two years ago you saw a young actor do some excellent scatting on a trumpet at a Fringe Festival show.
