Eggs Benedict

The creation of this dish can either be attributed to a hung-over stockbroker named Lemuel Benedict or an elderly pope with a queasy stomach named Pope Benedict XIII. Apparently, Benedict the stock broker woke up one morning at the Waldorf Astoria hotel and asked for two poached eggs and bacon on buttered toast, with hollandaise sauce on the side. A sharp-eyed maître’d spotted the sandwich, substituted ham for bacon, used English muffins instead of toast and put the whole affair on the menu.
