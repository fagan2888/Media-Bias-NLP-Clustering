But I do think it\u2019s important and it makes sense in a lot of ways. I\u2019m glad the Pac-12 is out in front of this.\u201d\n\nLast month, the Pac-12 revealed details of a nonconference men\u2019s basketball game between Washington and Texas of the Big 12 to be played in Shanghai on Nov. 14. It will mark the first time that a regular-season game between U.S. teams in any sport, professional or college, is played in China.\n\n\u201cThis is historic \u2026 a milestone,\u201d said Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott.\n\nA second regular-season men\u2019s college game will be played in China next year.\n\nAs for Pac-12 football, the Pac-12 and Mountain West are talking about having representatives of their conferences play in a bowl game in Australia as early as after the 2016 season.\n\nScott\u2019s \u201cGlobalization Initiative\u201d appears to be gaining momentum.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of presidents and chancellors from Pac-12 schools that want to attract students from China and that part of the world,\u201d George said. \u201cCU attracts students from those areas. That\u2019s good for the diversity of our institutions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also to expose our brand. For the Pac-12, and the 12 schools underneath it, to get that kind of exposure in China and other places is invaluable.\u201d\n\nScott took over as conference commissioner in 2009 and immediately began talking about expanding the brand of the conference to a global audience. If that raised some eyebrows, it shouldn\u2019t have. Scott served the previous six years as chairman and CEO of the Women\u2019s Tennis Association. Among his accomplishments: signing a contract with Eurosport to broadcast WTA events in more than 50 countries.\n\nIn 2011, Scott launched the Globalization Initiative. USC and UCLA men\u2019s basketball teams have played exhibition games in China, as has the California women\u2019s basketball team. The Pac-12 sent an all-star women\u2019s volleyball team to China, and last summer a Pac-12 men\u2019s all-star basketball team (including CU\u2019s Xavier Johnson) played exhibition games in China. A delegation of basketball coaches from the Pac-12 conducted clinics in China.\n\nScott said he hopes a nonconference men\u2019s basketball game involving a Pac-12 team will become an annual tradition that signals the start of the college hoops season.\n\nGeorge can identify with Scott\u2019s vision. George worked for the PGA Tour as president of the Champions Tour (seniors) from 2003-08; he helped to increase revenues and sponsorships. George was instrumental in developing strategic plans that included events outside the U.S.\n\nThe 2014-15 PGA Tour schedule includes tournaments in China, Malaysia and Mexico.\n\n\u201cIf you want to grow your visibility and your brand, going to China and Asia is important for that,\u201d George said. \u201cI do like us getting exposure in that part of the world.\u201d\n\nSo does the Pac-12. It\u2019s not out of the question that someday the Alibaba Group could consider including the Pac-12 Network on its list of channels. Corporate sponsors may follow.\n\n\u201cThe audience in China includes 650 million households,\u201d George said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pac-12\u2019s global initiative gains steam with basketball game in China", "title": "Pac-12\u2019s global initiative gains steam with basketball game in China", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/pac-12s-global-initiative-gains-steam-with-basketball-game-in-china/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606__BN20150607_C12_BNSP07PAC12SCOTT_1p1.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150606__BN20150607_C12_BNSP07PAC12SCOTT_1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T20:36:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T02:45:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda123\"", "article_summary": "USC and UCLA men\u2019s basketball teams have played exhibition games in China, as has the California women\u2019s basketball team.\nScott said he hopes a nonconference men\u2019s basketball game involving a Pac-12 team will become an annual tradition that signals the start of the college hoops season.\nThe Pac-12 sent an all-star women\u2019s volleyball team to China, and last summer a Pac-12 men\u2019s all-star basketball team (including CU\u2019s Xavier Johnson) played exhibition games in China.\nA second regular-season men\u2019s college game will be played in China next year.\nIt will mark the first time that a regular-season game between U.S. teams in any sport, professional or college, is played in China."}
