The decision raises many questions about the legal implications in the workplace for LGBT employees and their spouses.\n\nFriday\u2019s historic ruling inevitably leads to some large, looming questions: namely, can employers refuse health care benefits to same-sex spouses of their employees?\n\nNationally legalizing same-sex marriage is a relief as it is likely a burden for employers and employees alike. Attorney Jeff DeVree, who specializes in employee benefits with Varnum LLP, told FOX 17 News expect to see a head-on conflict between equal protection and religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThe real question will be for religious organizations and businesses owned by people with strong religious convictions, will the Religious Freedom Restoration Act survive this ruling by the Supreme Court,\u201d said DeVree.\n\nDeVree said that any employers who attempt to deny benefits to employees\u2019 same-sex spouses would only have the defense of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and their First Amendment right to religious freedom.\n\n\u201cState law now has to permit same-sex couples to be married; that doesn\u2019t make same-sex marriage a protected classification under employment discrimination laws,\u201d said DeVree.\n\nAs it stands, Michigan\u2019s Elliot-Larson Civil Rights Act does not protect same-sex employees from employer discrimination. Although, there are a number of Michigan municipalities that have recently passed ordinances protecting the LGBT community.\n\nAttorney Norbert Kugele, who also specializes in employee benefits with Warner Norcross & Judd LLP, told FOX 17 News that employers should consider the potential impact of local laws before attempting to deny any employee benefits.\n\nWith the Supreme Court sharply divided on its same-sex marriage ruling, some like DeVree believe it was a preview to what lies ahead, which may be the contest of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in the high court.\n\nAnother issue too is that under the Affordable Care Act, employers are not required to offer health care coverage to spouses; employers must only insure employees and dependent children.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. \u2013 It may still be an uphill battle after the Supreme Court\u2019s momentous ruling to legalize same-sex marriage.
