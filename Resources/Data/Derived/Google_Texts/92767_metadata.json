The President ended up speaking during the day, when breaking into regular programming did not have such a significant hit.\n\nBack in 2009, network executives estimated to Adweek that three primetime news conferences cost them around $30 million in ad revenue.\n\nAt 9 p.m. on the East Coast, CBS, ABC, Fox and NBC will all be breaking into their regular programming to run the speech.\n\nNBC will be breaking into a live edition of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d and will have Brian Williams anchoring. ABC will be breaking into a rerun of \"Modern Family.\u201d George Stephanopoulos will anchor. The Fox broadcast network will cut into the two-hour season premiere of \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d for the address, with Shepard Smith anchoring. CBS will be breaking into a special about \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d called \u201cUnder the Lights,\u201d which will preview the upcoming season. Bob Schieffer will anchor on CBS, with Scott Pelley contributing from Iraq.\n\nThe primetime presence is very significant, as every time the President makes a primetime address, it can cost them millions of dollars. Presidential speeches are commercial-free, and take up space that would otherwise be filled with entertainment programming and ads.\n\nFor tonight\u2019s address, NBC is effectively making the biggest commitment, effectively delaying \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d on the east coast. It isn\u2019t clear whether NBC will proceed with the show as usual, breaking in when the President is done, or whether it will wait until the address is over. Fox is in a similar boat with \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d but because it is taped, viewers can catch up on whatever they miss later on. CBS\u2019 N.F.L. special is effectively filler, but it is still football-related, and would likely deliver strong numbers for the network. The special will be simulcast on NFL Network, so viewers that really want to see it still can. ABC, which has only reruns slated in that hour, will not be losing too much.\n\nThe cable news channels will, as you would expect, cover the address from all angles. Fox News has Bret Baier and Megyn Kelly anchoring, with live shows before and after. CNN has Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer anchoring. MSNBC, CNBC, Fox Business, Al Jazeera America et al will also be covering the speech live. Bloomberg will have John Heilemann and Mark Halperin anchoring, in advance of their new show's launch.\n\nThe President last delivered a primetime address in August, speaking for eight brief minutes starting at 9:30 p.m. about helping Iraqis surrounded by the Islamic group ISIS.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how long tonight\u2019s address will last, but it will certainly boost cable news, and cost the broadcast networks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/09/8552209/networks-face-costly-decision-obamas-primetime-isis-remarks", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20BarackObama_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "Networks face costly decision with Obama's primetime ISIS remarks"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Will give up millions in potential revenue to give the President a platform"}, "article_summary": "The primetime presence is very significant, as every time the President makes a primetime address, it can cost them millions of dollars.\nThe President last delivered a primetime address in August, speaking for eight brief minutes starting at 9:30 p.m. about helping Iraqis surrounded by the Islamic group ISIS.\nBack in 2009, network executives estimated to Adweek that three primetime news conferences cost them around $30 million in ad revenue.\nThe President ended up speaking during the day, when breaking into regular programming did not have such a significant hit.\nIt isn\u2019t clear how long tonight\u2019s address will last, but it will certainly boost cable news, and cost the broadcast networks."}
