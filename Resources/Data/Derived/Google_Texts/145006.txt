1. President Obama, speaking in honor of the 150th anniversary of the constitutional ban on slavery, took a swipe at Donald Trump’s call for barring Muslim from entering the U.S. “Remember that our freedom is bound up with the freedom of others, regardless of what they look like or where they come from or what their last name,” Mr. Obama said, pointedly adding, “or what faith they practice.”

2. U.S. officials offered a fuller picture of the couple they say killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., last week. Radicalized separately, they were “talking to each other about jihad and martyrdom” before they became engaged in 2013, the F.B.I. director said. That raised questions about whether U.S. authorities missed something in the woman’s visa process.

3. The focus on the San Bernardino case and the political uproar stirred up since have slowed Congress’s progress on a spending bill, meaning lawmakers plan to pass a stopgap bill by the Friday deadline. The Hill is a frenzy of lobbying, dealing and sparring over topics like new restrictions on Syrian and Iraqi refugees, environmental rules and campaign finance rules.

4. Those last-minute provisions can have a huge impact. One Marco Rubio slipped into last year’s spending bill has undermined the Affordable Care Act, forcing premiums to rise and some insurers to close. Still, the Obama administration boasted of robust sign-ups for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, with next Tuesday the deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1.

7. Our top movie critics have wide-ranging tastes. But both put “Carol” and “Mad Max: Fury Road” among their top films of the year. A.O. Scott called “Mad Max” “a master class in old-school, super-linear action filmmaking, full of nasty, punk-rock, dystopian Australian humor. Also the best recent eco-feminist-socialist allegory that isn’t a novel by Margaret Atwood.”

8. “South Park” wraps up its 19th season tonight (10 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central) amid critical acclaim for its season-long send-up of rigid political correctness and the culture of outrage. “It was as if our culture had been shining an Eric Cartman-shaped Bat-signal and ‘South Park’ answered,” our reviewer said.

9. The mood remained cautiously optimistic as climate talks in Paris neared their official Friday close (though a Saturday finish is possible). Sticking points include how often to reconvene to assess compliance with emissions targets and how often to toughen those targets. Beijing suffered through another day of red alert pollution.

10. A Colorado court charged Robert Dear with 179 counts, including first-degree murder, in the shooting rampage last month at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

A 2,000-year-old stone block unearthed in the ruins of a synagogue six years ago near the Sea of Galilee could be a three-dimensional representation of the Second Temple, made while the original still stood.
