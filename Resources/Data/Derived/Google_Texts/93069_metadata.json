(Photo: File photo)\n\nA Pekin woman who was seriously injured in a two-car collision Friday morning on Grant Line Road died Saturday, according to Floyd County police.\n\nHavannah Balentine, 19, died of multiple-blunt force trauma at University of Louisville Hospital.\n\nPolice said Balentine was traveling south on Grant Line in a silver 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix when the vehicle crossed a set of railroad tracks near Chapel Lane and skidded into the northbound lane.\n\nReconstruction at the scene indicated Balentine overcorrected twice causing her vehicle to lose control on the curved roadway and slam into a silver 2005 Kia van.\n\nThe van's driver, John Wright, 35, of Borden, was unhurt, but three of his passengers suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to area hospitals. Police said speed appeared to be a factor.\n\nRecords show that Balentine graduated from Eastern High School in Pekin last spring and had played infield on the girls' softball team.\n\nNew Albany Police, Indiana State Police, New Chapel Fire Department and Yellow Ambulance assisted at the scene.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1C3lTmW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Police said Balentine was traveling south on Grant Line in a silver 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix when the vehicle crossed a set of railroad tracks near Chapel Lane and skidded into the northbound lane.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Police said Balentine was traveling south on Grant Line in a silver 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix when the vehicle crossed a set of railroad tracks near Chapel Lane and skidded into the northbound lane.", "title": "Pekin woman dies after Friday collision", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/01/25/pekin-woman-dies-friday-collision/22323571/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police said Balentine was traveling south on Grant Line in a silver 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix when the vehicle crossed a set of railroad tracks near Chapel Lane and skidded into the northbound lane.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d79ad83a892f8c583095b331042822313ad3eff3/c=124-0-618-494&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/25/B9315998158Z.1_20150125192436_000_G1P9P49TI.1-0.jpg", "title": "Pekin woman dies after Friday collision", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Louisville", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Louisville", "title": "Pekin woman dies after Friday collision", "author": "Grace Schneider", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b42c163f592376fd2f5d5a6407d993edcb275793/c=186-0-556-494/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/25/B9315998158Z.1_20150125192436_000_G1P9P49TI.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6adba0fd4d3baf0c66d91696cce0696db2c7bc32/c=124-0-618-494/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/25/B9315998158Z.1_20150125192436_000_G1P9P49TI.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9c25aa6fc318d835570657c49cc3b1426f3a1c5a/c=42-0-701-494/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/25/B9315998158Z.1_20150125192436_000_G1P9P49TI.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/685d9cffa2585451332245ab40640fad5ada7411/c=0-38-742-455&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/25/B9315998158Z.1_20150125192436_000_G1P9P49TI.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-25T22:33:40.390000-05:00", "shorthed": "Friday crash kills Pekin teen", "articleid": 22323571, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e8295feed122642a544ad03e4b9124615ff7a44b/c=0-38-742-455/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/25/B9315998158Z.1_20150125192436_000_G1P9P49TI.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dec4374018185d9ef9f32b135067e643bb7428cb/c=232-0-510-494/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/01/25/B9315998158Z.1_20150125192436_000_G1P9P49TI.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Grant Line Road, Indiana, Fatal Crash"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf677\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: File photo)A Pekin woman who was seriously injured in a two-car collision Friday morning on Grant Line Road died Saturday, according to Floyd County police.\nIndiana State Police were among the first responders on the scene of the Friday morning crash that ultimately killed 19-year-old Havannah Balentine of Pekin.\nNew Albany Police, Indiana State Police, New Chapel Fire Department and Yellow Ambulance assisted at the scene.\nRecords show that Balentine graduated from Eastern High School in Pekin last spring and had played infield on the girls' softball team.\nReconstruction at the scene indicated Balentine overcorrected twice causing her vehicle to lose control on the curved roadway and slam into a silver 2005 Kia van."}
