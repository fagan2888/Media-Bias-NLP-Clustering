A medical marijuana firm has broken ground in New York before winning state approval. The company's president calls the move in the Hudson Valley an educated leap of faith.

The Times Herald-Record of Middletown reports officials from Valley Agriceuticals broke ground Thursday on a growing and processing plant in Wallkill, about 70 miles north of New York City

Its president, Erik Holling, says that while the company is competing with about 40 others for five state licenses, it needs to get the project moving to get product on the shelves by January.

The firm expects a decision from the state Department of Health by next month. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the medical marijuana bill into law last year.

The Wallkill Town Board voted 5-0 in April to approve the plant.
