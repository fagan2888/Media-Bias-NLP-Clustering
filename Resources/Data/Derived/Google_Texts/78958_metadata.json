The new Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) system developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be posted on the CMS Nursing Home Compare website. It is also used in the Nursing Home Five Star Quality Rating System to help consumers understand the level and differences of staffing in nursing homes, the agency said.\n\nThe PBJ system is designed to \u201callow staffing information to be collected on a regular and more frequent basis than currently collected. It will also be auditable to ensure accuracy,\u201d said Thomas E. Hamilton, CMS director, Survey and Certification Group, in an April 10 memo. All long-term care facilities will have access to this system.\n\nThe new data collection effort comes under Section 6106 of the Affordable Care Act, which requires nursing homes to electronically submit direct care staffing information (including information with respect to agency and contract staff) based on payroll and other verifiable and auditable data in a uniform format.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "news_keywords": "Center For Medicare & Medicaid Services, Staffing Data", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "The government has posted technical specifications showing long-term care facilities how to electronically submit staffing information based on payroll data under a new system that becomes mandatory in July 2016", "title": "CMS posts specifics on staffing, payroll data collection for Five Star ratings", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/cms-posts-specifics-on-staffing-payroll-data-collection-for-five-star-ratings/article/409120/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2011/04/01/nurse_writing2_156227_156228.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2011/04/01/nurse_writing2_156227_156228.jpg"}, "title": "CMS posts specifics on staffing, payroll data collection for Five Star ratings", "description": "The government has posted technical specifications showing long-term care facilities how to electronically submit staffing information based on payroll data under a new system that becomes mandatory in July 2016", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@mcknightsltcn"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Staffing Data", "published_time": "2015-04-15T00:07:01", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T00:15:25"}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The government has posted technical specifications showing long-term care facilities how to electronically submit staffing information based on payroll data under a new system that becomes mandatory in July 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfac2\"", "article_summary": "CMS posts specifics on staffing, payroll data collection for Five Star ratingsShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintFacilities will be able to voluntarily submit that data beginning in October this year.\nThe government has posted technical specifications showing long-term care facilities how to electronically submit staffing information based on payroll data under a new system that becomes mandatory in July 2016.\nFacilities will be able to voluntarily submit that data beginning in October this year.\nThe PBJ system is designed to \u201callow staffing information to be collected on a regular and more frequent basis than currently collected.\nThe new Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) system developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be posted on the CMS Nursing Home Compare website."}
