But she gets you.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about Hillary Clinton: She\u2019s in Millennials\u2019 corner.\n\nShe wants to talk about treatment for the anxiety or depression we\u2019ve all experienced as adolescents or college freshman; she wants to remedy the substance abuse we saw taking place in our schools; she\u2019s eager to encourage companies to train and hire us.\n\nShe\u2019s poised to be the candidate for men and women our age, before any other Democratic candidate has even stepped on the scene.\n\nIn 2015, Millennials will overtake the Baby Boomer generation as the largest living generation in the United States.\n\nFor any presidential candidate in Election 2016 to succeed, they\u2019ll need to appeal to the 18- to 34-year-old demographic, 77 percent of whom are likely to vote.\n\nHillary hasn\u2019t made the full spectrum of her political platform clear, but her record as Secretary of State and as one of the leaders of the Clinton Foundation is a testament to her interest in addressing issues important to young people.\n\nMental health matters\n\nIn April 2015, Hillary participated in a New Hampshire roundtable and made it clear she\u2019d make mental health issues a big part of her campaign.\n\nShe emphasized Americans\u2019 concerns about substance abuse in small towns as well as concerns of cutbacks in insurance coverage for treatment programs.\n\nMental health is not usually a priority in presidential campaigns. Many candidates seem to dismiss it as something trumped by issues like foreign policy, the economy and taxes.\n\nBut it\u2019s an issue plaguing young voters, and Hillary has pledged to \u201cdo more.\u201d She said she\u2019d advocate for more of a \u201cconcerted policy\u201d on mental health treatment and substance abuse prevention, at all levels of government.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just rhetoric. Mrs. Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act, which required insurance plans to cover mental health and substance abuse services.\n\nShe also spoke about the issue last May at the National Council for Behavioral Health\u2019s Annual Conference. In reference to individuals suffering from mental health issues, she stated\n\nThe issues you are living with\u2026 are among the most important that we currently face as a society.\n\nShe went on to point out:\n\nAmerican women today are actually living shorter lives than their mothers\u2026We need to get serious and creative about stemming the tide of drug overdoses and dependencies.\n\nHillary\u2019s concern about mental health issues goes on. The Clinton Foundation, for all of the controversy it has attracted, has done some fantastic things for young people.\n\nIt created a series of conferences, held at universities across the country, called Mental Health and Wellness on Campus: A Town Hall Without Walls.\n\nThe series offered today\u2019s college students a forum to discuss how they can get help, and ask questions about prescription drug use and abuse.\n\nThese are the kinds of topics presidential candidates need to latch onto. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article profiling the increasing prominence of anxiety and depression among incoming college freshmen.\n\nAlso consider the school shootings taking place over the last decade, perpetrated by extremely disturbed young people who were clearly in need of mental health treatment.\n\nWhat matters to Millennials \u2014 and why\n\nMental health isn\u2019t the only issue on the table. Millennials are still struggling in Obama\u2019s economy. Unemployment among individuals 25 to 34 years old hovers at 5.6 percent, versus 3.7 percent among people aged 45 to 54.\n\nPeople our age are supposed to be the desirable candidates \u2014 the fresh, energetic, creative ones companies want to hire. But it\u2019s not happening.\n\nHillary wants to fix this. In 2014, she announced the creation of Job One, a project incorporated companies like The Gap, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Marriott all participated in.\n\nIt encourages companies to hire and train young people.\n\nHillary\u2019s announcement video also pledges to help Millennials. The video shows several examples of individuals in the 18-34 age bracket who\u2019d be concerned with issues like child care, gender equality, student loans and family planning.\n\nIt shows a young gay couple planning a marriage, an interracial couple, and a woman returning to work after taking time off to raise her child.\n\nThere are older individuals in the video. But many of the people featured, and issues alluded to, are the kinds of things that our very liberal (43 percent Democratic or Democratic-leaning) generation cares about.\n\nMore than half of Millennials have dated outside of their race and are concerned about economic issues and employment. A Pew Research Poll found 70 percent of individuals born after 1981 support marriage equality, illustrating a much more liberal view among our generation toward gay rights.\n\nHillary Clinton, at least so far, has hit the nail on the head with our generation. She knows what matters, and she\u2019s ready to talk about it, regardless of the subject matter\u2019s popularity with other candidates.\n\nBeing in tune with Millennials will help her win. Our demographic is massive, prepared to turn out to vote and, generally speaking, eager to take a stand on major issues.\n\nIt certainly helps her cause so many Millennials are already left-leaning.\n\nStill, Hillary will need to continue to listen to young people, be it through Twitter, town halls or visits to college campuses, to ensure she stays in step.\n\nAnd let\u2019s just be honest: the Texts from Hillary Tumblr probably didn\u2019t hurt her popularity either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "And she's promising to give us just that.", "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "description": "And she's promising to give us just that.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Is The Only Candidate Who Knows What Millennials Want", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cD1iMGZkY2U2ZWY3ZDc2ZTJiOGY3NGRkM2M5MGNlMGNkNyZnPTViYmUzM2MyYmY4ZmFhYjBkMmJmZWQ2MWM5NTFmY2Y2.jpg", "url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-what-millennials-want/1012053/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Elite Daily", "description": "And she's promising to give us just that.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Is The Only Candidate Who Knows What Millennials Want", "image": {"src": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cD1iMGZkY2U2ZWY3ZDc2ZTJiOGY3NGRkM2M5MGNlMGNkNyZnPTViYmUzM2MyYmY4ZmFhYjBkMmJmZWQ2MWM5NTFmY2Y2.jpg"}, "creator": "@jillpohl", "site": "@EliteDaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-what-millennials-want/1012053/"}, "ios": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-what-millennials-want/1012053/", "app_store_id": 1032458504, "app_name": "Elite Daily"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 378366428966386}, "keywords": "Hillary,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily", "section": "News", "tag": "Election 2016,Mental Health,millennials,presidential candidates", "published_time": "2015-04-24T13:46:03+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.elitestatic.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/apple_favicon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hillary,"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s the thing about Hillary Clinton: She\u2019s in Millennials\u2019 corner.\nMental health mattersIn April 2015, Hillary participated in a New Hampshire roundtable and made it clear she\u2019d make mental health issues a big part of her campaign.\nHillary Clinton, at least so far, has hit the nail on the head with our generation.\nMrs. Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act, which required insurance plans to cover mental health and substance abuse services.\nHillary\u2019s concern about mental health issues goes on."}
