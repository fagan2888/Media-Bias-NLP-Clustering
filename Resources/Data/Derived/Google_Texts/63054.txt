The Japan Rugby Football Union is asking fans to come up with a name for its Super Rugby franchise, which will play in the the Southern Hemisphere’s top provincial rugby league from next year.

According to the JRFU website, the name should reflect the passion, bravery and pride of a Japanese team competing against teams from other countries in the expanded league.

Currently there are 15 teams in the league, with Australia, New Zealand and South Africa each controlling five franchises. The expanded Super Rugby league will add a South African team, an Argentinian team and the Japanese team. The colorful names of existing teams include the Chiefs, the Sharks, the Rebels, the Hurricanes and the Stormers.

Japan’s national rugby team is called the Brave Blossoms, and the union’s participation in Super Rugby should give some members of the national squad useful experience playing against international opponents in the run-up to the 2019 World Cup, which Japan is hosting.

Readers wishing to suggest a name can use Japanese characters or the alphabet to make their recommendations, but must avoid any of the nicknames currently used by Japan’s various national teams. Suggestions can be made on the JRFU’s website until June 19.
