In the May 27 letter, signed by the Bad River, Red Cliff, Lac Courte Oreilles, Lac du Flambeau, St. Croix and Sokoagon Ojibwe Bands, tribes maintain that mining activities by GTAC will threaten the health of the western Superior Basin and Bad River Watershed.\n\nAccording to Mark Anthony Rolo, Communications Director for the Bad River tribe, this issue has been added to the agenda of the annual EPA Region 5 Regional Tribal Operating Committee meeting next month in Traverse City, Michigan.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, long time supporter of GTAC\u2019s plan to build the large open pit iron ore taconite mine near Lake Superior, is \u201ccrying foul,\u201d according to an editorial in the Capital Times. Walker \u201chopes the EPA will not step in to evaluate the environmental effects of the project before other state and federal agencies are given the opportunity to act on any permits for the project.\u201d\n\nHe further expressed concerns that the EPA might politicize the process of evaluating the mine.\n\nBad River Tribal Chairman Mike Wiggins said, \u201cGov. Walker has done everything he can to grease the skids for this out of state mining company to get their law then their mine. We washed our hands of him. Unfortunately now he is trying to interfere with the tribes sovereign relationship with the federal government. Walker\u2019s comments characterizing the treaties and trust responsibility as \u201cpolitics\u201d is just another example of why Bad River has gone to the federal level.\u201d\n\nBob Seitz, Director of External Affairs for GTAC, expressed surprise about the tribes\u2019 request for EPA evaluation of the mining process.\n\n\u201cWe are following and trust the science and experts in this process. The experts at the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers do a good job of protecting the environment; their process if rigorous,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if GTAC is concerned about EPA\u2019s possible involvement with the mine he said, \u201cWe are concerned about anything that would block the process of gathering science and data. We are working with state and federal authorities to ensure they have everything they need to make a good decision.\u201d\n\nThere have been differing claims regarding the presence of asbestos and sulfite in the rocks at the proposed mining sites and the possibility that the mining process would release these poisonous contaminants into the environment.\n\nRELATED: Deadly Asbestos Could Kill Gogebic\u2019s Iron Ore Mine Project\n\nLast week, GTAC filed a license renewal with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources that includes plans for six new drilling sites in a four-mile area east of the town of Mellen in eastern Ashland and western Iron counties.\n\nAccording to a WDNR press release the department has 10 days to review and issue a response to the application.\n\nThe mining controversy has attracted national and international media attention. On Friday, the Bad River community viewed the premier of a documentary episode of Al Jazeera\u2019s America\u2019s Fault Lines series, \u201cWisconsin\u2019s Mining Standoff,\u201d according to Rolo.\n\nThe 30-minute investigative film \u201ctells the story of how GTAC and its allies wielded money and power to influence the law, and goes behind the scenes with the burgeoning movement to resist the mine. It explores the potential harms the mine might bring, from asbestos exposure to acid runoff into the waterways in the area,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s press kit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Wisconsin Federation of tribes has asked the EPA to use the 404 C portion of Clean Water Act to stop mining activity by Gogebic Taconite.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/16/wisconsin-tribes-urge-epa-use-clean-water-act-stop-gogebic-taconite-mine-155847", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tyler_forks_river_-_penokee_hills_-_mary_annette_pember.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Wisconsin Tribes Urge EPA to Use Clean Water Act to Stop Gogebic Taconite Mine"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-16T09:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Wisconsin Tribes Urge EPA to Use Clean Water Act to Stop Gogebic Taconite Mine"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/16/wisconsin-tribes-urge-epa-use-clean-water-act-stop-gogebic-taconite-mine-155847", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, Wisconsin Federation of Tribes, Clean Water Act, Gogebic Taconite, GTAC, Penokee Mountains, Bad River Ojibwe Reservation, Mike Simonson, Mary Annette Pember, Mark Anthony Rolo, Gov.
