The reaction was generally positive to the Republicans\u2019 choice to replace CBO Director Doug Elmendorf, who has served in the position since.\n\nConservatives Split on Keeping or Ditching CBO\u2019s Elmendorf\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, Congress relies on CBO for non-partisan, unbiased economic and budgetary analysis,\u201d said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cI hope that Director Hall will continue that tradition of independent and professional leadership.\u201d\n\nHowever, some analysts questioned how well he will do in defending the agency\u2019s findings in tough meetings with lawmakers, as some of his predecessors including Alice Rivlin, Robert Reischauer. Rudy Penner, Doug Holtz-Eakin, Peter Orszag and Elmendorf have had to do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Keith has ever had that kind of public confrontation where he has to in public disagree with or correct the chair or a member of the Budget Committee,\u201d said Steve Bell, a former Republican Senate Budget Committee adviser and now a top executive with the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThe jury obviously is out on that.\u201d\n\nHall will formally succeed Elmendorf on April 1, whose departure was foreordained by the Republican takeover of Congress in last November\u2019s mid-term election. The new Republican leadership wanted to put its stamp on that critical position, although some conservatives initially sought to keep the Princeton and Harvard educated Elmendorf on for another term. Elmendorf took charge of CBO in January 2009, succeeding Peter Orszag.\n\nRelated: Why Budget Experts Are Worried About the Next CBO Chief\n\nThe change in leadership of the non-partisan congressional agency charged with overseeing and analyzing all facets of the federal budget and legislation, comes at a critical juncture. Shortly after taking charge of Congress in January, House Republicans implemented controversial new rules requiring CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation to use \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d in assessing the impact of changes in the tax law, as a means of more fully taking into account the macroeconomic effects of government actions, and reflecting them in the cost of proposed legislation.\n\nRepublicans dating back to the Reagan administration of the 1980s have embraced dynamic scoring, in large measure, because of their belief that tax cuts stimulate economic growth.\n\nRelated: Dynamic Scoring Adds More Problems to an Already Flawed CBO Process\n\nHowever, the practice is controversial because many economists don\u2019t believe that dynamic scoring can produce reliable forecasts. In a recent interview, former Congressional Budget Office Director June O\u2019Neill told The Fiscal Times that dynamic scoring introduced \u201cinnumerable problems\u201d into the budget scoring process.\n\nIn Elmendorf\u2019s CBO, as it was under his predecessors, dynamic scoring is little-used. The majority of economists believe that macroeconomic effects of policy are so difficult to model that dynamic scoring would produce unreliable data.\n\nThe data that is currently produced and that the government acts on is also a shot in the dark\u2014not because the numbers are wrong, but because of the lengthy projections that can\u2019t foresee economic changes in demographics or the economy.\n\nScoring Hall on Dynamic Scoring\n\nThroughout his career, Hall has specialized primarily on labor and work force issues, the cost of government regulations and other economic data. He has provided little evidence of where he comes down on the dynamic scoring controversy.\n\n\u201cKeith Hall will bring an impressive level of economic expertise and experience to the Congressional Budget Office,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, in a statement. \u201cHis vast understanding of economic and labor market policy will be invaluable to the work of CBO.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Sets Stage For Big Budget Showdown with GOP\n\nThe choice of Hall was made by the Republican chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees in concert with House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). No vote is necessary to confirm the choice.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, offered one of the few discordant notes about the choice.\n\n\u201cBased on Mr. Hall\u2019s writings, it appears that we have very different views on a range of issues and he would not have been my first choice,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHis opposition to increasing the minimum wage and his resistance to sound strategies for eliminating poverty place him outside the mainstream.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Keith Hall, a former top economic adviser in the Bush administration and one-time head", "title": "Will New CBO Director Keith Hall Stand Up to Congress?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/27/Will-New-CBO-Director-Keith-Hall-Stand-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04142011_Capitol_Cash_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/27/Will-New-CBO-Director-Keith-Hall-Stand-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04142011_Capitol_Cash_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Keith Hall, a former top economic adviser in the Bush administration and one-time head", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbe7\"", "article_summary": "In a recent interview, former Congressional Budget Office Director June O\u2019Neill told The Fiscal Times that dynamic scoring introduced \u201cinnumerable problems\u201d into the budget scoring process.\nRelated: Dynamic Scoring Adds More Problems to an Already Flawed CBO ProcessHowever, the practice is controversial because many economists don\u2019t believe that dynamic scoring can produce reliable forecasts.\n\u201cKeith Hall will bring an impressive level of economic expertise and experience to the Congressional Budget Office,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, in a statement.\nSen.
