And the North American Registry of Midwives is now overseeing the training and certification of Arizona midwives instead of the state, which now just handles licensing.\n\nBut the industry\u2019s biggest battle lies ahead and won\u2019t be solved this legislative session.\n\nDuring their work over the past year, said midwife Wendi Cleckner, they learned that state law makes it a felony for midwives to provide medications to their patients \u2014 even to save the woman\u2019s life.\n\nMedications commonly used by midwives include vitamin K to help a newborn with blood clotting, antibiotic ointment to prevent eye infections in newborns, Lidocaine to numb an area for stitches, and Pitocin to control a mother\u2019s heavy postpartum bleeding.\n\nThe statute, which is separate from the section of the law dealing with midwives, conflicts with the state\u2019s rules and those of the national certification agency. Both of those allow midwives to carry and administer certain medicines.\n\nFor midwives to legally provide the medicines they\u2019ve used in the state for decades, they want the Legislature to change the statute.\n\nThey had hoped to introduce a bill when the session begins in January, but this week decided to delay the fight for a year.\n\n\u201cAs we started to meet with legislators and hear from people in politics, there were some interesting factors that came up: It\u2019s election season next November; there\u2019s some ongoing infighting among legislators due to \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 \u201d Cleckner said. \u201cWe did not find people willing to support us.\u201d\n\nCleckner said the group determined it didn\u2019t have the support for the legislation this year.\n\n\u201cIt was really disheartening, but we\u2019re hoping we can continue talks,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will give us more time to talk to legislators.\u201d\n\nArizona is one of 27 states to allow certified professional midwives to deliver babies. Among those states, it\u2019s one of two that do not allow midwives to carry and dispense medications. Midwives deliver about 1 percent of the babies in Arizona.\n\nLast year, at the request of patients, the Legislature established an advisory committee to overhaul the state\u2019s rules on midwives.\n\n\u201cWe had a bunch of stakeholder meetings,\u201d said Arizona Department of Health Services legislative liaison Colby Bower. \u201cThe (Caesarean) stuff got a lot of play like, \u2018Oh, we totally loosened our rules.\u2019 But overall, our new rules have really provided a more regulatory framework.\u201d\n\nFor example, he said, there are new informed-consent requirements to assure midwives are clear with their patients about what\u2019s permitted under midwifery and some of the risks.\n\nThe group also looked at updating the rules on medications.\n\nBower said the rules allow midwives to administer certain medications in an emergency, after they\u2019ve called 911 and if they have a standing written order from a physician.\n\n\u201cMany things were outdated since our rules hadn\u2019t really been gone through in about 20 years,\u201d Cleckner said. \u201cAnd medicine changes pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nAs they began to work on updating the state\u2019s list of authorized drugs, they discovered the conflicting state statute: \u201cWe came to the conclusion that it\u2019s a felony for midwives to obtain, carry or administer any of the drugs written into our rules.\u201d\n\nBower said the midwives wanted to change statute so they would be allowed to carry and administer certain medications without needing a standing order from a doctor.\n\n\u201cI think they would be the first to tell you it\u2019s difficult to get such an order from a physician,\u201d Bower said. \u201cThey were looking to change that.\u201d\n\nSuch a bill requires the support of the House and Senate health committees of reference. The midwives had put their proposal on the calendar for Tuesday\u2019s hearing and then withdrew it at the last minute.\n\n\u201cI think they were counting their votes,\u201d Bower said. Two of the legislative members are physicians.\n\nCleckner said they will try again next year.\n\n\u201cWe are asking for the very basic medications that all midwives globally should have access to,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the meantime, Cleckner said Arizona midwives must decide whether they will continue to carry and provide medicines knowing they could be charged with a felony.\n\n\u201cEvery midwife is different in what they will choose to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a lot of midwives want to practice safely, and safely means having emergency drugs.\u201d\n\nShe said a healthy mother having a low-risk pregnancy and textbook labor and delivery can start losing large amounts amounts of blood right after the birth.\n\n\u201cA woman can lose her entire blood volume in three to four minutes,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said midwives are not asking for anything beyond what they believe their job is.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for lifesaving things,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that midwives carry these.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Alia Beard Rau", "description": "Midwives tout new regulations, but medicine-rule battle looms,Arizona licensed midwives, their clients and health officials have spent the past year updating antiquated state regulations and are claiming some significant victories.", "pubdate": "Sat Dec 14, 2013 10:22 PM", "creditline": "The Republic | azcentral.com", "headline": "Midwives tout new regulations, but medicine-rule battle looms", "section": "News", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2na4", "type": "article", "image": "http://i.azcentral.com/i/2/6/a/L169_CIFRd2b70c7b2be701c41d1a4976fff7ba62.jpg", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "title": "Midwives tout new regulations, but medicine-rule battle looms"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Midwives tout new regulations, but medicine-rule battle looms, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"description": "Arizona licensed midwives, their clients and health officials have spent the past year updating antiquated state regulations and are claiming some significant victories.", "title": "Midwives tout new regulations, but medicine-rule battle looms", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20131210midwives-regulations-medicine-rule-battle-looms.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "account_id": 13115682}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6cd7\"", "article_summary": "Last year, at the request of patients, the Legislature established an advisory committee to overhaul the state\u2019s rules on midwives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that midwives carry these.\u201d\nThe statute, which is separate from the section of the law dealing with midwives, conflicts with the state\u2019s rules and those of the national certification agency.\nBoth of those allow midwives to carry and administer certain medicines.\nAmong those states, it\u2019s one of two that do not allow midwives to carry and dispense medications."}
