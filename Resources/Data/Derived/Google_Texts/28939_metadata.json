In the Americans for Prosperity ad aimed at destroying Michigan Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Gary Peters, Julie Boonstra inaccurately claims that Obamacare is threatening her cancer treatment and that it \u201cjeopardized my health.\u201d\n\nShe said her life was on the line due to Obamacare, \u201cNow, the out-of-pocket costs are so high, it\u2019s unaffordable. If I do not receive my medication, I will die.\u201d That\u2019s a really strong accusation, so it drew a lot of attention, and it turned out to be more Koch brothers baloney.\n\nWhen called out on the facts, the Koch Brothers SuperPAC, Americans for Prosperity, and the GOP claimed people were picking on a cancer victim, as if they couldn\u2019t tell the difference between personal attacks and fact-checking.\n\nBut Chris Savage, publisher of EclectaBlog, revealed that the alleged \u201cObamacare victim\u201d from the Koch Brothers ad shares property in Dexter, Michigan with former Washtenaw County GOP chair, Mark Boonstra.\n\nSavage wrote on his site EclectaBlog that it seems like more than just the AFP are taking advantage of Julie Boonstra:\n\nAs far as Julie Boonstra being taken advantage of, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just AFP that\u2019s involved. She owns a home property with the former chair of the Washtenaw County Republican Party Mark Boonstra, a vacant lot next to Mr. Boonstra\u2019s Dexter home.\n\nDexter is a very small town outside of Ann Arbor.\n\nMr. Boonstra is no political novice. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science, a master\u2019s degree in applied economics and a law degree from the University of Michigan.\n\nAnd he\u2019s no non-partisan. Mr. Boonstra is a member of the self described conservative and libertarian Federalists Society. In 2012, Mr. Boonstra was appointed by Republican Governor Rick Synder to serve on the Michigan Court of Appeals. This makes sense, since Boonstra is from the Ann Arbor area, as is Rick Synder. Boonstra resides in Dexter, which is just outside of Ann Arbor, and is also the location of the property he shares with the \u201cObamacare victim\u201d.\n\nBoonstra was also the Washtenaw County GOP Chair.\n\nFrom his bio, \u201cBoonstra has served as senior principal for the Miller Canfield law firm, located on Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor, since 1985. He previously worked as a law clerk for Judge Ralph B. Guy Jr. of the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe law prohibits coordination between a political party or candidate\u2019s campaign and a PAC. This is exactly what got True the Vote in trouble, when the tea party group was ruled by a judge to have engaged in illegal activities by supporting Republicans in Texas. This same group then presented themselves as \u201cvictims\u201d of the IRS, and the media sold that to the people as proof of the IRS targeting conservatives. This lie has since been thoroughly debunked.\n\nMr. Boonstra\u2019s close association with the debunked \u2018Obamacare victim\u2019 in the ad brings up the question of whether or not the Republican Party is coordinating their ads with Americans for Prosperity. If they are, that\u2019s a violation of the law. And it also suggests that it\u2019s not that easy to find someone to star in their ads full of lies.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s tough not to feel for Julie Boonstra, who is already in a fight with cancer. To add insult to injury, she was then used in a commercial notorious for being deceptive. Most likely she had no idea of the facts, and is just another misled victim of the corporate campaign to steal healthcare from the people. The people who used her thusly owe her a public apology. She got it wrong, but she was scared. People who knew better exploited her.\n\nThe attention should be on Boonstra\u2019s association with the GOP party chair, and whether or not he coordinated with Julie Boonstra or AFP or the Koch Brothers or their associates in any way in order to create this ad.\n\n\n\nNote: EclectaBlog has a screengrab of the property records in which they redacted personal info, which I verified directly.
