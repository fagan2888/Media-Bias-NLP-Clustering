CINCINNATI -- The Cincinnati native who was the lead plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that declared same-sex marriage legal across the U.S. will attend President Barack Obama's final State of the Union address.

Jim Obergefell was invited as a guest of first lady Michelle Obama.

The Supreme Court ended up hearing the case and decided in Obergefellâ€™s favor last year, finding that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.

The White House said Sunday that Obergefell will be among about two dozen guests invited to sit near the first lady on Tuesday. The guests include several veterans and service members, including one of the three Americans who thwarted an attack aboard a Paris-bound train.

Those on the guest list will highlight issues that Obama has attempted to prioritize during his tenure, such as expanded health insurance coverage, and issues that he hopes to work on during his final year, such as criminal justice. The guest list includes a California man whose partner was killed in the San Bernardino attack and the first female Army Reserve officer to graduate from the Army's elite Ranger School. One seat will be empty, to represent the victims of gun violence.

Also invited were:

- Refaai Hamo, a Syrian scientist stricken with cancer who fled with a son and three daughters to Turkey from Syria after a missile attack killed his wife and one other daughter.

- Sue Ellen Allen of Scottsdale Arizona, co-founder of a nonprofit that helps former prisoners re-enter society.

- Jennifer Bragdon of Austin, Texas, a woman attending junior college in hopes of becoming a teacher.

- Edith Childs of Greenwood, South Carolina, a local councilwoman who during a 2007 campaign stop, led the chant "Fired Up." The crowd replied "Ready to go." The call and response became an unofficial slogan for Obama's two presidential campaigns.

- Mark Davis of Washington, District of Columbia, who started a small business that trains low-income people to install solar panels.

- Cary Dixon of Huntington, West Virginia, a mom who has called on family members to speak up about drug abuse as a sickness, which reinforces Obama's call to direct more resources into drug prevention programs.

Smith kept the patch for 40 years, from Vietnam to his pardon after serving three years in prison for a wrongful conviction. Smith gave Obama the patch when he met the then-senator during the 2008 presidential campaign. Obama carried it with him the rest of the campaign.

- Staff Sgt. Spencer Stone of Sacramento, California, who, along with Anthony Sadler and U.S. Army Specialist Alex Skarlatos, stopped a man from opening fire
