Instead, requests for more documentation to verify identities are evidence of a necessarily rigorous process, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe system is operating exactly as it was built to,\u201d Cohen said, by trying to ascertain \u201cthat you are who you say you are when you\u2019re applying.\u201d\n\nBut those caught in this snag \u2014 about 10 percent of people who attempted to log into the health insurance site \u2014 find it maddening.\n\n\u201cIt makes you go crazy. This has been very tough,\u201d said Lesley Hausmann of Lexington, who had to mail in a copy of her husband\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating,\u201d said Richard Pask of North Truro, who mailed copies of his and his wife\u2019s passports last week and is still waiting to hear back. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Kafka novel.\u201d\n\nDespite a smattering of such complaints, Cohen said the Connector had kept its promise to provide a well-performing website to Massachusetts residents who do not get health insurance from an employer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Connector website\u2019s first seven days, 51,967 signed on and learned what kind of health coverage they are eligible for \u2014 the key function that software was unable to perform last year, after it was retooled to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act. That number represents roughly a quarter of the 175,000 to 225,000 people expected to use the Connector during the three-month open enrollment period.\n\n\u201cTo reach that milestone in seven days gives us really good hope,\u201d Cohen said. He said the website continues to operate without lags; the average wait time at the call centers during the first seven days was just over four minutes.\n\nOf those who determined their eligibility, 23,792 qualified for Medicaid and were immediately enrolled. The rest were found eligible for private insurance, and half of those people selected a plan. A total of 753 have already paid their first month\u2019s premium, which is due Dec. 23.\n\nWhile thousands made it through the process, 4,998 people came to a dead stop when they could not verify their identities online. Connector officials said this rate of roughly 10 percent is similar to that of the federal marketplace. Spokeswomen for the health insurance exchanges in Connecticut and Rhode Island, both among the nation\u2019s best-functioning, reported similar estimates for identity-verification problems: 10 percent in Connecticut, 10 to 15 percent in Rhode Island.\n\nTo continue with their application, people need to provide backup documentation, such as copies of a driver\u2019s license or passport, by mail or fax. As of Monday morning, 899 people had sent in documents and 739 accounts had been unlocked, according to Connector spokesman Jason Lefferts.\n\nThe Connector is using Experian, a credit-rating service, to check identities against information the service has in its database. Young people and new immigrants who do not have long credit histories, people who have been victims of identity theft or have had their credit history frozen, and those who have recently moved can run into this problem. But any number of quirks can cause it.\n\nHausmann, a 47-year-old self-employed management consultant, has no idea why the system could not verify her husband\u2019s identity. They bought health insurance on the Connector last year.\n\nHausmann called it \u201creally aggravating\u201d to read news stories about the website\u2019s success. \u201cIt\u2019s not going great for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that the technology is running better, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have everything running well.\u201d\n\nPask, 62, who is retired, feels the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s like pouring salt in the wound when you read the paper or turn on the television and they tell you how swell everything is going,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, Pask spent months trying to get coverage. He was hoping for a better experience this year, but it is not going well. He said he waited 40 minutes for service at the call center early last week. He got a mysterious error message that he believes may have been related to his abbreviating \u201cN. Truro\u201d instead of spelling out \u201cNorth.\u201d Then he hit the identity snag. He said he mailed out copies of his and his wife\u2019s passports Wednesday and still hasn\u2019t heard back.\n\nConnector officials point to Paul Munafo\u2019s experience as more typical.\n\nMunafo, a 62-year-old carpenter and builder who had a liver transplant last August, is not yet able to return to work, and relies on the income of his wife, MJ Bruder Munafo, the artistic director of a theater on the Vineyard. Last year, they were never able to apply for a subsidy because of the website\u2019s failure, and ended up buying insurance for $1,250 a month for the pair.\n\nThis year, the Munafos went to Vineyard Health Care Access, an advocacy group, where a \u201cnavigator,\u201d trained to help people enroll, entered the couple\u2019s information and showed them their options. In a little over an hour, they had selected a plan that, because of a $500 subsidy, cost $780 a month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a godsend,\u201d Paul Munafo said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201d\n\nEric Linzer, spokesman for the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said health insurers are starting to receive enrollment files from the Connector. It is too soon to tell, he said, whether the next crucial steps \u2014 getting people enrolled so they can get their insurance cards \u2014 will go smoothly.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.467616913", "eomportal-id": 514425, "description": "About 5,000 people applying for health insurance have been temporarily locked out of the Massachusetts Health Connector because of difficulties proving their identities online -- an issue that Connector officials call inevitable and similar to experiences in other states.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "About 5,000 people applying for health insurance have been temporarily locked out of the Massachusetts Health Connector because of difficulties proving their identities online -- an issue that Connector officials call inevitable and similar to experiences in other states.", "title": "Massachusetts Health Connector site served 52,000 people last week - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/11/24/massachusetts-health-connector-site-served-people-last-week/18JT7r0atLaM0KUpk6PivM/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Health insurance,Massachusetts Health Connector,health care reform,Experian Group Ltd", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 19:47:59 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Health insurance,Massachusetts Health Connector,health care reform,Experian Group Ltd", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "aa07ec36-7412-11e4-b8d1-be58117b3d54"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201dEric Linzer, spokesman for the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said health insurers are starting to receive enrollment files from the Connector.\nInstead, requests for more documentation to verify identities are evidence of a necessarily rigorous process, he said.\nThey bought health insurance on the Connector last year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Kafka novel.\u201dDespite a smattering of such complaints, Cohen said the Connector had kept its promise to provide a well-performing website to Massachusetts residents who do not get health insurance from an employer.\nAbout 5,000 people applying for health insurance have been temporarily locked out of the Massachusetts Health Connector\u2019s website because of difficulties proving their identities online \u2014 an issue that Connector officials call inevitable and similar to experiences in other states."}
