John Kasich is visiting New Hampshire to promote an \u201cOhio Story\u201d of hope, economic growth and fiscal responsibility.\n\nIs his tale true?\n\nTo hear Kasich and the Ohio Republican Party tell it, Kasich would make a great presidential candidate because his fiscal restraint has jump-started Ohio\u2019s job creation and allowed the state to care for drug addicts and the mentally ill.\n\nJob growth and spending data show parts of Kasich\u2019s narrative are somewhat true, while others are false.\n\nAlthough Kasich is prodding fellow governors to follow his lead, Ohio\u2019s job growth during Kasich\u2019s first term didn\u2019t rank in the top five, the top 10 or even the top 20. From January 2011 through January 2015, Ohio\u2019s job creation rate ranked 21st of the 50 states.\n\nOhio\u2019s unemployment rate has improved under Kasich in large part because the state\u2019s labor force shrank by 34,910 during Kasich\u2019s first term, based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nThe state\u2019s economy has been rebounding slowly since 2010, but Kasich has dramatically expanded government since taking office in 2011. Ohio General Revenue Fund spending for the 2015 fiscal year ending June 30 is expected to be $5 billion higher than it was just four years earlier.\n\nWhat about the Ohioans getting medical care thanks to Kasich\u2019s stewardship of state funds? Kasich has taken more than $2.7 billion in federal money to put 510,000 working-age, able-bodied Ohioans on Medicaid.\n\nKasich\u2019s insistence the Obamacare Medicaid expansion is paid for with state money has been debunked by the Congressional Research Service, but his administration has not replied to multiple Ohio Watchdog requests for comment.\n\nThe governor\u2019s spokesmen tout his landslide reelection win \u2014 against a wreck of a Democrat candidate \u2014 as proof Kasich\u2019s \u201cOhio Story\u201d resonates throughout the state. However, Kasich\u2019s policies and temperament have turned many former supporters against him.\n\n\u201cSadly, Governor Kasich\u2019s \u2018Ohio Story\u2019 looks very similar to President Obama\u2019s \u2018Federal Story,'\u201d Toledo Tea Party president John McAvoy said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cGov. Kasich introduced the Ohio version of \u2018Redistribution of Wealth\u2019 with his proposed taxes cuts to one group and tax increases to another with the end result an increase in Ohio\u2019s budget,\u201d McAvoy said.\n\n\u201cKasich used his pen to bypass the state legislature when he implemented Obamacare Medicaid Expansion,\u201d McAvoy said. \u201cThis move garnered the praise of President Obama.\u201d\n\nWesterville TEA Party director Jim Burgess suggested New Hampshire Republicans should be wary of Kasich\u2019s approach to his policy priorities.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to John Kasich, just think \u2018Big Government,\u2019 Obama, and televangelist,\u201d Burgess told Ohio Watchdog via email. \u201cHe bypassed the legislature, just like Obama, when he implemented Obamacare in Ohio.\u201d\n\n\u201cKasich supports Common Core while berating parents who are against it,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cHe picks winners in business. He has done all of this while charismatically misusing scripture to support his actions. Restoring hope should mean government assistance drops, not increases at out-of-control rates.\u201d\n\nTom Zawistowski, executive director of the Portage County TEA Party and president of We the People Convention, expressed similar concerns in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cKasich supports Common Core against the wishes of parents and members of his own party and he went to court to impose an irresponsible Medicaid Expansion, against the wishes of both the Republican House and Senate, after personally signing the Ohio Health Care Freedom Amendment that was intended to stop Obamacare in Ohio,\u201d Zawistowski said.\n\n\u201cThe real Ohio Story is that John Kasich is a big government liberal who could not win Ohio if he ran for president, let alone win nationally.\u201d\n\nUnlike Ohio\u2019s conservative grassroots, most political observers outside Ohio still rely on the Ohio Republican Party and Kasich staffers for perspective on Kasich.\n\nIn a Thursday piece, The New York Times added to national buzz about how Kasich\u2019s \u201cOhio Story\u201d could help if he runs for president in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s proven the Republican philosophy that lower taxes and reduction in spending levels lead to private sector job creation,\u201d David Avella, chairman of Virginia-based Republican training organization GOPAC, told Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg.\n\nAvella also repeated the assertion Kasich\u2019s fiscal responsibility \u201cputs more money in the state bank account, which allows you to do more for the poor and the less fortunate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
