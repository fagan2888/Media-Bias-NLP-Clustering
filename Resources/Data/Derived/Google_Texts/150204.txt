A woman has died following a crash Saturday afternoon in Ellsworth County.

It happened just before 4 p.m. on K-156 at 6th Road, northeast of Holyrood. The Kansas Highway Patrol reports a vehicle was heading northeast and pulled to the shoulder to allow another car to pass.

The driver, identified as Fern Zajic, 89, of Holyrood, then tried to make a left turn onto 6th Road and was hit by a northeast-bound semi.

Zajic was pronounced dead at the scene.

Troopers say the 26-year-old driver of the semi was not hurt.
