More than 70 percent of the information in your medical record comes from laboratory testing. Yet chances are you\u2019ve never been inside the lab that so influences your health care.\n\nSo I\u2019d like to offer you a little behind-the-scenes tour of some of the sights and sounds of the top health issues facing the United States. They\u2019re fascinating in and of themselves, but they also may give you added incentive to do what it takes for your own health.\n\n\ufffc\n\nHeart Disease\n\nHeart disease kills more Americans than anything else, accounting for 1 in 4 deaths. Heart disease alone costs the U.S. $108.9 billion each year. Prevention is our best defense (hence the recent fuss over new statin recommendations). This begins with knowing your lipids. Seen and heard here are the sounds of automated instruments analyzing specimens to report a lipid panel.\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\n\nWhat is a lipid panel? It includes cholesterol, LDL (low density lipoprotein, \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d), HDL (high density lipoprotein, \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d) and triglycerides.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, many health insurance plans cover preventive care services, including lipid screening, at no cost to you.\n\nCancer\n\nRanking number two in leading causes of death is cancer. Screening exams such as pap smears, colonoscopies and mammograms are vital to early detection and prevention. Once again, the pathology lab plays an integral role. Below, hear and see how tissue slides are produced and evaluated by pathologists. All care begins with a diagnosis. See your physician for what screening tests are recommended for you.\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\n\nTime is everything when dealing with stroke, the third-ranking cause of death. Seconds can make the difference between life and death. As the clock ticks away, the likelihood mounts of irreversible neurologic consequences. The lab is just one of the many critical members in the care team when treating stroke patients. The speed with which specimens are received, processed and resulted is extremely important. The arrival of a stroke patient in the Emergency Department sets off a rapid, carefully choreographed, series of events.\n\nSeen and heard here are STAT specimens arriving through the pneumatic tube system for immediate workup.\n\n\ufffc\ufffcDiabetes\n\nThe American Diabetes Association estimates 25.8 million children and adults in the United States \u2014 8.3 percent of the population \u2014 have diabetes. Of those, 7 million are undiagnosed and an additional 79 million have pre-diabetes.\n\nWhat can you do? It\u2019s simple. Know your fasting blood sugar and if you have diabetes, the hemoglobin A1c is extremely important to monitor. Your physician will typically order these tests as part of a routine checkup. When that sample is received in the lab, it is first centrifuged before being analyzed on automated instruments.\n\nThis illustrates how the lab plays an important role not only in your care, but in the care of whole populations. By monitoring the care of entire communities, your health care team can detect problems before they become problems. This keeps patients out of the hospital and saves the system money. Pre-diabetes is a perfect example. Ask your doctor to be tested if you have risk factors for diabetes .\n\nInfectious Disease\n\nPrior to the discovery of penicillin in 1928, bacterial infections were by far the number one cause of death. Infections still remain a major danger. Whether it be hospital acquired infections (pneumonia, C. diff.), the rise of antibiotic resistant bugs (MRSA) or influenza, the microbiology lab is important in identifying these important pathogens.\n\nListen and see how culture plates are scanned and evaluated for germs. Flu remains a killer. What can you do? Get immunized.\n\nIn Defense Of Pathology\n\n\ufffc\ufffc\n\nAs you can see, the pathology lab plays a critical role in your health, and it offers insights into very real perils. Following these simple steps can help keep you healthy and out of the hospital.\n\nNow, a brief message in defense of pathology: Federal health financing authorities have proposed devastating cuts to pathology, with up to 80 percent cutbacks in some services. These would threaten the very existence of many labs and most certainly impact the quality of care you receive.\n\nMassachusetts U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy was one of the first to sign on to a bipartisan letter in the House opposing these cuts. Sens. Warren and Markey have joined in a similar Senate letter.\n\nIn order for health care reform to succeed we need to ensure that we have the resources to continue to deliver high quality care.\n\nDr. Michael Misialek is Associate Chair of Pathology at Newton-Wellesley Hospital and Assistant Clinical Professor of Pathology at Tufts University School of Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A pathologist shares behind-the-scenes laboratory sights and sounds of diagnosing the most common health problems.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A pathologist shares behind-the-scenes laboratory sights and sounds of diagnosing the most common health problems.", "title": "Inside The Lab: Sights And Sounds Of Your Health Issues", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/11/pathology-lab-sights-sounds", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/11/roche-620x463.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/11/pathology-lab-sights-sounds", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/11/roche-620x463.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Inside The Lab: Sights And Sounds Of Your Health Issues"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-18", "date": "Mon, 18 Nov 2013 10:49:01 -0500", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5a1\"", "article_summary": "Inside The Lab: Sights And Sounds Of Your Health IssuesBy Dr. Michael MisialekGuest contributorMine is a world very few see: pathology and laboratory medicine.\nYet chances are you\u2019ve never been inside the lab that so influences your health care.\nBy monitoring the care of entire communities, your health care team can detect problems before they become problems.\nIn order for health care reform to succeed we need to ensure that we have the resources to continue to deliver high quality care.\nSo I\u2019d like to offer you a little behind-the-scenes tour of some of the sights and sounds of the top health issues facing the United States."}
