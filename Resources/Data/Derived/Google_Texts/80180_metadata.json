To be accepted in certain social strata, you need to look like you belong there\u2014or so the thinking goes.\n\nIn fact, dressing in a non-conformist manner can actually make you come across as more powerful and accomplished.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of a Harvard Business School research team. In the Journal of Consumer Research, Silvia Bellezza, Francesca Gino, and Anat Keinan write that deviating from the norm when it comes to self-presentation \u201ccan act as a particular form of conspicuous consumption, and lead to positive inferences of status and competence in the eyes of others.\u201d\n\nThey argue that dressing in an unconventional way \u201csignals that one has the autonomy needed to act according to one\u2019s own inclinations.\u201d The fact you can get away with ignoring the unwritten rules (like Dr. House refusing to wear a lab coat) implies you have a high level of power and/or ability.\n\nThe researchers demonstrate this dynamic, which they call \u201cThe Red Sneakers Effect,\u201d in a series of experiments.\n\nThe first featured 52 shop assistants in Milan, Italy, who worked in luxury-brand boutiques such as Armani, Burberry, and Christian Dior. They read one of two versions of a vignette about a 35-year-old woman who entered such a store.\n\nSome were informed she wore a dress and fur coat; others were told she was in gym clothes. Another group learned she was wearing heeled sandals and an expensive watch; still others were told she was in flip-flops and wore a cheap watch.\n\nAll were then asked a series of questions about the customer and her likely purchasing behavior. They reported she was \u201cmore likely to make a purchase, and to be a celebrity, when she was wearing gym clothes or a Swatch than when she was wearing an elegant dress or a Rolex.\u201d\n\nA second experiment was conducted in the very different environment of Harvard University. The 159 participants (mostly students) read a vignette about a professor, after which they were asked how good he was at his job, and how respected he was by his students.\n\nThe academic was described as 45 years old. Half the participants were told he was clean shaven and wore a tie to work; the others received the information that he had a beard and typically lectured in a T-shirt. In addition, they were randomly informed that he was either at a generic university or a \u201ctop-tier\u201d school.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests non-traditional sartorial choices can signal autonomy and a high level of status", "author": "Tom Jacobs", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research suggests non-traditional sartorial choices can signal autonomy and a high level of status", "title": "Pharrell is onto something: Dressing for success means deviating from the norm", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/17/red_socks_may_be_a_key_to_success_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/AP560370184446-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests non-traditional sartorial choices can signal autonomy and a high level of status", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/AP560370184446-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Pharrell is onto something: Dressing for success means deviating from the norm", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Pharrell is onto something: Dressing for success means deviating from the norm", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, dressing, Pacific Standard, Psychology, study, Success", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5c6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: dressing, Pacific Standard, Psychology, study, Success, Business News, Life NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of a Harvard Business School research team.\n\u201cDress for success\u201d is a familiar mantra of self-help books, particularly those focused on helping one succeed in the business world.\nIn fact, dressing in a non-conformist manner can actually make you come across as more powerful and accomplished.\nIn addition, they were randomly informed that he was either at a generic university or a \u201ctop-tier\u201d school."}
