Paul Ryan, R-Wis., takes reporters' questions, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2013, as House Republicans signaled support for a budget deal worked out yesterday between Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. The budget deal was one of a few major measures left on Congress' to-do list near the end of a bruising year that has produced a partial government shutdown, a flirtation with a first-ever federal default and gridlock on President Obama's agenda.

Scott Applewhite)\n\n4079377\n\nWhat did House Speaker John Boehner really mean on Thursday when he announced that the GOP will back conditional legalization for 12 million illegals, and increase the flow of foreign workers into the country?\n\nThe various GOP legislators and advocates can\u2019t tell if Boehner is faking solidarity with the GOP\u2019s immigration-boosting business donors, or is moving slowly to muffle voters\u2019 worries about competition for jobs and wages.\n\nSo they\u2019re looking for clues to what Boehner will do next. They\u2019re checking his statements and demeanor, his quips, claps and shrugs, to find out if he really want to push the unpopular bill though the House.\n\nThey\u2019re also trying to gauge the willingness of GOP legislators to go through a painful process that would split the GOP base before November, distract the media and voters from Obamacare, and perhaps leave the Democrats in control of the Senate after the November election.\n\nThey\u2019re also working to cajole, pressure, spin and lobby to drag Boehner over to their side.\n\nAdvocates of greater immigration and citizenship for illegals cheered Boehner\u2019s immigration-boosting document, which was released at the GOP\u2019s closed-door retreat in Cambridge, Md. President Barack Obama complimented him.\n\nBut the reformers who favor lower levels of immigration said the meeting showed that most GOP legislators oppose the immigration amnesty and increase.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the GOP legislators who spoke in the closed-door meeting opposed the proposed amnesty, or else urged that action be postponed into 2015, Rep. John Fleming told The Daily Caller.\n\nWhen Boehner \u201cgot up and presented the points, didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with it; he was really tentative in his support,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anybody say we need to be committed to getting this done now, that we can\u2019t wait, not even [Rep. Jeff] Denham.\u201d\n\nDenham\u2019s district voted for Obama in 2012, and he\u2019s backing the Senate\u2019s amnesty bill.\n\nWisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan was also tepid, said Fleming. Ryan said \u201che likes this draft and he made the comment that \u2018You know, there\u2019s never a good time or best time to move forward with legalization,'\u201d Fleming added.\n\nThe document \u2014 and the leaders \u2014 downplayed most dramatic features of the document, which offers an indirect path to citizenship for the 12 million Democratic-leaning illegals, and many new low-wage guest-workers to employers. For example, a House bill allowing 500,000 more guest-workers per year was approved last year by Rep. Bob Goodlatte\u2019s Judiciary Committee.\n\nEach year, four million Americans turn 18.\n\nRyan admitted the plan includes an indirect route to citizenship to the Wall Street Journal. Illegals could get citizenship via current legal procedures, after they first find jobs during a provisional period before they get a traditional work permit and then a green card.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of process we envision. \u2026 [It] is not a special pathway to citizenship and it\u2019s not going to automatically in any way give an undocumented immigrant citizenship,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nAlso, a top GOP leader said they could try to pass the amnesty and guest-worker legislation in June, after legislators win their primaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably months out, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Boehner ally, Oregon Rep. Greg Walden. He\u2019s the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is responsible for helping GOP candidates win their elections.\n\nBut other critical GOP leaders, including Goodlatte, avoided the media and hid from voters and tea party protests. Any amnesty bill would have to get his support before it could get through his judiciary committee.\n\nThe vocal opposition from legislators, and the leaders\u2019 cautious statements, means that \u201cAmericans dodged a bullet,\u201d said Roy Beck, director of NumbersUSA, a immigration reform group.\n\n\u201cAmericans should be thankful to the majority of Republican [legislators] who stood up at the retreat\u201d against Boehner\u2019s plan, he added. \u201cThousands and thousands of phone call went into Republicans\u2019 [offices] before they went into their retreat.\u201d\n\nBut business lobbies, Democrats and some GOP legislators will continue to push for the amnesty, and will pressure uncommitted GOP legislators to bend in their direction, he said.\n\nHis members will pressure those legislators to oppose the immigration increase because \u201ca lot of these [uncommitted] Republicans would like to get it off the table \u2026 and move on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not letting up at all,\u201d he said.\n\nContinued pressure is needed because Boehner \u201cis dead set on making this happen,\u201d said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken the [political] risk to release these plans when most conservative thought leaders oppose them, and when he was being shown in a silly hat on Drudge,\u201d and when the GOP base is loudly objecting, Dane said.\n\nFAIR\u2019s supporters are melting down the phone lines to Congress, Dane added.\n\nMark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said Boehner could push the amnesty, or walk away, depending on the political costs and benefits.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that he\u2019s zig-zagging to keep everybody happy,\u201d Krikorian said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s OK with this thing passing, and he\u2019s also OK with there being a lot of [voter] push-back so he can tell the donors had can\u2019t do it,\u201d Krikorian said.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m whistling past the graveyard, [but] I don\u2019t sense the real enthusiasm from him on this. \u2026 he wants it to go away, one way or the other,\u201d Krikorian said.\n\nThere\u2019s little or no support for the bill outside the business-funded establishment wing of the GOP.\n\n\u201cWe see a failure of leadership in Congress,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots group, which claims 3,400 chapters and 15 million members. \u201cThe American people made their terms clear months ago\u2014we don\u2019t want amnesty.\u201d\n\nThe editors of National Review, the established conservative outlet slammed Boehner\u2019s plan, saying it \u201ccould be the opening foray in one of the most mystifyingly stupid misadventures in recent congressional history \u2026 [and also] vague, sophomoric, and poorly written.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to be stunned that House Republicans would even consider anything like this \u2026 is inviting a poisonous intramural political brawl, and the base of the party will \u2014 justifiably \u2014 feel betrayed if an amnesty actually passes,\u201d said National Review.\n\nGOP senators also pressured the House leadership to walk away.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, whose polls cratered after he joined with Democrats to pass an immigration bill out of the Senate in June, has suggested the GOP back away from a rewrite. \u201cYou can write whatever you want in that bill, but the federal government will not enforce the law,\u201d he said recently.\n\nSens. Jeff Sessions and Ted Cruz slammed the GOP leadership, and urged Republicans to make sure immigration rules help Americans wager-earners, not employers. \u201cRather than responding to the big-money lobbying on K Street, we need to make sure working-class Americans show up by the millions [at the ballot box in November] to reject Obamacare and vote out the Democrats,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cAmnesty will ensure the [GOP-leaning] voters stay home [in November]. \u2026 Anyone pushing an amnesty bill right now should go ahead and put a \u2018Harry Reid for Majority Leader\u2019 bumper sticker on their car,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz\u2019s criticism of Boehner\u2019s plan was matched by praise from Obama.\n\n\u201cIf the speaker proposes something that says right away: Folks aren\u2019t being deported, families aren\u2019t being separated, we\u2019re able to attract top young students to provide the skills or start businesses here and then there\u2019s a regular process of citizenship, I\u2019m not sure how wide the divide ends up being,\u201d Obama told CNN.\n\nBusiness groups also backed the plan. \u201cWe applaud House Republicans for their public commitment to immigration reform demonstrated by the release of their standards today,\u201d said Greg Brown, CEO of Motorola Solutions, Inc., who chairs an immigration group for the Business Roundtable.\n\n\u201cThis is a very encouraging sign that House lawmakers are serious about fixing our broken immigration system,\u201d said the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBut the public\u2019s opposition is blocking Obama\u2019s reach for millions of new immigrant voters, and Boehner\u2019s willingness to bring in millions of new workers. \u201cIt is the grassroots, the voters, who are keeping these Republicans somewhat in line,\u201d said Beck.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "What did House Speaker John Boehner really mean on Thursday when he announced that the GOP will back conditional legalization for 12 million illegals, and", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "What did House Speaker John Boehner really mean on Thursday when he announced that the GOP will back conditional legalization for 12 million illegals, and increase the flow of foreign workers into the", "title": "What is Boehner\u2019s secret immigration plan?", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/01/what-is-boehners-secret-immigration-plan/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2a8408cf05b041e3b52da664ff7ab233-e1386799423794.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What did House Speaker John Boehner really mean on Thursday when he announced that the GOP will back conditional legalization for 12 million illegals,...", "title": "What is Boehner\u2019s secret immigration plan?
