A New York City man is reportedly suing an Au Bon Pain, Carepoint Health, Hoboken University Medical Center, Kmart (Store 7749), the St. Luke’s Emergency Dept., New York City Transit Authority, the City of New York, NYC MTA, LaGuardia Airport Administration and a whole bunch of people for $2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. That’s $2 undecillion, or a two with 36 zeroes behind it, which is way more money than what the world can offer, and, as XCKD’s What If blog points out, pretty much anything anyone can imagine.

Sixty-two year old Anthony Purisima, who is representing himself, filed the 22-page complaint in Manhattan federal court reports the New York Post. The suit claims that the alleged violations, which include “Civil rights violations, personal injury, discrimination on national origin, retaliation, harassment, fraud, attempted murder, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy to defraud,” began when a ‘rabies-infected’ dog on an MTA bus bit and infected Purisima’s middle finger, and a ‘Chinese couple’ took photos of him against his permission at the hospital.
