In one passage, Romney recounts a conversation she and Mitt had with her doctor about the disease\u2019s toll on her body and their marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that people with MS, they are able to find other ways of expressing their intimacy that can be just as gratifying,\u201d the doctor told the Romneys.\n\nHe went on to share the story of one couple who created intimate moments by just hooking their pinkies.\n\n\u201cMitt looked at him as if he were crazy,\u201d Ann Romney writes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much since that moment, but we\u2019ve never forgotten it. In fact, since that day, sometimes when we\u2019re together in a stressful situation we\u2019ll grasp pinkies.\u201d\n\nLast October, I wrote about our former governor and first lady seeding a $50 million fund-raising effort for the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women\u2019s. Romney\u2019s proceeds from the book will go to the center, and she begins a book tour that comes to New England next week. More than 50 million people worldwide suffer from these brain-related illnesses, including Lou Gehrig\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe book provides a front-row seat to the powerful couple\u2019s most vulnerable moments, when the \u201cMitt Stabilizer,\u201d as Ann is known in the family, is afflicted by a mysterious condition that leaves her lethargic and barely able to walk. Mitt would later describe the day she was diagnosed \u2014 Oct. 25, 1998 \u2014 as the \u201cworst day of his life,\u201d with the couple breaking into tears in the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no cure for MS, a debilitating disease in which your own body attacks the protective sheath around your nerves.\n\n\u201cI imagined it like an army of Pac Men inside me, chewing away,\u201d Romney writes. \u201cFrom everything I could determine, the inevitable outcome would be me sitting in a wheelchair, incapacitated, dying young. My life as I knew it was over. There was nothing I could do to prevent it.\u201d\n\nAnn Romney would soon fall into a depression.\n\nI asked Romney, 66, why she is so candid and whether she felt at times she gave out too much information.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou know something? I am not afraid of anything anymore. Nothing intimidates me.\u201d\n\nShe explained that the book is not just for those suffering from MS, but for any others facing struggles.\n\n\u201cIf I can say I have been really low, maybe it\u2019s easier for them to have to go through something,\u201d she said. \u201cMy intent really was to be as honest as I could be.\u201d\n\nThis memoir confirms what we\u2019ve known for a long time: This stay-at-home mom of five boys is one of Mitt\u2019s most trusted advisers.\n\nShe writes that she was the one to persuade Mitt to leave his lucrative job as chief executive of Bain Capital to rescue the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They uprooted to Utah, where she discovered reflexology and horseback riding as alternative therapies for MS. Along with the help of steroid injections, her condition went into remission.\n\nWith the Games a success, the Massachusetts Republican Party wanted Mitt to run for governor. Ann was \u201cambivalent\u201d because she didn\u2019t want to leave the life they built out West. He would be a good governor, she felt, but it boiled down to this: Boston was where she became sick, Utah where she got well.\n\nShe sought advice from her Brigham neurologist, Howard Weiner, who did not think a political campaign would trigger a relapse. \u201cYou can handle it,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe one thing you have to be aware of is hitting the wall. If you get tired, you have to stop.\u201d\n\nThe Romney clan had one of their family meetings to decide if Mitt should run. Everyone else was for it. Then it was up to Ann. Her opinion, she knew, mattered the most to Mitt.\n\n\u201c \u2018Let\u2019s do it,\u2019 I said \u2014 or something like that which conveyed a lot more confidence than I felt,\u201d she writes.\n\nThe biggest legacy Mitt left as governor was making Massachusetts the first state to mandate health insurance \u2014 Romneycare before there was Obamacare. She believes her struggle with MS helped Mitt understand the importance of health care for all.\n\n\u201cI take no credit for Romneycare, but I\u2019m glad that I was part of Mitt\u2019s motivation and determination to create and implement it,\u201d she writes. \u201cPerhaps my MS had a small but real influence.\u201d\n\nShe kept a low profile during her husband\u2019s gubernatorial race and his first presidential run in 2008. She didn\u2019t want to risk a relapse.\n\nWhen the extended family met to decide whether Mitt should enter the 2012 White House race, the vote was 10 to 2 against \u2014 only Ann and their oldest son, Tagg, were in favor. But weeks later, Mitt, she writes, \u201ccame around to my way of thinking.\u201d\n\nAnn Romney agreed to campaign several days a week and to do interviews. Her role: to humanize Mitt. But when Super Tuesday rolled around, she overdid it. She began losing her speech and her balance.\n\nAfter introducing Mitt at an event in Florida, she sat down backstage and declared, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nShe returned a few days later, but in the end Mitt would lose again.\n\nThe Romneys contemplated running in 2016 but decided against it in January. Any misgivings now that Donald Trump, of all people, is leading the Republican pack?\n\n\u201cWe have no regrets,\u201d she told me. \u201cEvery day we look at each other and go high five; \u2018Aren\u2019t we having a great life?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnn Romney, the MS patient, has come to appreciate that.\n\n\u201cI am well and I am strong, but I am also vulnerable,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I am on a tight wire, and I can fall off at any moment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.520906596", "eomportal-id": 473603, "description": "By the end of the first chapter of Ann Romney\u2019s new book, you learn that she has had a miscarriage, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and that husband Mitt worried about intimacy issues with his wife.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Belmont", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "By the end of the first chapter of Ann Romney\u2019s new book, you learn that she has had a miscarriage, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and that husband Mitt worried about intimacy issues with his wife.", "title": "Ann Romney reflects on illness, life on campaign - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/29/ann-romney-reflects-illness-life-campaign/dnflZDhQ1gi4y5Hmb2NwmK/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/09/29/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/AP431123831197.jpg", "longitude": "-71.17761139999999", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3956405", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Mitt,Salt Lake City Olympics,governor,presidential campaign,GOP,shirley leung,Ann Romney", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 19:08:03 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Mitt,Salt Lake City Olympics,governor,presidential campaign,GOP,shirley leung,Ann Romney", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "24ec5e5e-66d5-11e5-9ef6-0847c90acf95"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMitt looked at him as if he were crazy,\u201d Ann Romney writes.\n\u201cEvery day we look at each other and go high five; \u2018Aren\u2019t we having a great life?\u2019 \u201dAnn Romney, the MS patient, has come to appreciate that.\n\u201cI imagined it like an army of Pac Men inside me, chewing away,\u201d Romney writes.\nBut weeks later, Mitt, she writes, \u201ccame around to my way of thinking.\u201dAnn Romney agreed to campaign several days a week and to do interviews.\nAnn was \u201cambivalent\u201d because she didn\u2019t want to leave the life they built out West."}
