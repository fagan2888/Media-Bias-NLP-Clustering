At least rust has principles.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOf course, nothing inspires shameless partisan ambition in politicians like an awful human tragedy. So, in a spasm of deceitful grandstanding, President Obama immediately sprang into the spotlight of last week\u2019s terrible shooting in Oregon to peddle some of the worn, broken and rejected political wares he\u2019s never been able to offload on anyone before.\n\nAs with every traveling snake oil salesman, Mr. Obama knows how to take advantage of a crowd \u2014 even if they are gathered in mourning over the wretched murder of 9 heroic Americans who died \u2014 with a gun pointed at their heads \u2014 bravely testifying that, indeed, they are Christian and will die Christian.\n\nLike Mr. Obama told us, \u201cbitter\u201d Americans cling to their guns and their religion.\n\nIt really is a mystery why so many people have such deep doubts about whether the guy was even born in America. And how could anyone doubt his Christian faith?\n\n\u201cThis is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,\u201d Mr. Obama scolded.\n\nBy \u201cwe,\u201d he meant all of us Americans who cherish our Second Amendment rights and don\u2019t reflexively believe the federal government is the answer to every problem or bad event.\n\n\u201cWe collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loves ones because of our inaction,\u201d he said.\n\nAgain, misuse of the word \u201cwe.\u201d He is not talking about himself here. He is talking about you and me. He is saying you and I do not care about people who are killed.\n\nThis, from a guy who learns of 9 people murdered for their Christian faith and immediately thinks of how to use the tragedy for his own personal political advantage. This, from a guy who would rather stick people with meaningless, ineffective proposals that will do nothing to stop such carnage than actually take the situation seriously.\n\nAnd what new federal gun laws, exactly, does Mr. Obama propose? What new rules would he employ to stop such horrible atrocities from happening in this sordid world of delusion, self-absorption and media-manic isolation?\n\nOne thing is true about the perpetrators of all of these shootings. Every one of them is crazy and that is where Mr. Obama wants to start, if he were being honest with us.\n\nHe wants to generate a government list of crazies. Like the no-fly list. Or the federal database of felons now used to prevent guns from lawfully being sold to felons.\n\nLawfully buying a gun would just take a smidge longer to do the paperwork. The one call already made to ATF and then a second call to HHS to check your Obamacare records.\n\nAnd what, exactly, is crazy? You take anxiety meds? Sleeping pills? Been to a therapist? Or, perhaps, you go to church five nights a week? Or, did you serve in a combat zone of a foreign war?\n\nMr. Obama will never be able to adequately answer any of these thorny questions about his crazy list that will cause even the zaniest of left-wingers to cringe.\n\nThat is because his real goal is confiscation and outlawing of virtually all guns that Americans use everyday for self-defense, sport shooting, hunting and just to prove we love freedom. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask him.\n\n\u201cWe know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours \u2014 Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.\u201d\n\nNo, Mr. President, they most certainly are not like us at all. But you wouldn\u2019t understand that.\n\nCharles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com and on Twitter via @charleshurt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "[*BN*]The Nuclear Option[*]: Obama Suggests Gun Owners Don't Care About People Who Are Killed", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "[*BN*]The Nuclear Option[*]: Obama Suggests Gun Owners Don't Care About People Who Are Killed", "title": "[*BN*]The Nuclear Option[*]: Obama Suggests Gun Owners Don't Care About People Who Are Killed - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/nuclear-option.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/14/bnthe-nuclear-option-obama-suggests-gun-owners-dont-care-about-people-who-are-killed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "[*BN*]The Nuclear Option[*]: Obama Suggests Gun Owners Don't Care About People Who Are Killed", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/nuclear-option.jpg", "title": "[*BN*]The Nuclear Option[*]: Obama Suggests Gun Owners Don't Care About People Who Are Killed - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "ATF, Christianity, Guns, Obama, Oregon,2nd Amendment, Big Government, Faith,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2nd Amendment", "tag": "Oregon", "published_time": "2015-10-14T07:27:06-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Faith,2nd Amendment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Every one of them is crazy and that is where Mr. Obama wants to start, if he were being honest with us.\nAnd what new federal gun laws, exactly, does Mr. Obama propose?\n\u201cThis is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,\u201d Mr. Obama scolded.\nLike Mr. Obama told us, \u201cbitter\u201d Americans cling to their guns and their religion.\nMr. Obama will never be able to adequately answer any of these thorny questions about his crazy list that will cause even the zaniest of left-wingers to cringe."}
