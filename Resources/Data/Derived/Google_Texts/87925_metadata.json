An admitted 2Pac fan, I would put money on Rubio reflecting on his career with a loop of \u201cSo Many Tears.\u201d While some claimed to be moved by his \u201cheartfelt\u201d remarks about the brutishness of Donald Trump and his campaign, offered days prior to Rubio\u2019s exit, I felt nothing.\n\nRubio deserved to lose because he was an abysmal candidate. You may hate me, but it ain't no lie (baby, bye bye bye).\n\nTrumps treats his political opponents the same way nemeses treat each other on any Real Housewives franchise.\n\nRubio, like Mitt Romney, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, and every other floundering Republican candidate during this election, condemns Trump with insults like \u201ccarnival barker,\u201d \u201cclown,\u201d \u201ccon man\u201d\u2014insults meant to convey that Trump is too much of a showman to be taken seriously. What these slights get right is that Trump campaigns like an entertainer. In fact, Donald Trump is basically running his campaign the same way one would orchestrate a reality show.\n\nTrumps treats his political opponents the same way nemeses treat each other on any Real Housewives franchise. There is a genius in how Trump can encapsulate a political adversary\u2019s greatest flaw in as few words as possible. Ask Jeb! Bush about his \u201clow energy.\u201d Trump referring to Ted Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d is akin to NeNe Leakes coining the name \u201cWig\u201d for Kim Zolciak on Real Housewives of Atlanta. Or how I have referred to Leakes in my writing and tweets as \u201cBaloo.\u201d These insults stick because Trump is able to disparage a foe in an entertaining way.\n\nAnd like any bitchy reality star (this applies to men and women alike, FYI), Trump loves a tit-for-tat, which is why every Republican debate has mirrored a reality show reunion. When he announced that he would not be attending the now-canceled debate Fox News scheduled for March 21, all I could think of was Draya Michele bowing out of the Basketball Wives reunions because she was tired of talking about the same bullshit. To wit, Trump tweeted: \u201cHow many times can the same people ask the same question?\u201d\n\nTrump is narcissistic, dramatic, and completely out of his depth in terms of actual policymaking. However, what Trump\u2019s critics continue to misunderstand is that that last issue doesn\u2019t matter\u2014his narcissism and intuitive understanding of drama make him great at campaigning. By centering on the theatrics of the campaign trail, he is presently winning winning winning.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics may cry that his approach prevents debates from digging into anything substantive, but is this a stance rooted in reality? Does anyone want (or recognize) substance? We live in a country where, as of September 2015, 43 percent of Republicans still believed that President Obama is Muslim. A 2012 study found that one in three Americans could not pass a naturalization civics test. And when it comes to the GOP candidates, a lot of them are just as empty on policy as Trump\u2014notably on domestic issues like health care (they want to repeal Obamacare but provide no clear alternative) and the economy (we don\u2019t want debt, but let\u2019s give rich people huge tax cuts).\n\nIn January, Robert Gates, the former Defense Secretary for President George W. Bush and President Obama, said of those candidates who had promised to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d ISIS: \u201cWell, they\u2014first of all, they don't know what they're talking about. Carpet bombing would be completely useless. It's totally contrary to the American way of war. Total disregard for civilians. So I mean, part of the concern that I have with the campaign, particularly when it comes to national security, is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the reality of the rest of the world, with the way the world really works.\n\nReading this, I immediately think of Phaedra Parks reading Kenya Moore:\n\nIt\u2019s a shame Gates didn\u2019t end his response with \u201cNow carpet bomb that.\u201d\n\nAs full of shit as Trump is, so is the rest of his competition. Moreover, critiques of Trump\u2019s lack of seriousness recall the same issue I have with outcry over his racism: Nearly everyone else is guilty of the same.\n\nAll of the cable networks are guilty of promoting both Republican and Democratic debates like they are Wrestlemania steel cage matches. The cable networks are guilty of crafting programming that focuses on two people of differing political views barking at each other. CNN created two incarnations of Crossfire, and really, what network has not had and continues to feature segments like that?\n\nReality shows are nothing more than people giving real reactions to carefully choreographed scenarios intended to produce conflict at maximum volume. If that scenario sounds familiar to you\u2014and you\u2019ve never binged Basketball Wives\u2014it\u2019s because you\u2019ve been paying attention to this election cycle.\n\nNow, I will concede that Trump has gone too far in how he purposely takes an already hostile environment and incites violence at his rallies. It\u2019s become like an episode of any Love & Hip-Hop franchise in that respect, and the potential for something fatal is too high of a risk for him to take. Even so, when Ted Cruz was asked about Trump\u2019s rallies on Meet the Press, Cruz called President Obama a demagogue and said that it\u2019s \u201cmoralizing from the president that makes people angry.\u201d When asked if it was worse, Cruz said, \u201cTo be honest, I think it\u2019s very much the same. They\u2019re both engaging in demagoguery.\u201d\n\nChuck Todd did not challenge him on this false equivalence. (To his credit, Todd did take Trump to task on inciting violence in a separate interview.) Instead, both host and guest got to stick to their respective scripts, making me question the usefulness of our news media if it isn\u2019t a space to challenge politicians in a meaningful way. Trump knows that this is empty spectacle and plays not only on the ignorance of angry and uninformed blocs of voters, but also an industry consumed by \u201cinfotainment.\u201d One is free to hate how Trump has managed to go from hosting The Apprentice to potentially becoming the next commander-in-chief with the same skill set, but your anger should not begin and end with Donald J. Trump.\n\nTrump is a symptom, not the disease.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_feed_thumb/trump-draya-michele-mash-up_tgen2o.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michael Arceneaux", "description": "Donald Trump and Draya Michele have a lot in common.", "og": {"site_name": "Complex", "description": "Donald Trump and Draya Michele have a lot in common.", "title": "Donald Trump Runs His Campaign Like a Reality Show", "url": "http://www.complex.com/life/2016/03/donald-trump-campaign-reality-show-draya-michele", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/trump-draya-michele-mash-up_tgen2o.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump and Draya Michele have a lot in common.", "title": "Donald Trump Runs His Campaign Like a Reality Show", "url": "http://www.complex.com/life/2016/03/donald-trump-campaign-reality-show-draya-michele", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/trump-draya-michele-mash-up_tgen2o.jpg", "site": {"id": 13049362}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-17T12:53:25-0400", "p": {"domain_verify": "51da1c238ae41f7163c35ac3e762917b"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685812641524750}, "sailthru.content.type": "News", "sailthru.tags": "Donald Trump, Features, Love And Hip Hop, Reality Tv, Essays, Other Source, Draya Michele, Complex, Life, complex", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Features, Love And Hip Hop, Reality Tv, Essays, Other Source, Draya Michele, Complex, Complex Magazine, Style Guide, Fashion News, Celebrity Profiles, Sneakers, Sneakers Guide, Sneakers Blog", "sailthru.channel": "Life", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/trump-draya-michele-mash-up_tgen2o.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In fact, Donald Trump is basically running his campaign the same way one would orchestrate a reality show.\nThere is a genius in how Trump can encapsulate a political adversary\u2019s greatest flaw in as few words as possible.\nAnd like any bitchy reality star (this applies to men and women alike, FYI), Trump loves a tit-for-tat, which is why every Republican debate has mirrored a reality show reunion.\nBush about his \u201clow energy.\u201d Trump referring to Ted Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d is akin to NeNe Leakes coining the name \u201cWig\u201d for Kim Zolciak on Real Housewives of Atlanta.\nReality shows are nothing more than people giving real reactions to carefully choreographed scenarios intended to produce conflict at maximum volume."}
