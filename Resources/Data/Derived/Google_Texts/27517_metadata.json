Different types of microbes that are found in the gut produce unique gases as a byproduct of their metabolism, they added.\n\n[STORY: Do matches actually burn off fart smells?]\n\nFor instance, sulfate-reducing bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide, which produces a pungent odor similar to the smell of rotten eggs, while methanogenic archaea produce odorless methane. Both of these gases have been linked to conditions such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nCollecting accurate measurements of these intestinal gases could help scientists gain essential new information about the potential role that some types of gut microbes play in a variety of different gastrointestinal health states. However, currently available methods (including breath analysis) are unreliable when it comes to determining the composition of those gases.\n\nGas-collecting methods\n\nThe authors of the study claim that in vitro fermentation systems and consumable gas capsules such as the ones they have developed could be promising alternatives to existing techniques. By using fermentation methods such as culturing human fecal samples in a humid, oxygen-free lab environment similar to the gastrointestinal tract, they were able to collect gas samples and then conduct an in-depth quantitative analysis to separate each of the individual gases.\n\nAlternatively, using encapsulated gas sensors that can be swallowed can provide a more direct and even more accurate approach by sampling gases from inside the intestine, they added. These pill-type sensors are comprised of a protective outer shell, a gas-permeable membrane window, the sensor itself, a microprocessor, a wireless transmitter and a tiny battery.\n\n[STORY: Turbulent black hole gas prevents star formation]\n\nKalantar-zadeh explained that since both techniques \u201care noninvasive, they have the potential to significantly impact relevant medical industries and public health sectors, facilitating the formulation of point-of-care methodologies for diagnostics and potentially new diet- or drug-based therapies for gastrointestinal diseases.\u201d\n\nIn the study, he and his colleagues also detailed ways to overcome different obstacles which could prevent these devices from being used, and suggest that future research should evaluate their long-term potential.\n\n-----\n\nFollow redOrbit on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram and Pinterest .", "article_metadata": {"author": "redOrbit", "og": {"site_name": "Redorbit", "description": "Intestinal gas is awful, but getting it measured may be even worse.
