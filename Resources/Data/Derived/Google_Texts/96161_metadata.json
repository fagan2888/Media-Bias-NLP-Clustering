He further noted Obama signed the law less than four months before the White House released the first national HIV/AIDS strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also said there\u2019s no way I could have imagined a transition that didn\u2019t have bumps along the way,\u201d said Crowley, referring to glitches with the Affordable Care Act website and other enrollment-related concerns. \u201cOver time those things will work themselves out. The ACA really creates an opportunity for us to make a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nCrowley acknowledged undocumented immigrants are unable to apply for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. He also said those with HIV below the poverty level who live in states that did not expand Medicaid may not be able to afford coverage because they cannot access marketplace subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe have these ongoing challenges,\u201d Crowley told the Blade.\n\nThe Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Emergency Act remains available to assist uninsured people with HIV and those who are underinsured. The program can also supplement and help reduce drug costs for those living with the virus.\n\nThe AIDS Drug Assistance Program under the Affordable Care Act will also be able to cover drugs that Medicaid, Medicare or private insurance will not cover.\n\n\u201cThere are issues of the affordability because some of drugs may not be covered and then the co-payments might be too high,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of advocacy going on right now with some of the HIV advocates in some cases state-by-state with the local advocates to really educate these plans to improve their formulary policy so they don\u2019t put all the drugs in the highest level.\u201d\n\nCrowley, who is the program director of the National HIV/AIDS Initiative at Georgetown University\u2019s O\u2019Neill Institute, also applauded D.C.\u2019s response to the epidemic.\n\nHe specifically noted the \u201ctest to treat\u201d approach to combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the nation\u2019s capital and the D.C. Department of Health\u2019s HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Administration (HAHSTA)\u2019s work with local HIV/AIDS service organizations to use a surveillance model to reconnect people with the virus who have stopped treatment to care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually really, really proud of the District,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cIn the past they weren\u2019t necessarily the leader on a lot of fronts.\u201d\n\nCrowley, who is a Whitman-Walker client, taught high school science in Swaziland from 1988-1991 when he was a member of the U.S. Peace Corps. He also held various positions with the now defunct-National Association of People with AIDS from 1994 through 2000.\n\nCrowley described the organization\u2019s 2013 bankruptcy as \u201csad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important for people living with HIV to have a voice,\u201d Crowley told the Blade. \u201cThere\u2019s still a need to be a voice for people with HIV and we\u2019re going to have to look at different mechanisms.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whitman-Walker Health on April 17 will honor former White House AIDS czar Jeff Crowley at its spring benefit.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "Whitman-Walker Health on April 17 will honor former White House AIDS czar Jeff Crowley at its spring benefit.", "title": "Whitman-Walker to honor former White House AIDS czar", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 404, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/04/Jeffrey_Crowley_thumb_courtesy_Whitman-Walker_Health.jpg", "height": 404}, "updated_time": "2014-04-02T10:36:32-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/04/02/whitman-walker-honor-former-white-house-aids-czar/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Whitman-Walker Health on April 17 will honor former White House AIDS czar Jeff Crowley at its spring benefit.", "creator": "@mklavers81", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/04/Jeffrey_Crowley_thumb_courtesy_Whitman-Walker_Health.jpg", "title": "Whitman-Walker to honor former White House AIDS czar", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "Local", "tag": "Whitman-Walker Health", "published_time": "2014-04-02T10:36:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-02T10:36:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "HIV/AIDS, Homepage Headlines, Jeff Crowley, National Association for People With AIDS, Whitman-Walker Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfad9\"", "article_summary": "He further noted Obama signed the law less than four months before the White House released the first national HIV/AIDS strategy.\nThe AIDS Drug Assistance Program under the Affordable Care Act will also be able to cover drugs that Medicaid, Medicare or private insurance will not cover.\nThe Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Emergency Act remains available to assist uninsured people with HIV and those who are underinsured.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually really, really proud of the District,\u201d said Crowley.\nCrowley described the Affordable Care Act as a \u201cstructural intervention that will make it easier to get\u201d people with HIV onto care and keep them in treatment."}
