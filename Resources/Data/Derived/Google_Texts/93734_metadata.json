She is a 20-year-old beautician from Blackpool, now famous for tweeting \u2018Why is our president Barraco Barner getting involved with Russia, scary.\u2019 Cue 7,000 retweets, publicity from Australia to Brazil, and the inevitable vicious attacks. Haters have come thick and fast, she says, describing her as an \u2018oxygen thief\u2019 and worse. This morning\u2019s press gets stuck in too. \u2018Tweet about the Ukraine/Russia crisis is branded a new low for \u201cdumb Britain\u201d\u2018 sneers the Daily Mirror.\n\nReally? It can be argued that this is a new high. I\u2019d like to cite, in my defence, Ed Miliband. The sole redeeming feature of his confused Hugo Young lecture was his quoting a lesser-known Walt Whitman poem, The Prairie Grass Dividing:\n\n\u2018Whitman talks about what makes for a successful democracy and says it is about a country where people can \u201clook carelessly in the faces of Presidents and Governors, as to say, Who are you?\u201d\u2018\n\nOr, to put it another way, a successful democracy is one where a socially-engaged beautician in Blackpool can refer to \u201cBarraco Barner\u201d as \u201cour president\u201d. In his poem, Whitman was arguing that politicians should, ideally, be as unimportant as possible. That, ideally, people would not have cause to know who they are. That he who governs least governs best.\n\nIn that poem, Whitman saluted:-\n\nThose that go their own gait,\n\nErect, stepping with freedom and command\n\nLeading, not following,\n\nThose with a never-quell\u2019d audacity\n\nThose with sweet and lusty flesh, clear of taint\u2026\n\nThose that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and Governors, as to say, Who are you?\n\nThose of earth-born passion, simple, never-constrain\u2019d, never obedient,\n\nThose of inland America.\n\nHad Whitman been in Britain today, these words might well have been written not for inland America but for coastal England \u2013 and the likes of Ms Worrall.\n\nShe felt obliged, in later comments, to refer to her \u2018stupidity\u2019, which I\u2019d dispute. In the Spectator\u2019s Portrait of the Week column, we always refer to \u201cDavid Cameron, the Prime Minister\u201d. You might wonder: why add the job title? Surely anyone who buys our magazine would know who was in No.10? But there are many perfectly intelligent Brits who could not give a hoot about current affairs.\n\nThe Spectator\u2019s great coalition of readers include those who think poetry is more important than politics. Those who buy us just for Jeremy Clarke and cartoons are certainly getting their money\u2019s worth (just \u00a31 a week, by the way, sign up here).\n\nIf you decide that life\u2019s too short to follow the Westminster tragicomedy, it emphatically does not make you stupid. The societies which tend to make a fuss about the bloke in power tend to be the societies in which you don\u2019t want like to live. The freer the country, the less the need to know who is running the government. That\u2019s why Ms Worrall\u2019s tweet can be seen a sign of something going right, rather than wrong, in Britain today.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barraco barner, walt whitman", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Coffee House", "description": "Meet Gemma Worrall, the latest unlikely\u00a0worldwide star produced by social media.
