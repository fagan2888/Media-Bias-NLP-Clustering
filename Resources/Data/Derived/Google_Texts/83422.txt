Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., joins Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., as another Democrat to play the racism card on the delay to hold a confirmation vote on attorney general hopeful Loretta Lynch.

“If it look like a duck, walk like a duck, and quack like a duck, it’s a duck,” Brown said during a news conference, one day after Durbin levelled his accusation. “And it is clear to me that there is hidden racism rampant in the House and the Senate.”
