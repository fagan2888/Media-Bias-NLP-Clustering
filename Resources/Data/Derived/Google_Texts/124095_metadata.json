The Fort Atkinson Blackhawks are under scrutiny by the organization.\n\nThe letters were sent more than a month after Governor Scott Walker signed a bill making it harder to force schools with tribal nicknames to change them. It no longer takes a complaint to start the review process. Now, the petitioner has to prove that the mascot or nickname is racist.\n\n\u201cWe have received the letter from the WIEA requesting Fort Atkinson to discontinue the use of the Blackhawk mascot out of respect for tribal nations,\u201d District Administrator Jeff Zaspel told The Daily Union. \u201cAt this time, we do not believe our use of the Blackhawk mascot is racist or disrespectful, and do not plan to discontinue our tradition of honoring Chief Blackhawk in this manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonoring\u201d is the defense other school districts and professional sports teams have used to describe why they should not change their name. Zaspel said that the name Blackhawks is an ode to Chief Blackhawk, who he said was \u201ca prominent figure in our community\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor our community, the use of the Blackhawk mascot is a focus on the bravery, courage, leadership and dignity displayed by Chief Black Hawk himself,\u201d Zaspel said.\n\nIn 1966, Fort Atkinson High School changed its name from the \u201cCardinals\u201d to the \u201cBlackhawks\u201d to differentiate itself from the teams in its conference that had the same name. According to the Daily Union, the Fort Atkinson Student Council recommended the change to honor Chief Black Sparrow Hawk, the Sauk warrior whose tribe\u2019s tragic massacre during the Blackhawk War of 1832 permeates Fort Atkinson\u2019s heritage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "High School Won't Drop 'Blackhawks' Name", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/21/letters-sent-wisconsin-high-schools-plead-name-change-153669", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/blackhawks_mascot.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Letters Sent to Wisconsin High Schools Plead for Name-Change"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-21T08:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/21/letters-sent-wisconsin-high-schools-plead-name-change-153669", "dc": {"title": "Letters Sent to Wisconsin High Schools Plead for Name-Change"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Letters Sent to Wisconsin High Schools Plead for Name-Change"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a0c\"", "article_summary": "The Fort Atkinson Blackhawks are under scrutiny by the organization.\nA school district in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, refuses to change the name of its high school\u2019s mascot after calls from the Wisconsin Indian Education Association to do so.\nThe WIEA sent 31 letters to school districts in the state asking them to drop Native American mascots and nicknames.\nIn 1966, Fort Atkinson High School changed its name from the \u201cCardinals\u201d to the \u201cBlackhawks\u201d to differentiate itself from the teams in its conference that had the same name.\nThe letters were sent more than a month after Governor Scott Walker signed a bill making it harder to force schools with tribal nicknames to change them."}
