Steve Gent, director of the Iowa Department of Transportation\u2019s office of traffic and safety, said the department plans to review the reports in coming weeks.\n\nThe adopted rules are meant to ensure that cities are targeting \u201cdocumented high-crash or high-risk\u201d locations for safety purposes, and decisions made by the DOT to remove permanent cameras can be appealed. The rules also outline an application process for the installation of new cameras on state roads.\n\nThe cities that have sought review are Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, Muscatine and Sioux City. Other cities using automated cameras that ticket motorists have chosen not to deploy them on the state highway system, and Clive has opted to end its traffic camera program altogether as of June 30.\n\nCapt. Melvin Williams with the Sioux City Police Department said the DOT\u2019s rules have severely limited areas where the department can deploy its two mobile speed cameras, making it more predictable for the public to determine where they\u2019ll be located. As a result, he said there have been reports that speeds are creeping back up, and the department has had to send more officers out to enforce speed laws along these roadways.\n\nWilliams added that he worries the rules mean cameras will be phased out over time, eventually stripping law enforcement officials of an \u201ceffective tool\u201d for speed enforcement.\n\nGent said decisions are ultimately up to the DOT, but that the review process will involve collaboration between DOT and local officials to fully understand why cities believe cameras are needed in certain areas. He said the idea is to make sure cameras are installed solely for safety purposes and not to bring in money.\n\nGent also said a provision saying traffic cameras should not be used as a long-term solution doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be. He said the department will assess different strategies for their efficiency and effectiveness and make decisions on the cameras from there.\n\nIowa is the only state in the nation with permanently installed cameras along interstate roadways, Gent said. Cedar Rapids has installed several permanent speed cameras along Interstate 380, for example, generating about $2.5 million in revenue in fiscal year 2013. Des Moines brought in nearly $1.3 million with its Interstate 235 speed cameras. Sioux City got just more than $5 million with its mobile speed cameras along Interstate 29 and red light cameras on U.S. Highway 75.\n\nLt. David Seybert with the Des Moines Police Department said the city has worked with the DOT since its cameras were first installed, so the new rules haven\u2019t caused any issues thus far.\n\n\u201cWhen new rules come about, we look at them, we abide by them and we just move on with business,\u201d he said.\n\nGreg Buelow, a Cedar Rapids spokesman, also said the rollout of the new rules hasn\u2019t been problematic.\n\nStill, Des Moines Police Department spokesman Sgt. Jason Halifax said if Des Moines decides to install or deploy new cameras, they likely won\u2019t be located on state roadways. He said deploying them elsewhere would be easier, \u201crather than jump through constant hoops with the DOT.\u201d\n\nJohn Bowman, a spokesman with the National Motorists Association, said it\u2019s important for local officials to be held accountable for their decisions and justify the use of the devices.\n\n\u201cI think with something as controversial and pervasive as ticket cameras, I see no reason not to have some general oversight throughout the state,\u201d he said.\n\nWhatever happens moving forward in terms of installing or removing traffic cameras, Gent said the focus must be safety.\n\n\u201cIowa doesn\u2019t want to be seen as a state where there are cameras everywhere, especially in a place where they\u2019re not needed,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six Iowa cities have submitted reports of their traffic camera use to state transportation officials and now await word on whether they'll be able to keep their speed and red light cameras on state-controlled highways and interstates.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Six Iowa cities have submitted reports of their traffic camera use to state transportation officials and now await word on whether they\u2019ll be able to keep their speed and red light cameras on state-controlled highways and interstates.", "title": "6 cities await Iowa DOT traffic camera decisions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/24/6-cities-await-iowa-dot-traffic-camera-decisions/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/24/470be1470368ec14540f6a70670096bd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/24/470be1470368ec14540f6a70670096bd.jpg", "description": "Six Iowa cities have submitted reports of their traffic camera use to state transportation officials and now await word on whether they'll be able to keep their speed and red light cameras on state-co", "card": "summary", "title": "6 cities await Iowa DOT traffic camera decisions"}, "Author": "KOURTNEY LIEPELT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Steve Gent, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Sioux City Police Department, Melvin Williams"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe43cf\"", "article_summary": "Whatever happens moving forward in terms of installing or removing traffic cameras, Gent said the focus must be safety.\nGent also said a provision saying traffic cameras should not be used as a long-term solution doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be.\nThe cities that have sought review are Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, Muscatine and Sioux City.\nSioux City got just more than $5 million with its mobile speed cameras along Interstate 29 and red light cameras on U.S. Highway 75.\nIowa is the only state in the nation with permanently installed cameras along interstate roadways, Gent said."}
