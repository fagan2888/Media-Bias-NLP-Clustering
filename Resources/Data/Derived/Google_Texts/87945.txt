A new map from data company Experian puts some pretty good detail into the wealthiest zip codes in America.

On average, those who reside in the 20510 zip code in Washington D.C., bring in just over $190,000 a year after taxes. Oddly enough, that zip code lists just 11 residents in its area.

Residents in the 20004 zip code in D.C. make just under $140,000 a year after taxes, while those who live in the 20015 zip code bring in just over $120,000 after taxes.

New York claims three of the top five wealthiest zip codes in the country, where people make over $2,000,000 after taxes in certain parts of the city.
