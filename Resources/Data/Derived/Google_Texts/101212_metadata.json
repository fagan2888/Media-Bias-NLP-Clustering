The number of people employed fell by about 115,000. The only reason the rate declined is that the overall labor force dropped by a larger 312,000, a possible sign of discouraged long-term jobless dropping out.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which is the percent of the population either working or looking to work, took a tumble to 63.2% \u2014 its lowest level since 1978.\n\nThe drop in the number of people employed may come as a shock, considering that the number of jobs in the economy rose last month. That\u2019s because the number of jobs added to the economy and the unemployment rate come from separate reports. The number of jobs added comes from a survey of business, while the unemployment rate comes from a survey of U.S. households. The two reports often move in tandem, but can move in opposite directions from month to month.\n\nThe unemployment rate is calculated based on the number of unemployed \u2014 people who are without jobs, who are available to work and who have actively sought work in the prior four weeks. The \u201cactively looking for work\u201d definition is fairly broad, including people who contacted an employer, employment agency, job center or friends; sent out resumes or filled out applications; or answered or placed ads, among other things. The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed by the total number of people in the labor force.\n\nA positive sign was a big drop \u2014 198,000 \u2014 in the number of people who say they\u2019re unemployed, but with the decline in the labor force many of those people may have just given up looking for work.\n\nA mixed signal came from the decline in the broader unemployment rate, known as the \u201cU-6\u2033 for its data classification by the Labor Department. That includes everyone in the official rate plus \u201cmarginally attached workers\u201d \u2014 those who are neither working nor looking for work, but say they want a job and have looked for work recently; and people who are employed part-time for economic reasons, meaning they want full-time work but took a part-time schedule instead because that\u2019s all they could find.\n\nThe drop in the U-6 rate was also influenced by the shrinking labor force, but also driven by a big decline in the number of people working part time, but who want full-time work. With the overall decline in the number of employed workers, it\u2019s likely that many of them just lost their jobs instead of graduating to full-time work.\n\nMore than four million people have been out of work for more than six months and over 11.5 million in total are looking for work. There\u2019s still a big hole in the jobs market.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The U.S. unemployment rate dropped 0.1 percentage point to 7.3% in August and a broader measure of unemployment fell to 13.7% from 14%, but the declines came from the wrong reasons.", "title": "Unemployment Rate Drops for Wrong Reasons", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/06/unemployment-rate-drop-for-wrong-reasons/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Unemployment Rate Drops for Wrong Reasons", "description": "The U.S. unemployment rate dropped 0.1 percentage point to 7.3% in August and a broader measure of unemployment fell to 13.7% from 14%, but the declines came from the wrong reasons.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Phil Izzo", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "The U.S. unemployment rate dropped 0.1 percentage point to 7.3% in August and a broader measure of unemployment fell to 13.7% from 14%, but the declines came from the wrong reasons.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-06T13:02:46-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/06/unemployment-rate-drop-for-wrong-reasons/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-20251", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The U.S. unemployment rate dropped 0.1 percentage point to 7.3% in August and a broader measure of unemployment fell to 13.7% from 14%, but the declines came from the wrong reasons.", "title": "Unemployment Rate Drops for Wrong Reasons", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/06/unemployment-rate-drop-for-wrong-reasons/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-20251", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-06T21:05:23-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe51\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. unemployment rate dropped 0.1 percentage point to 7.3% in August and a broader measure of unemployment fell to 13.7% from 14%, but the declines came from the wrong reasons.\nThe unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed by the total number of people in the labor force.\nThe drop in the main unemployment rate was driven almost totally by negative factors.\nThat\u2019s because the number of jobs added to the economy and the unemployment rate come from separate reports.\nThe number of jobs added comes from a survey of business, while the unemployment rate comes from a survey of U.S. households."}
