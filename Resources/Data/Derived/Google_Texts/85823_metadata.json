He incontrovertibly was the political prime mover in raising the world\u2019s wealth to $100 trillion (trillion with a t). As this writer elsewhere has observed:\n\n\"According to the World Bank, the world\u2019s GDP in 1980 was around $11 trillion. Today it is around $60 trillion. The added $50 trillion-per-year capitalizes to over $100 trillion in new wealth\u2026 even when adjusted for inflation.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n$100 trillion is a lot of money\u2026 even by Washington standards. Thanks to the work of Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) and his tiny team, America was instrumental in bringing a billion people out of abject poverty into decent working affluence. Not incidentally, Kemp\u2019s work created the conditions for the generation of nearly 40 million jobs, under Reagan and Clinton, in America. Abandoning the Kemp formula, America has stagnated.\n\nKemp\u2019s honors include the award, posthumously, of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America\u2019s highest civilian honor, by President Obama.\n\nThe White House described Kemp this way:\n\n\"In Congress and as a Cabinet Secretary, Kemp was a self-described \u2018bleeding heart conservative\u2019 who worked to encourage development in underserved urban communities. In the years leading up to his death, Kemp continued seeking new solutions, raising public attention about the challenge of poverty, and working across party lines to improve the lives of Americans and others around the world.\"\n\nEquitable prosperity, a little more than ten years ago, lost the momentum imparted to it by the Kemp formula. This faltering mostly was due to the ending of the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d of Federal Reserve Chairmen Paul Volcker and, in his first decade, Alan Greenspan. The Great Moderation was a reflection of the Kemp playbook.\n\nAs a result of neglecting Kemp\u2019s demand for \u201cgood money,\u201d choosing instead the seductive but bad road of \u201ccheap money,\u201d job creation \u2014 and upward mobility by workers \u2014 slowed to a snail\u2019s pace. Presidents Bush and Obama would have considered themselves fortunate to see the creation of as many jobs in a term as Reagan and Clinton saw in a year (or even less).\n\nIt is cheap money that is demolishing job creation. Now the Democrats are calling for symbolic, patchwork, and sometimes counter-productive measures such as increasing the minimum wage. But at least the Democrats have the political sense to be taking the problem of wage stagnation seriously even if their proposed solutions do not appear promising. Most Republicans look clueless.\n\nKemp had many good ideas for igniting sizzling, equitable, job creation and economic growth. The GOP is groping for an agenda relevant to voters. It need look no further than the trove of ideas harbored by the Jack Kemp Foundation, beginning with completing the main task left undone: institutionalizing good monetary policy, most preferably through the gold standard.\n\nKemp: \"Because of its inherent connection with the federal deficit, the trade deficit, and economic instability, the gold issue will not go away.\" The Jack Kemp Foundation\u2019s president Jimmy Kemp characterizes the gold standard as his father\u2019s most important piece of unfinished business.\n\nThe Jack Kemp Foundation, with American Principles in Action, is assembling the Kemp Brain Trust to discuss just that, this Friday. At a Kemp Forum on Growth to be held on Capitol Hill, Jack Kemp Foundation president Jimmy Kemp; Dave Hoppe, chief of staff to Rep. Kemp; John Mueller, economic counsel to the House Republican Conference under Kemp\u2019s chairmanship; Jeffrey Bell, national co-chairman of Kemp\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign; and this writer, later a junior associate of Team Kemp and founder of the Prosperity Caucus will be discussing the Gold Standard Act of 1984 on its 30th anniversary.\n\nKemp\u2019s Gold Standard Act, the missing link for restoring job creation and equitable prosperity, is even more important today than it was when first introduced. Want more jobs, better jobs, stable prices, and a quickly diminishing deficit \u2014 and happy voters of all parties?\n\nLook no further than the Gold Standard Act. The Spirit of Jack Kemp rides again.\n\nBenko is a senior adviser to American Principles in Action, a conservative advocacy group.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "At least the Democrats have the political sense to be taking the problem of wage stagnation seriously even if their proposed solutions do not appear promising.", "description": "At least the Democrats have the political sense to be taking the problem of wage stagnation seriously even if their proposed solutions do not appear promising.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "At least the Democrats have the political sense to be taking the problem of wage stagnation seriously even if their proposed solutions do not appear promising.", "title": "Spirit of Jack Kemp rides again", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/208240-spirit-of-jack-kemp-rides-again", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/208240-spirit-of-jack-kemp-rides-again", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-05T17:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Ralph Benko", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-05T17:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/208240-spirit-of-jack-kemp-rides-again", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "At least the Democrats have the political sense to be taking the problem of wage stagnation seriously even if their proposed solutions do not appear promising.", "card": "summary", "title": "Spirit of Jack Kemp rides again"}, "dcterms.title": "Spirit of Jack Kemp rides again"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8894\"", "article_summary": "The Jack Kemp Foundation\u2019s president Jimmy Kemp characterizes the gold standard as his father\u2019s most important piece of unfinished business.\nThe Spirit of Jack Kemp rides again.\nThe Jack Kemp Foundation, with American Principles in Action, is assembling the Kemp Brain Trust to discuss just that, this Friday.\nHe incontrovertibly was the political prime mover in raising the world\u2019s wealth to $100 trillion (trillion with a t).\nJack Kemp was one of very few transformational political leaders of the 20th century."}
