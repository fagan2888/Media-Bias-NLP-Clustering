The whole system is not working; it\u2019s not working for me.\u201d\n\nA self-employed attorney who also works as a part-time registered nurse, Dicharry and his wife were happy with their old health coverage, which cost $317 a month with $5,000 deductibles for each person and vision and dental coverage.\n\nBut under the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, the couple\u2019s coverage through Presbyterian Healthcare Services was canceled because it did not meet the more robust standards of the ACA.\n\nDicharry says his new plan through Presbyterian will cost three times more. He believes he\u2019s eligible for federal subsidies to help lower those premiums, but his application has not gone through, even though he has logged onto healthcare.gov repeatedly since Oct. 5.\n\nThe problem appears to be that the website is unable to verify Dicharry\u2019s identification.\n\nRepeatedly, Dicharry says he receives messages like this one:\n\n\u201cI keep waiting for them to send me an email saying, we\u2019ve confirmed your identity,\u201d said Dicharry, who said he originally supported the aims of Obamacare. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that hard to do. I\u2019m 60 years old and I\u2019ve been filing income tax returns since I was 15.\u201d\n\nThe clock is ticking.\n\nOld policies like Dicharry\u2019s expire at the end of the year, and applications must be approved by the federal government by Dec. 23 to go into effect Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cIf I go from having health insurance for 20, 30 years, getting my coverage canceled and to now go to being on the verge of being uninsured (it\u2019s frustrating),\u201d Dicharry said. \u201cI\u2019m going through everything they wanted me to go through.\u201d\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.organd follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Despite reports that the Obamacare website is working much better, a 60-year-old from New Mexico has been unable to sign up for coverage after trying for two months.", "title": "NM lawyer stuck in Obamacare limbo - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/guy-dicharry-obamacare-website.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-09T15:51:33+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/119411/obamacare-limbo-stuck/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "New Mexico", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Guy Dicharry,New Mexico Watchdog,ObamaCare,Presbyterian Healthcare Systems,www.healthcare.gov", "published_time": "2013-12-09T13:01:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T15:51:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Despite reports that the Obamacare website is working much better, a 60-year-old from New Mexico has been unable to sign up for coverage after trying for two months.", "title": "NM lawyer stuck in Obamacare limbo - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/guy-dicharry-headshot-267x300.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Despite reports that the Obamacare website is working much better, a 60-year-old from New Mexico has been unable to sign up for coverage after trying for two months."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b26\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis thing (healthcare.gov ) does not do what it\u2019s supposed to do at all,\u201d Guy Dicharry told New Mexico Watchdog.\nBy Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico WatchdogSANTA FE \u2014 The Obama administration insists the troubled healthcare.gov website is working better, but a 60-year-old lawyer from Los Lunas says his application for individual coverage has been stuck in limbo for more than two months.\n\u201cI\u2019m going through everything they wanted me to go through.\u201dContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.organd follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski\nI\u2019m 60 years old and I\u2019ve been filing income tax returns since I was 15.\u201dThe clock is ticking.\nBut under the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, the couple\u2019s coverage through Presbyterian Healthcare Services was canceled because it did not meet the more robust standards of the ACA."}
