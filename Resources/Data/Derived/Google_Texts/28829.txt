An Army veteran who was ordered by Georgia election officials to remove his National Rifle Association hat before voting has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the state.

The lawsuit comes after Bundy Cobb, who is certified by the NRA in firearms training, was ordered to remove his “NRA Instructor” hat before being allowed to vote early in Douglasville on Oct. 24.

Mr. Cobb said a poll worker explained at the time that the pro-gun garb was perceived as being too closely associated with the GOP and the tea party. The National Rifle Association later wrote a letter demanding the board of elections in Douglas County reverse its “unconstitutional policy.”

Southeastern Legal Foundation filed the lawsuit Monday on behalf of Mr. Cobb in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia, The Daily Caller reported.

“The lawsuit filed today seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to redress and prevent the rights of Mr. Cobb and all registered voters in Douglas County against unconstitutional restrictions on free speech and free association under the U.S. Constitution,” the foundation’s Executive Director Shannon Goessling said in a statement.

“This should never happen again in Douglas County, in Georgia, or in any jurisdiction in the U.S.,” she said.

Mr. Cobb’s lawsuit names the state, the Douglas County Board of Elections, Fulton and other county election officials as defendants, The Daily Caller reported.
