Many veterans of the Vietnam War began treating themselves with marijuana while in Vietnam as a way to deal with what was PTSD in real time \u2014 though it had no official moniker until 1980.\n\nNearly 44 years ago this month, on duty inside the turret section of a 155mm howitzer located some 40 miles northeast of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) in South Vietnam, I was introduced to marijuana by a couple of seasoned veterans who said that pot helped them cope with the long stretches of boredom as well as the occasional horror of the war.\n\nI would soon discover that there were many others like them, and I found some truth in their words.\n\nAbout 10 months later, I returned home to an uncertain future, with my father dying from inoperable brain cancer and my mother \u2014 who hadn\u2019t worked outside the home since World War II \u2014 facing the prospect of raising my two young brothers alone, with little or no income.\n\nIn the months following my return, I started college full-time on the GI Bill, took on the role of surrogate father to my youngest brother and, yes, continued smoking pot. By the time I\u2019d graduated from college five years later, I assumed it would just be a matter of time before marijuana was recognized as a safe and effective way to deal with post-traumatic stress.\n\nAlthough I have long since quit smoking pot, I never changed my position about the legality issue, and I have always regarded my pot smoking back then as one of the only reasons I was able to maintain somewhat normal behavior after being plucked from a firebase near the Cambodian border and dropped two days later back into a life I no longer recognized.\n\nWhen I smoked pot for the first time in Vietnam, I enjoyed the distance that a few pulls on a marijuana cigarette put between my country\u2019s publicly professed interest in Vietnam and the reality of what I was experiencing on the ground.\n\nSince that time, I have raised two children, run 45 marathons, and taught in middle schools and high schools in four states. Both of my daughters have undergraduate degrees. One owns and operates a medical marijuana dispensary with her husband in Denver, where I have met several veterans who don\u2019t need a government study to tell them about marijuana\u2019s potential in treating symptoms of PTSD.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to imagine how many veterans troubled by PTSD over the past 40 years may have wound up in psychiatric hospitals, prison, or worse.\n\nIn Colorado at least, veterans experiencing PTSD need not wait for a government study to learn for themselves if marijuana helps alleviates their symptoms and, at long last, they no longer have to worry about being thrown in jail for attempting to treat their PTSD in real time.\n\nMark McVay of Golden, a retired teacher, served in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Vietnam in 1969-70.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "When vets treat PTSD with pot", "title": "When vets treat PTSD with pot", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/11/when-vets-treat-ptsd-with-pot/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140411__veterans-PTSDp1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140411__veterans-PTSDp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-11T11:22:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:04:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe9d\"", "article_summary": "In the months following my return, I started college full-time on the GI Bill, took on the role of surrogate father to my youngest brother and, yes, continued smoking pot.\nIn Colorado, an Iraq war veteran diagnosed with PTSD became the first person in the nation to buy recreational marijuana legally on Jan. 1.\nThe federal government last month gave the go-ahead to a study examining the use of marijuana in treating U.S. veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nIt\u2019s sad to imagine how many veterans troubled by PTSD over the past 40 years may have wound up in psychiatric hospitals, prison, or worse.\nMany veterans of the Vietnam War began treating themselves with marijuana while in Vietnam as a way to deal with what was PTSD in real time \u2014 though it had no official moniker until 1980."}
