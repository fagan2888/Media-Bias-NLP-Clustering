The Colorado State marching band has performed in numerous local, national and international events, from the 2013 St. Patrick’s Festival and Parade in Dublin, to Denver Broncos’ games.

You’ve probably seen them from above, sitting the stands or watching them on TV. You may have even seen them from field level. But you’ve never seen them this close, through a GoPro camera attached to a trombone. Enjoy.
