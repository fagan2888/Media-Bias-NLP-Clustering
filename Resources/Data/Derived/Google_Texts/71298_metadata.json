Spending healthcare dollars with intelligence, confirms the proposed rule, results in healthier people.\n\nThe proposed rule requests the implementation of a value-based pay model for SNFs with quality metrics influencing 2018 reimbursements. Those SNFs that adopt health IT to enable data exchange will be financially rewarded for doing so.\n\nPutting all your financial eggs in one market basket\n\nAccording to CMS\u2019 proposal, there will be changes in payment rates under the SNF Prospective Payment System (PPS). CMS estimates SNF cumulative payments will increase by $500 million \u2013 1.4 percent \u2013 from earlier payments made in 2015.\n\nCMS explains such a projection is based on a possible 2.6 percent market basket increase.\n\nCMS defines a market basket as a fixed-weight index, measuring a \u201cpure\u201d price change. A market basket helps clarify how much more (or how much less) it would cost to purchase an identical mix of goods and services within a given base period at a later time. CMS market baskets update payments and cost limits within various CMS payment systems and reflect input price inflation to better financially inform healthcare providers.\n\nThere are three steps involved in the assembly of a market basket, says CMS.\n\nA base period is selected. Total base period expenditures are estimated for mutually exclusive and exhaustive spending categories based on expenditure type. Each spending category\u2019s proportion \u2013 cost or expenditure weights \u2013 for total costs is determined.\n\nEach expenditure category is matched to a price proxy, an appropriate price/wage variable.\n\nThe price level for each spending category price proxy is multiplied by that category\u2019s expenditure weight. The sum of all products yields the composite index level in the market basket for a given annual time period.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires market basket updates for SNFs be regularly adjusted according to economy-wide productivity changes. The market update of SNF PPS, which went into effect in 1998, has declined from 2.7 in 2012 to 2.3 in 2014.\n\nCMS stresses it is merely taking its very best guess\n\nWhere is a crystal ball when you need one? Is a $500 million increase something to tangibly anticipate or is it merely dead-end brouhaha?\n\nThe short answer, according to CMS, is a firm maybe. CMS merely estimates the aggregate impact in payments to SNFs will increase by $500 million. However, CMS itself is perhaps a tad conservative within the unfolding of its proposed ruling.\n\n\u201cCertain events may occur to limit the scope or accuracy of our impact analysis, as this analysis is future-oriented and, thus, very susceptible to forecasting errors due to certain events that may occur within the assessed impact time period,\u201d explains CMS.\n\nThe possibility of newly-legislated Medicare program funding changes by the Congress or SNF changes is blatantly feasible, confirms CMS. Similarly, it\u2019s possible previously-enacted legislation, or new statutory prevision unconsidered as of yet will affect CMS\u2019 estimate.\n\n\u201cAlthough these changes may not be specific to the SNF PPS, the nature of the Medicare program is such that the 136 changes may interact and, thus, the complexity of the interaction of these changes could make it difficult to predict accurately the full scope of the impact upon SNFs,\u201d CMS\u2019 proposed ruling confirms, adding that preliminary data that could more accurately predict future financial implications is something \u201cwe do not yet have.\u201d\n\nCMS additionally suggests more detailed financial estimates, claiming, \u201cWe estimate a total additional burden of $27.47 per Medicare-covered SNF stay, based on the most recent data available, in this case FY 2014, that 15,421 SNFs had a total of 138 2,599,656 Medicare-covered stays for fee-for-service beneficiaries.\u201d CMS states this would equate to 1,012,566.13 total added hours, the equivalent of 66 hours per SNF annually.\n\nFocusing on matters of technology to decrease healthcare costs\n\nA focus on technology to keep costs down is also a primary focus, according to the proposed rule. SNFs are suggested to independently manage health IT initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe encourage stakeholders to utilize health information exchange and certified health IT to effectively and efficiently help providers improve internal care delivery practices, support management of care across the continuum, enable the reporting of electronically specified clinical quality measures (eCQMs), and improve efficiencies and reduce unnecessary costs,\u201d states the proposed rule.\n\nCMS accepts public commentary on its proposed rule through mid-June of 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New policy changes further promote the Medicare payment transition from volume to value within the healthcare industry for Skilled Nursing Facility Payments.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/skilled-nursing-facility-payments-projected-to-rise-by-500m", "type": "article", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Doctor_Payment.jpg", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "Skilled Nursing Facility Payments Projected to Rise by $500M"}, "twitter": {"description": "New policy changes further promote the Medicare payment transition from volume to value within the healthcare industry for Skilled Nursing Facility Payments.", "title": "Skilled Nursing Facility Payments Projected to Rise by $500M", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Doctor_Payment.jpg"}, "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf113\"", "article_summary": "The sum of all products yields the composite index level in the market basket for a given annual time period.\nSpending healthcare dollars with intelligence, confirms the proposed rule, results in healthier people.\nThe proposed rule requests the implementation of a value-based pay model for SNFs with quality metrics influencing 2018 reimbursements.\nCMS market baskets update payments and cost limits within various CMS payment systems and reflect input price inflation to better financially inform healthcare providers.\nCMS estimates SNF cumulative payments will increase by $500 million \u2013 1.4 percent \u2013 from earlier payments made in 2015."}
