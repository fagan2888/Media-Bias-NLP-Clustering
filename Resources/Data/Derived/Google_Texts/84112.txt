Obamacare is a flawed law that Republicans can use to signify how the administration of President Barack Obama has taken away the freedoms of Americans by taking away choice, says former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani."It was flawed from the beginning. Everything the president has said about it has turned out to be untrue," Giuliani told "Fox & Friends" on Wednesday."I believe the Obamacare message is a much better message when it's taken to what I call the next level, when it's taken to the overarching level of just one more example of how the Obama administration has taken away your freedoms, how he has taken away your ability to make choices for yourself," said Giuliani, a Republican.In addition to Obamacare, the stripping of freedoms by the Obama administration has been evident in its lack of support for charter schools and the intrusion of government into business through overregulation, Giuliani said.He said that overreach has generated the "emotion that's driving the tea party and everything else.""In every respect, the Obama administration has taken this country and made it more intrusive into our lives," Giuliani said.
