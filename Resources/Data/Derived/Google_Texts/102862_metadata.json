Former employees are still waiting for a clear answer on when, or if, they will see a pay check for their final days of work.\n\nThe group set up outside of the hospital on Saturday waiting on the attorney who is handling their bankruptcy case, planning to pass out their employee records and gave them the chance to ask question.\n\nAttorney James Rogan explained that there is a hierarchy and employee wages claims are third in line for payment behind Acute Care Incorporated and the Internal Revenue Service. He said that employees claims are dependent on collection of accounts receivable and the pending lawsuit against the cabinet for health and family services involving medicaid reimbursement.\n\n\"Whether or not there will be sufficient money to pay the claims right now is up in the air,\" Rogan said. \"If that lawsuit is successful there is a chance employees will be paid, if not it is doubtful they will be paid.\"\n\n\"That's fine and and okay but that's not what we had been told and understood never let go of that last shred of hope until you know it is completely gone but i think deep down in our hearts we didn't think that we'd ever see anything but it would have been nice if we did and it would also have been nice if they had just been upfront with us,\" Dance said.\n\nThose who showed up on Saturday say they do feel like they finally got an answer and say this was probably the final chapter for them and the hospital.\n\nRogan says that lawsuit is currently in litigation and there is no estimate of when it could be final.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of former employees are fighting to get paid in a bankruptcy lawsuit filed against the now-defunct Nicholas County Hospital.", "language": "english", "author": "Hillary Thornton", "og": {"url": "http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/Former-employees-wait-outside-Nicholas-Co-Hospital-demanding-answers-307263151.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/nicholas+county+hospital1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A group of former employees are fighting to get paid in a bankruptcy lawsuit filed against the now-defunct Nicholas County Hospital.", "title": "Former employees wait outside Nicholas Co.
