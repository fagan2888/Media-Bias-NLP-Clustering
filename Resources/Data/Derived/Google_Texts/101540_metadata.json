After all, ever since he officially became a Republican presidential candidate, he\u2019s faced considerable and growing backlash over his theories about Mexicans. Recently, however, he \u201cclarified\u201d his remarks by releasing a statement that in many ways dug himself deeper into a hole. \u201cThe Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States,\u201d he wrote in part. \u201cThey are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.\"\n\nNevertheless, Charles Krauthammer, who has been in a tussle with Trump for some weeks now, explained why the business mogul\u2019s comments are beyond offensive, and, ultimately, toxic to the Republican brand:\n\n\"Well, he's tapping in, but he's essentially -- he's done it in a way that the word offensive is too weak. It's an insult. An entire immigrant group. He did not make a distinct between legal and illegal immigrants. That's his entire campaign. All our problems are from Mexico, from China, from Saudi Arabia, and Japan. He will make them pay. But that elevates him to a guy actually with ideas. These are eruptions, barstool eruptions. And the pity is this. This is the strongest field of Republican candidates in 35 years. You could pick a dozen of them at random and have the strongest cabinet America's had in our lifetime and instead all of our time is spent discussing this rodeo clown...\"\n\nMincing words is not in Krauthammer\u2019s repertoire when discussing the fabulously wealthy \u2013 and high-polling \u2013 Donald Trump. And yet, Krauthammer\u2019s not the only one frustrated by Trump\u2019s influence and large microphone (via Politico):\n\nAt least one top Republican donor wants the party to keep Donald Trump from the debate stage. \u201cSomeone in the party ought to start some sort of petition saying, \u2018If Trump\u2019s going to be on the stage, I\u2019m not going to be on there with him,\u2019\u201d Republican donor John Jordan told The Associated Press on Monday, according to a report published Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m toying with the idea of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I feel strongly about as somebody who not only cares about the Republican Party, but also Latinos,\u201d he added.\n\nNo doubt others feel the same way. But how likely is a petition to be successful, one that bars Trump from debating on stage, when he\u2019s polling in the top tier and has a dedicated, devoted, and rather large following who wants to see him nominated?\n\nKrauthammer\u2019s right: The controversies Trump is generating are overshadowing a GOP field that is both talented and desperate to win. But finding a way to silence him, when he\u2019s entirely self-funded, is impossible. I suspect very few pundits thought Trump would actually run, and now that he has, the donor and political classes are scratching their heads trying to figure out how to respond. And while this adds (for some) a new layer of excitement to the race, it also adds another dimension of nervousness and unpredictability as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just a thought..05/26/2016 0:58:45AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Just a thought.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Republican Donor: Shouldn't Donald Trump Be Barred From Debates?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/07/07/should-donald-trump-be-barred-from-debate-n2022223", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/187/92e85db7-4099-4a8b-9826-d9b318fa73f8.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Just a thought.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Republican Donor: Shouldn't Donald Trump Be Barred From Debates?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/07/07/should-donald-trump-be-barred-from-debate-n2022223", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/187/92e85db7-4099-4a8b-9826-d9b318fa73f8.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Republican Donor: Shouldn't Donald Trump Be Barred From Debates?, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd197d\"", "article_summary": "Is Donald Trump a political liability?\nAnd yet, Krauthammer\u2019s not the only one frustrated by Trump\u2019s influence and large microphone (via Politico):At least one top Republican donor wants the party to keep Donald Trump from the debate stage.\n\u201cI\u2019m toying with the idea of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I feel strongly about as somebody who not only cares about the Republican Party, but also Latinos,\u201d he added.\nAfter all, ever since he officially became a Republican presidential candidate, he\u2019s faced considerable and growing backlash over his theories about Mexicans.\nKrauthammer\u2019s right: The controversies Trump is generating are overshadowing a GOP field that is both talented and desperate to win."}
