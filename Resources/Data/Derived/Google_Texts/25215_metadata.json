The date, 3/21, reflects the triplication of the 21st chromosome that causes the genetic disorder.\n\nThe extra chromosome causes delays in mental and physical development. Those with Down syndrome typically have trouble with learning, decision making, concentration, and memory. In developed nations, however, some go on to graduate high school and find paying jobs. Most can live to 50 or 60 with the disorder.\n\nOne of every 691 babies in the U.S. is born with Down syndrome, which is about 6,000 a year, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. And \u201cone of every 700 to 900 babies born worldwide will have Down syndrome,\u201d Down Syndrome Australia reports.\n\nThe United Kingdom-based Down Syndrome International released the video clips as part of its \u201cMy Friends, My Community\u201d initiative, which promotes the inclusion of Down syndrome children around the world. Each clip features an interview with one of these children and a friend.\n\n\u201cThe reality for many is that prevailing negative attitudes result in low expectations, discrimination and exclusion, creating communities where children and adults with Down syndrome cannot integrate successfully with their peers,\u201d Down Syndrome International said in a formal statement.\n\nGroups and organizations from 33 countries arranged the interviews. The groups sent the videos to Down Syndrome International for editing and release.\n\nIn the clip from Italy, Riccardo and Gianmarco are interviewed together.\n\n\u201cWhich three words describe your friend?\u201d the interviewer asks the boys.\n\n\u201cBeautiful, nice, and a little bit talkative,\u201d Riccardo, the one with Down syndrome, says.\n\n\u201cFunny, affectionate, short,\u201d Gianmarco says with a laugh.\n\nNeither mentions Down syndrome.\n\nAnother clip features Kim and Magali, friends from Switzerland.\n\nKim, who has Down syndrome, says she lives at home with \u201cMom, Dad \u2026 and Nala,\u201d and wants to be a teacher when she grows up.\n\nMagali says she lives with her cats, a sister, her parents, two mice\u2014sometimes even a third one\u2014two bunnies, and two guinea pigs. She says she wants to grow up to be a horse trainer and riding instructor.\n\nThe girls agree on one thing\u2014they will still continue to see each other even when they get older.\n\nNeither mentions Down syndrome.\n\nColorful posters and a shelf full of stuffed animals surround Chiara and Nadja as they talk about school, their hopes for the future, and their lives in Germany.\n\nBoys are also a topic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like boys,\u201d Chiara, who has Down syndrome, says. \u201cThe boys tease the teacher and the teacher scolds them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a \u2018clique\u2019\u2014which has no name\u2014and during the breaks we gossip about girl\u2019s stuff and Chiara is with us there,\u201d Nadja says. \u201cAnd there is a boy who chats with us. We have to send him off because he annoys us.\u201d\n\nThe interviewer asks what the girls like to do with each other.\n\n\u201cWith Chiara, I like to play and we like going out for ice cream,\u201d Nadja says.\n\nChiara says the two watch TV together and play with their cell phones.\n\nNeither mentions Down syndrome.\n\nAll children benefit when children with Down syndrome have an opportunity to participate in an environment of \u201cfriendship, acceptance, and respect for everyone,\u201d the statement from Down Syndrome International says, adding:\n\nThese environments prepare all today\u2019s children for life as tomorrow\u2019s adults, enabling adults with Down syndrome to live, work and participate, with confidence and individual autonomy, fully included in society alongside their friends and peers.\n\nSarah Sleem contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of every 700 to 900 babies worldwide is born with Down syndrome.
