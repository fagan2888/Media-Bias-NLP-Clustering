But the future of the hospital is now unclear. Its fate will hinge on the coming days and weeks.\n\nElbert County commissioners are holding public hearings this week and next on a proposed 1-mill property tax increase for one year to raise about $500,000 to offset the Elberton hospital\u2019s costs for indigent care.\n\nWithout the money, the 52-bed hospital will close, officials warn. That would eliminate more than 200 jobs, and residents would have to travel more than 30 miles to the nearest hospital. A closure would jolt the mostly rural county\u2019s economy.\n\nElbert Memorial lost $1.5 million in its last fiscal year, CEO Jim Yarborough said Tuesday. \u201cOur concern is that charity care and bad debt are trending upward,\u201d he said. Yarborough calls the financial crunch facing many Georgia hospitals \u201ca silent epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s predicament demonstrates how counties and hospitals depend on each other financially, and how revenue pressure on each is creating an unprecedented squeeze.\n\n\u201cCounties are in major turmoil deciding whether they want a hospital or pick up the garbage,\u201d said Jimmy Lewis, CEO of HomeTown Health, an organization of rural hospitals in the state. Meanwhile, he added, \u201cThe general cash position in most rural hospitals is extremely dire.\u201d\n\nHospitals are facing lower reimbursements from government programs and private health insurers, along with high levels of uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\nBut another key issue is Georgia\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid, hospital execs say.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal and Georgia\u2019s legislative leaders, citing costs, have decided not to expand Medicaid as outlined under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nExpansion \u201cwould help significantly,\u201d Yarborough said. \u201cIt would create a paying source\u201d from uninsured low-income patients, he added.\n\nThe Elbert County predicament comes in the wake of five hospitals closing in Georgia in the past two years. Four were in rural areas. And several other hospitals around the state are struggling just to stay open.\n\n\u201cIf this disturbing trend continues, we\u2019ll have major access-to-care issues for hundreds of thousands of Georgians throughout the state,\u201d Kevin Bloye of the Georgia Hospital Association said recently. \u201cIt will also have devastating financial consequences to areas that lose their local hospital which serves as a major economic engine.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, hospitals\u2019 requests to counties for help are more urgent now, said Debra Nesbit of the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, which represents county governments in the state. \u201cThe counties are really struggling with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHospitals are saying, \u2018Give us money or we are going to shut the door,\u2019\u201d Nesbit added. But with property appraisals decreasing, she said, counties have financial problems of their own. \u201cThey may not have the resources, particularly in rural areas.\u201d\n\nMost counties are supporting their hospitals financially, Lewis said.\n\nReimbursement reductions for hospitals \u201ctranslate into an unfunded mandate onto the county,\u201d Lewis added. \u201cRural unemployment rates are so high there\u2019s no millage capacity to support the unfunded mandate.\u201d\n\nSome counties are pursuing new avenues to keep their hospitals upright. Recently, Habersham County in the northeast Georgia mountains agreed in a deal with the local hospital authority to make monthly bond payments on Habersham Medical Center\u2019s $37 million debt. The county will eventually take over the assets of the facility.\n\nIn Newton County, east of Atlanta, 97-bed Newton Medical Center recently requested a property tax increase to offset indigent care costs. It would have resulted in about a $600,000 funding increase, said Troy Brooks, assistant administrator of fiscal services for the hospital. But he said the county has already set the budget and did not include the funding that the hospital requested.\n\nThe hospital isn\u2019t in danger of closing, Brooks indicated. Last year the hospital posted its first positive margin since fiscal 2008, which Brooks attributed to the nearly $2 million in funds related to the Electronic Health Record initiative in the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Health, Local News, Around Here, Features, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "ELBERTON | Elbert Memorial Hospital has served its northeast Georgia county for more than 60 years.
