Police in southwest Florida say vandals spray painted the words "lion killer" on the garage door of the vacation home owned by a Minnesota dentist who has been identified as the hunter who killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe.

Marco Island police Capt. David Baer says the vandals also left at least seven pickled pigs' feet on the driveway of Walter Palmer's $1.1 million home. Baer says police have opened an investigation.

A hand-made sign criticizing Palmer was left in the yard last week. A security company has been hired to protect the property.

Officials in Zimbabwe have said they'll seek the extradition of Palmer, alleging he lacked authorization to kill Cecil last month. Palmer has said he relied on professional guides to ensure his hunting was legal.
