Euthanasia. Rationing. Assisted Suicide. These are the kinds of concerns the pro-life community brought up when Congress pushed through Obamacare and government-run health care. These concerns are already becoming real in the Untied States, but a new story out of the United Kingdom should give Americans a hint as to what’s next.

Nurses who are a part of in-home health care programs for the sick, elderly and disabled are coming forward to say they’ve been told to ask such patients not if they need medical help but if they need assistance in killing themselves.

The nurses say patients are asked via a form if they want to sign a DNR order making it so no efforts would be made to save their lives in emergency circumstances.

The elderly patients are given these forms and asked these questions as a part of Britain’s NHS program, the government-run health care scheme. Experts fear patients will feel pressured into giving consent to avoid trouble.

The forms were sent to patients in June and then returned to their doctors and they target patients over 75 and patients with long-term medical conditions — both of whom may be vulnerable to pressure to end their lives to ration their health care.
