MacArthur Foundation, analyzed health care costs in state prisons from 2007 to 2011. It showed that not only did Oklahoma spend less than any other state on health care per inmate in 2011 \u2014 $2,558 \u2014 but that number is a 17 percent reduction from 2007.\n\nAn increase in aging prisoners and the prevalence of chronic diseases, mental illness and substance-use disorders were among key factors for increasing prison health care costs cited in the study.\n\nAccording to the study, from 2007 to 2011, the number of inmates age 55 or older in Oklahoma increased from 6.6 percent to nearly 8 percent of the total prison population. In 2014, those inmates represent 8.5 percent of Oklahoma\u2019s prison population, state Corrections Department spokesman Jerry Massie said.\n\nOne third of Oklahoma inmates require mental health treatment, and more inmates are serving time on drug possession or distribution charges than any other type of crime, he said.\n\nAging inmates\n\nIn an effort to combat high levels of violence at the Oklahoma State Reformatory in 2012, Corrections Department officials decided to remove any offender younger than the age of 40 from the prison, a state facility in Granite that houses close to 1,000 medium- and minimum-security inmates. While violence rates plummeted in the following year, the total number of medical visits more than doubled.\n\nEric Franklin, division manager over health services for the Corrections Department, called addressing the medical needs of the state\u2019s aging prisoners a \u201cdaunting issue,\u201d but he added the state is taking steps to reduce the growing impact of medical costs.\n\nFranklin said the department has been preparing for the increase in older inmates by utilizing some of the options outlined in the study released Tuesday, such as trying to make good use of Medicaid reimbursements, pushing for early medical paroles, and using telemedicine, which allows doctors to see patients via webcam rather than in person.\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nThe study also found that states that did not opt to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act could miss out on potential cost savings through medical reimbursement.\n\n\u201cFor those states, it will really be business as usual,\u201d said Maria Schiff, one of the study\u2019s researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s really the states that have expanded that would experience a different type of savings open to them for the first time under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin chose not to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which would have increased who was eligible. Fallin said expanding the program, a key element of the Affordable Care Act, would be too costly for the state.\n\nEditor's note: You can read the Pew study in its entirety below.\n\nState Prison Healthcare Spending Report", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study released Tuesday shows Oklahoma spends less per-inmate on medical costs, however, the study also showed how the state\u2019s increasing population of older inmates and the state\u2019s option to not expand Medicaid could lead to increased medical costs in the future.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
