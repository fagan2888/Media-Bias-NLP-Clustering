But considering our country\u2019s near-400-year history, can we honestly say that our concepts and perceptions about God haven\u2019t evolved?\n\nIs our contemporary American God the same as in 1629, when the Puritans began organizing a mass exodus toward their \u201cPromised Land\u201d?\n\nIs our modern God the same as in 1801, when Christians at a revival in Kentucky became so filled up with God\u2019s spirit that they got down on all-fours and barked and howled like wild dogs?\n\nMore recently, is our God the same as in 2000, when born again George W. Bush won (sort of) the presidential election by rallying America\u2019s then thriving evangelical electorate with a Jesus-tinged GOP rhetoric he called \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d?\n\nThe truth is, no. God is likely not exactly the same as God was yesterday, not here in the United States, not among America\u2019s faithful. Here, God changes.\n\nOur making God into our own image isn\u2019t a new trend. We\u2019ve been changing God since Anglo Saxons first stepped foot onto these shores. Here are five examples.\n\n1. The Puritans\u2019delusions.\n\nEven before leaving England, the Puritans started reimagining God\u2019s divine plan. And it just so happened that plan revolved around them.\n\nGiving God\u2019s narrative a Puritan focus may have been the only way that John Cotton, a priest in the Church of England and a somewhat closeted Puritan, was able to convince his fellow renegades that starting afresh in Boston was a good idea.\n\nDespite the Puritans being disgusted, stifled and persecuted by England\u2019s church, the majority of them weren\u2019t all that excited at the thought of joining John Winthrop\u2019s adventure to the New World.\n\nThat is, until Cotton refashioned Winthrop\u2019s crazy idea for the Puritans into God\u2019s ordained destiny for his new chosen people.\n\nIn a sermon called \u201cGod\u2019s Promise To His Plantation,\u201d Cotton used Old Testament story, imagery and prophesy and created a God narrative that put the Puritans squarely in the middle of heaven\u2019s divine blueprint.\n\nAccording to Cotton, God had not only prepared a place (America!) for his new people (the Puritans!), but God also was betting his entire future on the Puritan people becoming a religious, economic and social success in the New World.\n\nNo doubt Cotton\u2019s holy foretelling was, at the very least, inspiration for Winthrop when he repurposed Jesus\u2019 words as the unofficial Puritan tagline: \u201cWe shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.\u201d\n\nThe Puritans arrived in Boston intoxicated by Manifest Destiny: the idea that God had chosen them and ordained their prosperity before the foundations of the Earth.\n\n2. God creates evangelicals.\n\nWithin two generations, the American people - including many Puritans - had lost a good bit of their piety, which sparked revivalists to inspire a spiritual revival.\n\nOne of the biggest influences of the Great Awakening was how God altered the way he interacted with America\u2019s people.\n\nRather than engaging humanity through communal covenants\u2014holy connections usually reserved for large groups \u2014according to the Anglican evangelist George Whitefield, God was now interested in making personal relationships with individuals.\n\nThough Americans were a century or two away from asking Jesus into their hearts, Whitefield and others began preaching that God was ready and willing to bypass the church and interact with people one on one.\n\nWhitefield became so popular\u2014some historians suggest 80% of America\u2019s population heard him preach\u2014that his core message, one centering around a spiritual relationship that he called \u201cnew birth,\u201d became popular, too, especially among Baptists and Presbyterians.\n\nHis revivals spearheaded a shift in how Americans would interact with the God of the universe, that the spiritual drama was happening inside us.\n\nMoreover, Whitefield\u2019s evangelical message of liberty\u2014a spiritual liberty that many Americans equated to also mean a national liberty\u2014became a unifying ideal that helped ready a much divided colonial population into becoming \u201cone nation under God.\u201d\n\n3. America falls in love with Jesus.\n\nAmid America\u2019s campaign for independence, people began gravitating toward more evangelical churches, like Baptist and Methodist.\n\nThese congregations boasted a more laid-back approach to worship and faith as opposed to the stuffy religiosity of Congregational and Anglican gatherings.\n\nThen, in 1801, that rather strange spiritual gathering of more than 20,000 happened in Cane Ridge, Kentucky, a revival that sparked, among many things, a spiritual revolt against Calvinism\u2019s God.\n\nIn America, with the help of preachers like Charles Grandison Finney, Peter Cartwright and Barton Stone, the God that the people favored was one who let individuals choose their own spiritual destiny.\n\nAs Methodists and Baptists led America away from the reformed doctrine, they also directed worshipers\u2019 focus away from God the Father and toward Jesus, eventually making God\u2019s only son the \u201cface\u201d of Christian spirituality.\n\nWhile America\u2019s followers had always believed that Jesus paid the price for their sins, Jesus wasn\u2019t the core topic of discussion, at least, nowhere close to how Christians uplift, debate, and theologize Jesus today.\n\nIn the early 1800s, Jesus was much easier to relate to among everyday Americans. Jesus seemed to offer a more practical spirituality, one that celebrated Jesus\u2019 humanity\u2014his \u201cmanliness,\u201d his suffering, his flesh and blood, his father/son relationship with God, his ability to understand the human plight.\n\nThe simpler approach to Christianity that Methodists and Baptists offered would eventually be tested by the nation\u2019s debate over slavery, a conflict that divided America\u2019s churches long before it divided a nation.\n\n4. America\u2019s apocalyptic obsession\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, America\u2019s Jesus-focused Christianity led to John Nelson Darby\u2019s apocalyptic-heavy theology, dispensationalism.\n\nDarby\u2019s thoughts about the End Times only garnered moderate attention in his home country of England. But here, thanks to Darby apologists like James Brookes, D.L. Moody and Cyrus I. Scofield, America fell in love with his Rapture-ready Jesus.\n\nDispensationalism changed everything about America\u2019s faith, specifically how evangelicals applied their beliefs to a variety of areas of life, including supporting Prohibition, war, fighting against the teaching of evolution, and Christianizing new immigrants as well as other nations.\n\nAmong evangelicals, dispensationalism also cultivated a culture of fear, defensiveness and carelessness about helping a \u201cdoomed world.\u201d\n\n5. The Billy Graham effect\n\nAs the country sought healing after World War II, Americans began searching for hope in the God-smorgasbord that Christianity had laid out, from Bible-believing fundamentalism to Holy Ghost-inspired Pentecostalism, from education-minded Roman Catholicism to progressive-leaning high church spiritualism.\n\nOne man seemed capable of connecting across church and denominational lines: Billy Graham.\n\nUnrestrained by the limitations of a home church, Graham\u2019s God evolved into a deity that a variety of Americans wanted to know. Graham\u2019s God wooed conservative and charismatic believers alike, and didn\u2019t offend most Catholic and Episcopalian believers.\n\nAmid the large and varied buffet, Graham\u2019s God was like a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich, a divine brand delivered using books, television, radio, magazine publishing and live events.\n\nIn many ways, Graham was the first to unleash the power of GOD\u00ae. And that changed everything.\n\nToday, most Christians can\u2019t distinguish between God and GOD\u00ae, which has made America\u2019s deity into a superpower, an almighty deity that can be mixed with just about anything, from enterprise to politics, from hate campaigns to promises of prosperity.\n\nHere in America, God is constantly changing. It\u2019s a divine story that we edit and manipulate\u2014sometimes innocently and sometimes intentionally\u2014into our own narratives.\n\nWe create a most powerful God who serves our own agendas, whether they be cities built on hills or presidential elections.\n\nMatthew Paul Turner is the author of \"Our Great Big American God: A Short History of Our Ever-Growing Deity.\" The views expressed in this column belong to Turner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinion by\u00a0Matthew Paul Turner, special to CNN (CNN) \u2013\u00a0The majority of America\u2019s churches teach that God is the same yesterday, today and forever.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "5 ways America changed God", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/06/5-ways-america-changed-god/", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/belief.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Opinion by\u00a0Matthew Paul Turner, special to CNN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) \u2013\u00a0The majority of America\u2019s churches teach that God is the same yesterday, today and forever.", "title": "5 ways America changed God"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "belief, billy graham, christianity, end times, evangelicals, faith, history, jesus, opinion, protestant, apocalypse, billy graham, christianity, evangelicals, god, jesus, rapture", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/06/5-ways-america-changed-god/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30fe\"", "article_summary": "Here in America, God is constantly changing.\nGod is likely not exactly the same as God was yesterday, not here in the United States, not among America\u2019s faithful.\nThat is, until Cotton refashioned Winthrop\u2019s crazy idea for the Puritans into God\u2019s ordained destiny for his new chosen people.\nUnrestrained by the limitations of a home church, Graham\u2019s God evolved into a deity that a variety of Americans wanted to know.\nIs our contemporary American God the same as in 1629, when the Puritans began organizing a mass exodus toward their \u201cPromised Land\u201d?"}
