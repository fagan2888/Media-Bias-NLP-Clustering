Nannerl, many reviews say, actually played better music, The Huffington Post reported.\n\n\u201cTwo centuries after her brother's death, Nannerl is a mere footnote in Mozart's history,\u201d The Huffington Post reported. \u201cAs a biographical fact of his early years, she is easily forgotten as a sibling he happened to have.\u201d\n\nNannerl\u2019s decision to stay home was also due to the Mozart family\u2019s financial standings, according to the play\u2019s producer, Sylvia Milos, who spoke to The Huffington Post. Despite the common perception that the Mozarts were well off since Wolfgang\u2019s attire was so fashionable and high class, the family actual had tough financial struggles, which disallowed Nannerl from traveling to play music.\n\n\u201cThey were in a middle class position,\u201d Milos told The Huffington Post. \u201cThey borrowed a lot to go on those tours. They risked everything trying to promote Mozart, so they could be lifted up by him. The decisions that Leopold made were absolutely logical. They made sense for the survival of the family.\u201d\n\nSo, to help his family put food on the table, Mozart continued his tours alone \u2014 leading to the eventual success he garnered as an adult, The Huffington Post reported.\n\nMilos said that many of Wolfgang\u2019s compositions may have been Nannerl's, since the two got along well and shared a lot of the same habits when making music, The Huffington Post reported.\n\nFor the famous Mozart, having a sister gave him excellent music and a reason to tour the world and make a living for his family. But that relationship is only one example of the benefits of having a sister.\n\nIn fact, research has found that having a sister has many benefits. A 2010 study published in the Journal of Family Psychology found that sisters make their siblings kinder and more giving, according to ABC News.\n\nSpecifically, the study, done by researchers at Brigham Young University\u2019s School of Family Life, found that youngsters who have a sister are less likely to feel lonely, guilty or fearful, ABC News reported.\n\n\"Just having a sister led to less depression,\" lead researcher Laura Padilla-Walker told ABC News. \"Sibling affection from either gender was related to less delinquency and more pro-social behaviors like greater kindness and generosity, volunteering and helping others.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in 2009, a study of 571 families by the De Montfort University and the University of Ulster found \u201cyoung people who had grown up with at least one sister tended to be happier and more optimistic,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nThis is mostly because sisters are more likely to talk to their siblings about their issues, the Times reported, as women and girls often do. The researchers noted that boys tend to be silent on their emotional issues, the Times reported.\n\n\u201cSo the key to why having sisters makes people happier \u2014 men as well as women \u2014 may lie not in the kind of talk they exchange but in the fact of talk,\u201d according to the Times. \u201cIf men, like women, talk more often to their sisters than to their brothers, that could explain why sisters make them happier.\u201d\n\nOf course sisters aren\u2019t exactly perfect, either. The Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan wrote that her experiences with her own sister sometimes created a rivalry between them.\n\nSibling rivalries can hurt children from a young age. In fact, two English sisters, Ursula and Louisa, wrote for the Daily Mail last year that sibling rivalry created intense jealousy and anger, severing their relationship and making it hard for them to connect as adults.\n\n\u201cShe has her own scars too and, like me, she still struggles with depression and feelings of inadequacy caused by the chasm that opened up when I arrived, and the terrible, pernicious rivalry that was actively encouraged and fueled by our parents,\u201d Ursula wrote for the Daily Mail.\n\nIn fact, a 2013 study published in Pediatrics found that some sibling rivalries become so intense that children feel victimized or even bullied by their siblings, according to The Star-Ledger. These rivalries can then create mental health issues for children.\n\n\"The possible importance of sibling aggression for children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 mental health should not be dismissed,\" the study\u2019s authors wrote, according to The Star-Ledger. \u201dThe mobilization to prevent and stop peer victimization and bullying should expand to encompass sibling aggression as well.\"\n\nDespite these issues, sisters have proven to not only make siblings healthier and happier, but also to be best friends, as Lexi Herrick wrote for The Huffington Post.\n\nAmong the many reasons sisters are great best friends, Herrick wrote sisters often create a strong bond with their siblings and help them through the darkest times.\n\n\u201cShe's constantly there to guide you, be honest with you, and hold you tightly through all of the ever-changing phases of your lives,\u201d Herrick wrote. \u201cA best friend is the other half of your heart. That isn't the case with sisters. This is because you are one heart.\u201d\n\nFor more on siblings:\n\n8 benefits of having a sibling\n\nThe NBA\u2019s favorite daughter now has a sister\n\nIn the shadow: What life is like having a famous sibling\n\nHerb Scribner is a writer for Deseret News National.
