As pediatricians, we have become all too familiar with treating kids who have accidentally eaten marijuana.

Two 8-year-old kids grabbed marijuana cookies off the counter and required intensive care. A 15-month-old toddler found marijuana gummy bears in her mother’s purse and needed to be hospitalized. A 2-week-old baby was drinking marijuana from breast milk, resulting in failure to grow and develop normally.

As the marijuana industry continues to expand, it is important that our communities and families benefit as much as the companies. This is why voting “yes” on proposition BB is critical. Money generated from marijuana taxes needs to go to education, mentor services, poison control, and substance abuse programs. Bottom line: money spent this way helps avoid medical emergencies like those above.

Voting “yes” on Proposition BB is voting to protect our kids.
