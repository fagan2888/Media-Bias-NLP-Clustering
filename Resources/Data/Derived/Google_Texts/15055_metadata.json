All increase the risk of contact that could infect isolated people with diseases to which they have no natural resistance, said Beatriz Huertas, a Peruvian anthropologist who has studied Peru\u2019s isolated groups extensively and wrote the report recommending the protected corridor.\n\nIsolated groups tend to remain near the headwaters of rivers during the rainy season, but in April or May, as floodwaters recede, they move downstream in search of turtle eggs and other resources, Huertas said.\n\nOver the past year, there have been several reports of groups entering communities along the upper Madre de Dios and the Las Piedras rivers in southeastern Peru and taking metal objects, especially machetes, axes and pots.\n\nIn 2011, Shaco Flores, a Matsigenka man in the community of Diamante, also near Manu National Park, was killed by an arrow fired by a member of a group of Mashco Piro near the community of Diamante, also near Manu National Park. Flores had allowed Mashco Piro to take crops from his field and had been trying to establish closer contact with them, according to anthropologist Glenn Shepard, who knew him.\n\nThe nomadic groups trace their history back at least a century, to the rubber boom in the Peruvian Amazon, when rubber barons enslaved indigenous people. Some fled into the forest and have shunned contact since then.\n\nBut oil and gas production, gold mining, logging, drug trafficking, adventure tourism and Protestant and Catholic missionaries continue to put pressure on the groups.\n\nMashco Piro people have lived in the area around Shipetiari since before the community was established, according to a report by the Federation of Native Communities of the Madre de Dios River and its Tributaries (Fenamad, for its Spanish initials).\n\nMembers of a Mashco Piro group had also entered Shipetiari in October 2014 and February 2015, encounters that resulted in \u201cproperty damage\u201d but no personal injuries, the Fenamad statement said.\n\n\u201cIf isolated people appear in an area, it is better for the villagers to move out of that area,\u201d Huertas said.\n\nThe residents of Shipetiari, whose houses are distant from one another, have said they would not relocate, however, and have asked for a perimeter fence, according to Fenamad.\n\nThe incursions into Shipetiari and into Monte Salvado, on the Las Piedras River, should encourage the government to step up monitoring of the way isolated groups use their territories\u2014without contacting them\u2014 and set up guard posts to protect them from outsiders who could carry diseases to which they have no natural resistance, according to Huertas.\n\n\u201cThe government has taken some steps,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real appreciation of the scope of the problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Peru\u2019s largest indigenous organization has proposed creating a corridor to protect isolated groups from outside pressures following a murder.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/12/murder-raises-concerns-protecting-nomadic-and-settled-indigenous-peru-160329", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/ministry_of_culture_warning_signs_-_barbara_fraser.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Murder Raises Concerns of Protecting Nomadic and Settled Indigenous in Peru"}, "abstract": "Peru\u2019s largest indigenous organization has proposed creating a corridor to protect isolated groups from outside pressures following a murder.", "keywords": "Leonardo P\u00e9rez, Mashco Piro, Matsigenka Community, Manu National Park, Peruvian Ministry of Culture, Patricia Balbuena, Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest, AIDESEP, Beatriz Huertas, Isolated People, Uncontacted People, Shaco Flores, Federation of Native Communities of the Madre de Dios River and its Tributaries, Fenamad, Barbara Fraser", "dc": {"title": "Murder Raises Concerns of Protecting Nomadic and Settled Indigenous in Peru"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/12/murder-raises-concerns-protecting-nomadic-and-settled-indigenous-peru-160329", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-12T10:07-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Murder Raises Concerns of Protecting Nomadic and Settled Indigenous in Peru"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca169\"", "article_summary": "Just days after a young Matsigenka man was killed by a member of a nomadic tribe, Peru\u2019s largest indigenous organization proposed creating a corridor to protect such isolated groups outside pressures.\nMembers of a Mashco Piro group had also entered Shipetiari in October 2014 and February 2015, encounters that resulted in \u201cproperty damage\u201d but no personal injuries, the Fenamad statement said.\nThe nomadic groups trace their history back at least a century, to the rubber boom in the Peruvian Amazon, when rubber barons enslaved indigenous people.\nFlores had allowed Mashco Piro to take crops from his field and had been trying to establish closer contact with them, according to anthropologist Glenn Shepard, who knew him.\n\u201cThe government has taken some steps,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real appreciation of the scope of the problem.\u201d"}
