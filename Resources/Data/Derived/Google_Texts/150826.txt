Patrick Roy isn’t handing out veteran favors to Jarome Iginla. At least not Sunday after the Avalanche’s ugly loss to Anaheim at home — in which the Ducks ran right over Colorado in the second period.

With the game tied 2-2, Anaheim’s Cam Fowler corralled the puck on the left boards and he made a move toward the front of the net. At first, he hesitated — because there’s no way he should be allowed to skate so freely near a team’s goal. But Fowler, almost surprised by the lack of defense, cruised right in for the game-winner.

He skated right through the circle with three Avs defenders nearby, including veteran forward Jarome Iginla.

“On that third goal, we were just lost,” Roy said. “Jarome lost his position, lost his D. And it was an easy walk-in for Fowler.”

It wasn’t exactly a tongue-lashing from Roy. And Colorado’s coach didn’t put the whole loss on Iginla — it was an ugly second period top-to-bottom for the Avs, in which they got off just two(!) shots, including one from just inside the red line by Dennis Everberg with seconds left.

But Iginla’s name was the only one mentioned by Roy in describing Fowler’s game-winner.

Speaking on the Avs’ loss and the rough second period, Matt Duchene said:

“It’s tough to put a finger on what happened.”

Here’s the Fowler goal:
