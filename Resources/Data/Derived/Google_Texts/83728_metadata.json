(AP) - A YouTube video has transformed a laid-back deer named Sugar Bob that lives on the grounds of the Applegate River Lodge into a late-night television star.\n\nAnd like a true diva, Sugar Bob declines to stoop to the level of actually interacting with the media. Instead, the former forest denizen leaves that distasteful chore to Richard Davis, who co-owns the lodge with his wife, Joanna.\n\nIn fact, when Davis handed the phone to Sugar Bob to talk to a reporter recently, there was nothing but silence, which forced Davis to take back the receiver and handle the interview.\n\nSugar Bob and Davis stole the show Wednesday night on the satirical \u201cDaily Show\u201d program, which is hosted by Jon Stewart and airs on the Comedy Central network.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re from New York. They kind of think of Oregon as this crazy state of nothing but pot smokers,\u201d Davis said.\n\nIn all fairness to Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj, who traveled with a film crew to Applegate, Sugar Bob does consume cannabis, and Davis is an open proponent of medical marijuana.\n\nWith that backdrop, the segment featuring Sugar Bob and Davis was titled \u201cSugar High\u201d and aired as a tongue-in-cheek counterpoint to several anti-marijuana segments by Fox News, which were aired to open the short piece.\n\nMinhaj, who Davis described as a nice young man, satirically tried to portray Davis as a drug kingpin.\n\nFor instance, there\u2019s a shot of a heading on a sheet of paper titled Richard \u201cPa Butt\u201d Davis and his connection to medical marijuana\n\nIn the Comedy Central piece, Minhaj also compares Davis to Pablo Escobar, the notorious Colombia drug lord, and draws parallels to the movie \u201cScarface,\u201d starring Al Pacino as a drug kingpin.\n\nA smiling Davis responds by calmly stating he doesn\u2019t deal with drugs, he deals with medicine.\n\nIn another scene, Minhaj refers to Davis\u2019 vicious guard dog, which happens to be a gentle, slow-moving, 14-year-old beagle named Trooper D (the D is short for Davis).\n\n\u201cI love him. He\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Davis said of Trooper.\n\nOther comical scenes included Minhaj interviewing two veterinarians in an effort to prove Sugar Bob has been irreversibly harmed by his pot intake.\n\nInstead, veterinarians Sarah Brandon and Greg Copas said they didn\u2019t see any harm in the deer eating pot and commented on the amount of protein and minerals in marijuana leaves. Full disclosure: The two veterinarians operate a clinic in Washington state called Canna Companion, which advocates pot use for pets.\n\nMinhaj proved a perfect foil for Davis\u2019 subtle humor.\n\nIsn\u2019t weed ruining the great state of Oregon, Minhaj wondered? Davis said rather than a destructive influence, he thinks of it as a solution.\n\nAs a drug kingpin rolling in money, what comes next for Davis, Minhaj asked.\n\n\u201cPower,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThen what, the Daily Show correspondent asked.\n\n\u201cWomen,\u201d Davis said.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to ascertain Sugar Bob\u2019s back story because he won\u2019t talk, but we do know he \u201cmysteriously\u201d showed up at the lodge one day, and it\u2019s clear he enjoys munching marijuana leaves.\n\nThis is the second time in eight months the lodge has been featured on national television. In August, it was featured on the program \u201cHotel Hell,\u201d hosted by bombastic chef Gordon Ramsay.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of film crews out at the lodge,\u201d Davis said. \u201cEverything we do out here is a lot of fun.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Courier, http://www.thedailycourier.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A YouTube video has transformed a laid-back deer named Sugar Bob that lives on the grounds of the Applegate River Lodge into a late-night television star.", "Author": "JIM MOORE", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/28/daily-show-segment-features-pot-eating-oregon-deer/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A YouTube video has transformed a laid-back deer named Sugar Bob that lives on the grounds of the Applegate River Lodge into a late-night television star.", "title": "\u2018Daily Show\u2019 segment features pot-eating Oregon deer"}, "twitter": {"title": "\u2018Daily Show\u2019 segment features pot-eating Oregon deer", "description": "A YouTube video has transformed a laid-back deer named Sugar Bob that lives on the grounds of the Applegate River Lodge into a late-night television star.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8763\"", "article_summary": "And like a true diva, Sugar Bob declines to stoop to the level of actually interacting with the media.\n\u201cWe have a lot of film crews out at the lodge,\u201d Davis said.\nSugar Bob and Davis stole the show Wednesday night on the satirical \u201cDaily Show\u201d program, which is hosted by Jon Stewart and airs on the Comedy Central network.\nRUCH, Ore.
