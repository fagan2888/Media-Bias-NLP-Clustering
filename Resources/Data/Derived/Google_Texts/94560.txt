It is likely someone you know suffers from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, debilitating digestive diseases also known as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These diseases affect 1.6 million Americans, including 80,000 children.

One such child is Josh Berendt, 11, of Palatine, who was diagnosed at age 9 with indeterminate colitis.

Josh will be recognized as the Honored Hero on Sunday, May 31, when the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America holds a Take Steps for Crohn's and Colitis walk in Naperville. Take Steps is CCFA's largest fundraising event, having touched more than 240,000 people and raised nearly $60 million to help further the foundation's mission.

"The Honored Hero is someone we recognize at each walk as someone who has the disease but also a participant of the walk," said Heidi Merritt, walk director for CCFA.

Another participant in this year's walk is Adina Walters of Cary. Walters struggled with pain for years before an insightful doctor diagnosed her with Crohn's disease.

Adina and Josh share their stories win the hopes of raising awareness about IBD and inspiring readers to participate in the Take Steps walks or donate to CCFA.
