And we have five of our seven treaty alliances are in the Pacific region. We're very committed to that region,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKirby also pointed out that Defense Secretaryjust returned from his sixth trip to the region and plans to make four visits this year. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work will travel to the region next week, Kirby added.\n\nThe pivot, or rebalance, of U.S. military forces away from Europe and the Middle East toward the Pacific has been a major strategic goal for the Obama administration. The move is widely viewed as a means to counter China\u2019s rapidly expanding military and a belligerent North Korea.\n\nHowever, U.S. military operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and Russia\u2019s aggressive behavior toward Ukraine have overshadowed the effort.\n\nOn Thursday, Kirby said the DOD would not \u201ctake our eye off the ball of the rest of the world.\"\n\n\u201cWe know we have security commitments around the world in the Middle East, in Africa, in Europe, and we continue to work mightily on those commitments. And there's been no slackening in that regard,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, Kirby warned, if sequestration \u201cremains the law of the land, it's going to be harder and harder\" for the U.S. to live up to its security obligations.\n\n\u201cThe defense strategy that we put forward, which allows us to conduct this rebalance and still focus on those parts of the world, will be put in jeopardy,\u201d Kirby said.\n\nHis comments came the same day as reports that North Korea fired three short-range rockets off its east coast, possibly to distract attention from Pope Francis's visit to the South Korean capital of Seoul.\n\n\u201cThe pope worries about a higher authority than Kim Jong Un,\u201d Kirby joked in reference to North Korea\u2019s leader.\n\nHe said it would be an \"exercise in futility\" to attempt to figure out the reclusive regime's intentions.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"We're very committed to that region,\u201d Rear Adm.
