(Of course, I was the female president. But that\u2019s a different story.)\n\nI\u2019m not so sure about Hillary.\n\nWomen\u2019s issues are really at the forefront of this election, with conservative men (and scarily, women) throwing around plenty of rhetoric about controlling our reproductive and family planning decisions.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s the issue of equal pay, and the strange fact that we\u2019re the only developed country on the planet that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid leave for moms with new babies.\n\nIt definitely is an important election.\n\nBut I\u2019m not so convinced electing a woman is guaranteed to get us these things.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to look at the issues a little closer than we have been.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to dig a little deeper.\n\nThe more I learn about Bernie, the more I realize he\u2019s the better choice.\n\nHere are three reasons why:\n\n1. Equal And Higher Pay\n\nBernie is fighting for equal pay for women, as is Hillary.\n\nBut here\u2019s where Bernie goes further: He is fighting for higher pay for all Americans.\n\nWhile equal pay is super important, it\u2019s not enough if equal pay is still keeping plenty of American women or families in poverty.\n\nBernie proposes a living wage of $15 an hour by 2020.\n\nThis helps all women achieve equality and better pay overall.\n\n2. Universal Healthcare\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act took care of a few of the issues regarding our nation\u2019s healthcare crises, there are still 33 million Americans who don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nBernie\u2019s plan of universal health coverage is a Medicare for all, single-payer system that takes the private companies out of the equation and lets everyone have healthcare.\n\nFinally.\n\nThis is so crucial for women, who have, on average, higher healthcare costs than men.\n\nHillary\u2019s plan is to keep the private companies involved, which has been expensive and sometimes hard to obtain, especially for young women and single moms.\n\nHere are Hillary\u2019s plans and Bernie\u2019s plans, for comparison.\n\n3. Paid Maternity Leave\n\nAlthough Hillary has been talking about it more in the past month (last year, she said she didn\u2019t think it was possible), Bernie has a set plan for paid maternity leave for moms.\n\nHe plans to fight for three months of paid leave, which is awesome.\n\nEvery mom should be able to stay at home if she chooses, without having to rush back to work in fear of losing her job.\n\nOverall, Bernie is not only a better choice for women, but a much better choice for Americans in general.\n\nPlus, more women are now contributing to his campaign than they are to Hillary\u2019s.\n\n#FeelTheBern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie takes it a step further.", "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "description": "Bernie takes it a step further.", "title": "3 Reasons Bernie Might Be A Better Advocate For Women Than Hillary", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/11/03140056/cD1iMGZkY2U2ZWY3ZDc2ZTJiOGY3NGRkM2M5MGNlMGNkNyZnPTM0ZWE2MWM4NmQwYjFmMTFjZDFhMGVlM2M5N2ZiNDA1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-04T18:02:03+00:00", "url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton/1300527/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Elite Daily", "description": "Bernie takes it a step further.", "title": "3 Reasons Bernie Might Be A Better Advocate For Women Than Hillary", "image": {"src": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/11/03140056/cD1iMGZkY2U2ZWY3ZDc2ZTJiOGY3NGRkM2M5MGNlMGNkNyZnPTM0ZWE2MWM4NmQwYjFmMTFjZDFhMGVlM2M5N2ZiNDA1.jpg"}, "creator": "@a_lynneadams", "site": "@EliteDaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton/1300527/"}, "ios": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton/1300527/", "app_store_id": 1032458504, "app_name": "Elite Daily"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 378366428966386}, "keywords": "bernie,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily", "published_time": "2015-12-04T18:00:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sraeynoillim", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T18:02:03+00:00", "tag": "2016 election,bernie,Bernie Sanders,Election,healthcare,hillary clinton,vote"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.elitestatic.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/apple_favicon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "bernie,"}, "article_summary": "While equal pay is super important, it\u2019s not enough if equal pay is still keeping plenty of American women or families in poverty.\nOverall, Bernie is not only a better choice for women, but a much better choice for Americans in general.\nEqual And Higher PayBernie is fighting for equal pay for women, as is Hillary.\nThis helps all women achieve equality and better pay overall.\nHe plans to fight for three months of paid leave, which is awesome."}
