Even though Murdoch occupies a uniquely powerful position in Republican politics, though, we\u2019re going to guess that his advocacy won\u2019t work now, just as it hasn\u2019t worked throughout the year-plus-long push. But hey, a feisty billionaire\u2019s gotta try, right?\n\nThe main reason CIR now really isn\u2019t likely to go forward, as Murdoch notes, is the primary defeat of House majority leader Eric Cantor. The legislative prospects for CIR were already mostly dead before Cantor\u2019s loss, but afterward, they\u2019re dead and buried. \u201cLike others who want comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Murdoch writes, \u201cI worried that Mr. Cantor\u2019s loss would be misconstrued and make Congress reluctant to tackle this urgent need. That would be the wrong lesson and an undesirable national consequence of this single, local election result.\u201d He\u2019s right! That would be both the wrong lesson, as well as exactly what\u2019s going to happen. As Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Renee Ellmers have shown, if you run a smart campaign, you can be both pro-CIR and withstand a primary challenge. But all it takes is one big upset to scare the crap out of everyone and freeze legislative action for years, so here we are.\n\nMurdoch is savvy enough to know that there isn\u2019t enough pressure he personally can apply to help push CIR through. And since he\u2019s a Republican more than he\u2019s an immigration reform advocate, he\u2019s also trying to push the blame to Democrats\u2019 doorstep for when the effort is officially dropped. And so, surrounding all the happy and ineffectual talk about how immigrants make America great!, he tosses in this bold claim (emphasis ours):\n\nNext, we need to do away with the cap on H-1B visas, which is arbitrary and results in U.S. companies struggling to find the high-skill workers they need to continue growing. We already know that most of the applications for these visas are for computer programmers and engineers, where there is a shortage of qualified American candidates. But we are held back by the objections of the richly funded labor unions that mistakenly believe that if we keep innovation out of America, somehow nothing will change. They are wrong, and frankly as much to blame for our stalemate on this issue as nativists who scream about amnesty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pro-immigration Republican billionaire writes that unions are behind the CIR \"stalemate.\" That's plain wrong", "author": "Jim Newell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The pro-immigration Republican billionaire writes that unions are behind the CIR \"stalemate.\" That's plain wrong", "title": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s delusion: It\u2019s not labor\u2019s fault that immigration reform is dying", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/19/rupert_murdochs_delusion_its_not_labors_fault_that_immigration_reform_is_dying/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/rupert_murdoch4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The pro-immigration Republican billionaire writes that unions are behind the CIR \"stalemate.\" That's plain wrong", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/rupert_murdoch4.jpg", "title": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s delusion: It\u2019s not labor\u2019s fault that immigration reform is dying", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s delusion: It\u2019s not labor\u2019s fault that immigration reform is dying", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AFL-CIO, chamber of commerce, columnists, Editor's Picks, Immigration, Immigration Reform, Labor, Media Criticism, Richard Trumka, Rupert Murdoch, Unions, Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfaa8\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AFL-CIO, chamber of commerce, columnists, Editor's Picks, Immigration, Immigration Reform, Labor, Media Criticism, Richard Trumka, Rupert Murdoch, Unions, Wall Street Journal, Media News, Politics NewsConservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch has taken to the pages of one of his papers, the Wall Street Journal, to plead \u2014 nay, beg \u2014 for comprehensive immigration reform.\n\u201cLike others who want comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Murdoch writes, \u201cI worried that Mr. Cantor\u2019s loss would be misconstrued and make Congress reluctant to tackle this urgent need.\nAnd since he\u2019s a Republican more than he\u2019s an immigration reform advocate, he\u2019s also trying to push the blame to Democrats\u2019 doorstep for when the effort is officially dropped.\nMurdoch is savvy enough to know that there isn\u2019t enough pressure he personally can apply to help push CIR through.\nThey are wrong, and frankly as much to blame for our stalemate on this issue as nativists who scream about amnesty."}
