By using the protocol, several state departments will work together with 211 to make sure the residents who need to get out of the cold are ensured shelter this weekend.\n\nCameron said with these extreme temperatures Connecticut residents should use common sense. He had these following helpful tips for dealing with this wicked weather:\n\nDressing in layers in a way you will stay dry\n\nCovering every single square inch of skin if you plan on being outside for more than a minute\n\nLimiting \"outside time\" for pets to just essential \"pet functions,\"\n\nMandating kids play inside\n\nMaking sure your carbon monoxide detector is working; with the house closed up tight and with heating at a maximum, there could be a danger of CO build-up.\n\nCameron said to ensuring pipes don't freeze, he said residents should make sure the basement is warm.\n\n\"Open bathroom vanity and kitchen sink cabinet doors so that the plumbing gets more exposure to warm air. If you have a lot of plumbing in exterior walls, you may want to let your taps trickle moderately warm water,\" Cameron said.\n\nTo read the complete technical discussion, click here.\n\nFor weather updates and alerts on smartphones and tablets, click here or text \"weather\" to 38324 to download the WFSB app.\n\nCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
