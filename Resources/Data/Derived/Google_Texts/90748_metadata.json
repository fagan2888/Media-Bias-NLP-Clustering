In the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, approval of the GOP has fallen to 24 percent.\n\nIn the campaign to persuade America of their Big Lie \u2014 that the House Republicans shut down the government \u2014 the White House and its media chorus appear to have won this round.\n\nYet, the truth is the Republicans\u2019 House has voted three times to keep open and to fund every agency, department and program of the U.S. government, except for Obamacare.\n\nAnd they voted to kill that monstrosity but once.\n\nRepublicans should refuse to raise the white flag and insist on an honorable avenue of retreat.\n\nAnd if Harry Reid\u2019s Senate demands the GOP end the sequester on federal spending, or be blamed for a debt default, the party should, Samson-like, bring down the roof of the temple on everybody\u2019s head.\n\nThis is an honorable battle lost, not a war.\n\nWhy, after all, did Republicans stand up? Because they believe Obamacare is an abomination, a new entitlement program this nation, lurching toward bankruptcy, cannot afford.\n\nIt is imposing increases in health care premiums on millions of Americans, disrupting doctor-patient relationships and forcing businesses to cut workers back to 29 hours a week. Even Democratic Sen. Max Baucus has predicted a coming \u201ctrain wreck.\u201d\n\nNow if the Republican Party believes this, what choice did the House have except to fight to defund or postpone it, against all odds, and tune out the whining of the \u201cWe-can\u2019t-win!\u201d Republican establishment?\n\nAnd if Republicans are paralyzed by polls produced by this three-week skirmish, they should reread the history of the party and the movement to which they profess to belong.\n\nIn the early 1960s, when the postwar right rose to challenge JFK with Mr. Conservative, events and actions conspired to put Barry Goldwater in the worst hole of a Republican nominee in history.\n\nKennedy was murdered in Dallas one year before the election. Goldwater had glibly hinted he would privatize Social Security, sell the Tennessee Valley Authority and \u201clob one into the men\u2019s room at the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nAfter his defeat of Nelson Rockefeller in the California primary assured his nomination, Goldwater was 59 points behind LBJ \u2014 77-18.\n\nThe Republican liberals \u2014 Govs. Rockefeller, George Romney and William Scranton \u2014 to the cheers of the Washington press, began to attack Goldwater for \u201cextremism\u201d and failing to vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nAt the Cow Palace convention, liberals demanded Goldwater rewrite the platform to equate The John Birch Society with the Communist Party USA and the Ku Klux Klan, which had murdered four black girls at a Birmingham church in 1963 and three civil rights workers in Neshoba County, Miss., that same summer.\n\nGoldwater rejected this stinking outrage, declaring, \u201cExtremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.\u201d And, so, the liberals all abandoned him.\n\nOne man stood by Goldwater. The two-time loser Richard Nixon, who had not won a race in his own right since 1950, campaigned for Goldwater and the party longer and harder than Barry himself.\n\nAnd what became of them all?\n\nBill Scranton packed it in 1966. George Romney was trounced in 1968 by Nixon, with Goldwater\u2019s legions at his side, in New Hampshire, and quit the race two weeks before the returns came in.\n\nRockefeller, who had spent a career calling Nixon a \u201closer,\u201d lacked what it took to challenge Nixon in any of the contested primaries.\n\nAnd, lest we forget, one other national Republican spoke up for Goldwater and conservatism in that 1964 humiliation, the retired Hollywood actor and impresario of GE Theater: Ronald Reagan.\n\nNixon and Reagan would go on to win four of the next five GOP nominations and presidential elections. In the one convention Reagan lost, 1976, the right, as the price of its support of Gerald R. Ford, demanded that Nelson Rockefeller be dumped as vice president.\n\nDone. Rocky was last seen flipping a middle finger to the delegates happily marking \u201cpaid\u201d on his account.\n\nPrediction: The people who fought the battle of Obamacare will be proven right to have fought it, and America will come to see this.\n\nAnd the people who said, \u201cWe can\u2019t win!\u201d will never win.\n\nAmerica is at a turning point.\n\nIf she does not stop squandering hundreds of billions on liberal agenda items like Obamacare and if she do not end these trade deficits sucking the jobs, factories and investment capital out of our country, we will find ourselves beside Greece, Spain, Illinois and Detroit.\n\nEven if America disagrees, as in 1964 when it embraced LBJ\u2019s Great Society plunge to social and economic disaster, Republicans need to stand up \u2014 current polls and corporate Republicans be damned.\n\nIf the right is right, time will prove it, as it did long ago.\n\nPatrick J.
