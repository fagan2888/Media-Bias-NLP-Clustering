I do not believe that he\u2019s complied.\u201d\n\nIn question are two secret agreements between Iran and the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency allowing Tehran to inspect its own nuclear sites. Reportedly, no one beyond the negotiators involved has seen the text of these agreements, including Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nRepublicans contend that the side deals violate the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which was passed unanimously in the spring and required Obama to hand over all of the documents associated with the deal to Congress, including agreements \u201centered into or made between Iran and any other parties.\u201d\n\nDan Holler, the communications director for Heritage Action, said the process under the review act has been a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d in allowing Congress to \u201creassert\u201d its constitutional authority.\n\n\u201cThe House\u2019s refusal to go along with that process is encouraging, though lawmakers will need to do more if they want to rein in this administration,\u201d he said.\n\nBoehner vowed to leave all options on the table, describing the accord as \u201cworse than anything I could\u2019ve ever imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis debate is far from over and, frankly, it\u2019s just beginning,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cWe will use every tool at our disposal to stop, slow and delay this agreement from being fully implemented.\u201d\n\nThe House will vote later this week on a bill condemning Obama for not transmitting the side agreements to Congress.\n\nHouse members will also cast an up-or-down vote approving the agreement Thursday or Friday, but Senate Democrats have already ensured the deal\u2019s passage after blocking a Republican-led resolution of disapproval last week.\n\nCongress has until Sept. 17 to vote on the accord before it is implemented.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest brushed aside Boehner\u2019s threat to sue Obama, saying, \u201cWe obviously feel quite confident in our ability to move forward with the rest of the international community,\u201d according to the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker John Boehner threatened to sue President Obama last week over the Iran nuclear agreement.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner threatened to sue President Obama last week over the Iran nuclear agreement.", "title": "Boehner Threatens to Sue Obama Over Iran Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_BoehnerSue_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T21:19:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ObaAih"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner threatened to sue President Obama last week over the Iran nuclear agreement.", "title": "Boehner Threatens to Sue Obama Over Iran Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_BoehnerSue_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-09-14T17:52:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T21:19:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "John Boehner, Iran nuclear agreement, Iran deal, Josh Earnest, International Atomic Energy Agency"}, "article_summary": "House Speaker John Boehner threatened to sue President Barack Obama last week over the Iran nuclear agreement.\nReportedly, no one beyond the negotiators involved has seen the text of these agreements, including Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.\nI do not believe that he\u2019s complied.\u201dIn question are two secret agreements between Iran and the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency allowing Tehran to inspect its own nuclear sites.\nBoehner vowed to leave all options on the table, describing the accord as \u201cworse than anything I could\u2019ve ever imagined.\u201d\u201cThis debate is far from over and, frankly, it\u2019s just beginning,\u201d Boehner said.\nCongress has until Sept. 17 to vote on the accord before it is implemented."}
