That's because insurers gravitate toward narrow networks as they grow larger and gain negotiating clout, he said. Provided that patients can still see their preferred doctors, the rumored industry consolidation would also benefit consumers, he added.\n\nThis puts pressure on providers to improve their performance, Bithoney told Healthcare Dive, as those facilities that fall out of the top 25 percent on quality metrics risk being excluded from the narrow networks.\n\nMeanwhile, the specific phrasing of Humana's quiet period announcement reflects the large scale of the deal that may be at hand, the Louisville Business Journal reported.\n\nThe Humana statement does not use the words \"merger\" or \"acquisition\" but, rather, \"industry consolidation.\" The size of the players will dictate what type of deal might occur, the article said.\n\nAetna had total revenue of $58 billion in 2014, compared to $34 billion for Cigna. If either were to strike a deal with Humana, which had $48 billion in revenue last year, it would essentially be a merger, the article said.\n\nOn the other hand, with nearly $74 billion in revenue in 2014 and with interest rates low, Anthem may be ready to make an acquisition.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the Healthcare Dive article\n\n- here's the Louisville Business Journal article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHumana enters quiet period until July 29, refueling acquisition rumors\n\nHow a Humana acquisition would reshape the market\n\nHumana still attractive acquisition target, but priced too high\n\nAnthem may be ready to make an acquisition\n\nBooming Medicare business could make Humana an acquisition target", "article_metadata": {"description": "The\u00a0health insurance industry consolidation that a Humana sale would bring\u00a0stands to benefit payers while challenging hospitals and providers.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "The\u00a0health insurance industry consolidation that a Humana sale would bring\u00a0stands to benefit payers while challenging hospitals and providers.", "title": "Humana deal will benefit payers at expense of providers", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/humana-deal-will-benefit-payers-expense-providers/2015-06-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Aetna,Anthem,Cigna,Humana,Medicare Advantage,Mergers And Acquisitions", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca906\"", "article_summary": "The health insurance industry consolidation that a Humana sale would bring stands to benefit payers while challenging hospitals and providers, according to Healthcare Dive.\nIf either were to strike a deal with Humana, which had $48 billion in revenue last year, it would essentially be a merger, the article said.\nMeanwhile, the specific phrasing of Humana's quiet period announcement reflects the large scale of the deal that may be at hand, the Louisville Business Journal reported.\nProvided that patients can still see their preferred doctors, the rumored industry consolidation would also benefit consumers, he added.\nThe Humana statement does not use the words \"merger\" or \"acquisition\" but, rather, \"industry consolidation.\""}
