What would happen if you suddenly lost your home? Where do you call home? Where do you belong?\n\nIntroduction\n\nIdentifying where we belong has always been a part of growing up. You identify with your neighborhood, your city, your state. We also seek to connect ourselves with people and places that have common beliefs and interests. This issue is becoming more challenging, particularly in urban areas where the cost of living has increased exponentially and families are being forced to relocate to other neighborhoods. This disrupts the feeling of belonging.\n\nThe problem of being priced out of a neighborhood is particularly bad in high priced cities such as San Francisco. Rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are soaring due the strong economy. And there are fewer affordable housing units. Several factors are contributing to the decrease in affordable rentals. San Francisco has strong rental control laws that cover 172,000 of the housing units in the city. But recently fewer new affording housing units have been built and some landlords are getting out of the business of renting to low income residents. Seniors and families are particularly hard hit. Three years ago the governor of California, Jerry Brown, eliminated the redevelopment agencies that used to help finance low income housing construction.\n\nThe private housing market isn\u2019t creating enough homes affordable to low and moderate-income households. According to a recent report from the California Housing Partnership Corporation investment in affordable housing has dropped $1.5 billion annually. The report also points out there is a shortage of nearly one million home available to the lowest-income households.\n\nAnother law change in the mid-1980s is also affecting the lack of affordable housing. The state Ellis Act allows landlords to leave the rental business. They are then allowed to sell their properties. This forces thousands of people out of their rent controlled apartments. Speculators are buying the properties and selling or renting them at much higher prices.\n\nOne recently built affordable housing complex with 160 units, received 4,600 applications. The severe crisis is changing parts of the city as seniors, artists, and working families are priced out of neighborhoods they\u2019ve lived in for years. It could be happening in your neighborhood. And it makes us reflect on where we belong.\n\nResource\n\nCalifornia Report\u2019s radio segment Did the End of California\u2019s Redevelopment Agencies Hurt Affordable Housing?\n\nThere\u2019s new evidence every day of the brutal housing market in parts of California. Many housing experts think the short supply of affordable rental units is likely to get worse, at least partly because the state did away with Redevelopment Agencies two years ago. For all their faults, the agencies were legally required to devote a fifth of their revenue to affordable housing \u2014 about a $1 billion a year. What happens now that the money is gone?\n\nTo respond to the Do Now, you can comment below or tweet your response.
