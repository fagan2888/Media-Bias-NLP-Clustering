Chad Terhune and Russ Mitchell, who left the Times during the recent buyout, are joining Kaiser Health News as part of a California expansion of the nonprofit health news service, part of a new partnership with the California HealthCare Foundation. Already on hand are California projects editor Julie Marquis, a former investigative projects editor at the LAT, and reporter Anna Gorman, also an LAT health beat alumna. There are other adds to the Kaiser staff as well.\n\nAlso today, KHN reported that the Los Angeles-area chapter of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association is splitting from the national organization, \"the latest in a string of departures that could impact the national group\u2019s bottom line.\"\n\nOK, here's the memo on the personnel moves.\n\n\n\nOur California-based operation will be led by California Bureau Chief Julie Marquis, based in LA. Julie will continue to work closely with fellow LA-based Senior Correspondent Anna Gorman and Multimedia Reporter and Producer Heidi De Marco. Senior National Correspondent Sarah Varney and Senior Correspondent Jenny Gold will maintain their Menlo Park home base, and will continue to produce a mix of national and California-based stories. All of our California-based journalists will participate in national reporting projects, including a new Enterprise Reporting Initiative that will also be established with external support. Of course John and LaRonda will continue to oversee the entire enterprise, working with me and Drew.\n\n\n\nToday I\u2019m pleased to introduce a great team of journalists who are joining KHN as we expand in California. Their work, together with pieces from freelancers across the state, will be disseminated through our large and growing network of California-based news organizations. Their reporting will also appear on Californiahealthline.org and KHN.org. Much of it will also be distributed through our national media partners. And KHN\u2019s DC-based web gurus Kathleen Hayden, Andrew Villegas, and Lynne Shallcross will manage the re-launch ofCaliforniahealthline.org and ensure that all this new content looks great online and finds the broadest possible audience through social media.\n\n---\n\nBay Area\n\n\n\nRuss Mitchell, Managing Editor.
