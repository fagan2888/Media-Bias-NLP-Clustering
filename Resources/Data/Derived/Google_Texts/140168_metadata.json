So-called \u201cinclusion directors\u201d for those segments of the population are \u201cout in the field every day, holding meetings, going on radio shows ... reaching out in different ways,\u201d she said.\n\nGleason said Pennsylvania years ago hired outreach directors to inspire Hispanics and blacks to vote Republican. \u201cI recognized long ago that we have a great message that appeals to everyone, but not everyone was hearing it,\u201d he said.\n\nCongressman Steve King of Iowa will welcome the conferees Thursday evening. Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Virginia, who is making his second run for president, will hold a breakfast session Friday. Santorum lived in Penn Hills when he represented Pennsylvania in the Senate from 1995 to 2007.\n\nAbout 500 people are expected to attend the conference, which runs through Saturday, Sweeney said.\n\nAmong the speakers: Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Scott Walker of Wisconsin; U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa; U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who have announced White House bids; and Republican National Committee co-chairs Reince Priebus and Sharon Day.\n\nKarl Rove, former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, is scheduled to speak.\n\nGleason said he chose Philadelphia for the conference in part because it's where Democrats will convene in 2016 and because of voter density.\n\n\u201cThe southeast part of the state holds 45 percent of the vote total,\u201d Gleason said. \u201cWe have to show that we mean business in this area, and that we are not afraid to come here and do just that.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia beat out Brooklyn and Columbus, Ohio, to host the Democratic National Convention in July 2016. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has said the city's \u201cdeep-rooted place in American history provides a perfect setting for this special gathering.\u201d\n\nSalena Zito is a Trib Total Media staff writer.
