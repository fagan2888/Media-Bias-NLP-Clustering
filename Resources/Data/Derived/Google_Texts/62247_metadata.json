It's also not certain how or if Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, the third-party payer for the large automakers, would be affected.The UAW is preparing for its next round of negotiations with Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in September. Each car company is self-insured, meaning they pay the medical claims of their employees on their own and outsource the administrative functions. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan is the predominant claims administrator for all three companies, although some regional HMOs perform services in other states.UAW President Dennis Williams said using the size of all three companies could have significant bargaining power.\u201cThe more people that pool together in this healthcare system, the more leverage you have with the institutions, such as hospitals, clinics and insurance companies,\u201d Williams said during Thursday's news conference . \u201cThat's the focus right now.\u201dAbout 900,000 retired and active UAW employees are spread across FCA, Ford and GM. \u201cIf you pool that, that's a pretty good number,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI'd go to the bargaining table with that number. In fact, I am.\u201dThe auto companies at least appear willing to listen to the UAW. Healthcare benefits consume billions of automakers' dollars every year, and many self-insured employers have been looking to cut costs wherever possible.\u201cAs the cost of healthcare continues to increase at an unsustainable rate, FCA US is open to discussing with the UAW options that will reduce cost while both the improving the quality of care and the health of our employees,\u201d FCA spokesperson Jodi Tinson said.\u201cWe're always open to talking through creative solutions to deliver benefits our employees value while improving the long-term competitiveness of the company,\u201d GM spokesman Pete Ternes said.Ford did not respond to a request for comment. Blue Cross and Blue Shield also did not immediately respond to questions about how such an alliance would alter its business as the claims administrator.Automakers and the UAW also share common disdain for a certain healthcare policy: the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax. That excise tax goes into effect in 2018 and levies a fee on employers that offer healthcare policies with generous benefits and little cost-sharing for employees. A Health Affairs study from this year found that the Cadillac tax will greatly diminish collectively bargained union plans \u201cI think it's very unfair for the United States government to penalize people for having good healthcare,\u201d Williams said at the news conference.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The head of the United Auto Workers wants to pool the employees of the Detroit Three automobile companies to extract lower prices from healthcare companies.", "title": "UAW eyes healthcare alliance among self-insured automakers", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The head of the United Auto Workers wants to pool the employees of the Detroit Three automobile companies to extract lower prices from healthcare companies.", "title": "UAW eyes healthcare alliance among self-insured automakers", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150619/NEWS/150619880", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150619/NEWS/150619880/AR/0/AR-150619880.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The head of the United Auto Workers wants to pool the employees of the Detroit Three automobile companies to extract lower prices from healthcare companies.", "title": "UAW eyes healthcare alliance among self-insured automakers", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150619/NEWS/150619880/AR/0/AR-150619880.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150619/NEWS/150619880", "published_at": "2015-06-19", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150619/NEWS/150619880/AR/0/AR-150619880.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce771\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat's the focus right now.\u201dAbout 900,000 retired and active UAW employees are spread across FCA, Ford and GM.\nThat excise tax goes into effect in 2018 and levies a fee on employers that offer healthcare policies with generous benefits and little cost-sharing for employees.\nEach car company is self-insured, meaning they pay the medical claims of their employees on their own and outsource the administrative functions.\nIn fact, I am.\u201dThe auto companies at least appear willing to listen to the UAW.\nThe head of the United Auto Workers wants to pool the employees of the Detroit Three automobile companies to extract lower prices from healthcare companies.But details of the influential union's plan are unclear."}
