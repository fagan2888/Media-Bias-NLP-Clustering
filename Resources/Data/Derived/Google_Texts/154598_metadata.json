You have a specific agenda \u2014 to shop by the list and avoid unnecessary spending. But all your planning goes haywire once the kids spot chips, soda, and all other things you classify as \u201cjunk.\u201d They rant and bully you into buying what they want, and you end up feeling guilty for giving into their demands. Hundreds of parents all over the world face this. And who can remedy this situation? Supermarkets, apparently. All they need to do is stash the unhealthy foods high up on shelves, where children can\u2019t see them and place healthier options at their eye level.\n\nThis novel suggestion was made by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who believe when it comes to children, the \"out of sight, out of mind\" strategy always works. Titled \u201cChild as change agent. The potential of children to increase healthy food purchasing,\u201d the study was published in this month\u2019s edition of Appetite. It explores both the influence of store environment on children and children\u2019s influence on grocery shopping.\n\nThe research was first initiated to promote healthy food purchasing in low-income neighborhoods\u2019 in Baltimore, Md., when the study group found that often parents and caregivers gave in to kids\u2019 demands and ended up buying unhealthy, expensive food, which they had not intended to buy. As a solution, caregivers suggested altering food placements so that healthy food would be accessible to children, and also offering cooking classes to older children.\n\n\u201cOur study suggests that grocery shopping with children often can have negative consequences on the healthfulness of grocery purchases, but has the potential to have a positive influence instead,\u201d said lead author Pamela J. Surkan, in a statement.\n\nThis quantitative study was also novel in that the end results were not numerical figures and statistics, but rather narratives from the participants who were mainly low-income African-American women and caretakers to at least one child under age 16, and their household\u2019s primary food shopper.\n\nOf the 62 participants, 30 participated in interviews, and the rest were split into five focus groups. The study also included the owner and employees of the store, which was the focus of the study. The store was in an area that had limited access to healthy, fresh produce. It catered primarily to the low-income group.\n\nWhile the participants admitted to giving in to their children's demands, they did not do so without a fight. They tried all tactics from flat-out refusal to suggesting alternative healthy snacks, or setting aside the coveted item on the sly.\n\nA majority suggested that the store\u2019s policy of advertising for junk food should be changed. Others suggested that children can benefit from a healthy shopping experience, and this could be done by giving them samples of healthy food, such as a fruit.\n\nOne mother noted that her son wanted to try blueberries, but she didn\u2019t want to \u201cbuy the whole thing and take it home, and it\u2019s a waste [if they don\u2019t like it].\u201d\n\nSo she suggested that the shop allow children to try fruits before they were bought. But how far will grocery stores go to accommodate shoppers? Only time will tell.\n\nSource: Wingert K, Zachary D, Fox M, Gittelsohn J, Surkan P. Child as change agent.
