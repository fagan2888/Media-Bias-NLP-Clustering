They gathered to protest the lack of progress by state lawmakers in Olympia to present a new state budget and funding for local schools.\n\nHowever, a new study released by the Washington Policy Center (WPC) indicates that only 60 cents of every tax dollar destined for education spending actually reaches classrooms.\n\nLiv Finne, director of WPC\u2019s Center for Education, indicates in a paper titled Where the Money Goes in Public Education (PDF) that administrative costs in school districts are soaring, and that at least 55 school superintendents receive a higher annual salary rate than Washington State Governor Jay Inslee.\n\nMany of these public servants also work in districts with fewer than 100 students. Among them is Lacrosse district Superintendent Randy Nelson, responsible for an average of 65 students, who is paid a salary rate of US$120,000. Meanwhile, Keller district\u2019s Mike Perry has 40 students, and earns $105,000 pro rata.\n\nIn the same vein, Mill A district Superintendent Kathy Whitlock, with 22 students, has a $97,000 salary rate. Bill Glidewell from Evergreen (Ste) district earns $93,000 pro rata, although the number of students in the area is no more than 20.\n\nFinne further demonstrates that 34 school superintendents are paid at a rate higher than $200,000 a year, 36 are paid at a rate three times greater than the average teacher salary of $62,400, and 220 superintendents are paid at a rate three times greater than the state starting-teacher salary of around $34,000.\n\nThe most shocking finding, however, is that certain superintendents earn some of the highest salaries in government, even though they only oversee modestly sized school districts. Bellingham district\u2019s Greg Baker oversees 10,600 students and earns an annualized $298,000. Meanwhile, Elaine Beraza, from the Yakima district with 15,700 students, receives $228,000 pro rata.\n\nFinne concludes that superintendents\u2019 high salaries not only \u201ccontribute to income inequality,\u201d but also \u201ccontribute to a sense of unfairness that administrators are paid so much while teachers say they are often underpaid and forced to go short on classroom supplies.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, she argues that the public education system needs reforms \u201cto the outmoded and outdated ways school dollars are now spent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes sense that some parents be allowed to choose an education voucher as a way to access alternative learning programs for their children, especially for families assigned to underperforming schools,\u201d she adds.\n\nFinne told the PanAm Post that the central problem with the allocation of resources for education is that schools operate as monopolies. \u201cIn a monopoly system, consumers get less and less service at a higher and higher cost,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPublic-school managers have no incentive to improve service or bring down costs because public funding is guaranteed. If parents could direct where the money goes, or does not go, you would quickly see school managers respond by delivering more public resources to school classrooms,\u201d Finne added.\n\nEnding the Monopoly\n\nLibertarian commentator and writer David Shellenberger told the PanAm Post that he was not surprised by the \u201cabsurdly high salaries\u201d for many school superintendents. \u201cThe government will always allocate resources politically, this is its nature,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Shellenberger, only a free market in education would allow parents to select the schools or other resources that best meet their children\u2019s needs. \u201cIt would also foster innovation, excellence, and reasonable pricing,\u201d he emphasized.\n\n\u201cThe current system limits choice,\u201d he argued, adding that \u201cthe purpose of government schools is to serve bureaucrats and teachers unions, while indoctrinating students and teaching them to conform.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government is the worst provider of any service \u2026 We need a free market in education, with no government subsidies or regulation. We also need to end compulsory education laws, allowing parents to raise their children as they see fit,\u201d Shellenberger stated.\n\n\u201cRather than trying to reform a system that is inherently flawed, I recommend freeing education from the clutches of the government,\u201d he concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research shows that multiple public school superintendents in Washington State earn a higher pro rata salary than Governor Jay Inslee.", "generator": "Give v1.4.5", "og": {"site_name": "PanAm Post", "description": "New research shows that multiple public school superintendents in Washington State earn a higher pro rata salary than Governor Jay Inslee.", "title": "Washington State's School Officials Pocket More than the Governor", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 710, "identifier": "https://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/ft-teachers-washington-21.jpg", "height": 350}, "url": "https://panampost.com/rebeca-morla/2015/05/15/washington-states-school-officials-pocket-more-than-the-governor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research shows that multiple public school superintendents in Washington State earn a higher pro rata salary than Governor Jay Inslee.", "creator": "@RebecaMorla", "image": "https://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/ft-teachers-washington-21.jpg", "title": "Washington State's School Officials Pocket More than the Governor", "site": "@PanAmPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002447837660, "app_id": 272171646459645, "pages": 197511413705974}, "google-site-verification": "ypzV0RhKyEDAxsbXG0ThtpSGZ18ECcSk-fWHTlztAQQ", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/PanAmPost", "section": "Education", "tag": "Washinton Policy Center", "published_time": "2015-05-15T15:33:42-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rebecaa.morla"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Teacher unions in several school districts in Washington State held a strike on Wednesday, May 13, to demand higher pay and better benefits.\nEnding the MonopolyLibertarian commentator and writer David Shellenberger told the PanAm Post that he was not surprised by the \u201cabsurdly high salaries\u201d for many school superintendents.\nIn the same vein, Mill A district Superintendent Kathy Whitlock, with 22 students, has a $97,000 salary rate.\nThe most shocking finding, however, is that certain superintendents earn some of the highest salaries in government, even though they only oversee modestly sized school districts.\nAmong them is Lacrosse district Superintendent Randy Nelson, responsible for an average of 65 students, who is paid a salary rate of US$120,000."}
