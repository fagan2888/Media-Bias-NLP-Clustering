Seventeen out of 20 on the list were Republicans, with the only liberals being Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson and America\u2019s reigning nabob of nuttiness, Joe Biden.\n\nIn a note appended to the story, GQ defensively said it wasn\u2019t guilty of \u201cstandard liberal-media bias,\u201d it just couldn\u2019t find any loony Democrats to speak of.\n\nLet\u2019s give GQ a little help, shall we? Here are 16 more Democrats for the list of the most cra-cra political figures.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democratic National Committee chair (Fla.):\n\nCompared Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to a wife-beater: \u201cScott Walker has given women the back of his hand. I know that is stark. That is direct. But that is reality. What Republican tea party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch.\u201d Wait, I\u2019m confused, this abuse already happened, is happening, but \u201cit\u2019s not going to happen\u201d?\n\nRep. Barbara Lee (Calif.):\n\nCalled for a $26 minimum wage so that \u201cpeople . . . could afford to live in areas now where they cannot afford to live\u201d and \u201cyou would increase diversity in certain communities where you don\u2019t have diversity anymore. You would have economic parity.\u201d Nah, $26 an hour isn\u2019t going to diversify Park Avenue. Try $260 an hour, that\u2019ll work!\n\nSean Eldridge and Chris Hughes, rich and clueless:\n\nEldridge tried to buy a New York congressional seat, purchasing a $5 million house in one district, then, when that didn\u2019t work, grabbing a $2 million home in another. He outspent his opponent 3-to-1, but still lost (dashing his hopes, the Daily Beast reports, of being \u201cthe first openly gay president\u201d). Meanwhile, Eldridge\u2019s husband, Facebook co-founder Hughes, decided to take out his frustration on the magazine he bought, The New Republic. He fired the editor and said the tweed jacket brigade would become a \u201cvertically integrated digital-media company.\u201d The liberal writers who lost their minds over this made up a crazy list all its own.\n\nGubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis (Texas):\n\nApproved a disparaging ad that featured images of a wheelchair like the one her opponent Greg Abbott has had to use for years since a freak accident. The ad was credited with adding five points to Abbott\u2019s huge margin of victory.\n\nOutgoing Sen. Kay Hagan (N.C.):\n\nAllowed an empty chair to represent her at an October debate with challenger Thom Tillis. Tillis, who spent an hour explaining his positions and slamming Hagan, won the debate and the election.\n\nSenate Veteran Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (a Democrat who identifies as a Socialist, in a reversal of the usual custom):\n\nSaid the VA provides \u201cvery high quality health care, period\u201d and that the shocking scandals surrounding it were traceable to \u201ca concerted effort to undermine the VA\u201d led by the \u201cKoch Brothers and others, who want to radically change the nature of society.\u201d So that\u2019s why the Koches are funding all those hospitals! It\u2019s really a roundabout way of making the VA look bad.\n\nMIT economist Jonathan Gruber, paid architect/spokesman for ObamaCare:\n\nTapes emerged of him saying that only the stupidity of American voters allowed ObamaCare to pass. Then, in congressional testimony, suffered an unfortunate public episode of schizophrenia as he called himself a liar for all the times he\u2019d previously said he helped write ObamaCare.\n\nOutgoing Sen. Mary Landrieu (La.):\n\nLocked in a fight for her political life, in the final days of her campaign she called her own constituents racists and sexists. About President Obama, she said he was unpopular in her state because \u201cThe South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans. It\u2019s been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader.\u201d About herself she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not always been a good place for women to present ourselves. It\u2019s more of a conservative place.\u201d Maybe Landrieu should have run someplace like Massachusetts, where the party of Obama is popular and Martha Coakley easily won the governor\u2019s . . . whoops, wait. No, she didn\u2019t.\n\nUN Ambassador Samantha Power:\n\nTweeted that \u201cDaniel Pearl\u2019s story is reminder that individual accountability & reconciliation are required to break cycles of violence.\u201d Either that or it\u2019s a reminder that murderous anti-Semitic Islamist fanatics should be broken into as many pieces as possible. But the quote is perfectly sane if Power is hoping her next job will be al Qaeda ambassador to the UN.\n\nOutgoing Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman and Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.):\n\nSent out a string of increasingly deranged fundraising emails that sounded as if they were coming from a guy who was strapped to the wall in Madame de Sade\u2019s Torture Dungeon and maybe even enjoying it, featuring subject lines such as \u201cCRIPPLING blow,\u201d \u201cDEVASTATING defeat,\u201d \u201cEVISCERATED,\u201d \u201cHORRIFYING,\u201d \u201cHUMILIATING\u201d and \u201cWHOA.\u201d Israel put his gift for hyperbole to use when he wrote his first novel, \u201cThe Global War on Morris.\u201d He said he was inspired to pursue fiction by things he heard while sitting in on national security briefings. Good to know that those are useful for something.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi:\n\nAfter Republican Rep. Tom Marino gave a speech mentioning that Pelosi had done nothing on immigration reform when she ruled the House, an enraged Pelosi chased him down two aisles, gesturing wildly and hurling imprecations until a group of fellow lawmakers intervened. Said \u201cDemocrats are not fear mongers\u201d but \u201cCivilization as we know it would be in jeopardy if Republicans win the Senate.\u201d Right. Because if, say, the minimum wage or gun laws stay the way they are right now, the Book of Revelation kicks into effect.\n\nOutgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid:\n\nOnce muttered the words \u201cKoch Brothers\u201d 27 times in a speech. Said the Koch Brothers are \u201cone of the main causes of [climate change]. Not a cause, one of the main causes.\u201d Koch Industries is responsible for one-third of 1 percent of the carbon emissions in one country. It\u2019s like saying Scranton is one of the main cities in the country.\n\nOutgoing Sen. Mark Udall (Colo.):\n\nApproved an attack ad that said opponent Cory Gardner was secretly waging an \u201ceight-year crusade that would ban birth control.\u201d If so, calling for selling the Pill over the counter (as Gardner did) was a funny way to go about it.\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much money in politics . . . Here is something you can do right now today to make a difference, and that is to write a big, fat check.\u201d\n\nPresident-in-Waiting Hillary Clinton:\n\nDefined \u201csmart power\u201d as \u201cShowing respect, even for one\u2019s enemies, trying to understand and insofar as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view.\u201d Hey, Muhammad, I feel your pain. Tell me, does your wrist ache from slitting that guy\u2019s throat?", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "In a survey of the \u201cCraziest Politicians of 2014,\u201d GQ had difficulty locating any Democrats.
