Nia Gill, D-Essex, and Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, said the state's biggest health insurer misrepresented its OMNIA health plan to lawmakers and the public by failing to disclose which doctors and hospitals were part of its network.\n\n\"With the introduction of this plan in New Jersey under an extremely flawed process, it is critical that we act,\" they said in a statement. \"Failure to do so could compromise the quality of care patients receive and the health of hospitals throughout the state. Strong oversight and accountability of this program is vital to ensuring our residents are protected.\u201d\n\nThe senators led a hearing on Monday about OMNIA, a plan Horizon has unveiled for 2016 that will include lower premiums, co-pays and deductibles for consumers \u2013 provided they get care from a network of 24,000 health care professionals and 36 hospitals, including Barnabas Health's and Meridian Health's eight hospitals in Monmouth and Ocean counties. Centrastate Healthcare System in Freehold Township was one of the hospitals left out.\n\nThe plan wouldn't affect consumers who are covered by Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nLawmakers at the hearing were unhappy that Horizon developed its network without disclosing how it decided which health care providers were included.\n\n\"They weren't even asked to the dance,\" Vitale said during the hearing. \"It's not fair.\"\n\nThe New Jersey Attorney General's office declined to comment Tuesday morning.\n\nThe hearing on Monday could be a sign of things to come. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, is aimed not only at ensuring virtually all Americans have health insurance but also at slowing the escalating cost of care.\n\nHorizon has 3.8 million members and a majority of both the individual and small employer market in New Jersey.\n\nHorizon executives said OMNIA will do both by paying hospitals and doctors in the network not for the number of services they provide but for the value of the care they provide \u2014 a model it has slowly been introducing since 2010.\n\nThe health care providers will take discounts in their reimbursements. But Horizon expects 250,000 consumers to opt for the plan, giving health care providers who participate more customers.\n\nConsumers who choose the OMNIA plan can expect premiums that are 15 percent less expensive than other Horizon plans, along with lower out-of-pocket expenses if they go to doctors in the network, Robert Marino, Horizon's president and chief executive officer, told the senators.\n\nThe full details haven't been released. Open enrollment for consumers who purchase insurance in the Obamacare exchange begins Nov. 1.\n\nBut the new plan should allow 40,000 New Jerseyans who don't have coverage to afford health insurance, Marino said at the hearing.\n\nIn response to the committees' call for more transparency, Horizon said in a statement that it provided \"more transparency than any other insurer in the state about how it developed its tiered network plans. Horizon will be offering new lower cost health plan options for consumers who are paying some of the highest health care costs in the nation.\"\n\nThe OMNIA plan already was approved by the state Department of Banking and Insurance, and it wasn't clear what lawmakers who opposed it could do to halt it. Some of the lawmakers, however, were miffed that Horizon developed its plan in relative secrecy, given the huge impact that it could have on health care providers who were left out of the plan.\n\n\"I\u2019m not saying it is (a monopoly), but we haven\u2019t been given information,\" Gill said during the hearing. \"This could and it has the earmarks of being a potential monopoly, as well as \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying it is \u2013 as well as potential consumer protection issues.\u201d\n\nMichael L.
