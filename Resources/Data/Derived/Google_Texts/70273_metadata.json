UCare\u2019s proposal applies to about 10,000 current policyholders.\n\nThe UCare proposal is just that \u2014 regulators are scheduled to release final rates this fall, and proposed increases could be knocked down by the rate review process at the Minnesota Department of Commerce.\n\nUCare officials said they can\u2019t comment on the process until final rates are announced by Commerce on Oct. 1.\n\nThe requested change is noteworthy because UCare seemed like it was on track to be one of the least expensive options in the individual market, said Heidi Michaels, an insurance agent with Dyste Williams in St. Louis Park.\n\nBeing low-cost and/or high-value has proved troublesome for carriers in the individual market during the past two years, said Michaels, who is president of the Minnesota Association of Health Underwriters, a trade group for insurance agents.\n\nIn 2014, Golden Valley-based PreferredOne offered some of the lowest premiums in the country, but had to pull back in dramatic fashion for 2015 after big losses mounted.\n\nIn 2015, Blue Cross was a popular choice because it offered a combination of good premium prices and low out-of-pocket costs, Michaels said. But the insurer took on losses, and has proposed big rate increases for 2016.\n\n\u201cUCare was really positioned to be the low-cost carrier,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be in that position going into this next open enrollment, because every carrier that has been in that position has sustained substantial losses.\u201d\n\nAbout 300,000 Minnesotans purchase coverage in the individual market, which includes the state\u2019s MNsure health exchange. The market has been the focus of reforms under the federal Affordable Care Act, which called for the creation of health exchanges in all 50 states.\n\nThe health law blocks health insurers from denying coverage to people based on pre-existing health conditions \u2014 a feature of the market that was unpopular with consumers. Minnesota insurers, however, have questioned whether the new individual market is working, considering the proposed rate increases for 2016 as well as PreferredOne\u2019s losses in 2014.\n\nThe Golden Valley-based insurer exited MNsure for 2015 after being the largest carrier on the exchange, and proposed big rate increases for this year in the off-exchange market.\n\n\u201cIn a market where you\u2019ve created a dynamic where you don\u2019t want to be the low-cost [plan] \u2014 that\u2019s broken,\u201d said Mary Brainerd, the HealthPartners chief executive, during a June interview with the Star Tribune. \u201cI\u2019m troubled not just by what I see here, but what you see across the country.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The request pre-dated the loss of a huge state contract.", "title": "UCare boosts its request for premium increase", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/ucare-boosts-premium-increase-request/322545241/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The request pre-dated the loss of a huge state contract.", "title": "UCare boosts its request for premium increase", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/ucare-boosts-premium-increase-request/322545241/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201462"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The request pre-dated the loss of a huge state contract."}, "article_summary": "The individual market business for UCare is distinct from the business in public health insurance programs.\nIn June, UCare was one of three Minnesota health insurers in the spotlight for requesting rate increases in excess of 10 percent for next year.\nUCare has upped its proposal for premium increases in the individual market next year, citing factors from growing medical costs to possible underpricing for some of its current policies.\nBut the insurer took on losses, and has proposed big rate increases for 2016.\nWith the July filing, UCare upped its proposed average rate increase from 12 percent to 27 percent \u2014 a bump that\u2019s more in line with increases being sought by other individual market carriers for 2016."}
