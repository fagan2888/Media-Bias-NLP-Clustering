The Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC) has named Jerry Chrisman to interim warden at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.

Chrisman was serving as warden for the Jackie Brannon Correctional Center (JBCC) when the DOC called on him to fill the interim role. Chrisman will step in to relieve Deputy Warden Maurice Warrior, who had been serving as Warden since Anita Trammell retired in October.

The close proximity of both the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and the Jackie Brannon facility will allow for Chrisman to continue both roles.

There has not been a timetable set for selecting a permanent warden for the OSP.

Chrisman is a native Oklahoman and a graduate of graduate of Southeastern Oklahoma State University. He began his work as a corrections officer for the OK DOC in 1989. From 2001 ro 2012, Chrisman served as deputy warden at James Crabtree Correction Center, Joseph Harp Correctional Center, and Mack Alford Correctional Center.

He took over as interim warden at Mack Alford in 2012 and served until 2015, when he was named the warden of the JBCC in June 2015.
