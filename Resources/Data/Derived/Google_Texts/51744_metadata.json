Mike Pence joined the chorus of hawks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday, arguing that foreign policy will be the central issue in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 2016 [election] could actually be the first foreign policy national election since 1980, and sadly this administration has reduced our army to its smallest size since 1940,\u201d Pence said.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Navy has fewer ships than at any time since 1960, the Air Force is at its smallest tactical fighting force in history,\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory teaches you cannot reduce our military strength without provoking our enemies, weakness arouses evil.\u201dPence gave the keynote address at the prestigious, invitation-only dinner that closes out the second day of the conservative conference.His speech came amid chaos on Capitol Hill as GOP lawmakers barely averted a shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by passing a one-week continuing resolution funding the agency.\n\nStill, a dozen lawmakers were in the Potomac Ballroom at the Gaylord National Convention Center just across the border from the nation's capitol for Pence\u2019s address.\n\nConference organizer Matt Schlapp said Sens. Steve Daines of Montana and Dan Sullivan of Alaska attended the dinner, along with Reps. Rick Allen (Ga.), Ken Buck (Colo.), John Culberson (Texas), Bill Flores (Texas), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Richard Hudson (N.C.), Tim Huelksamp (Kansas), Steve King (Iowa), Bruce Westerman (Ark.), and Dana Rohrbacher (Calif.).\n\n\n\nPence hasn't closed the door on a run for president in 2016, although he hasn\u2019t made any clear moves into the field. He said he\u2019ll wait until Indiana\u2019s legislative session is over in late April to make a decision.\n\n\n\nAs a House member for twelve years, Pence served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and on Friday he made clear that he falls squarely in the party\u2019s hawkish right wing.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that conservatives again embrace America\u2019s role as leader of the free world and the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Pence said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe time has come to dramatically confront defense spending so we\u2019re able to confront the knowable and unknowable threats we face,\u201d he continued.\n\n\n\nForeign policy has been a dominant theme at CPAC, with many of the potential presidential candidates arguing that the U.S. must assert its force abroad. A slew of potential presidential candidates demanded a more hawkish global approach at the conservative gathering.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Indiana governor joined the chorus of hawks at CPAC.", "description": "The Indiana governor joined the chorus of hawks at CPAC.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Indiana governor joined the chorus of hawks at CPAC.", "title": "Pence: 2016 will be foreign policy election", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/234210-pence-2016-will-be-a-foreign-policy-election", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/pencemike_022715gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-27T22:20:31-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-27T22:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/234210-pence-2016-will-be-a-foreign-policy-election", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-27T22:03-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jonathan Easley", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Mike Pence,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-27T22:03:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T22:20:31-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/234210-pence-2016-will-be-a-foreign-policy-election", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Indiana governor joined the chorus of hawks at CPAC.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pence: 2016 will be foreign policy election"}, "dcterms.title": "Pence: 2016 will be foreign policy election"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe 2016 [election] could actually be the first foreign policy national election since 1980, and sadly this administration has reduced our army to its smallest size since 1940,\u201d Pence said.\nMike Pence joined the chorus of hawks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday, arguing that foreign policy will be the central issue in the 2016 presidential election.\nForeign policy has been a dominant theme at CPAC, with many of the potential presidential candidates arguing that the U.S. must assert its force abroad.\nPence hasn't closed the door on a run for president in 2016, although he hasn\u2019t made any clear moves into the field.\n\u201cIt is imperative that conservatives again embrace America\u2019s role as leader of the free world and the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Pence said."}
