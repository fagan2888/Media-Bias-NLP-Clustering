No longer in the NFL drug program after staying clean for two years, Miller enters the final year of his contract with added leverage. A positive test will not sideline him for a full season. Because of his clean record and last season\u2019s revamped drug program, Miller starts over. A mistake, which he has shown no signs of making, would only place him back in the program and would not result in a suspension.\n\nIt shows how far Miller has come since his career went briefly off the rails two years ago. Miller acknowledged his situation has changed, but insisted it won\u2019t change him. He made changes for the long term, not a two-year window.\n\n\u201cI mean that\u2019s it? I got a long way to go, right? It\u2019s not time to throw the confetti and the balloons. I still got a long way to go,\u201d Miller said Sunday night. \u201cI still got a long way to go to be the type of player I want to be for this organization. So that\u2019s where my mind is right now. Just coming out here having fun and all that other stuff is cool. But I already came to camp with my mind in the moment and wanting to get everybody else better, wanting to inspire everyone else to play great to let this year be the year.\u201d\n\nMiller appears poised for a big season. Outside linebackers have flourished in defensive coordinator Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4 defense, creating predictions of a 20-sack season for Miller. The Broncos could choose to franchise tag Miller. The template for a long-term deal was provided by Kansas City\u2019s Justin Houston, who received $52.5 million guaranteed last month after a 22-sack season. Miller hears the contract talk, but only when the issue is raised.\n\n\u201cI was happy for Justin \u2014 22 sacks I think he should get a lot more. I have always said before when I am here and I am on the football field, I am grinding. I really don\u2019t think about (the contract) at all,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhen I go home I really don\u2019t think about it all. That\u2019s what has worked for me since coming in from college and from my rookie season. I do give it mind when you guys talk about it, but as soon as I am out of this moment I am on to the next thing. I am just trying to be great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Justin Houston,Von Miller", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Von Miller has turned a risk into a potential reward by testing clean the past two years, but he's not ready to celebrate the milestone.", "title": "Von Miller 'not throwing confetti' over release from drug program", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/08/02/von-miller-not-throwing-confetti-over-release-from-drug-program-remains-focused-on-improving/34755/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/08/von-miller-broncos-training-camp-495x348.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Von Miller has turned a risk into a potential reward by testing clean the past two years, but he's not ready to celebrate the milestone.", "title": "Von Miller not throwing \u2018confetti\u2019 over release from drug program", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/08/02/von-miller-not-throwing-confetti-over-release-from-drug-program-remains-focused-on-improving/34755/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/08/von-miller-broncos-training-camp-495x348.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Von Miller has turned a risk into a potential reward by testing clean the past two years, but he's not ready to celebrate the milestone."}, "article_summary": "Because of his clean record and last season\u2019s revamped drug program, Miller starts over.\n\u201cI still got a long way to go to be the type of player I want to be for this organization.\nNo longer in the NFL drug program after staying clean for two years, Miller enters the final year of his contract with added leverage.\nI still got a long way to go,\u201d Miller said Sunday night.\nI got a long way to go, right?"}
