Bill Haslam\u2019s (R) embrace of Medicaid expansion looked like a godsend for the state. The Volunteer State would receive federal funds to bring coverage to roughly 280,000 low-income Tennesseans, and state hospitals would pick up the tab for future costs. In the process, Haslam struck a deal with federal officials to impose conservative restrictions on his \u201cInsure Tennessee\u201d plan.\n\nIt was about the best gift Tennessee could ever be offered: a package that helped thousands of families, improved state finances, and bolstered state hospitals, all at a cost of $0 from the state budget. And yet, last week Republicans in the state legislature killed the whole idea\n\nNBC\u2019s Perry Bacon Jr. reported the other day that in this fight, the popular governor went up against the state chapter of the Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity. The Tennessee Republican never stood a chance.\n\n[AFP] argued Haslam was just trying to trick conservatives into implementing Obamacare in their state by giving it a new name. AFP campaigned aggressively Haslam\u2019s plans for the next six weeks, even running radio ads blasting GOP state legislators who said they might vote for it. [\u2026] To sell his plan, the governor toured the state over the last two months, stopping in eight cities with the same message: his program could help fund hospitals and cover more than 200,000 low-income people. \u201cThis was not Obamacare,\u201d he emphasized constantly, since the program would have co-pays, premiums and other conservative ideas not in traditional Medicaid.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter. The far-right group not only ran ads insisting that a vote for \u201cInsure Tennessee\u201d was a vote \u201cfor Obamacare,\u201d the NBC report added, \u201cOn its Facebook page, the group paired pictures of Republican state legislators with photos of Obama\u2019s face, accusing the lawmakers of \u2018betraying Tennesseans\u2019 by considering a vote for Haslam\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nA Republican pollster found that only 16% of state residents opposed \u201cInsure Tennessee,\u201d but 85% oppose \u201cObamacare.\u201d (It doesn\u2019t matter if this doesn\u2019t make sense; when it comes to blocking Americans\u2019 access to basic medical care, reason flew out the window years ago.)\n\nAFP mobilization paid off. Indeed, as Bacon reported , when legislators held a hearing early last week, they were confronted with more than 100 people wearing red \u201cAmericans for Prosperity\u201d t-shirts, some of whom had traveled great distances on an AFP-chartered bus.\n\nRepresentatives of the Tennessee Hospital Association were there, too, but they were easily outnumbered, and were left to stand in the back of room during the hearing.\n\nAnd what did the AFP activists have to say for themselves?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical of government-run programs,\u201d said Louis Stans, a retired engineer who was part of the AFP group. Medicare, Stans said, was \u201cbetter\u201d and he had \u201cpaid into it my whole life.\u201d\n\nThose two sentences tell us a great deal about the state of the debate. Here\u2019s a retiree who doesn\u2019t like government-run programs, instead preferring a government-run program. In other words, an AFP activist traveled to the state capitol to condemn a conservative version of Medicaid expansion, because what he really wants is a socialized system like Medicare .", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The popular governor went up against the state chapter of the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity.
