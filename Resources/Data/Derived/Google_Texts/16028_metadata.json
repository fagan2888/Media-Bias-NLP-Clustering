Scientists have looked into the evolution of our skeletal system and what they found only reaffirms how unhealthy our sedentary lifestyles are to our future. They found answers in our ancestors\u2019 bones and published two separate studies in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\u201cThe lightly-built skeleton of modern humans has a direct and important impact on bone strength and stiffness,\u201d the study\u2019s co-author Tim Ryan, an anthropologist at Penn State University, told Smithsonian magazine. \u201cHumans can have robust trabecular bone structure, similar to what is seen in living non-human primates, if they engage in appropriate levels of physical activity throughout life.\u201d\n\nResearchers studied the CT scans of 229 different skeletal structures and discovered four different human populations, each with their own type of foraging or farming methods. They studied the trabecular bone structure, which makes up the inside of the bone and reveals the evolution of the skeleton. This was the first time scientists had examined millions of year's worth of bone density in order to discover clues to our last 12,000 years of evolution.\n\nForagers had significantly higher bone density, the researchers found, which meant they had thicker hip and thigh bones. Thus, they were less likely to break. But around the time we started to grow food and raise livestock more than we hunted, scientists saw a distinct difference in our bone density \u2014 we became lighter. Joint bone weakness can be attributed to different levels of physical activity.\n\nAccording to Ryan, bone lightness indicates weakness because it leads to higher rates of osteoporosis and age-related bone loss. If we don\u2019t need to hunt because our food is right in our backyard, less stress and physical demand is placed upon our skeletal system. We evolved into a weaker human. Even our ancestors, the chimpanzees have 50 to 75 percent denser bones than we do.\n\n\u201cModern human skeletons have shifted quite recently towards lighter \u2014 more fragile, if you like \u2014 bodies. It started when we adopted agriculture. Our diets changed. Our levels of activity changed,\u201d the study\u2019s coauthor Habiba Chirchir, an anthropologist in the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, told Smithsonian. \u201cThink of the end of a chicken bone: If you cut through it, then you see this meshwork of bone that\u2019s interwoven.\u201d\n\nWhen the research team couldn\u2019t rule out diet or disease as the reason bones became lighter throughout evolution, they looked to our levels of physical activity. It seems that a lack of physical activity may be the reason why human bones became lighter, and not necessarily the food they farmed and ate. \u201cWhat we think is going on is that humans were becoming less active, more sedentary,\u201d Chirchir said. \u201cPeople were adopting farming, domesticating animals. That reduction in physical activity is what\u2019s resulted in this light skeleton.\u201d\n\nSource: Chirchir H, Kivell TL, Ruff CB, Hublin JJ, Carlson KJ, and Zipfel B, et al.
