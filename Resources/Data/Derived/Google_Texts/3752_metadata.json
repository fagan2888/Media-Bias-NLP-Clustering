It is much more lucrative than any other DROP program for state and other city employees.\n\nNo other police and fire pension fund in the state offers such lavish guarantees - money on top of a regular pension, potentially for life.\n\nAnd no other large municipal pension fund in the state is in such dire financial shape as the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund , which is $1.65 billion in debt and is so underfunded that the city's bond ratings have suffered.\n\n\"Our pension benefits are so generous that we really are creating millionaires,\" City Councilman Bill Gulliford said.\n\nPolice and firefighters say they have worked hard for these benefits, which were negotiated long ago and approved by the City Council .\n\nThe DROP program allows police officers and firefighters with just 20 years of service the chance to put five years of future pension checks into what amounts to a secondary, high-interest retirement account while they continue to work and draw their regular pay.\n\nMost Florida cities require their retirees to take their DROP earnings with them when they officially leave work.\n\nNot in Jacksonville .\n\nThe program is so enticing that only a handful of retirees each year decide to withdraw their DROP earnings to spend or invest on their own.\n\nThe rest, between 80 and 130 or so retirees a year, know their earnings will double, triple, even quadruple if they play it safe and invest their money here, in a troubled pension fund that has taxpayers acting as a bank when the stock market falters.TAXPAYERS HAVE ALL THE RISK\n\nThe Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund has been good for retirees.\n\nJohn Keane , the executive administrator over the fund, became the leading advocate for enhanced benefits for police officers and firefighters. Deal, as one of the fund's trustees, helped to secure them.\n\nSince the 1990s, police and firefighters gained progressively better benefits, leading to this: the ability to retire after just 20 years at any age, a 3 percent cost-of-living increase on the pensions, a supplement to help pay for insurance costs in retirement and the creation of the DROP program.\n\nThis DROP program was supposed to be cost-neutral when the Internal Revenue Service signed off on the Jacksonville plan 15 years ago.\n\nIt has been anything but that.\n\nA bad year of trading on Wall Street means nothing to Deal and other retired police and firefighters, thanks to long-ago negotiated deals between former Mayor John Delaney and the pension fund - where Deal served as a decision-making trustee for 17 years.\n\nSeven times in the 15 years DROP has been offered, taxpayers were forced to make up the difference when the market value of the pension fund's returns fell below 8.4 percent.\n\nConsidering that most retirees are paid from their DROP accounts in equal, set amounts 26 times a year, the payouts and the guaranteed growth of 8.4 percent on the remaining balance of their accounts offer a much better return than a savings account, U.S. Treasury bonds, many mutual funds and stock investments.\n\nDuring the worst of the recession between late 2007 and late 2008, when taxpayers saw their 401(k) funds and stock portfolios obliterated, the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund had market returns of negative 16.12 percent.\n\nTaxpayers made up that loss and then added 8.4 percent for a total payout of nearly 25 percent that year.\n\nCity finance officials did not want to comment on the matter but did acknowledge in an email that they do not know what it cost taxpayers that year, or for any of the other six years when the market did not deliver the promised 8.4 percent.\n\nOthers who have studied Jacksonville's long-standing pension promises and the economic fallout of those promises do talk. And they are usually slack-jawed by the numbers from The Florida Times- Union analysis of DROP.\n\nThe newspaper found that a group of 16 who retired last month are being promised more than $11 million collectively in future payouts just from their DROP accounts. That does not include what they'll take home from their regular pensions.\n\n\"There's nowhere on the planet that I am aware of that offers such a high, compounded rate of return that is guaranteed over decades. Where can I - and the rest of the Jacksonville taxpayers, for that matter - sign up?\" asked Tom Majdanics, a Jacksonville resident who has followed the city's attempt at pension reform closely.\n\nWhile retirees are protected when the market performs poorly, taxpayers are not. They absorb the risk without ever getting paid back in better years.\n\n\"It's fleecing the taxpayers,\" Majdanics said.\n\nJacksonville's version of DROP also allows the retirees to leverage time.\n\nThe longer the money is invested in the pension fund, the more money the retiree makes, regardless of the true value of the investments.\n\nIn other words, the balance on the account grows 8.4 percent for 20, 30 or even 50 years while the retiree draws guaranteed payments 26 times a year. 'MILLIONAIRES NEXT DOOR'\n\nDeal decided to invest and draw on his DROP account over the next 25 years.\n\nOn top of his regular pension, Deal will draw more than $52,000 a year from his DROP account. By being able to have his pension funds in a high-interest account for five years before he retired, what would have been a $546,585 pension for his 35 years at the Sheriff's Office will become $1.3 million , a difference of $762,034 .\n\nAt the end of his DROP plan in June 2039 , Deal will have collected $4.9 million in combined pension and DROP benefits. His DROP benefits end that year, but his pension will continue; he is due to receive $210,845 in 2040. He will receive an additional 3 percent every year after that.\n\nMost employees who retired in July decided to invest and draw from their DROP accounts over the next 30 years. One chose 42.6 years.\n\nTwo people who retired in the spring, one a firefighter and the other a police officer, opted to invest and draw from their accounts for more than 50 years. In doing so, they will have been paid four times the amounts they would have received had they taken lump sums.\n\nIf they die sooner, the payments will continue, passed to surviving spouses, children and even grandchildren if they are named in the deceased retiree's trust.\n\nFormer Fire Capt. Edward Brackett is just 44 and retired after 25 years of service.\n\nHis DROP account had a balance of $326,866.68 when he left work in March. He has asked to draw on that account for the next 51.5 years. The pension fund - or taxpayers, depending on the stock market - will pay Brackett $1,070 every other week from his DROP account.\n\nAll the while, Brackett will receive a regular pension, which now is almost $60,000 annually.\n\nBy the time Brackett is done collecting from his DROP account, he will be 95, should he live that long.\n\nBy then, he and/or whomever his trust is passed on to, will have received $1,432,796 because he was in DROP.\n\nVanessa Bass , a former police officer who is 45, chose the same option after working with the Sheriff's Office for 25 years. She's turning her $244,243.04 DROP account into $1,070,624 over the next 51.5 years.\n\nJust between the two of them, that is $1.93 million more than the lump-sum pension payouts other Florida cities would have required them to take.\n\n\"This is just totally ridiculous,\" said Dominic Calabro , president and chief executive officer of Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan taxpayer research institute and government watchdog.\n\n\"Generous is not even a word for it,\" Calabro said. \"It is dysfunctional. We don't know of any pension system in the United States that has such ridiculous and unbelievable [perks]. Many of these folks become the millionaires next door.\"\n\nMany like Calabro say the time is now - not in 30 years, as Mayor Alvin Brown proposes - to drop DROP.\n\nThe City Council likely will discuss just that in the coming weeks, when it votes on a plan that Brown and the pension fund hammered out months ago.\n\n\"This is absolutely preposterous,\" Gulliford said.\n\nGulliford said those who have tried to rein in out-of-control pension costs - currently costing taxpayers $153 million this year with an anticipated pledge of another $40 million a year for more than a decade - received significant pushback from the pension fund and union members.\n\n\"They think they should be guaranteed something,\" he said. \"Anyone who has any fiscal responsibility and fiscal acumen would say that this is crazy.\n\n\"I'm not so sure the agreement on the table is in the best interest of the taxpayers. We could pass this thing that is on the table only to have people in my position 10 years from now say, 'Wow we are in a bad or worse position.' \"HOW IT WORKS\n\nThe rationale behind DROP varies.\n\nSome believe it is an incentive to keep employees on the job, giving them a reason to stick around at least 20 years so that there isn't a brain drain caused by an exodus of seasoned employees.\n\nOthers say it is an incentive to rid the public sector of what are typically higher-paying jobs because only those police and firefighters with at least 20 years of service can apply for the DROP in Jacksonville .\n\nOn one point, there is no debate: DROP is lucrative.\n\nThe police officer or a firefighter who hits the 20-year service mark has three options: Enroll in DROP, wait to enroll, or opt out.\n\nThere is no record of police and firefighters who have opted out of DROP after meeting the eligibility requirements.\n\nEnrolling in DROP is a pledge that the police officer or firefighter officially will leave the job within a specified time frame, up to five years.\n\nDeal went with the maximum time, five years.\n\nAs a senior-level employee, Deal was entitled to a pension of 80 percent of his average monthly salary of the previous two years.\n\nThe DROP payments put into Deal's account almost immediately started compounding interest annually at 8.4 percent.\n\nIn January 2010 , after Deal entered DROP, his regular pension in that account was given a 3 percent cost-of-living boost and again his payments compounded annually at 8.4 percent.\n\nThat scenario happened again and again until July, when Deal, 59, and who by then had worked for the department 35 years, hit the maximum allotted time he could be in DROP - five years.\n\nOn July 4 , he retired, leaving more than a half million dollars in the police and fire pension fund.\n\nDeal's earnings will grow just as they did when he entered DROP in July 2009 .\n\nFor 2015, Deal will have earned $153,045 in pension benefits between his regular $100,701 pension and $52,344 from his DROP account. Deal's top income earned when working was $109,221 .\n\nDeal's regular pension in 2016 will grow by 3 percent. On top of that, again he will receive $52,344 from DROP. In fact, Deal will receive $52,344 from DROP every year until his account runs dry in mid-2039. At the same time, his regular pension will grow 3 percent a year.\n\nThat means by 2030, 15 1/2 years from now, Deal's combined pension benefits will be $209,233 . For his last year in the DROP program - which ends in June 2039 - he will receive $231,017 in combined benefits.\n\nBy then, Deal would have been paid $4.9 million .\n\nDeal says the current retirement perk, DROP, is better than what police had before.\n\n\"What we had before was the drop-dead plan,\" Deal said. \"What we were doing is having people work until they dropped dead. They couldn't afford to walk out the door.\"MANY RETIREES\n\nDeal is far from alone as a retiree making more a year than those still working at the Sheriff's Office .\n\nHe was one of 16 police officers and firefighters who retired last month and have opted to keep the bulk - or all - of their DROP accounts in the pension fund.\n\nThe value of all of these 16 DROP accounts last month was $4,538,207 . By the time the retirees finish drawing from these DROP accounts, the amount actually paid out to just 16 retirees will mushroom to $11,651,142 , thanks to the annual 8.4 percent guaranteed by taxpayers.\n\nThat's a difference of $7.11 million that taxpayers must pick up should the market not produce 8.4 percent annual returns on investments.\n\n\"That is an incredible amount that would go to just a few [retired] employees,\" said Clay Yarborough , the council president. \"That is the exact reason that we need a different plan in place.\"\n\nThe 16 July retirees provide a snapshot of the future as the city grapples with getting pension costs under control.\n\nAt a relatively low 80 retirees a year, that means that if the other retirees realize similar-sized payouts to the $11.65 million committed to the July DROP retirees, about $58.25 million would be committed to DROP payouts from one year's retirees alone.\n\nSimilar commitments could be expected every year.\n\n\"It wouldn't surprise me,\" City Councilman John Crescimbeni said of the promised payouts for just 16 retirees. \"It's a contractual obligation the City Council approved.\"\n\nThe DROP and pension program rattled businessman and former Mayor John Peyton , who was elected after Delaney struck the deal with the pension fund.\n\nPeyton did not return repeated phone messages left on his cellphone over the last few weeks.\n\nBut others recall that Peyton spoke frequently and fervently at businessmen's luncheons about the perils of the lucrative perks given to the employees.\n\nHis passion and campaign promises to end these lucrative deals essentially got him aggravation and no real change.\n\nLike Peyton, Mayor Alvin Brown</person> suggested early on he wanted to see aggressive changes to police officers' and firefighters' pensions.\n\nUnder the mayor's proposal, DROP is essentially dead, but only for future employees.\n\nSeveral City Council members say the deal Brown cut with Keane didn't go far enough.JACKSONVILLE UNIQUE\n\nThe financial rewards of the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund's DROP program are so seductive that at least 80 and possibly 90 percent of all police and firefighters who entered DROP kept their money in the fund because of the guaranteed interest.\n\nOf the 18 who retired in July, just two decided not to keep their money in the pension fund.\n\n\"There is nowhere else [in the market] you can get that guarantee payment,\" said Chris Draughon , an analyst with First Coast Wealth Advisors of St. Augustine .\n\nBy comparison among safe investments, U.S. Treasury Bonds yield 2.4 percent.\n\nKeane said the 8.4 percent guarantee was not some far-fetched figure; it was consistent with the market conditions when DROP was first considered in Jacksonville in the late 1990s, which was a time of rapid stock market investment growth.\n\nMarket investment returns for the pension fund between 1996 and 1997 were 22.33 percent.\n\nA year later, when City Council approved the measure, the market return rate was just 1.67 percent.\n\nDROP officially was offered in January 1999 , a time when market returns picked up.\n\nFor the next two years, DROP experienced negative returns, requiring taxpayers to make up the difference plus 8.4 percent.\n\nThe market has fluctuated greatly over the years, with last year's investment returns hitting 22.3 percent.\n\nKeane and Deal said it's important to remember that retirees are not getting those high returns in the good years.\n\nThey are in Fort Lauderdale .\n\nAnd they also feel the sting when the market tanks.\n\n\"If the plan makes 10 percent, they make 10 percent. If the plan loses 10 percent, they lose 10 percent. There are no guarantees,\" said Fred Nesbitt , director of the public information over Fort Lauderdale's police and fire pension fund.\n\nMost large municipal pension plans require the retirees to roll their DROP accounts into private investments or take lump sums once they finish work and the DROP program.\n\nMark Bogush , board chairman of the Tampa Police and Fire Pension Fund , said if the same perks were offered his retirees, the ability to guarantee 8.4 percent rate after DROP, there would be a stampede of retirees investing their money in his Tampa pension fund.\n\n\"If we could do that, I bet 80 percent would do the same,\" Bogush said.\n\nBut they can't.A 'NO-BRAINER'\n\nJacksonville's police and fire pension fund is $1.65 billion in debt.\n\nRight now, about 43 cents is available in assets for every dollar promised to retirees.\n\nThe cost rises with DROP.\n\nJarmon Welch , the pension fund's Atlanta -based consultant who prepares the actuarial valuation report each year, said he looks at current values of what is owed because of DROP.\n\nAs of 2013, that value was more than $247 million , a huge jump from just four years earlier - the earliest year on record - when it was about $170 million .\n\nA review of the DROP account balance from 2009 to 2013 shows a significant increase each year - typically about $20 million a year because more people are entering the DROP.\n\n\"I pretty well figured [the DROP] was a bad deal,\" Gulliford said. \"But the fact that they don't take into consideration [the future payouts] only tells me that the hole is deeper than we think it is.\"\n\nFilling that hole may be difficult, because there has been a steady stream of police officers and firefighters entering the program.\n\nIn DROP's inaugural year, 319 police officers and firefighters signed up. At that time, the average age of those entering DROP was 53 and the average police officer or firefighter had put in 28 years of work.\n\nToday, the average soon-to-be retiree is 48 and has put in 21 years.\n\nIn other words, they are signing up younger and after fewer years worked.\n\nThrough the early to mid-2000s, between 44 and 61 people entered each year. Starting in 2010, at least 105 entered each year.\n\nToday, 554 police officers and firefighters are in the first phase of DROP, meaning they still go to work each day while their pensions earn interest for up to five years before the employees are eligible to collect them.\n\nAs for the retirees who will continue to collect the taxpayer- guaranteed pension supplements for another 5, 30, or even 51 1/2 years?\n\nThere are 880 of them.\n\n\"It's a no-brainer,\" Crescimbeni said. \"You have a 8.4 percent return and your principal is never at risk.\n\n\"You cannot find that in the real world, and I don't know of a single person who wouldn't want to invest in the DROP if they had that opportunity. It's a super, super deal.\"CHANGE A LONG WAY OFF\n\nThat deal could be a thing of the past for future hires.\n\nBut the major potential money-saving changes to DROP that Brown negotiated with the pension fund won't be seen for at least 30 years. That's the earliest any new hires after the plan is approved could retire.\n\nUnder the plan, DROP as it is now will look so different that it essentially drops DROP altogether.\n\nThere is one change that, if approved, would have a slight impact on current DROP participants - having returns change from a fixed rate to a variable rate ranging from 5 to 10 percent.\n\nThat means if the stock market experiences a loss, the DROP recipient would get 5 percent interest instead of 8.4 percent. If market returns are at 6 percent, the DROP recipient would get 6 percent. If the market performs at better than 8.4 percent, the DROP participant would get the higher rate, but no higher than 10 percent.\n\nKeane estimated the cost savings to be about $200,000 a year, saying there was a great deal of time devoted to a relatively minor tweak in the program.\n\nChris Hand , the mayor's chief of staff, objected, saying the proposed changes for old and new employees are significant.\n\nNot so, said Majdanics, the Jacksonville pension observer. He said the pension reform plan did not go far enough.\n\nThe future, he said, looks pretty bleak for taxpayers and the city's overall vitality considering the volume of police officers and firefighters who could qualify eventually for DROP.\n\n\"There are more than 2,600 who could reap the benefits of this ill-conceived, financially destructive DROP perk,\" Majdanics said. \"Without any changes, it will predictably bleed our city budget over the next 50 to 60 years. Yet the so-called comprehensive pension reform agreement before the City Council neglects to address this gaping problem right now.\n\n\"Our city finances need a blood transfusion. The negotiated agreement asks current employees to donate a few drops [of blood] to solve the pension problem while the taxpayers are expected to give quarts.\" [email protected], (904) 359-4104THE MILLIONAIRE COP NEXT DOORHow do Jacksonville police officers and firefighters earn millions in retirement? Here's how the numbers add up for former assistant police chief Bobby Deal:DEAL'S PENSION$3.6 MILLIONPolice and firefighters who served for 25 years retire with a pension equal to 70 percent of their salary. Deal will receive $3.6 million in pension payments if he lives until 2039. His payments start at $101,701 in 2015 and increase by 3 percent a year, guaranteed.DEAL'S DROP PAYOFF$1.3 MILLIONIn addition to a regular pension, the city offers the DROP program to police and firefighters.8.4%Guaranteed return: The DROP program guarantees retirees an 8.4 percent interest rate regardless of stock market performance. If the stock market falls short, as it has done for 7 of the last 15 years, taxpayers have to make up the difference. But taxpayers don't get paid back when the stock market performs well.In Deal's case, he is to receive an additional $52,344 a year over his regular pension because of the DROP program. The money is guaranteed through 2039 and will go to his relatives or trust if he dies before then. $153 ,045Making more in retirement: That means that Deal, who never earned more than about $109,000 a year as assistant police chief, will collect $153,045 in his first year of retirement.JULY RETIREESHow 16 July retirees are turning $4 million from their drop accounts into $11 million *\n\nDROP Payout Name retirement in years Total DROP payoutsMark Beebe $224,194 30 $614,624 Leroy Brantley $303,034 30 $830 ,762Dewitt Cooper Jr. $237,124 25 $567 ,716Bobby Deal $546,584 25 $1,308 ,619Micheal Edwards $571,829 30 $1,370 ,740Cathy Griffin $253,834 35 $788 ,141Ronald Jenkins $250,338 30 $686 ,298Stephen Lee $275,532 30 $755 ,367David Makauskas $244,720 15 $430 ,790Wayne Miller $269,233 20 $556 ,264Glen Palmer $250,622 25 $600 ,034Bobby Smith $100,000 42.6 $368 ,199William Smith $150,000 20 $309 ,914Thomas Staples $360,248 30 $839 ,576Timothy Thomas $274,825 25 $657 ,982Ronald Thompson $305,913 36 $972,110 * Not all 16 retirees invested the full amounts of the DROP accounts back into the troubled Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund .
