On his Monday radio show, conservative talk show host Mark Levin reacted to the weekend’s passage of the so-called CR/omnibus spending bill, which wasn’t well received by Levin.

“I want to tell the Republican leadership, the RNC, the NRSC, the NCCC, the NAACP — whatever they call themselves in the Republican Party — I am one inch away from leaving you. And I bet I speak for hundreds of thousands of people. One inch. You think this is a joke? You think you can lie to the American people?”

The source of that ire also dealt with the refusal by some Republicans refusing to back the effort Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) to question the constitutionality of that particular bill.

“Do you think you can lie to … conservatives about how you’re going to defund Obamacare, run millions of dollars on ads on that to get re-elected, on how you’re going to fight unconstitutional amnesty?” Levin added. “Tooth and nail? You think you can lie to us with impunity? And repeatedly? I don’t care how many millionaires and billionaires you have in your damn back pocket.”
