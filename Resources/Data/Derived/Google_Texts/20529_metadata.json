A widow and mother, she fights for patient empowerment through her paintings, writing and even her Twitter. (Follow her. You won\u2019t regret it.) She is also the mind (and paintbrush) behind the Walking Gallery, a movement devoted to patients and healthcare leaders wearing their stories on their backs, literally. She took the time to answer some questions regarding the changing healthcare landscape, her favorite healthcare moment of 2013 and of course, her work.\n\nHow did you become involved full time as an activist-artist? What did you do before? What inspired you to become an activist?\n\nI became a full time activist artist five days after my husband Fred Holliday II died from the effects of kidney cancer. Before becoming an activist I worked in retail sales for 16 years, taught pre-K fine art for five years and painted neighborhood murals.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite piece of art you\u2019ve created for patients\u2019 rights? Why?\n\n73 Cents. Not only is it a monument to my late husband it spread the word about the importance of patient data access around the world.\n\nHow do you envision your art impacting the healthcare landscape?\n\nThe art I do helps explain complex health policy and sometimes helps shape it.\n\nWhat project are you most looking forward to? Why?\n\nThat is sort of like asking a parent about their favorite child. . . . I look forward to watching The Walking Gallery grow more in both numbers and depth.\n\nHow do you begin each painting? Do you start with an idea or an image?\n\nThat depends on the project. On Gallery jackets I research the walker online as well as read the story that they have sent. I then wait for the image to come that explains their life and mission. On conference paintings I listen to speakers and attendees and the image comes from the content seen through the prism of the patient view.\n\nWhat other art projects excite you that are empowering patients?\n\nI love what Ross Martin is doing with the The American College of Medical Informatimusicology. I know it is helping folks embrace the power of music in medicine and information technology.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest patients rights challenges for the medtech industry?\n\nEducating the populace on the new rights afforded in data access based on new technology.\n\nWhat is one simple way each of us can promote patient empowerment?\n\nEvery time you write or present try to include the patient experience by sharing your experience or the experience of others.\n\nYou attend many of the biggest conferences for healthcare, meet the movers and shakers\u2013you\u2019ve even spoken at the White House. What are the biggest trends you\u2019ve seen in healthcare in 2013?\n\nThe focus on BlueButton is a good thing for patients. The OCR\u2019s decision to go after data withholders continues to be great tool for patients to claim access. The decision of more and more facilities to embrace open notes (link added) will directly affect patient outcomes.\n\nWhat\u2019s been your favorite healthcare moment of 2013 so far?\n\nEric Topol\u2019s speech at HIMSS.
