Tune into TV ONE. The network recently announced an Empire binge-a-thon on May 14. TV ONE will air 17 back-to-back episodes beginning at 9 a.m. on Saturday. \u201cEMPIRE is one of those cultural phenomena that seem to come along very rarely in television\u2019s history,\u201d said Brad Siegel, TV One\u2019s President, in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a game changer. We are so excited to give fans the opportunity to indulge in all the FABULOUSNESS of every episode of this season on one day. We expect a lot of EMPIRE fans will not be leaving their homes during this Saturday\u2019s binge-a-thon.\u201d In conjunction with the binge-a-thon, the network will share the biggest fan moments on television and on social media as part of their \u201cTV One is The Ultimate Fan\u201d campaign.\n\nFederal Judge Rules in Favor of Republicans in Obamacare Spending Challenge\n\nPresident Obama and his administration took a major blow on Thursday after a federal judge ruled that the administration\u2019s choice to fund a part of the Obamacare law was conducted unlawfully. The decision was a major triumph for House Republicans. U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer decided the \u201creimbursements paid to issuers of qualified health plans for the cost-sharing reductions mandated\u201d should be stopped until Congress finds \u201can appropriation for such payments.\u201d The case was focused on Section 1401 and Section 1402 under the law. Section 1401 gives tax credits so that individuals can afford insurance, and 1402 lowers the cost of deductibles and co-pays. \u201cSuch appropriations are an integral part of our constitutional checks and balances, insofar as they tie the Executive Branch to the Legislative Branch via purse strings,\u201d said Judge Collyer. President Obama\u2019s administration stated, \u201cSections 1401 and 1402 are economically and programmatically integrated. A contrary reading of the amended appropriations statute, they contend, would yield absurd economic, fiscal, and healthcare-policy results.\u201d Read more.\n\nMichael Jordan Isn\u2019t a Fan of His Crying Meme\n\nA meme of NBA legend Michael Jordan crying has been circulating around the web, and although his reps say Jordan thinks it\u2019s funny, his former teammate Charles Oakley has another story. \u201cWe think it\u2019s funny,\u201d said Michael Jordan\u2019s rep in a statement. \u201cEveryone seems to be having fun with it.\u201d Oakley begged to differ. \u201cNah, he don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is what it is.
