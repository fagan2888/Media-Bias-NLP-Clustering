She chose not to attend a 'debate' this week, ceding an hour of statewide airtime to her surging Republican opponent, Thom Tillis. Her chair sat empty throughout the forum. What didn't she want to discuss? Perhaps it was her decision to skip a key classified briefing on ISIS in favor of a New York City fundraiser. Or maybe it was the explosion of reports that her immediate family benefited directly from the \"stimulus\" law she voted for. It could have been President Obama's endorsement of candidates like Hagan as strong supporters of his agenda in Washington; the extent of Hagan's fealty was underscored again in yesterday's CQ analysis of 2014 voting records:\n\n\n\n\n\n.@kayhagan goes 118/119 in supporting Obama on Senate votes where Obama had a position. She disagrees only on PA judge (vote 87) @CQnow \u2014 Shawn Zeller (@shawnzeller) October 22, 2014\n\nNorth Carolina's largest health insurer says rates will rise by more than 13 percent on average next year for buyers of individual Affordable Care Act policies. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina discussed the prices Wednesday. As an example, the insurer cited a typical rate for a 45-year-old man in the Raleigh area who doesn't smoke...Aside from ACA plans, the insurer is maintaining pre-existing plans that don't conform to the Affordable Care Act's requirements but customers wanted to keep. Rates for those plans will rise by an average of 13 to 19 percent, depending on when they were sold.\n\nWith companies set to face fines next year for not complying with the new mandate to offer health insurance, some are pursuing strategies like enrolling employees in Medicaid to avoid penalties and hold down costs. The health law\u2019s penalties, which can amount to about $2,000 per employee, were supposed to start this year, but the Obama administration delayed them until 2015, when they take effect for firms that employ at least 100 people. Now, as employers race to find ways to cover their full-time workers while holding a lid on costs, insurance brokers and benefits administrators are pitching a variety of options, sometimes exploiting wrinkles in the law...the company, which is based in Hartford, Conn., hopes to reduce its costs by offering eligible employees a chance to enroll in Medicaid, using a contractor called BeneStream Inc. to help them sign up. The government program is more affordable for employees and saves money for Locals 8, said Chief Executive Al Gamble. \u201cThe burden gets shifted to Medicaid,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sticker shock..05/26/2016 6:05:12AM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Sticker shock.", "title": "Guy Benson - Obamacare: Largest NC Insurer Announces Double-Digit Premium Increases", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/10/23/obamacare-major-nc-insurer-announces-doubledigit-premium-increases-n1908643", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/282/09e46cee-187e-4de0-b140-f27ac44b27a7.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Sticker shock.", "title": "Guy Benson - Obamacare: Largest NC Insurer Announces Double-Digit Premium Increases", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/10/23/obamacare-major-nc-insurer-announces-doubledigit-premium-increases-n1908643", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/282/09e46cee-187e-4de0-b140-f27ac44b27a7.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obamacare: Largest NC Insurer Announces Double-Digit Premium Increases, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a85\"", "article_summary": "The government program is more affordable for employees and saves money for Locals 8, said Chief Executive Al Gamble.\nRates for those plans will rise by an average of 13 to 19 percent, depending on when they were sold.\nShe chose not to attend a 'debate' this week, ceding an hour of statewide airtime to her surging Republican opponent, Thom Tillis.\nIt's been a tough week for North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan, who's clinging to a razor-thin lead in her re-election fight.\nPerhaps it was her decision to skip a key classified briefing on ISIS in favor of a New York City fundraiser."}
