Photo by Arlene Karno\n\nAs students settle into their school routines, at least one student is already thinking of next semester.\n\nTy Moura, the new Associated Students president, has already put in motion several initiatives to help the student body. With a plan for implementing \u201caffordability, sustainability and awareness,\u201d Moura wants to build on the Santa Monica College community.\n\nMoura has started working on campaign promises such as lowering fees for student identification cards and prices in the cafeteria.\n\n\u201cWe already got a deal going with Eat Street where they\u2019re serving this six-inch sub with chips and drink for like $6.50,\u201d said Moura.\n\nLooking for a more affordable and healthier campus, Moura said she considers this deal just a \u201clittle part of the goal.\u201d\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Moura went around to local businesses looking for deals to expand SMC\u2019s discount network, while in return rewarding any cooperative business with advertisement space within the Cayton Center. The AS already has businesses like restaurants, a bike repair shop, and a car wash lined up for the discounts, Moura said.\n\n\u201cWe even have a doctor,\u201d she said.\n\nA main focus of her agenda is that students enroll for subsidized health care from the government. She said that the Affordable Care Act can be a great service to students in need of health care.\n\nAlthough Moura has been busy putting all of these plans into action, she is not alone when working on such projects.\n\nAlexander Van Dertol, AS vice president who works alongside Moura, said they are trying to push ideas that will give students a bigger voice and encourage them to be more involved in SMC.\n\nVan Dertol said he is is also working on a civic engagement program, where students can search for volunteer opportunities instead of an individual going and getting turned down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have some sway as an institution rather than an individual trying to break into the volunteer world themselves,\u201d said Van Dertol.\n\nThe program would also reward individuals for exceptional volunteering.\n\nVan Dertol mentioned that his goal is to \u201cpromote more long-term goals\u201d for the students, rather than settling for immediate satisfaction.\n\nMoura said she wants to be able to help students become more engaged with each other while creating a better atmosphere around the campus.\n\n\u201cI feel that a way for you to get engaged and involved is by making friends that are engaged and involved,\u201d said Moura.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Corsair", "description": "As students settle into their school routines, at least one student is already thinking of next semester.
