Reuters\n\nIn a move that will hopefully offset the tremendous burden of medical marijuana costs and allay Catholics\u2019 fears over drug consumption, the Italian army will be spearheading a pilot project in the coming year in which it will grow the country\u2019s entire supply of marijuana.\n\nAs the system stands now, Italian citizens looking to end joint pain or the occasional bout of insomnia must shell out 38 euros per gram or roughly 1,000 euros per ounce of cannabis at their doctors\u2019 office. These rates soar high above the typical street prices, which can run for at least eight times cheaper than prescriptions. High costs of import and regulation often drive up the prices.\n\nOffsetting the cost by growing the plant within Italian borders isn\u2019t so simple. Most of the population is Catholic, and the Catholic Church has explicitly admonished the use of recreational drugs alongside so-called \u201csubstitute drugs,\u201d which, in June, Pope Francis rejected as \u201ca veiled means of surrendering\u201d to one\u2019s health concerns. To keep marijuana costs down, experts argue politics must stay out of it.\n\nCannabis \u201cis a very effective medicine, but since it's also a drug... there's always fear to use it,\u201d Umberto Veronesi, a former health minister and Italian cancer physician told Reuters. \u201cThe same thing happened with morphine, which for years no one would prescribe for the poor patients who were suffering terribly.\u201d\n\nThe solution: Satisfy both concerns and remove the plant from the public sphere altogether. Agricultural scientist Gianpaolo Grassi, dubbed Italy\u2019s top cannabis expert, will be adding to his already sizable 70-hectare growing farm, located approximately 40 miles outside Venice, with the new military project. Grassi\u2019s farm is the only place in the country permitted to grow marijuana outdoors. Since 2002, he\u2019s experimented with more than 300 strains of medical marijuana.\n\nFor all the project\u2019s ingenuity in keeping people happy, the Italian government has already come down against full legalization. Marijuana\u2019s trajectory in the United States has been predictable on a nationwide scale: a state moves from banning the drug to decriminalizing it or legalizing its medicinal use, to the most extreme cases of Colorado and Washington legalizing full recreational use. In Italy, pot\u2019s future has already been written, according to some officials.\n\n\u201cCuring sick people does not become an excuse to expand the use of the substance,\" said Senator Carlo Giovanardi, an outspoken Catholic anti-drug campaigner, to Reuters. Giovanardi added the country\u2019s government does not want a \u201csociety of zombies\u201d roaming the streets.\n\nThe science behind medical marijuana suggests Giovanardi\u2019s fears are largely unfounded. Undead Italians aside, research into cannabis\u2019s therapeutic effects have been robust given the constraints within which the research has been conducted. Marijuana has been shown to decrease patients\u2019 inflammation in cases of arthritis, joint pain, inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, and promote hunger among people suffering from anorexia nervosa.\n\nItalian officials predict the new growing project will help cut the high costs associated with buying medical marijuana. Even with a prescription, consumers are covering the growing costs, the costs to test it for purity, and the costs to import the product from the Netherlands to Italy. At a news conference last month, Italian Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin said it would be up to the states to decide how much to charge patients. So far about 20 regions have agreed to offer it for free.\n\nAnd Grassi, after a career of advocating for the plant\u2019s benefits, agrees the solution is a logical one that even the most devout will accept. \u201cSome political decisions are tied to country's Catholic mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes growing medical cannabis agreeable for everyone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medical, marijuana, be, grown, italian, army, sake, ailing, consumers, wallets", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mix of religious concerns and high import costs have driven scientists to come up with a compromise to grow marijuana.", "title": "The Italian Army Is Now In Charge Of The Country's Weed", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-marijuana-be-grown-italian-army-sake-ailing-consumers-wallets-306869", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mix of religious concerns and high import costs have driven scientists to come up with a compromise to grow marijuana.", "title": "The Italian Army Is Now In Charge Of The Country's Weed", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-marijuana-be-grown-italian-army-sake-ailing-consumers-wallets-306869", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-13T11:07:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-13T11:07:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A mix of religious concerns and high import costs have driven scientists to come up with a compromise to grow marijuana."}, "article_summary": "A mix of religious concerns and high import costs have driven scientists to come up with a compromise to grow marijuana.\nItalian officials predict the new growing project will help cut the high costs associated with buying medical marijuana.\nSince 2002, he\u2019s experimented with more than 300 strains of medical marijuana.\nThe science behind medical marijuana suggests Giovanardi\u2019s fears are largely unfounded.\nTo keep marijuana costs down, experts argue politics must stay out of it."}
