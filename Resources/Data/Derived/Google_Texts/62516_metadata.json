I like to imagine the DNC\u2019s lifelike talking points robot is delivering a hastily prepared rewrite of the thoughts in her head while the truth wreaks havoc of Godzilla-esque proportions just behind her eyes. Imagine administration deadlines getting blown apart like so many model skyscrapers as she speaks.\n\nREINCE PREIBUS: The question that\u2019s on the table right now is which person that\u2019s running as a Democrat in these targeted states, who? \u2013 WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: All of our candidates PRIEBUS: Mary Landrieu, who? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: All of our candidates are able to run on the provisions of Obamacare. PRIEBUS: But you won\u2019t say it. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I just said it. PRIEBUS: Ok, so they\u2019re going to run on Obamacare? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: All of our candidates will be able to use Obamacare as an advantage. PRIEBUS: Great. Excellent.\n\nWasserman Schultz follows up by telling one of those mythic success stories of \u201ca woman\u201d under Obamacare. Priebus is doubtful this will trump what polling shows about Obamacare in Montana, Arkansas, South Dakota, etc. Someone better tell Senate Democrats they\u2019re supposed to be running on this thing, not away from it. Lost in translation, I suppose.\n\nPRIEBUS: And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re going to run on Obamacare.\n\nNow, that\u2019s a line that doesn\u2019t require any translation.\n\nPreviously:\n\n\u201cI think Democrats will run on Obamacare next year\u201d\n\n\u201cI meant what I said: We\u2019re running on Obamacare next year\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Yes, please.", "title": "Wasserman Shultz apparently still doing this \u201cWe will run on Obamacare\u201d thing", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/03/dws-apparently-still-doing-this-we-will-run-on-obamacare-thing/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-04T03:01:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-04T03:05:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Previously:\u201cI think Democrats will run on Obamacare next year\u201d\u201cI meant what I said: We\u2019re running on Obamacare next year\u201d\n\u2013 WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: All of our candidates PRIEBUS: Mary Landrieu, who?\nREINCE PREIBUS: The question that\u2019s on the table right now is which person that\u2019s running as a Democrat in these targeted states, who?\nWASSERMAN SCHULTZ: All of our candidates are able to run on the provisions of Obamacare.\nWasserman Schultz follows up by telling one of those mythic success stories of \u201ca woman\u201d under Obamacare."}
