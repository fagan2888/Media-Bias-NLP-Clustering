Attempting to court Sanders voters for the general election, Team Hillary continues to talk about lowering the high cost of college. Chelsea Clinton described this scenario:

An eight year old just asked me a question about paying for college. That shouldn't be a worry for a kid in America. https://t.co/pU8xS4Cp4d — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) May 13, 2016

Love it! What say you, Dems?

My 8 rr old asked how he is going to pay for Super Bowl tkts, so lets make Super Bowl tickets free.@ChelseaClinton https://t.co/rtg13xbgBr — Sean Owens (@the747captain) May 14, 2016
