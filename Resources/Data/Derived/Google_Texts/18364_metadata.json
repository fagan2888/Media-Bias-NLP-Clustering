It replays an interview in which Ms. Kirkpatrick declares that the health care law is the vote she is most proud of, while recounting problems with the new insurance coverage in Arizona, including premium increases and the withdrawal from the plan by a major insurer.\n\n\u201cWhile Kirkpatrick\u2019s proud of putting us at risk, John McCain is leading the fight to stop Obamacare,\u201d the female announcer says.\n\nMr. McCain\u2019s campaign has also established a new website hitting his Republican primary opponent Kelli Ward, a former state legislator, for various provocative statements and actions, leaving Mr. McCain punching in two directions. The primary election is not until Aug. 30, and Mr. McCain\u2019s decision to start attacking Ms. Kirkpatrick shows he is not willing to risk her getting a free pass until then.\n\nAware that Mr. McCain is increasingly seen as vulnerable in his fight for a sixth term, his campaign team issued a memo this week noting his sizable fund-raising advantage and extensive grass-roots organizing efforts.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160518060023, "twitter": {"description": "Facing a difficult race, Mr. McCain has released a television spot against Representative Ann
