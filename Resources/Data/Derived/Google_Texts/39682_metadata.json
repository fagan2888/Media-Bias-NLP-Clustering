It\u2019s coming back to Annapolis, Maryland, after a one-year hiatus.\n\n\u201cWe get to go to the White House this year and get our trophy back,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\nReynolds\u2019 second rushing TD was his 85th career score, the most for any FBS or FCS Division I player. Hoist that broom to the mast: Reynolds is the first QB to go 4 for 4 in a classic rivalry that began in 1890.\n\nNiumatalolo improved to 8-0 against the Black Knights two days before he is set to visit BYU to talk about the program\u2019s coaching vacancy.\n\nNiumatalolo, the winningest coach in Navy history, seemed focused with \u201cDamn The Torpedoes\u201d stitched on the back of his hat. But he had much more on his mind than just beating Army (2-10) again.\n\nHe could leave after eight seasons to follow his heart and his religion to BYU.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an institution, and we\u2019re certainly a football program, that\u2019s steeped in team and not about \u2018me.\u2019 All of a sudden, it\u2019s become about that,\u201d Navy athletic director Chet Gladchuk said.\n\nNiumatalolo danced \u2014 he at least tried to dab \u2014 in the locker room as players circled him and hollered in celebration.\n\nHe choked back tears discussing his faith-based decision to visit BYU. Niumatalolo is a Mormon who went on a two-year mission following his freshman year at the University of Hawaii.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my life,\u201d at Navy, he said. \u201cMy kids have grown up here. I\u2019ve given everything for his program.\u201d\n\nNiumatalolo tied former Army coach Earl \u201cRed\u201d Blaik (8-8-2) for most wins in the series.\n\nArmy coach Jeff Monken showed his program might be closing the gap on Navy \u2014 but blew any chance of an upset in the fourth.\n\nDaniel Grochowski missed a 29-yard field goal early in the quarter. Chris Carter lost a fumble at the Navy 34-yard that was recovered by linebacker Ted Colburn. Navy had two interceptions \u2014 one off a trick play \u2014 on two straight drives to preserve the lead. Army\u2019s Hail Mary on the final play of the game fell short.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our job at West Point, to build those warriors,\u201d Monken said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely positive we\u2019ve got a room full of guys in there that are going to find a way to win.\u201d\n\nReynolds, the game\u2019s MVP, showed why he was a late contender for Heisman Trophy consideration. Reynolds, the only player in team history with two 1,000-yard rushing and passing seasons, put the Mids up 21-17 with a 50-yard TD pass to Jamir Tillman late in the third.\n\nRoger Staubach, who won the 1963 Heisman Trophy at Navy, said he cast his vote for Reynolds.\n\nA three-touchdown favorite, Navy had it tougher than usual in one of the most storied rivalries in college sports. The Mids won the CIC trophy, awarded to the team with the best record in games among the three service academies. Navy beat Air Force 33-11 this season.\n\nArmy and Navy turned a game already stuffed with pomp and patriotism into a bit of a fashion show.\n\nNavy wore seven different hand-painted helmets that paid homage to seven of the ships that make up the U.S. Naval Fleet.\n\nArmy topped its rivals with 17 different helmets, representing the 17 branches cadets can enter after graduation.\n\nBilled as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Game,\u201d the Linc was stuffed with cadets and midshipmen standing, bouncing and cheering the entire game. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter attended and watched a half with each side.\n\nArmy came ready to pull an upset and snap the second-longest losing streak to one team of any uninterrupted FBS series.\n\nThe Black Knights got a field goal on the game\u2019s opening drive and Tyler Campbell scored on a 29-yard run make it 10-7 in the first.\n\nCarter hit Edgar Poe for a 39-yard TD pass with 2:08 left in the half to make it 17-14 and give Army its first halftime lead since 2009.\n\nArmy had a lead. It just didn\u2019t have Reynolds.\n\nReynolds scored on runs of 58 yards and 1 yard to keep Navy in the game, and then used his arm to find Tillman in the third for the lead.\n\nReynolds has a 31-13 career record as a starter and he is Navy\u2019s career leading rusher.\n\nArmy\u2019s season again ended with the loss. Navy plays Pittsburgh (8-4) in the Dec. 28 Military Bowl at Annapolis.\n\nNavy leads the series 60-49-7.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 21 Navy tops Army for 14th straight win in series", "title": "No. 21 Navy tops Army for 14th straight win in series", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/12/no-21-navy-tops-army-for-14th-straight-win-in-series/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__501137276p1.jpg", "height": 509}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__501137276p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-12T18:38:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:19:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ve given everything for his program.\u201dNiumatalolo tied former Army coach Earl \u201cRed\u201d Blaik (8-8-2) for most wins in the series.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 With perfection at stake, Keenan Reynolds ended his Navy career with a clean sweep against Army.\nNavy coach Ken Niumatalolo just might leave the academy the same way.\nArmy coach Jeff Monken showed his program might be closing the gap on Navy \u2014 but blew any chance of an upset in the fourth.\n21 Midshipmen to their 14th straight win over the Black Knights, 21-17 on Saturday at Lincoln Financial Field."}
