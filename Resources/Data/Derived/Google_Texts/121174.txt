In the coming weeks, the group expects thousands of requests for help so they will be bringing in extra crews.

Nearly everywhere you look there are tree limbs and branches that need cleanup from this weekend's ice storm. As is always the case when disaster hits, the Southern Baptist Convention Disaster Relief is stepping up to help.

A majority of workers started cleaning up branches and broken trees on Tuesday, now that most of the ice is gone. There was a buzz of activity, with all volunteers doing God's work by cleaning up Mother Nature's mess.

“We do it for the Lord,” said volunteer Jack McAlister.

They’re helping those like 91-year-old Fern.

“They were all so nice and no foul language and no acting up or anything,” she said. “They just got up there and worked.”

“Our preference is to help widows and elderly and people with disabilities, single-parent moms, also wives when their husbands are deployed overseas, but we’ll help anyone,” said Sam Porter, BGCO Disaster Relief Director.

In the coming weeks, the group expects thousands of requests for help so they will be bringing in extra crews.

“I’m hoping to have 15 on the ground by the end of the week,” said Porter.

But there is a lot to be done. And it will take a while.

“I’m hoping we can get everyone back in their own home by Christmas,” explained Porter.

It is a tremendous amount of work, and that's not lost by those on the receiving end.

“She was such a sweet lady and fixed us cookies afterward,” said McAlister of Fern. “We were just happy to be able to help.”

“I didn’t have to pay for it and I thought the cookies were such a small ‘thank you,’” said Fern.

Although volunteers have to go through a class to run the chain saws, BGCO is looking for volunteers to help clear branches. If you are interested in helping go to the First Baptist Church of Yukon.
