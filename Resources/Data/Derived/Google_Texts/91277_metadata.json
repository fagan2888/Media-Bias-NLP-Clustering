Cunningham talked about the Anderson Access to Care Coalition, and ways patients can avoid making multiple trips to the emergency room.\n\nBy Kirk Brown\n\nLynn Ferrell went to the emergency room at AnMed Health Medical Center last year because she \u201cjust was not feeling good at all.\u201d\n\nA doctor admitted Ferrell for an overnight stay at the Anderson hospital after discovering that she had dangerously high blood pressure. The 61-year-old Belton woman also was diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nIn December, AnMed officials enrolled Ferrell in the Anderson Access to Care Coalition, an initiative that is striving to keep uninsured patients from making repeated trips to the emergency room.\n\nSince then, her health has improved dramatically.\n\n\u201cI feel like a day at Disneyland,\u201d Ferrell said in an interview last week. \u201cI actually feel like getting out of bed in the morning.\u201d\n\nFerrell credits her health coach, AnMed nurse Lindsey Sanders, and Williamston-based family physician Matthew Roehrs for helping to bring blood pressure and diabetes under control. AnMed also is providing her with more than $1,400 worth of insulin and other medications each month.\n\n\u201cGod knows that I just could not do it without these people,\u201d said Ferrell, who cares for her 93-year-old aunt. Together, they live on about $1,200 per month.\n\nFerrell is among 405 AnMed patients who are receiving assistance from the access to care coalition. Along with AnMed, the coalition\u2019s members include the Anderson Free Clinic, Anderson-Oconee-Pickens Mental Health Center and the nonprofit group AIM, formerly known as Anderson Interfaith Ministries.\n\nAcross South Carolina, 58 hospitals have enrolled more than 10,000 patients in similar programs, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. These programs target what are known as \u201cfrequent fliers\u201d \u2014 patients who have visited emergency rooms four or more times in the previous year.\n\nGov. Nikki Haley praised the ongoing efforts in a statement that the health and human services department issued earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis program has been so successful because of the strong partnerships we\u2019ve developed with the hospitals and health care workers in South Carolina,\u201d Haley said.\n\nThornton Kirby, president and CEO of the South Carolina Hospital Association, offered an equally upbeat assessment.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of our state\u2019s hospitals and their valuable partners for making great strides to improve the health of high-risk, uninsured patients in their communities,\u201d Kirby said.\n\nThe programs are part of a statewide Healthy Outcomes Plan approved by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled General Assembly in 2013 as an alternative to expanding South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nCritics contend that the number of patients receiving assistance from the Healthy Outcomes Plan is far less than the 300,000 people who would have benefitted from expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program. Federal officials were offering to spend $11 billion over several years on expanding Medicaid in South Carolina. The expansion would have provided health insurance for an estimated 10,000 people in Anderson County who lack coverage.\n\nAnMed\u2019s program has focused on forging connections between uninsured patients and family medicine physicians, said Michael Cunningham, AnMed\u2019s vice president for advancement. These physicians can help patients manage chronic conditions more effectively than emergency-room doctors, Cunningham said.\n\n\u201cThe emergency department is geared up to really treat trauma and emergencies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe program is making a difference, Cunningham said. Those patients who have enrolled are going to the emergency room less often, he said.\n\nSanders is one of three AnMed nurses serving as health coaches in the program. She is dealing with about 175 patients. Many of them have problems that go beyond health care.\n\n\u201cAt times it is overwhelming because you have people that need basic life-sustaining requirements like a roof over their head,\u201d she said.\n\nSanders helped Ferrell obtain food stamps and apply for health insurance.\n\nFerrell said the program has helped her physically and emotionally. As a result, she is able to enjoy spending more time with her two granddaughters.\n\n\u201cNow I feel like having them over to Nana\u2019s for a sleepover,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Kirk Brown on Twitter @KirkBrown_AIM", "article_metadata": {"title": "Program helps uninsured avoid repeated visits to emergency room", "og": {"url": "http://www.independentmail.com/news/program-helps-uninsured-avoid-repeated-visits-to-emergency-room-ep-980493806-340273611.html", "image": {"width": 631, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/er_frequent_flyers_03_14734444_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "AnMed Health program is assisting 405 patients who lack insurance.", "title": "Program helps uninsured avoid repeated visits to emergency room"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/er_frequent_flyers_03_14734444_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Program helps uninsured avoid repeated visits to emergency room", "description": "AnMed Health program is assisting 405 patients who lack insurance.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/independentmail"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-aim-icon144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09a6\"", "article_summary": "Cunningham talked about the Anderson Access to Care Coalition, and ways patients can avoid making multiple trips to the emergency room.\nIn December, AnMed officials enrolled Ferrell in the Anderson Access to Care Coalition, an initiative that is striving to keep uninsured patients from making repeated trips to the emergency room.\nLindsey Sanders, left, an AnMed Health nurse and health coach, sits near patient Lynn Ferrell of Belton, both looking at Michael Cunningham, AnMed Health's vice president of advancement.\nMany of them have problems that go beyond health care.\nMichael Cunningham, AnMed Health's vice president of advancement, talks about the Anderson Access to Care Coalition."}
