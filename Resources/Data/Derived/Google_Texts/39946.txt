THERE IS NO WORD ON WHAT STARTED THIS FIRE. SHEREE: A MAN SENTENCED FOR EXPOSING HIMSELF. THIS CRIME SHOULD HAVE ALL SHOPPERS TAKING A FEW EXTRA PRECAUTIONS. WE HAVE A STORY YOU WILL SEE ONLY ON WLWT. WE SIT IN OUR CAR WITH HER HEAD IN OUR PHONE NOT REALLY AWARE OF OUR SURROUNDINGS. IMAM WAS RECENTLY RESPONDING TO E-MAILS WHEN A MAN WHO HAD BEEN TART -- PARKED TWO SPOTS DOWN WAS A LOT CLOSER. I SEE SOMETHING RIGHT UP AGAINST MY DRIVER WINDOW. REPORTER: A MAN WITH HIS PANTS DOWN DOING SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE. I WAS SCARED, THEN GROSSED OUT, AND THEN I WAS MAD. MIKE: SHE MANAGED TO GET HIS LICENSE PLATE NUMBER AND THE POLICE MADE THE ARREST. TODAY DURING SENTENCING, HE WAS A MAN OF FEW WORDS. SHE HOPES TO ENCOURAGE OTHER SHOPPERS TO BE MORE AWARE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS WITH THE UPCOMING BUSY SHOPPING SEASON. WEATHER IN PLAZAS OR OTHER AREAS, POLICE SAY THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN ALL PROTECT OURSELVES. HAVE YOUR KEYS PREPARED. DON'T HAVE YOUR ARMS SO LOW -- SO LOADED DOWN THAT YOU CAN'T PROTECT THEM. REPORTER: KEY POCKET BOOKS OUT OF SIGHT AND IF SOMEONE COMES UP TO YOU, THEY SUGGEST MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH THEM. THEY WILL GO TO THE NEXT PROFESSIONAL VICTIM. THEY DON'T WANT SOMEONE THEY THINK IS CONFIDENT AND WON'T BE A VICTIM. CLEARLY, DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE OTHER SIMILAR CONVICTIONS, THE JUDGE SUSPENDED HIS SENTENCE. HE WILL BE ON PROBATION FOR A YEAR AND WILL HAVE TO UNDERGO A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION.
