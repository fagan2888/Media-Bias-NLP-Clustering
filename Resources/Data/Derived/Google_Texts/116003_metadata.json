Eventually, the program served as the blueprint for a national organization.\n\nHomeAid now has chapters in 17 cities and contributed to the renovation or construction of 410 shelters worth more than $200 million.\n\nAbout 7,800 new beds have been created nationwide, and about 225,000 homeless people have spent at least one night in a HomeAid shelter, said Peter Simons, a former Beazer Homes division president and chief executive of Newport Beach-based HomeAid America.\n\n\u201cPretty much all the nationals have built a HomeAid project,\u201d Simons said, referring to big builders. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a builder charity.\u201d\n\nOrange County roots\n\nHomeAid started as a public relations gesture. The local Building Industry Association wanted to improve the image of builders amid the growing popularity of the slow-growth movement.\n\n\u201cWe were doing good things for the community, but people weren\u2019t aware of it,\u201d said Larry Webb, CEO of the New Home Co. and a longtime HomeAid board member. \u201cEvery company did their own thing. But by doing something together, we\u2019d have a greater impact.\u201d\n\nAfter doing one project, builders wanted to keep going. HomeAid was born.\n\nSince then, HomeAid has worked with key service providers that include Mercy House, the Orange County Rescue Mission, Casa Teresa and Orangewood Children\u2019s Foundation.\n\nIn Orange County, projects range from remodeling a Placentia shelter to reduce energy bills to building a home for AIDs patients in Santa Ana.\n\nHomeAid Orange County helped convert an unmarketable remnant of land in Buena Park into 17 new townhomes for homeless families.\n\nAnd it was a key player in the 13-year project to build the Orange County Rescue Mission\u2019s Village of Hope, a manicured 192-bed transitional shelter on the former Tustin Marine base.\n\nThe 5-acre complex includes three-story barracks renovated to look like modern apartment buildings. The brown, stucco buildings overlook an enclosed, palm-shaded compound that\u2019s home to a medical clinic, cafeteria and programs that provide spiritual guidance, counseling and parenting classes.\n\nThe agencies provide the beds and services needed to help struggling families get back on their feet. HomeAid provides the \u201csticks and bricks\u201d to do it in.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the most important nonprofit agencies in terms of addressing homelessness in Orange County,\u201d said Larry Haynes, executive director of Mercy House, which operates the cold-weather armory shelters in Santa Ana and Fullerton. \u201cWithout HomeAid, our capacity is a fraction of what it has been.\u201d\n\nHaynes added that prior to HomeAid\u2019s efforts, shelters here were spartan, utilitarian and rundown. Because HomeAid is able to bring in architects, engineers and consultants \u2013 often working for free \u2013 the buildings are better designed.\n\n\u201cYou can say what you want about the value of human dignity, but if you\u2019re moving (homeless people) into a dump, you\u2019ve communicated what you think of them,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cWith HomeAid, it really communicates a very different message and respect.\u201d\n\nLife on the street\n\nCordiella James used to think that life on the street was fun.\n\nAfter her mother kicked her out of the house for using methamphetamine, she ended up on Beach Boulevard, \u201cstuck doing drugs, not really caring about myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was homeless, hopping from motel to motel and kicking it with people who had drugs,\u201d the 29-year-old Fresno native said. \u201cAt first, it was fun. It was really, really fun. I didn\u2019t have any rules or anyone I answered to.\u201d\n\nAnd it continued being fun \u201cuntil I started going to jail.\u201d\n\nFor the next two years, she was in and out of detention for repeated drug and probation violations. Each time she got released, she\u2019d go back to the streets \u2013 and to smoking meth.\n\nThen everything changed. She got pregnant, and realized she had to clean up her act.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want (my son) to have the life I had,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to get clean and sober before he was born so he\u2019d have a chance at a good life that I didn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nInstead of hitting the streets, she hit the phones \u2013 and found a bed in the Precious Life Shelter for expectant homeless women.\n\nThat night, she slept in a compound of neat, yellow-sided homes built by HomeAid.\n\nOn the rise\n\nService providers counted 4,452 homeless people in January during the latest \u201cpoint-in-time\u201d survey of people living in shelters or on the streets, according to Orange County\u2019s 2015 \u201cHomeless Count & Survey Report.\u201d\n\nOfficials projected another 11,000 Orange County residents would become homeless at some point this year.\n\nThis year\u2019s tally was up by 201 people from the last count in 2013, a 5 percent gain. It\u2019s possible that counters merely spotted more homeless this time around.\n\nBut with rent going through the roof, it\u2019s likely homelessness is on the rise, said Karen B. Williams, president and CEO of 2-1-1 Orange County, a nonprofit referral service that oversees the county\u2019s homeless management system.\n\n\u201cWe see more people who are falling into homelessness rather than chronically homeless,\u201d Williams said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the rising tide of homelessness has created a state of emergency, Mayor Eric Garcetti and council members said Tuesday. Estimates of Los Angeles\u2019 homeless population ranged from 25,000 to 41,000, up 12 percent to 16 percent over 2013 counts.\n\nLos Angeles leaders want to spend $100 million to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cWe must do everything we can now to get people off the streets and into housing with the resources we have available,\u201d Garcetti said in a letter to the city\u2019s administrative officer.\n\nMaking a dent\n\nHomeAid America\u2019s programs are small compared to the scope of homelessness. Still, program executives say they are making a dent in the problem.\n\nHomeAid America has 62 projects underway this year, with a total value of $23.8 million, Simons said. HomeAid typically reduces a provider\u2019s costs by 50 percent by getting contractors at cost, pro bono professional services and donated materials.\n\nLocally, HomeAid had three construction projects this year, with a total value of $3.5 million. About three-fourths of its annual budget goes to housing projects, it reported in its 2013 tax return.\n\nCurrent projects include renovating apartment buildings for two children\u2019s programs and construction of a new community center at the Orangewood school.\n\nAutumn Strier, president and CEO of Miracles for Kids, estimates she saved $300,000 in renovation costs on a apartment building her agency bought, thanks to HomeAid and other backers.\n\nThe 12-unit \u201cMiracle Manor\u201d will house families of critically ill children. Because those families are at risk of becoming homeless, HomeAid brought in a builder to replace decaying stairs with donated labor and materials and an architect to work pro bono.\n\nToday, the walls are covered with black tar paper and chicken wire as workers prepare to re-stucco the first two-story building. Workers are painting newly sheet-rocked interiors.\n\n\u201cIf you have a child with a medical illness, it can spin you financially out of control,\u201d said HomeAidOC Executive Director Scott Larson.\n\nRedemption\n\nIn Los Alamitos, HomeAid is working on its fifth project with Precious Life Shelter, which helps homeless mothers through childbirth, then provides housing for up to two years after their babies are born.\n\nTheresa and Don Sherrin started Precious Life in 1982 when they took four expectant homeless women into their home.\n\nEventually, the Sherrins opened a shelter in a house renovated by HomeAid. Over the years, the charity brought in different homebuilders to add space. Today, there are six buildings on the shelter\u2019s property, including a row of two-room apartments for moms and their children.\n\nNow, an architect and a HomeAid staffer are in talks with the city about plans to tear down a nearby house and build a small apartment building to provide permanent affordable housing for new mothers.\n\nThe shelter has strict rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a working place,\u201d said Cordiella James, who gave birth to a healthy boy, Brandon, four months ago. \u201cFrom the moment that I got here, they said, this is what you have to do.\u201d\n\nShe started attending Alcoholic Anonymous meetings five times a week, took parenting classes and got counseling. They taught her social skills and life skills. She found a job. They provided her with food, dishes, home supplies and daycare while she works at a nearby restaurant.\n\n\u201cThey gave me all the tools that I needed to succeed,\u201d James said. \u201cBasically, since I\u2019ve been here, I have not wanted for anything, and that\u2019s the greatest gift I could have ever received.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a productive member of society now.\u201d\n\nAbout 100 women go through the program each year, said Precious Life founder Theresa Sherrin.\n\n\u201cHomeAid did all of this,\u201d Sherrin, 79, said, waving a hand at the buildings. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have any of this without them.\u201d\n\nRegister staff writer Teri Sforza and Register wire services contributed to this report.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-7734 or jcollins@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "blogs", "description": "Business: Builders' charity: How HomeAid has labored to house the homeless, help rebuild lives | homeaid, homeless, county, orange, life, people, shelter, year, house, building", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JEFF COLLINS", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "It started as a simple way for Orange County homebuilders to give back to the community and generate some positive PR.", "title": "Builders' charity: How HomeAid has labored to house the homeless, help rebuild lives", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/homeaid-684692-homeless-county.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nv9jug-b88517146z.120150925194752000g4ec5n23.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nv9jug-b88517146z.120150925194752000g4ec5n23.10.jpg"}, "description": "It started as a simple way for Orange County homebuilders to give back to the community and generate some positive PR.", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Builders' charity: How HomeAid has labored to house the homeless, help rebuild lives"}, "content_author": "JEFF COLLINS", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nv9jug-b88517146z.120150925194752000g4ec5n23.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "homeaid, homeless, county, orange, life, people, shelter, year, house, building", "publication_date": "2015-09-25", "access-type": "paid", "section": "blogs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Builders' charity: How HomeAid has labored to house the homeless, help rebuild lives"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5cad\"", "article_summary": "HomeAid Orange County helped convert an unmarketable remnant of land in Buena Park into 17 new townhomes for homeless families.\nIt started as a simple way for Orange County homebuilders to give back to the community and generate some positive PR.\nSince then, HomeAid has worked with key service providers that include Mercy House, the Orange County Rescue Mission, Casa Teresa and Orangewood Children\u2019s Foundation.\nThe program gelled into a permanent charity, building and renovating 54 homeless shelters and creating 1,100 new beds across Orange County over the past 27 years.\nBecause those families are at risk of becoming homeless, HomeAid brought in a builder to replace decaying stairs with donated labor and materials and an architect to work pro bono."}
