"Oh God, it's Mom!" Republican political activist Dallas Woodhouse exclaimed when his mother called into a CSPAN talk show where he and brother Brad, a Democratic operative, were debating the Affordable Care Act.

Mom, Joy Woodhouse that is, told her sons she wanted them to get political arguments out of their system before they come home to Raleigh for Christmas.

Brad Woodhouse heads the liberal Americans United for Change and Dallas Woodhouse runs a Republican-aligned group called Carolina Rising. The two brothers from North Carolina are the subjects of a documentary called "Woodhouse Divided" about politics and family dynamics.

CSPAN said they had no notice Joyce Woodhouse would call during Tuesday's program and Brad and Dallas appeared to be surprised as well.

The story and video have already made the rounds of many news outlets and blogs that cover North Carolina politics. To my knowledge, the Woodhouses have no particular connection to Western North Carolina, but the video is still fun to watch. Click below if you want to see it.
