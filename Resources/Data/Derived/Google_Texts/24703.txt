With a new coaching staff and new schemes, the 2015 Broncos are adjusting, something offensive lineman Ben Garland and safety Darian Stewart know all too well.

Garland, who switched from the defensive to offensive line in 2013 and is vying for the starting job at guard, said he has “totally embraced” his role on the offensive line. His latest challenge: mastering zone-blocking.

“I love zone scheme,” he said at the Broncos’ Dove Valley facility Wednesday. “It’s more lateral moving, being smart and just being able to move quickly and just being able to get to the cut block on the back side.”

Garland, a former practice-squad player who played eight games last season for the Broncos, has spent the past couple months studying the team’s new schemes, learning new calls and poring over past offenses. And his experience on the defensive line has come in handy.

“It helps to be from the other side,” Garland said. “You can kind of understand the way they’re thinking, and it helps you defend against it.”

Stewart, who signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in March as a replacement for safety Rahim Moore, said he was drawn to Denver because of coach Gary Kubiak, his offensive coordinator in Baltimore in 2014.

And in just a month’s time, Stewart is impressed by the Broncos’ defense and coordinator Wade Phillips’ 3-4 scheme.

“It’s straightforward,” Stewart said. “Wade has a good scheme set up for us, and we have a hell of a defense. We’re well-rounded at every position. We got depth, and I think this year is going to be a great year for us.”

Stewart faces some competition for the starting job at safety, as David Bruton has made his desire to start known, and Phillips has talked about possibly using cornerback Bradley Roby at safety.

To Stewart, the more, the better.

“Competition is needed,” he said. ” It makes all of us better. I’m up for the challenge.”
