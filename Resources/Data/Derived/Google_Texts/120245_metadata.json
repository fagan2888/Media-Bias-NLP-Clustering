Many experts, however, argued that the exclusion would allow drug and device companies to avoid disclosure by shifting marketing dollars to CME from direct promotional programs. In the proposed rule, the CMS said \u201can unintended consequence\u201d of the policy was the appearance the agency was tacitly endorsing corporate sponsorships of continuing education events. The Open Payments program stems from a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act known as the Sunshine Act.CME organizations and manufacturers that fund education events were blindsided by the move, said Andrew Rosenberg, senior adviser for the CME Coalition, a trade group. \u201cIf it is allowed to stand, this policy change will be massively disruptive to every stakeholder in the CME ecosystem\u2014doctors, educators and commercial supporters\u2014who have spent over a year preparing for the implementation of the current rules,\u201d Rosenberg wrote in an e-mail to Modern Healthcare late Friday. Extending the disclosure to CME, he added, would \u201cdiscourage physicians from learning new medical science by creating a false stigma.\u201dMeanwhile, the rule's suggested changes in the \u201crelative value units\u201d that determine Medicare payments to physicians must be revenue-neutral, so increases in payments in one area lead to cuts elsewhere. The CMS proposed cutting Medicare payments (PDF) for radiation therapy centers and radiation oncology services by 8% and 4% respectively by reclassifying equipment purchases as indirect expenses of providing care.At the same time, the rule would increase payments for family practice (2%), internal medicine (2%) and geriatrics (1%), due to changes stemming from the CMS previously undervaluing the work required in those specialties, the proposal says. In addition, independent laboratories would get a 3% bump based on increases in the cost of running such an organization.\u201cConsistent with amendments to the Affordable Care Act, CMS has been engaged in a vigorous effort over the past several years to identify and review potentially misvalued codes, and to make adjustments where appropriate,\u201d CMS officials said in a statement. \u201cWe identified most of these by reviewing high-expenditure services by specialty that have not been recently reviewed.
