Similarly, 58 percent of 18-to-29 year-olds are convinced government agencies abuse their powers, while merely 25 percent trust government agencies to do the right thing.\n\nThe Reason-Rupe report finds this skepticism of government has millennials favoring general reductions to government spending and regulations:\n\n73 percent of millennials favor allowing private accounts for Social Security; 51 percent favor private accounts even it means cutting Social Security benefits for current and future retirees because 53 percent of millennials say Social Security is unlikely to exist when they retire\n\n64 percent of millennials say cutting government spending by 5 percent would help the economy\n\n59 percent say cutting taxes would help the economy\n\n57 percent prefer a smaller government providing fewer services with low taxes, while 41 percent prefer a larger government providing more services with high taxes\n\n57 percent want a society where wealth is distributed according to achievement\n\n55 percent say reducing regulations would help the economy\n\n53 percent say reducing the size of government would help the economy\n\n74 percent of millennials say government has a responsibility to guarantee every citizen has a place to sleep and enough to eat\n\nHowever, millennials also support more government action and higher spending in a number of key areas:\n\n71 percent favor raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour\n\n69 percent say it is government\u2019s responsibility to guarantee everyone access to health care and 51 percent have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act\n\n68 percent say government should ensure everyone makes a living wage\n\n66 percent say raising taxes on the wealthy would help the economy\n\n63 percent say spending more on job training would help the economy\n\n58 percent say the government should spend more on assistance to the poor even it means higher taxes\n\n57 percent favor spending more money on infrastructure\n\n54 percent favor a larger government that provides more services, when taxes are not mentioned\n\n54 percent want government to guarantee everyone a college education\n\nSixty-two percent of millennials describe themselves as socially liberal, while 27 percent say they are socially conservative. The gap is much narrower on economic issues, with 49 percent of millennials identifying themselves as economic liberals and 36 percent labeling themselves as economic conservatives.\n\nMillennials\u2019 social liberalism is mixed with strong opposition to many nanny state regulations:\n\n72 percent of millennials say large sugary sodas and drinks should be allowed to be sold\n\n67 percent of millennials favor legalizing same-sex marriage\n\n61 percent say abortion should be legal in all or most cases\n\n61 percent say people should be able to buy foods containing trans fats\n\n60 percent want to allow e-cigarette use in public places\n\n59 percent say the government should allow online gambling\n\n57 percent say marijuana should be legal, although just 22 percent say cocaine should be legal\n\n52 percent say either the government should not set a legal drinking age or that the legal drinking age should be lower than 21\n\n2014 and 2016 Elections\n\nOf those registered to vote, 76 percent of millennials say they plan to vote in the 2014 midterm elections. Fifty-three percent of registered millennials tell Reason-Rupe they plan to vote for the Democratic congressional candidate in their district this November, while 29 percent intend to vote for the Republican. For Democrats that\u2019s a sharp decline from the 64 percent of millennials who say they voted for President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\nThings look better for Democrats in 2016, however. When asked to select their top choice for president in 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the top choice of 39 percent of registered millennial voters, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (8 percent), Vice President Joe Biden (6 percent) and the top Republican, Rep. Paul Ryan (6 percent). Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Sen. Rand Paul were each the top choice of 5 percent of registered millennial voters.\n\nA majority of millennials, 52 percent, identify themselves as independents when first asked. Just 16 percent self-identify as Republicans, while 32 percent say they\u2019re Democrats. Including those leaning towards a party, 43 percent of millennials identify as Democrats, 35 percent as independents, and only 23 percent classify themselves as Republicans.\n\nMillennials don\u2019t identify with the political parties and don\u2019t have much confidence in them. When asked who they trust most to handle a series of policy issues, young Americans say they trust \u201cneither\u201d party to handle 12 of 15 issues surveyed. Millennials do trust Democrats the most on gay marriage, the environment, and poverty, while only trusting Republicans the most on promoting entrepreneurship.\n\nAbout the Reason-Rupe Poll\n\nThe Reason-Rupe national poll, executed by YouGov, surveyed 2,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 29 online from February 28 to March 11, 2014.
