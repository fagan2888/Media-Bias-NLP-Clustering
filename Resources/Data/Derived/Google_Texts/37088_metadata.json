Well, the engine pushing it forward was Julia Colson, whose job is putting on events at Seattle Center where she works as a manager in the productions office.\n\nI got a note praising her from one of the health-care officials involved, Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett of the University of Washington School of Public Health, where he\u2019s director of the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice. \u201cGuess the professional background of the person who brought together the dozens of nonprofits, businesses, and health-care organizations for the event? Not medicine, public health, social work, or corporate management \u2014 but dance,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEven though the Affordable Care Act has made it easier for more people to get care, there are still far too many Americans who aren\u2019t getting the care they need. Like Kwan-Gett (who\u2019s also a friend), I was struck that in this instance it took, not a health-care insider, but a dancer to mobilize a response.\n\nA preliminary tally shows that more than 1,400 volunteers, including care providers and supporting staff, helped at least 3,400 people at the four-day clinic in KeyArena.\n\nI paid Colson a visit and asked how she pulled it off. She said it was all about collaborating, and that\u2019s true, but someone has to conduct the orchestra. She was a good fit because she\u2019s a workaholic who loves figuring out tough problems, and she also knows how to work with people.\n\nHer office, Seattle Center Productions, is charged with developing free and affordable events for the public. Often it\u2019s something artistic, but not always.\n\nLast year, center director Robert Nellams challenged the staff to use the facilities and their expertise in new ways, Colson said. And he specifically asked if they could do something health-related.\n\nColson was primed for that. She and her immediate boss had both seen an episode of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d years before about clinics put on by the nonprofit Remote Area Medical, and they\u2019d wanted to do something like that for the center\u2019s centennial celebration but hadn\u2019t been able to.\n\nSo now, they contacted Remote Area Medical about helping put one on here. RAM was started to help people in poor countries, but now much of its work is focused on poor people in the U.S.\n\nThe center staff knows how to stage events, but this was something different.\n\nThey looked for individuals and organizations to partner with, including the UW public-health program. They started with dental and vision-care specialists because there tends to be lots unmet needs in those areas. Then medical doctors came on board.\n\nSomeone who works in emergency medicine helped them figure out how to set up the clinic. They found outside help with communications to be sure they would reach people who needed free care.\n\nAfter three or four months of recruiting partners they arrived at a turning point. People started calling asking what they could do, and it became clear they could actually make the clinic happen.\n\nThe project became a broad-based community effort. Close to 80 organizations participated.\n\nI asked how she manages working with so many individuals and organizations. \u201cIt\u2019s important to listen everyone\u2019s thoughts and ideas,\u201d she said, and also to be attentive to their fears even when they might go unstated.\n\nColson said in her work she has to be and be open and adaptable. She has been both in making her way to her current job.\n\nShe earned a degree in math and education because she wanted to teach middle-school students. \u201cI loved math because it was like a puzzle,\u201d she said. I\u2019m someone who likes to figure out the ins and outs of things.\u201d\n\nAnd she worked hard at ballet, even going on to graduate school to study dance.\n\nRight out of graduate school, she joined the faculty of the University of Oklahoma teaching dance. She staged performances and learned about the administrative side of dance, working behind the scenes rather than on stage \u2014 experiences that come in handy now.\n\nThen she met her future husband, who lived in Southern California, where she had grown up. She didn\u2019t like the sunny, hot climate, so they looked for a place where they could both be happy.\n\nAbout that time, she saw an opening with the Washington Academy of Performing Arts in Redmond. The job fit her well but eventually the money dried up, and a year later, in 2006, she landed a job at Seattle Center.\n\nKwan-Gett said, \u201cThe clinic simply would not have happened without Julia\u2019s tireless energy, enthusiasm, charisma, and organizing skills.\u201d\n\nHer fellow city of Seattle managers think highly of her work, too. She\u2019s receiving an award for leadership in community service from the Seattle Management Association on Thursday.\n\nKwan-Gett said the School of Public Health used the event to teach its students about the disparities in health care in this community. Maybe Colson has helped spark something larger than a one-time event.\n\nJerry Large\u2019s column appears Monday and Thursday.
