(REUTERS/Larry Downing)\n\n4249355\n\nThe federal government\u2019s health-care programs made over $62 billion in improper or fraudulent payments last year, according to a Senate report out Wednesday, and the sum is likely to rise in the future as the federal government\u2019s role in health care is expanding drastically.\n\nMedicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid alone accounted for $62.2 billion of the federal government\u2019s improper payments in 2013, the last full year of former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 tenure, according to the Senate Special Committee on Aging report.\n\nWhile improper payments across the entire federal government have dropped from a record-high $121 billion in 2010 to $105 billion total last year, incorrect payouts from federal health-care programs are growing.\n\nIn 2012, 8.5 percent of all Medicare payments were considered incorrect, but last year the rate grew to 10.1 percent. Medicare has hired more auditors to provide higher levels of oversight to the Medicare and Medicaid payment processes, but so far they\u2019ve failed to actually prevent the improper payouts from happening.\n\n\u201cMedicare just isn\u2019t getting the job done when it comes to preventing payments errors,\u201d said committee chairman Sen. Bill Nelson. \u201cMedicare must change the way it pays its providers so that the cheats are getting caught and the honest providers are getting paid.\u201d\n\nRanking member of the committee Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins pointed out that the auditors aren\u2019t helping.\n\n\u201cThe increase in audits has not translated into a reduction in improper payments,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIn fact, Medicare is currently experiencing its highest improper payment rate in five years.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan report focused on the growing rate of Medicare and Medicaid fraud and even honest mistakes, emphasizing that the health care programs administrator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), must shift from documenting improper payments that have already occurred and attempt to prevent the faulty payments from happening in the first place.\n\nAbsent any drastic changes in the federal government\u2019s practices, however, improper health care payments are, if anything, likely to increase over the next several years. CMS administers Medicare, Medicaid and beginning this year, Obamacare as well \u2014 creating yet another opportunity for taxpayers to be hit billions in improper payments.\n\nThe risk for improper taxpayer spending through the Affordable Care Act is well-documented. Because CMS failed to build an income verification system in time for Obamacare\u2019s launch, the Obama administration is belatedly sending out millions of letters to customers asking them to provide further proof of their eligibility for premium subsidies through Obamacare exchanges.\n\nThe administration has not yet announced whether it will even attempt to recover improper subsidy payments from Obamacare customers; it\u2019s possible taxpayers will be at a loss for the first year\u2019s costs. But given the bipartisan committee\u2019s complaints about CMS\u2019 ability to recover payments in its longstanding health-care programs, it may be difficult to get back improper payments through new programs as well.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Expect even more this year", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The federal government's health-care programs made over $62 billion in improper or fraudulent payments last year, according to a Senate report out Wednesday, and the sum is likely to rise in the futur", "title": "HHS Spent $62 Billion On Improper Payments In Health-Care Programs Last Year", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/09/hhs-spent-62-billion-on-improper-payments-in-health-care-programs-last-year/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-16T174902Z_1_CBREA3F1DHS00_RTROPTP_4_USA-SEBELIUS-e1398098282989.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Expect even more this year", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/09/hhs-spent-62-billion-on-improper-payments-in-health-care-programs-last-year/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-16T174902Z_1_CBREA3F1DHS00_RTROPTP_4_USA-SEBELIUS-e1398098282989.jpg"}, "title": "HHS Spent $62 Billion On Improper Payments In Health-Care Programs Last Year Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-09 17:05:18", "sailthru.title": "HHS Spent $62 Billion On Improper Payments In Health-Care Programs Last Year", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "ben nelson,medicaid,medicare,obamacare,susan collins", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "medicaid,medicare,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "The federal government's health-care programs made over $62 billion in improper or fraudulent payments last year, according to a Senate report out Wednesday, and the sum is likely to rise in the futur", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-16T174902Z_1_CBREA3F1DHS00_RTROPTP_4_USA-SEBELIUS-e1398098282989.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bcc\"", "article_summary": "In 2012, 8.5 percent of all Medicare payments were considered incorrect, but last year the rate grew to 10.1 percent.\n\u201cThe increase in audits has not translated into a reduction in improper payments,\u201d Collins said.\nWhile improper payments across the entire federal government have dropped from a record-high $121 billion in 2010 to $105 billion total last year, incorrect payouts from federal health-care programs are growing.\nCMS administers Medicare, Medicaid and beginning this year, Obamacare as well \u2014 creating yet another opportunity for taxpayers to be hit billions in improper payments.\nAbsent any drastic changes in the federal government\u2019s practices, however, improper health care payments are, if anything, likely to increase over the next several years."}
