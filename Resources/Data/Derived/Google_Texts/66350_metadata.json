It is accountable to Darwin, not to Newton.\u201d\n\nThankfully, many examples of \u201cliving,\u201d governmental Darwinism rot on the ash-heap of history: Mussolini and Hitler\u2019s National Socialism, Lenin and Stalin\u2019s International Socialism, and Castro\u2019s collectivist Latin variation, which he admitted \u201cdoesn\u2019t even work for us anymore.\u201d\n\nIslamic fundamentalism, however, is a more ancient and virulent strain of progressivism that seeks the salvation of humankind through, well, submission.\n\nI suspect this is why progressive Democrats now seeking their party\u2019s nomination for president cannot bring themselves to say America is at war with an Islamic tyranny whose will to power they both admire and wish to emulate.\n\nBut Wilsonian progressivism brings ideological baggage far more offensive to college-age progressives \u2014 the delicate souls who faint on hearing the slightest \u201cmicro aggression.\u201d\n\nThe offense is Woodrow Wilson\u2019s overt racism.\n\nWilson, the 13th president of Princeton University and 28th president of these United States, famously said, \u201cWhite men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservation \u2013 until at last there had sprung into existence a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to protect the Southern country.\u201d\n\nAs for the cloistered confines of Princeton University, President Wilson said, \u201cThe whole temper and tradition of the place are such that no Negro has ever applied for admission, and it seems unlikely that the question will ever assume practical form.\u201d\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that Princeton University\u2019s Black Justice League noticed that their institution of higher learning has a Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs that seeks to advance the university\u2019s motto: \u201cPrinceton in the Nation\u2019s Service and in the Service of All Nations.\u201d\n\nA globalist view of Wilsonian Darwinism.\n\nIn response, the Black Justice League demanded Princeton\u2019s \u201cadministration publicly acknowledge the racist legacy of Woodrow Wilson and how he impacted campus policy and culture. We also demand that steps be made to rename Wilson residential college, the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy and International Affairs, and any other building named after him.\u201d\n\nThen, as if to prove Wilsonian Darwinism is just as strong among the so-called enemies of \u201canti-Blackness and xenophobia,\u201d the students of the Black Justice League demanded \u201ccultural competency training for all staff and faculty,\u201d although \u201cit was voted down on the grounds of trespassing freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nFor progressives of all colors, the natural rights of others (freedom of speech) are of little consequence when they hamper the ultimate goal of Wilsonian Darwinism: survival of the thuggish.\n\n\u201cA great deal of nonsense has been talked about the inalienable rights of the individual, and a great deal that was mere vague sentiment and pleasing speculation has been put forward as fundamental principle,\u201d wrote Wilson. \u201cSuch theories are never \u2018law,\u2019 no matter what the name or the formal authority of the document in which they are embodied. Only that is \u2018law\u2019 which can be executed, and the abstract rights of man are singularly difficult of execution.\u201d\n\nEvery bit a Wilsonian, President Obama once said his problem with the Bill of Rights is that it \u201csays what the states can\u2019t do to you. Says what the federal government can\u2019t do to you, but doesn\u2019t say what the federal government or state government must do on your behalf.\u201d\n\nAs victims of King George\u2019s royal decrees, the nation\u2019s founders were naturally obsessed with establishing a governing system protecting a free people from \u201carbitrary government\u201d that enlarges \u201cits boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing\u2026 absolute rule,\u201d wrote Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMore than a century of Wilsonian Darwinism later, we have a federal government that acts contrary to public consent and in violation of individual liberty\u2026\u201con your behalf,\u201d of course.\n\nThe result is expensive, inferior and dictatorial Obamacare.\n\nProgressives hate Wilson\u2019s racism while loving his legacy of unrestrained government power that continues to inform the thinking of petty tyrants working \u201cin the Nation\u2019s Service and in the Service of All Nations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For progressives of all colors, the natural rights of others (freedom of speech) are of little consequence when they hamper the ultimate goal of Wilsonian", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Stephen Z.
