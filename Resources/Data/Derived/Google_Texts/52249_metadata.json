And now millions of Americans are getting notices that there health insurance will be canceled because it doesn\u2019t meet the minimum standard under the law.\n\nThe Obama administration insists nobody will lose coverage as a result of cancellation notices going out to millions of people. At least 3.5 million Americans have been issued cancellations, but the exact number is unclear. Associated Press checks find that data is unavailable in a half the states.\n\nMainly they are people who buy directly from an insurer, instead of having workplace coverage. Officials say these consumers aren\u2019t getting \u201ccanceled\u201d but \u201ctransitioned\u201d or \u201cmigrated\u201d to better plans because their current coverage doesn\u2019t meet minimum standards. They won\u2019t have to go uninsured, and some could save a lot if they qualify for the law\u2019s tax credits.\n\nSpeaking in Boston\u2019s historic Faneuil last week, Obama said the problem is limited to fewer than 5 percent of Americans \u201cwho\u2019ve got cut-rate plans that don\u2019t offer real financial protection in the event of a serious illness or an accident.\u201d\n\nBut in a nation of more than 300 million, 5 percent is a big number \u2014 about 15 million people.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating any time you really want to see something succeed because you believe it\u2019s good for people, and it doesn\u2019t get off on the right foot,\u201d Cutler said in the memo.\n\nThe administration refuses to release enrollment numbers until mid-November, when a crash program of computer fixes may be showing results. The numbers are expected to be disappointingly low; officials acknowledge as much.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
