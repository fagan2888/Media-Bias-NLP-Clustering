Jan Brewer\u2019s endorsement wasn\u2019t as important for candidates in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary as their own name recognition.\n\nMs. Brewer surprised political onlookers by endorsing 21 state candidates in the GOP primary, choosing for the most part moderate Republicans who supported her controversial 2013 move to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nThe lame-duck Republican governor picked some winners, starting with Michele Reagan, who won the nod for Secretary of State in a tight three-way primary.\n\nSEE ALSO: Summer of GOP flip-flops: Jindal, Paul, Rubio change course on key issues\n\nIn the showcase race for governor, however, Ms. Brewer whiffed. Her candidate, former Mesa Mayor Scott Smith, finished second to state Treasurer Doug Ducey in the six-way race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.\n\nIn the legislative races, Ms. Brewer appeared to break even, but analysts pointed out that there was a more powerful factor at play: incumbency. Candidates who now serve or have recently served in the state legislature were much more likely to win the party\u2019s nod than newcomers, whether they had the governor\u2019s endorsement or not.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a pattern here, it\u2019s an incumbency pattern,\u201d said Arizona political analyst Mike O'Neil. \u201cWhen she endorsed an incumbent, they won. When she endorsed a non-incumbent against an incumbent, she lost.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Arkansas, home to key Senate race, announces rate decreases on Obamacare exchange\n\nFor example, Ms. Brewer threw her support behind businessman Jeff Schwartz against state Rep. John Kavanagh in the Senate District 23 race, but Mr. Kavanagh, a conservative favorite, won with 53 percent of the vote, according to figures posted by the Arizona Secretary of State.\n\nOn the other hand, Brewer-backed state Sen. Bob Worsley won his primary re-election bid by 53 percent to 46 percent against Ralph Heap, the more conservative candidate backed by the grass-roots Alliance for Principled Conservatives.\n\nThe alliance had endorsed a slate of candidates almost entirely at odds with Ms. Brewer\u2019s picks. Possibly the only candidate they agreed on was Mark Brnovich, who defeated embattled incumbent Tom Horne in the attorney general primary.\n\nAlliance chair Christine Bauserman said she was pleased with the outcome of the primary, saying, \u201cWe actually gained ground.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Smith fell short in the gubernatorial contest, Mr. O'Neil said he wouldn\u2019t have come as close without the governor\u2019s endorsement. Mr. Ducey won with 37 percent of the vote, followed by Mr. Smith with 22 percent.\n\nMr. Ducey now faces Democrat Fred DuVal, who ran unopposed, in the Nov. 4 election.\n\n\u201cShe took Scott Smith from relative obscurity to a second-place finish,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Neil, who hosts \u201cThe Think Tank\u201d on KTAR-FM in Phoenix. \u201cI think she had a positive effect.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It looks like Arizona Gov.
