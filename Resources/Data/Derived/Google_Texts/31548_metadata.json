Under the rules, Puerto Ricans are allowed to receive disability benefits for their inability to speak English as well.\n\n\u201cWe found the Agency did not make exceptions regarding the English-language grid rules for claimants who reside in Puerto Rico, even though Spanish is the predominant language spoken in the local economy,\u201d the OIG said.\n\nThe audit said a person applying for disability in Puerto Rico who cannot speak English \u201cmay increase his/her likelihood of receiving disability benefits.\u201d\n\nThe agency does not currently have a system in place to keep track of the number of beneficiaries who receive disability insurance for not being able to speak English.\n\nHowever, the OIG was able to identify 218 cases between 2011 and 2013 where Puerto Ricans were awarded disability due to \u201can inability to communicate in English.\u201d Furthermore, 4 percent of disability hearings in Puerto Rico involved looking at the individual\u2019s ability to speak, read, write, and understand English.\n\nThough 95 percent of Puerto Ricans speak Spanish at home, according to the rules a Spanish-speaking nurse in Puerto Rico would be considered \u201cunskilled,\u201d the OIG said.\n\nThe SSA told the OIG that the rules are applied one-size-fits-all.\n\n\u201cSSA managers at various disability decision levels stated Social Security is a national program, and the grids must be applied to the national economy, regardless of local conditions,\u201d the audit said.\n\nThe SSA takes into account an individual\u2019s education level when considering awarding disability benefits if they do not qualify for medical reasons. Part of the education requirement involves looking at a person\u2019s ability to speak English, to determine whether it limits his ability to find a job.\n\nLast year Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) raised concerns that the Obama administration was broadly applying the education rule under the Social Security Act to allow individuals to receive disability payments solely because they cannot speak English.\n\nHe noted that the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) rolls swelled 230 percent between 2000 and 2010, while the U.S. population only grew 9.7 percent.\n\nFormer SSA judges have also testified that individuals have been approved for disability in the United States without having to prove they cannot speak English.\n\nThe hundreds of Puerto Ricans noted in the OIG\u2019s report have received disability insurance despite a 1987 U.S. District Court ruling that appears to contradict the SSA\u2019s policy. Benefits were denied on the grounds that \u201cit is the ability to communicate in Spanish, not English, that is vocationally important in Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be noted, however, that the court explicitly declined to apply this rationale outside of this one case,\u201d the OIG said.\n\nThe SSA agreed with the OIG\u2019s recommendations to figure out how many individuals have been \u201cawarded disability based on their inability to communicate in English,\u201d and to \u201cevaluate the appropriateness\u201d of applying the English-speaking rules to Puerto Rico.\n\nThe SSA is currently gathering information for a proposed regulation that \u201ccould lead to changes\u201d to the English-speaking rule, the agency said.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we are soliciting public comments and supporting research on how the inability to communicate in English affects an individual\u2019s ability to adjust to other work that exists in the national economy,\u201d the SSA said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "95 percent of Puerto Ricans speak Spanish", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) approved disability benefits for hundreds of Puerto Ricans because they do not speak English, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is a predominantly Spanish-spea", "title": "Feds Consider Puerto Ricans Disabled Because They Speak Spanish", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-consider-puerto-ricans-disabled-because-they-speak-spanish/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Puerto-Rico-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) approved disability benefits for hundreds of Puerto Ricans", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Puerto-Rico-150x150.jpg", "title": "Feds Consider Puerto Ricans Disabled Because They Speak Spanish", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda320\"", "article_summary": "Under the rules, Puerto Ricans are allowed to receive disability benefits for their inability to speak English as well.\nThough 95 percent of Puerto Ricans speak Spanish at home, according to the rules a Spanish-speaking nurse in Puerto Rico would be considered \u201cunskilled,\u201d the OIG said.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe Social Security Administration (SSA) approved disability benefits for hundreds of Puerto Ricans because they do not speak English, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is a predominantly Spanish-speaking territory.\nPart of the education requirement involves looking at a person\u2019s ability to speak English, to determine whether it limits his ability to find a job.\nThe hundreds of Puerto Ricans noted in the OIG\u2019s report have received disability insurance despite a 1987 U.S. District Court ruling that appears to contradict the SSA\u2019s policy."}
