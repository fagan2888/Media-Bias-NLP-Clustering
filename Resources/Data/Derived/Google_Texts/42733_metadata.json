(AP) - A University of Missouri associate law professor has filed a lawsuit contending that the school\u2019s ban on concealed weapons on campus violates his constitutional rights.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Saturday by Royce de R. Barondes against the Board of Curators and President Tim Wolfe also argues the ban conflicts with a state law that allows guns to be stored in the passenger compartment of a vehicle by an adult with a permit.\n\nHis attorney, Jennifer Bukowsky, also argues the ban violate Barondes\u2019 right to keep and carry weapons on campus for self-defense. Barondes is licensed to carry a concealed firearm.\n\nThe lawsuit also cites an amendment approved last year by Missouri voters that said state residents have an unalienable right to bear arms and any gun regulations must be subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d\n\nUniversity spokesman Christian Basi declined to comment because the lawsuit is pending, the Columbia Daily Tribune reported (http://bit.ly/1V6gBRF ).\n\n\u201cThis is a sensitive subject to many people, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is a constitutional right for Mr. Barondes,\u201d Bukowsky said. \u201cHe should be able to exercise that right, and the university shouldn\u2019t be able to violate it.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit cites three incidents near the Columbia campus this year, including an officer-involved fatal shooting in a parking garage of a suspect in several violent crimes. It also recalls the 2005 death of assistant professor Jeong Inn, who was killed and stuffed in his car, which was set on fire, in a parking garage.\n\nBarondes, who has worked at the university since 2002, fears he will lose his tenured job and be arrested if he conceals a gun in his car or on his person, according to the petition.\n\nBukowsky said Monday the lawsuit can provide a test case to interpret how far the amendment approved last year in Missouri goes in expanding gun rights.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Columbia Daily Tribune, http://www.columbiatribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A University of Missouri associate law professor has filed a lawsuit contending that the school's ban on concealed weapons on campus violates his constitutional rights.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/21/university-of-missouri-professor-sues-over-campus-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A University of Missouri associate law professor has filed a lawsuit contending that the school\u2019s ban on concealed weapons on campus violates his constitutional rights.", "title": "University of Missouri professor sues over campus gun ban"}, "twitter": {"description": "A University of Missouri associate law professor has filed a lawsuit contending that the school's ban on concealed weapons on campus violates his constitutional rights.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "University of Missouri professor sues over campus gun ban"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca8f\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - A University of Missouri associate law professor has filed a lawsuit contending that the school\u2019s ban on concealed weapons on campus violates his constitutional rights.\nHis attorney, Jennifer Bukowsky, also argues the ban violate Barondes\u2019 right to keep and carry weapons on campus for self-defense.\nBukowsky said Monday the lawsuit can provide a test case to interpret how far the amendment approved last year in Missouri goes in expanding gun rights.\n\u201cThis is a sensitive subject to many people, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is a constitutional right for Mr. Barondes,\u201d Bukowsky said.\nIt also recalls the 2005 death of assistant professor Jeong Inn, who was killed and stuffed in his car, which was set on fire, in a parking garage."}
