Taylor Swift just released her highly anticipated new LP, “1989.” She’s called it her “first documented, official pop album,” which is no hyperbole: From the perky “Shake It Off” to the electronic-leaning, digitally processed “Welcome to New York,” it’s clear the singer-songwriter is striving for a higher echelon of pop stardom. With this new direction, it seems appropriate to suggest 10 songs from the titular year of her album that she might want to cover—especially considering the preponderance of classic glossy synthpop and dance jams from that year.

Martika, “Toy Soldiers”



Swift’s new song “Out of the Woods” resembles the airy electropop popularized by groups such as Chvrches—music that is in turn inspired by ’80s synthpop. Exhibit A: Ex-“Kids Incorporated” star Martika’s torchy No. 1 hit “Toy Soldiers,” a children’s-choir-assisted ballad ready-made for Swift.

Janet Jackson, “Escapade”



This hit from “Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814″ split the difference between danceable precision and personal exuberance; in fact, this tale of carefree adventure with a beau fits Swift’s upbeat personality to a T.

Madonna, “Cherish”



It’s never easy to tackle a Madge song, especially one as totemic as “Cherish.” But it’s easy to see Swift relating to this tale of hearts-and-stars romance, in which Madonna asserts her right to her lovey-dovey feelings: “Romeo and Juliet they never felt this way I bet/So don’t underestimate my point of view.”

The Replacements, “Talent Show”



The scruffy Minneapolis charmers seem to have little in common with Swift. However, the kickoff song from the band’s “Don’t Tell a Soul” is a classic Westerbergian tale about being an underdog infiltrating the cool kids club, a favorite Taylor topic—and this vaguely twangy tune has Swift written all over it.
