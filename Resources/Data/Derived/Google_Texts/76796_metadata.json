We uplift each other and debate in an environment where we do not insult or undermine each other.\u201d\n\nAlthough the women of the network are mostly right-of-center, they nevertheless consider themselves \u201cfeminists,\u201d something Chavez thinks makes perfect sense. \u201cThe idea of conservative being pro-woman is certainly not \u2018oxymoronic,\u2019\u201d she said in her statement.\n\n\u201cIdentifying as a conservative does not make us \u2018brainwashed\u2019 or \u2018content with inequality.\u2019 It actually means that we have considered both sides of the issues, analyzed the arguments, and come to different conclusions that may not identify with modern liberalism or liberal feminism.\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s chapter of conservative feminists also plans to co-host a lecture by conservative political strategist Karl Rove with the university\u2019s college Republican group, an event that has also been heavily criticized, including by student news website The Rival.\n\nChavez joined the Republican group\u2019s president, Stuart Algood to defend their event on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe very proud to bring different conservative speakers to create a message that encourages free speech, intellectual diversity, and civil discourse among all AU students. A person must hear from all sides of the issues in order to form a proficient argument,\u201d the two organization leaders wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with hearing a different point of view, and we hope that all critics and supporters will join us to create a constructive discussion about political strategy.\u201d\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis\n\nNBPCampus\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/02/04/american-universitys-conservative-feminists-receive-backlash/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sabrina.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "American University, College Fix, conservatism, conservative feminism, equity feminism, feminism, gender, gender feminism, Independent Women"}, "description": "At American University in the nation\u2019s capital, there has emerged a division among the college\u2019s female students between those who regard themselves as", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sabrina.jpg"}, "keywords": "independent women\\'s forum,sabrina shaeffer,network of enlightened women,conservative feminist,equity feminist,gender feminist,sex,american university,,college fix,conservatism,conservative feminism,equity feminism,feminism,gender,gender feminism,karl rove,progressive,republican,sex and gender on campus", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "American University\u2019s conservative feminists receive backlashPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/02/04/american-universitys-conservative-feminists-receive-backlash/Sabrina Schaeffer speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland.\nConservative student newspaper The College Fix obtained Facebook screenshots of American students who slammed the event as damaging to women\u2019s causes.\nAccording to NeW\u2019s Facebook event page, Shaeffer plans to discuss \u201cconservative feminism, the wage gap, and gender politics on college campuses\u201d in her remarks at American next week.\nThe controversy arose earlier this year when the university\u2019s chapter of Network of Enlightened Women (NeW), a conservative women\u2019s group, posted an announcement for a talk on Feb. 8 by Independent Women\u2019s Forum (IWF) executive director Sabrina Schaeffer.\n\u201cThe idea of conservative being pro-woman is certainly not \u2018oxymoronic,\u2019\u201d she said in her statement."}
