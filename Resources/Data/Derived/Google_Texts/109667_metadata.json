Close Guantanamo and the terrorists will present it, rightfully, as a huge victory over the United States, that they forced us to close Guantanamo. There are endless problems with this, from the magical accounting you heard from President Obama yesterday. He\u2019s not very good with financial figures, as we saw with Obamacare.\u201d\n\nObama doesn\u2019t know where he would send these prisoners if Guantanamo closed, Peters said.\n\n\u201cHe is desperate to cling to this one part of his legacy, that 2008 campaign promise \u2026 He appears to have learned almost nothing in seven years,\u201d Peters said.\n\nPeters went on to argue the Left\u2019s depiction of Guantanamo as \u201cTreblinka with palm trees\u201d was a false one, saying the detainees there get better medical care than tens of millions of Americans. He joked, however, that he wouldn\u2019t mind seeing terrorists have to mix with the general population of American prisons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them on American soil. I don\u2019t want those terrorists here,\u201d Peters said. \u201cThen they get all these magical rights kicked in. But given how great conditions are for these guys down there, take them away from the palm trees. I\u2019d love to see them at a Supermax prison in Colorado or out in general population where they can make new friends, because they have it good.\u201d\n\nPeters is rarely one to mince words in his Fox appearances. He went a bit far in an appearance in December, receiving a two-week suspension after referring to Obama as a \u201ctotal pussy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News military analyst Ralph Peters ripped President Obama's proposal to close Guantanamo Bay, saying it would be a huge victory for terrorists.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Fox News military analyst Ralph Peters ripped President Obama's proposal to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay on Wednesday, saying that terrorist enemies would see it as a \u201chuge victory\u201d", "title": "Peters: Obama Closing Guantanamo Would Be \u2018Huge Victory\u2019 for Terrorists", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/peters-obama-closing-guantanamo-huge-victory-terrorists/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fox News military analyst Ralph Peters ripped President Obama's proposal to close the military priso", "title": "Peters: Obama Closing Guantanamo Would Be \u2018Huge Victory\u2019 for Terrorists", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "creator": "@DavidRutz", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Close Guantanamo and the terrorists will present it, rightfully, as a huge victory over the United States, that they forced us to close Guantanamo.\nBY: Follow @DavidRutzFox News military analyst Ralph Peters ripped President Obama\u2019s proposal to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay on Wednesday, saying that terrorist enemies would see it as a \u201chuge victory\u201d in influencing the U.S. decision to do so.\nHe\u2019s not very good with financial figures, as we saw with Obamacare.\u201dObama doesn\u2019t know where he would send these prisoners if Guantanamo closed, Peters said.\nPeters went on to argue the Left\u2019s depiction of Guantanamo as \u201cTreblinka with palm trees\u201d was a false one, saying the detainees there get better medical care than tens of millions of Americans.\nHe went a bit far in an appearance in December, receiving a two-week suspension after referring to Obama as a \u201ctotal pussy.\u201d"}
