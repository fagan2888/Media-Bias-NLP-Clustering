This has created a \u201cfalse choice\u201d between the two types of care, said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). Wyden was the architect of the Medicare Care Choices Model, which is part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThrough the Choices program, Medicare will reimburse hospices $400 a month for \u201croutine home care and inpatient respite levels of care\u201d that are not eligible to be billed under other parts of the Medicare program, according to a CMS fact sheet. Providers and suppliers offering the hospice patient \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d curative services also will be eligible for Medicare reimbursement. The program initially will be limited to patients with certain conditions, including congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nThe hospice benefit is intended for Medicare beneficiaries who have an expected lifespan of six months or less. However, most people don't enter hospice care until their final days, possibly because they are pursuing curative treatment until that time, according to CMS. The demonstration is meant to test whether beneficiaries will pursue hospice care earlier, which potentially could increase their satisfaction while controlling Medicare costs.\n\nThe program should allow Medicare patients to access \u201cinnovations\u201d in care that have \u201clong benefitted patients in the private market,\u201d said Donald Schumacher, president and CEO of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.\n\nProviders can apply through June 19. A notice with further details is scheduled for publication in the Federal Register today.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "news_keywords": "CMS, Demonstration Program, Hospice, Ron Wyden, Curative Care", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "Medicare will reimburse both hospices furnishing palliative care and providers offering curative services under a new demonstration program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced.", "title": "Medicare to cover hospice and curative care simultaneously in new demonstration program", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/medicare-to-cover-hospice-and-curative-care-simultaneously-in-new-demonstration-program/article/339177/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/08/18/mcklogo_818012.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicare will reimburse both hospices furnishing palliative care and providers offering curative services under a new demonstration program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced.", "creator": "@@TimMullaneyLTC", "site": "@mcknightsltcn", "card": "summary", "title": "Medicare to cover hospice and curative care simultaneously in new demonstration program"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Curative Care", "published_time": "2014-03-21T06:30:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T17:50:34"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Medicare will reimburse both hospices furnishing palliative care and providers offering curative services under a new demonstration program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92f7\"", "article_summary": "Medicare to cover hospice and curative care simultaneously in new demonstration programShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintMedicare will reimburse both hospices furnishing palliative care and providers offering curative services under a new demonstration program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced.\nWyden was the architect of the Medicare Care Choices Model, which is part of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe demonstration is meant to test whether beneficiaries will pursue hospice care earlier, which potentially could increase their satisfaction while controlling Medicare costs.\nThrough the Choices program, Medicare will reimburse hospices $400 a month for \u201croutine home care and inpatient respite levels of care\u201d that are not eligible to be billed under other parts of the Medicare program, according to a CMS fact sheet.\nProviders and suppliers offering the hospice patient \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d curative services also will be eligible for Medicare reimbursement."}
