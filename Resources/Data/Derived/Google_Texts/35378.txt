Adventurist Dean Potter died Saturday after making an illegal jump off a high point in California.

He was 43.

Outside Magazine reported Sunday that Potter and fellow jumper Graham Hunt died after trying a wing-suited flight late Saturday from 7,500-foot Taft Point, above the Yosemite Valley.

Potter is survived by his girlfriend, and his blue heeler, Whisper.

Potter has been controversial and sponsors, such as Patagonia, withdrew their support. The Building, Antenna, Span and Earth (“BASE”) jumping he did, often with Whisper on his back, is illegal in Yosemite National Park.
