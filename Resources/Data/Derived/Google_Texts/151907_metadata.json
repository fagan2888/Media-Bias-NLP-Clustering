The court nonetheless determines the letter carries weight as it looks for guidance on the statute.\n\n\u201cHere, the court finds the OCR\u2019s interpretation of Section 1557 persuasively concludes that Section 1557 protects plaintiffs, like Rumble, who allege discrimination based on \u2018gender identity,'\u201d Nelson writes in the 63-page decision.\n\nThe order could have widespread implications across the country for trans people who feel they\u2019ve experienced discrimination in the health care system and wish to seek restitution.\n\nHarper Jean Tobin, policy director for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a blog post the court order makes clear trans people have options if they face discrimination.\n\n\u201cThis case illustrates the need for transgender people to stand up for their rights in health care settings,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cHaving recently experienced a stay in a hospital myself, I know that no matter who you are, if you are trans the fear of mistreatment in medical settings is constant. When it happens, trans people need to know that, no matter where you live, there\u2019s something you can do.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, known as Rumble v. Fairview Health Services, was filed in June 2014 by the Minnesota-based advocacy group Gender Justice. In addition to making claims on the basis of the Affordable Care Act, the lawsuit also alleges the hospital violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act. The court also allows the litigation to move forward on the basis of alleged discrimination under this statute.\n\nAccording to the order, Rumble went to the hospital in June 2013 because he had a fever of more than 100 degrees. Even though indicated to the clerk he was male, the hospital labeled him as female, and he was given an \u201cF\u201d wristband because his driver\u2019s license incorrectly identified him as such and he\u2019s listed in the hospital computers as female.\n\nWhen the physician, Dr. Randall Steinman, came to see him after an unusually long four to five-and-a-half hour waiting period, the physician allegedly asked Rumble in hostile manner \u201c[w]ho are you having sex with,\u201d \u201c[m]en, women, or both?\u201d and whether \u201che\u2019d ever had sex with objects.\u201d The questioning, Rumble alleges, seemed more an attempt to embarrass him, rather than treat him.\n\nDuring an examination, Steinman allegedly handled Rumble\u2019s genitals in a rough manner, causing the patient to cry out in pain. The doctor allegedly stated he \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell what was going on because of the male hormones.\u201d\n\nAs Steinman continued to jab at Rumble\u2019s genitals, the patient asked him to stop, but the doctor continued until his mother said something. When Steinman finally stopped, he allegedly said he couldn\u2019t determine the problem because \u201cbecause your mom made me stop the exam,\u201d then left the room without further explanation.\n\nRumble was eventually admitted to the hospital, where he alleges he continued to face mistreatment for six days that followed. When he received the bill for his stay, it indicated no insurance payments were made and he owed the full amount, stating, \u201cTHE DIAGNOSIS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PATIENT\u2019S GENDER.\u201d According to the order, Rumble alleges his ultimate diagnoses were conditions that affect people of any gender.\n\nThe hospital had urged the court to throw out on the case on the basis that Rumble failed to allege that he sought medical care from a health service receiving federal funds and didn\u2019t present facts demonstrating he faced differential treatment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation or gender identity. The order allowing the case to proceed denies these requests.\n\nThe court will make a decision after it obtains additional briefing. Rumble is seeking a permanent injunction requiring the hospital to adopt practices conforming with the Affordable Care Act and Minnesota, compensatory damages for physical and emotional pain, and punitive damages.\n\nAccording to the order, Rumble has filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health & Human Service, where an investigation is still ongoing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal court has upheld the interpretation of non-discrimination language on the basis of gender in Obamacare as prohibiting anti-trans bias.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "A federal court has upheld the interpretation of non-discrimination language on the basis of gender in Obamacare as prohibiting anti-trans bias.", "title": "Court: Obamacare prohibits anti-trans bias in health care", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/10/gavel_460x470_6_by_Bigstock.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2015-03-25T00:59:50-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/03/19/court-obamacare-prohibits-anti-trans-discrimination-in-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A federal court has upheld the interpretation of non-discrimination language on the basis of gender in Obamacare as prohibiting anti-trans bias.", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/10/gavel_460x470_6_by_Bigstock.jpg", "title": "Court: Obamacare prohibits anti-trans bias in health care", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Susan Richard Nelson", "published_time": "2015-03-19T18:55:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T00:59:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, Obamacare, transgender health"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis case illustrates the need for transgender people to stand up for their rights in health care settings,\u201d Tobin said.\nIn an apparent first, a federal court has upheld the interpretation of non-discrimination language on the basis of gender in Obamacare as prohibiting anti-transgender bias in the health care system.\nThe order could have widespread implications across the country for trans people who feel they\u2019ve experienced discrimination in the health care system and wish to seek restitution.\nAccording to the order, Rumble went to the hospital in June 2013 because he had a fever of more than 100 degrees.\nAccording to the order, Rumble has filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health & Human Service, where an investigation is still ongoing."}
