Gov. Matt Bevin has plans to dismantle Kynect by the end of the year, which means Kentuckians signing up for health care through a marketplace would have to use the federal exchange.\n\nThe state received $289.3 million from the federal government to establish Kynect.\n\nFederal officials notified Bevin that the state would have to return $57.5 million in unused federal funds left over from establishing Kynect. The leftover money cannot be used for ongoing operations of Kynect, nor can it be used for information technology costs associated with transition to the federal marketplace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance Programs", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance Programs", "title": "Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance Programs", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://wfpl.org/benefind-launches/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance Programs", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Health.jpg", "title": "Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance Programs", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2016-03-01T12:15:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance ProgramsThe site, Benefind, can be used to apply for Medicaid, the Kentucky Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program.\nBenefind replaces Kynect, the state health insurance exchange, as the portal to enroll in some of the state\u2019s assistance programs.\nPeople applying for SNAP and KTAP are required to complete an interview with the Department for Community Based Services in order to receive assistance.\nFederal officials notified Bevin that the state would have to return $57.5 million in unused federal funds left over from establishing Kynect.\nThe leftover money cannot be used for ongoing operations of Kynect, nor can it be used for information technology costs associated with transition to the federal marketplace."}
