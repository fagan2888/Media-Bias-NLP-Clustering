Pierre, SD

While fans of the nation's pastime everywhere celebrated Opening Day for professional baseball this week, the South Dakota Cultural Heritage Center in Pierre is honoring baseball tradition in the state.

"Play Ball! The National Pastime in South Dakota" is on display until April 2016. Historical artifacts, images, videos and more will trace the history of baseball in South Dakota from back in territory days until the present.

The display will be open during regular museum hours, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The display is being presented in the Hogen Gallery of the Museum.

There is an admission fee for adults, but baseball fans age 17 and younger can see the exhibit for free.
