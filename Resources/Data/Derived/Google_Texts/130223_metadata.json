These feelings that are pushing them toward critical, outsider candidates like Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders, Kaiman said.\n\nUnlike other middle-of-the-road candidates, Kaiman is not afraid to embrace the word \u201ccrisis.\u201d But he differs from a socialist candidate like Sanders or a whirlwind like Trump in that while he understands people\u2019s feelings of crisis, he isn\u2019t trying to overthrow or substantially change the American system of government. He is, of course, looking to make an impact, with campaign issues like supporting Planned Parenthood and the DREAM Act and raising the minimum wage, but he didn\u2019t have an issue with government\u2019s form in and of itself.\n\nRather, he frames the \u2018crisis\u2019 as a matter of perception.\n\n\u201cThe crisis is that everyone has lost confidence in their government. They\u2019re eager to believe all people are corrupt because they\u2019re not feeling confident in themselves. There\u2019s a stagnation of wages, for a period of time people were out of work. There\u2019s a sense of fear because of ISIS and other things going on around the world. We\u2019re losing control of our own ability to sustain our families, to sustain our community, and possibly to sustain our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with that fear comes a willingness to listen to anybody else who is willing to call other people names.\u201d\n\nKaiman expressed confidence that he could draw voters back to the mainstream Democratic fold.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I think we need to appreciate that just because somebody is identifying with Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, it doesn\u2019t mean we should give up on them. It means we should listen to them,\u201d he said.\n\nHis solution is to focus on a local level, getting down and dirty with the nitty gritty of issues like roads and sanitation.\n\n\u201cI believe that the way we start growing confidence is by understanding what people are thinking, doing and feeling locally,\u201d he said. As a former town supervisor of the fifth largest town in the United States, he said coordinating these services and making them cost effective is a specialty of his.\n\nBut Kaiman had aspirations in terms of national legislation as well. The candidate said he wanted to modify and improve Obamacare, even if it meant Republicans were going to try to shut it down during the reform process.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a level of creativity where we can get to that point to make amendments to that program,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it will die another way.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic primary is on Tuesday June. 28.\n\nKaiman is on the ballot with Anna Kaplan, Tom Suozzi and Steve Stern.\n\nThe winner will take on either Republican state Sen. Jack Martins or Philip Pidot.\n\nNational pundits consider the race to be a toss up. The seat is currently held by U.S. Rep. Steve Israel (D-Queens/Long Island).\n\nReach Lynn Edmonds at (718) 357-7400 x127, ledmonds@queenstribune.com or @Ellinoamerikana", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Kaiman, former North Hempstead town supervisor, understands crisis.
