Good and evil. Truth and lies. Natural sexuality (within marriage) and homosexuality (of any kind).\n\nThe contrast is bright as day is to night. While Christ repeatedly condemned all \u201csexual immorality\u201d as defined in the Old Testament Jewish moral code (which includes homosexual behavior), God\u2019s Word, throughout both the Old and New Testaments, specifically denounces as evil rising to the level of \u201ca detestable sin\u201d all same-sex sexual conduct \u2013 be it \u201cloving, monogamous and committed,\u201d or otherwise.\n\nLeviticus 18:22, for instance, admonishes, in no uncertain terms: \u201cDo not practice homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman. It is a detestable sin.\u201d\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9 warns: \u201cOr do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality.\u201d\n\nYet deceived they are, and without the Kingdom of God they remain.\n\nIndeed, today there persists a burgeoning racket of apostate biblical revisionists who rationalize sexual sin. Notwithstanding a level of deception rooted in a deeply heartfelt and genuinely emotional variety of wishful thinking, the Holy Bible, thousands of years of history and uncompromising human biology nonetheless remain incontrovertible: Unrepentant homosexual behavior is, always has been and always will be 100 percent and irredeemably wrong.\n\nStill, few people realize that there is a \u201cBible\u201d that not only affirms homosexuality (all forms of sexual immorality, in fact), but that goes so far as to make sin the centerpiece of its doctrine \u2013 its \u201cgolden rule,\u201d if you will.\n\nIn his fantastic new book, \u201cGay Awareness: Discovering the Heart of the Father and the Mind of Christ On Sexuality,\u201d author and minister Landon Schott devotes an entire chapter to this \u201cgay\u201d-affirming \u201cBible.\u201d \u201c[O]ut of the 31,102 verses in the Bible,\u201d he writes, \u201cnot one supports a homosexual lifestyle in any way \u2013 not one. If you are still looking for a scripture that supports homosexuality you need to close your Holy Bible and open The Satanic Bible!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. The Satanic Bible is the only \u201cgay-affirming\u201d Bible in existence (save a handful of heretical and intentionally mistranslated Bible counterfeits).\n\nSchott quotes The Satanic Bible verbatim:\n\n\u201cSatanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your individual desires, be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual, if you choose. Satanism also sanctions any fetish or deviation which will enhance your sex life, so long as it involves no one who does not wish to be involved.\u201d\n\nSatanism? Sounds more like the \u201cvalues neutral\u201d \u201ccomprehensive sex education\u201d curriculum pushed on children in most of today\u2019s public schools.\n\nContrast this with Christianity. Romans 13:13-14, for example, commands, \u201cLet us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatan\u2019s existence is consumed with a mission,\u201d continues Schott, \u201cto defy and mock God, to defy His order of creation, and to mock His governing orders. \u2026 The Church of Satan reverses the order of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, saying it backwards as they begin their services, to defy God. God says love; the Church of Satan says hate. God says heterosexual relationships; the Church of Satan says homosexual relationships. God says monogamous marriage between a man and woman; the Church of Satan says polygamous and sexually open relationships. God gave the Ten Commandments; the Church of Satan established their version, called the Nine Tenets, shown below:\u201d\n\nSatan represents indulgence instead of abstinence! Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams! Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit! Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted! Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek! Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his \u201cdivine spiritual and intellectual development,\u201d has become the most vicious animal of all! Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification! Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years! When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.\n\nConsider The Satanic Bible\u2019s following sex-centric passages. They read like the mission statements of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) or GLSEN:\n\nEach person must decide for himself what form of sexual activity best suits his individual needs.\n\nSatanism ENCOURAGES any form of sexual expression you may desire so long as it hurts no one else.\n\nIf all parties involved are mature adults who willingly take full responsibility for their actions and voluntarily engages in a given form of sexual expression \u2013 even if it is generally considered taboo \u2013 then there is no reason for them to repress their sexual inclinations \u2026 you have no cause to suppress your sexual preferences.\n\nIt is important to point out here that spiritual love and sexual love can, but do not necessarily, go hand in hand.\n\nThe Satanist realizes that if he is to be a sexual connoisseur (and free from sexual guilt) he cannot be stifled by the so-called sexual revolutionist any more than he can by the prudery of his guilt-ridden society.\n\n\u201cThat last verse from The Satanic Bible,\u201d observes Schott, \u201creminds me of a powerful proverb on the adulterous woman. Proverbs 30:20 says, \u2018This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d\u2018 Again and again The Satanic Bible tells its readers that there is nothing wrong with giving in to your natural sexual desires. The Bible tells us to resist the sexual desires of the flesh,\u201d he concludes.\n\nSchott points out, and I agree wholeheartedly, that homosexual practitioners are not necessarily demonic (or demon possessed) and that they are desperately in need of Christ\u2019s Truth, in love, as well as much prayer.\n\nEven so, it remains true that homosexual sin is demonic.\n\nAll good things come from God the Father, and all wickedness comes from the father of lies. If God designed biblical marriage and natural human sexuality, and He did, then we are left no doubt as to who designed its counterfeit \u2013 as to who fabricated pagan \u201cgay marriage\u201d and otherwise perverted God\u2019s perfect purposes for human sexuality.\n\nSin is from Satan. Homosexual behavior is sin. Therefore, homosexual behavior is from Satan.\n\nYes, \u201cgay marriage\u201d is evil.\n\nYes, homosexuality is evil.\n\nFor the Bible \u2013 and The Satanic Bible \u2013 tells me so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law..05/26/2016 19:01:01PM EST.", "author": "Matt Barber", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.", "title": "Matt Barber - The Satanic Bible\u2019s \u2018Golden Rule\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2016/04/03/the-satanic-bibles-golden-rule-n2142631", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/68/2016-03-07T145237Z_1_LYNXNPEC260UE_RTROPTP_3_CBUSINESS-US-USA-COURT-EBOOKS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.", "title": "Matt Barber - The Satanic Bible\u2019s \u2018Golden Rule\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2016/04/03/the-satanic-bibles-golden-rule-n2142631", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/68/2016-03-07T145237Z_1_LYNXNPEC260UE_RTROPTP_3_CBUSINESS-US-USA-COURT-EBOOKS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Satanic Bible\u2019s \u2018Golden Rule\u2019  , Matt Barber, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Satanic Bible is the only \u201cgay-affirming\u201d Bible in existence (save a handful of heretical and intentionally mistranslated Bible counterfeits).\n\u201cThat last verse from The Satanic Bible,\u201d observes Schott, \u201creminds me of a powerful proverb on the adulterous woman.\nFor the Bible \u2013 and The Satanic Bible \u2013 tells me so.\nIndeed, today there persists a burgeoning racket of apostate biblical revisionists who rationalize sexual sin.\nSatan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!"}
