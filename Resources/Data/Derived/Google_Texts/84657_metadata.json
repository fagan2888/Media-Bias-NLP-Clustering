The stocks include London-based GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE:GSK), Switzerland-based Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) and France-based Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY).\n\nThe veteran portfolio manager has an impressive track-record of managing to pick the most profitable stocks in foreign developed markets. His $7.2 billion Causeways flagship International Value fund has a \u2018Gold\u2019 rating from Morningstar and has outperformed 91% of its peers over the last five years. The fund returns an annual 9.77% on average. To put things in perspective, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Index returned an annual 6.72% on average during the same time. So far this year the fund has grown by 9.46%, slightly higher than the benchmark return of 8.63%.\n\nMr. Hartford has only good things to say about the future prospects of foreign pharmaceutical industry. He believes the patent cliff that hit blockbuster drugs of most pharma giants last year is almost nearing its end and it\u2019s now time that the aggressive research and development spending on new drug pipelines start reaping results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dirt cheap as it was four years ago when people were worried about Obamacare and the patent cliff, but there is decent scope for continued improvement,\u201d said Mr. Hartford.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline\n\nThe largest drug-maker in Britain has been going through a tough time lately, mostly on the back of intense competition, generics, pricing pressures and corruption scandals faced last year.\n\nMr. Hartford, however, believes the company is swiftly moving towards improvement. Glaxo struck a $20 billion-plus three-way asset swap deal with Novartis early in 2015 according to which its cancer drug unit was sold off to Novartis while Glaxo acquired vaccines business of the Swiss company. Apart from that, the two companies jointly created one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer healthcare ventures. According to Mr. Hartford, the deal refocuses Glaxo\u2019s expertise on core operations relating to vaccines, consumer healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Glaxo CEO Andrew Witty himself describes the deal as value generating that favors the company by divesting risky cancer drug development and investing into stable and long-standing vaccines and consumer healthcare including over-the-counter products.\n\nGlaxo said in a statement to investors yesterday that the company expects savings from the deal to start accruing by 2016. Mr. Hartford also remains optimistic about the company\u2019s R&D efforts which have been mostly directed to a promising respiratory drug pipeline over the last year. Glaxo faces intense generic competition for its top-selling asthma drug Advair in both US and EU \u2013 the drug\u2019s sales slipped 20% YoY to $6.9 billion in 2014.\n\nNovartis\n\nMr. Hartford expects the GSK deal to serve Novartis well. The company has also recently sold off its animal health unit to Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY) and is well on its way to consolidating its business around three key areas of pharmaceuticals, eye-care and generics or biosimilars (knockoffs of biologic drugs). The renewed concentration on eye-care and biosimilars can help the company realize a margin growth amounting to three percentage points, as estimated by Mr. Hartford.\n\nNovartis also struck a $750 million deal with a small biotech firm Aduro Bitotech soon after securing the GSK deal. Aduro develops immune-therapy cancer drugs that aim to harness the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. The company further established a new immune-oncology unit at Cambridge, headed by former Dana-Farber Cancer Institute researcher Glenn Dranoff. The company\u2019s restructuring around oncology treatments and consecutive set of new deals have started reaping dollar benefits already. Novartis attributes $200 million of income to Glaxo\u2019s oncology assets for March alone.\n\nAnother bright spot in Novartis\u2019 future is an experimental heart failure drug, LCZ696, which is expected to be approved by US Food and Drug Administration by this year\u2019s third quarter. The drug is tagged as a definite blockbuster with analyst consensus placing peak sales at above $10 billion. The company is also well on its way to launch the first-ever biosimilar in the US, a cancer drug Zarxio.\n\nSanofi\n\nSanofi has been undergoing a rough patch especially in its key diabetes business that saw a larger-than-expected decline in sales in the first-quarter of fiscal year 2015 due to low pricing of the company\u2019s blockbuster drug Lantus. The low diabetes sales are expected to continue at least till the end of this year. Sanofi stock has been down 8% over the last year, as investors lose confidence in the company\u2019s key growth driver \u2013 diabetes drugs.\n\nHowever, Mr. Hartford expects the company to significantly benefit from drug launches in emerging markets, particularly in Asia. Sanofi currently derives 15% of its sales from Asian emerging markets, where most currencies are either pegged completely or partially to US dollar. As dollar continues its upward trend, the company predicts foreign exchange fluctuations to add about 12% to 2015 Earnings per Share, up from a previous 5% estimate.\n\nFurthermore, Sanofi\u2019s new diabetes drug Toujeo \u2013 an advanced version of Lantus \u2013 was launched in the US recently. The drug\u2019s sales are expected to be closely followed over the next few months, as per London-based Mirabaud Securities analyst Nick Turner. Toujeo can potentially help cover up lost dollars from Lantus\u2019 price cuts in the US.", "article_metadata": {"DESCRIPTION": "Causeway Capital president, Mr. Harry Hartford, cites GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE:GSK), Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) and Sanofi SA (NYSE:SNY) as his most favorite European pharmaceutical stocks for the year, Barrons reports.", "COPYRIGHT": "2016 Bidness Etc", "AUTHOR": "Hannah Ishmael", "og": {"url": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/42100-glaxosmithkline-plc-adr-gsk-novartis-ag-adr-nvs-sanofi-sa-adr-sny-top-3-eur/", "image": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/glaxosmithkline-plc-adr-gsk-novartis-ag-adr-nvs-sanofi-sa-adr-sny-top-3-eur.jpg", "type": "Business_news", "description": "Causeway Capital president, Mr. Harry Hartford, cites GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE:GSK), Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) and Sanofi SA (NYSE:SNY) as his most favorite European pharmaceutical stocks for the year, Barrons reports.", "title": "GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (GSK), Novartis AG (ADR) (NVS), Sanofi SA (ADR) (SNY): Top 3 European Pharma Stock Picks"}, "IMAGE": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/glaxosmithkline-plc-adr-gsk-novartis-ag-adr-nvs-sanofi-sa-adr-sny-top-3-eur.jpg", "syndication-source": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/42100-glaxosmithkline-plc-adr-gsk-novartis-ag-adr-nvs-sanofi-sa-adr-sny-top-3-eur/", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"description": "Causeway Capital president, Mr. Harry Hartford, cites GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE:GSK), Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) and Sanofi SA (NYSE:SNY) as his most favorite European pharmaceutical stocks for the year, Barrons reports.", "title": "GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (GSK), Novartis AG (ADR) (NVS), Sanofi SA (ADR) (SNY): Top 3 European Pharma Stock Picks", "url": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/42100-glaxosmithkline-plc-adr-gsk-novartis-ag-adr-nvs-sanofi-sa-adr-sny-top-3-eur/", "image": {"width": "1280px", "identifier": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/glaxosmithkline-plc-adr-gsk-novartis-ag-adr-nvs-sanofi-sa-adr-sny-top-3-eur.jpg", "height": "720px"}, "site": "@Bidnessetc", "player": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.bidnessetc.com/video/embed/federal-reserves-rate-hike-banks-speculate-risks-strategy/", "height": 270}, "card": "photo"}, "language": "english", "fb": {"admins": "bidnessetc", "app_id": 441098346005934}, "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "KEYWORDS": "GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE:GSK), Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS), Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY), advair, Harry hartford, causeway capital, barrons, Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY)", "article": {"section": "Health", "tag": "glaxosmithkline-stock", "published_time": "2015-05-07"}, "news_keywords": "GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE:GSK), Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS), Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY), advair, Harry hartford, causeway capital, barrons, Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY)", "THUMBNAIL": "http://images.bidnessetc.com/img/310-glaxosmithkline-plc-adr-gsk-novartis-ag-adr-nvs-sanofi-sa-adr-sny-top-3-eur.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "SUBJECT": "Driving The Financial Data Revolution Bidnessetc.com"}, "article_summary": "The stocks include London-based GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE:GSK), Switzerland-based Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) and France-based Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY).\nThe drug\u2019s sales are expected to be closely followed over the next few months, as per London-based Mirabaud Securities analyst Nick Turner.\nMr. Hartford has only good things to say about the future prospects of foreign pharmaceutical industry.\nAduro develops immune-therapy cancer drugs that aim to harness the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer.\nAccording to Mr. Hartford, the deal refocuses Glaxo\u2019s expertise on core operations relating to vaccines, consumer healthcare and pharmaceuticals."}
