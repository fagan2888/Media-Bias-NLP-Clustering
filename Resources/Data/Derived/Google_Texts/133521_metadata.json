Finding info on the Medicare Part D RAC program is a harder proposition, but a recent report from the GAO had shed some light on the program\u2019s success since it was implemented in 2011.\n\nThe report\u2019s findings, however, paint a less than satisfactory picture of the Part D RAC program. For example, the Part D RAC (ACLR Strategic Business Solutions, Livonia, Mich.) recovered a total of $10 million in improper payments from January 2011 through May 2015, despite the fact that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services made $1.9 billion in improper Part D payments in 2014 alone.\n\nThe GAO said the low amount of recoveries was due to several factors, including difficulties deciding what audit issues to pursue. While the CMS authorized the RAC to audit excluded providers, unauthorized prescribers and inappropriate refills of controlled substances, it denied four out six audit issues proposed by the RAC.\n\n\u201cChallenges faced by CMS and the RAC have resulted in few audit issues being approved and therefore a small amount of improper payments being identified and collected relative to CMS's estimates of improper payments in Medicare Part D,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nSection 6411 of the Affordable Care Act expanded the RAC model from Medicare fee-for-service into Medicaid and Medicare Part C (managed care) and Part D. The Part D RAC is responsible for identifying improper payments and recovering any overpayments made to prescription drug plan sponsors.\n\nACLR\u2019s RAC contract expires at the end of December, and the report recommended that the CMS evaluate how it decided what audit issues to pursue as well as make sure that future contracts include clear work expectations. CMS agreed with the GAO, and said it would be awarding the new RAC contract by January 2016.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/part-rac-getting-b17179936077/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "A typical Google search for Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) will pull hundreds of reports and web pages, but the vast majority are concerned with the Medicare fee-for-service RAC program, which has...", "title": "Is the Part D RAC Getting the Job Done?"}, "csrf-token": "R7YJsALpFwGXoSFyvRFaPxJFrHn5P4jg5f0NujlrOcbqqKy1Z8nxNG2CNESGbph3tlMtgc_IK5FJbqc115No5WRG3LW9j1dkb4w5DRQgKdU1:D0s6TcAbsc9otUoq9tp41oKlFz7iptIzru5J05tsacTvQf0k7KkOPo5xL5OviiFv6Xl-Mc9CcuDeSjLDpEW-_40VXrbPy7G1yxA3sm3CgsI1", "description": "A typical Google search for Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) will pull hundreds of reports and web pages, but the vast majority are concerned with the Medicare fee-for-service RAC program, which has", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "The report\u2019s findings, however, paint a less than satisfactory picture of the Part D RAC program.\nSection 6411 of the Affordable Care Act expanded the RAC model from Medicare fee-for-service into Medicaid and Medicare Part C (managed care) and Part D.
