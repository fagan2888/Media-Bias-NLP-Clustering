There are no fees associated with the VITA program, ensuring taxpayers receive 100 percent of their refund.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo qualify for VITA, which is open to both Native and non-Native families, an individual or household must not make more than $58,000 per year and reside within the tribe\u2019s 14-county jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nThe service is free and runs Feb. 2 through April 15. Walk-ins are available at the Tahlequah and Westville sites. All others are by appointment only.\n\n\n\nThis year, 13 certified volunteers from Cherokee Nation\u2019s commerce department and Cherokee Nation Entertainment will be preparing returns using the basic 1040 form and others that apply. All federal and state returns will be e-filed through VITA at no charge.\n\n\n\nTo use the service, families must provide a photo ID, Social Security card and birth date for each person listed on the return, individual taxpayer identification numbers, W-2s, 1099s, a copy of the previous year\u2019s tax return, documentation of deductions and bank account information for direct deposit of any refund. Additional documents may be required, depending on the return.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also now mandates taxpayers to have had health insurance last year or a penalty could apply.\n\n\n\nVolunteers will be available for assistance in Tahlequah, Pryor, Westville, Stilwell, Sallisaw, Catoosa, Claremore, Jay, Collinsville, Salina, Muskogee, Vinita, Bartlesville and Nowata.\n\n\n\nTax preparation can also be completed online for free for those qualifying at http://www.myfreetaxes.com. NOTE: If you are being charged to prepare your federal or state tax return and your income is $60,000 or less STOP and call 855-698-9435.\n\n\n\nAppointments should be made as soon as possible. For more information on where to find the nearest volunteer and set up an appointment, call 918-453-5536.\n\nCherokee Nation News Release\n\nJulie Hubbard 918-207-3896918-453-5000800-256-0671\n\n\u00a9 Cherokee Nation - All Rights Reserved", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "Starting Feb. 2, the Cherokee Nation offers its Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program to help Cherokee citizens and the general public fill out and file federal and state taxes.", "GENERATOR": "DotNetNuke", "RESOURCE-TYPE": "DOCUMENT", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "REVISIT-AFTER": "1 DAYS", "COPYRIGHT": "Copyright 2016 by Cherokee Nation All Rights Reserved.", "KEYWORDS": "Cherokee Nation, news, culture, history, services, language,DotNetNuke,DNN", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, maximum-scale = 1.0, user-scalable = no, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6ff\"", "article_summary": "Cherokee Nation News ReleaseJulie Hubbard 918-207-3896918-453-5000800-256-0671\u00a9 Cherokee Nation - All Rights Reserved\nTAHLEQUAH, Okla. \u2014 Starting Feb. 2, the Cherokee Nation offers its Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program to help Cherokee citizens and the general public fill out and file federal and state taxes.\nThis year, 13 certified volunteers from Cherokee Nation\u2019s commerce department and Cherokee Nation Entertainment will be preparing returns using the basic 1040 form and others that apply.\nNOTE: If you are being charged to prepare your federal or state tax return and your income is $60,000 or less STOP and call 855-698-9435.\n\u201cThe Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program helps families file for and keep the tax credits for which they are eligible at no cost to the taxpayer,\u201d said Shay Smith, director of the tribe\u2019s Small Business Assistance Center."}
