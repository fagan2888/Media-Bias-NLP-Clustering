As federal courts run out of money to fund all but \u201cessential\u201d employees, Kopf said determining which remaining employees are essential \u201cbecomes a heart-breaking question.\u201d\n\n\u201cReject the premise of the question,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven the loss of employees already suffered by the judiciary on account of the sequester and otherwise, why shouldn\u2019t every remaining employee of every federal district court be declared essential?\u201d\n\nKopf was appointed to the bench in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush. He has generated headlines before, notably in 2004 when he struck down a ban on partial-birth abortions. He also dismissed a lawsuit against a state judge who barred the words \u201crape\u201d and \u201cvictim\u201d in court in 2007.\n\nRegarding the shutdown, Kopf wrote that if all district judges issued an order to that effect, the clerk of court, federal public defender and other executives would be protected from prosecution.\n\n\u201cBest of all, such an order would set up an inter-branch dispute worth having,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat would leave Congress with two choices, he said: Do nothing and destroy the judiciary by failing to pass a budget, or \u201cgo batshit, and the judiciary and Congress could have it out.\u201d (He even helpfully included a link to an urban dictionary definition of the word \u201cbatshit\u201d for the uninitiated.)\n\n\u201cIt is time to tell Congress to go to hell,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
