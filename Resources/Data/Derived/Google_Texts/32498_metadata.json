The following interview with Byron Mallott was held at the Empire\u2019s office on Oct. 13. It has been edited for length.\n\nByron Mallott was barely old enough to buy a beer when he first stepped into politics. At just 22 years old, he became mayor of his hometown of Yakutat. He would later go on to work under former Govs. Bill Egan and Jay Hammond, including time spent appointed to the Permanent Fund Board of Trustees and CEO of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation. He sat down with the Juneau Empire on Monday to discuss why he\u2019s running for Alaska\u2019s highest office and what his administration\u2019s stance would be.\n\nWhy are you getting into the race for governor?\n\nWhile I feel that in many ways running for Governor is part of my continuing journey in Alaska, \u2026 it isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about everything I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s about everything I\u2019ve experienced and a continuing desire to work with Alaskans in order to make a good place that is \u2026 hopefully far, far better. We can dream bigger, we can act bigger. I\u2019m anxious that we in Alaska work hard to come together as Alaskans. You know, we\u2019re really another country in terms of our size, in terms of the magnificence, of the richness of this place that we call home. But in our population, we\u2019re only the size of a relatively small city in any other part of our country and that, I think, gives us an incredible opportunity to do things in ways and to create opportunities, to look at things innovatively, to essentially carve a future in a place that can be incredibly beautiful for all of us. It\u2019s a belief, it\u2019s a sense that Alaskans can come together and make this place the best place on Earth. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running.\n\nWhat do you think about education funding in Alaska?\n\nThe whole future of Alaska will ultimately be built and sustained on the kind of education that we provide for our children. I believe that education should be world class. I think that we should focus, as Alaskans, on education as one of our very highest priorities. I believe that education should begin as soon after birth, as a child begins to reach out and touch the world as the world touches him or her. I think that we should focus on the incredible diversity of our state and \u2026 what we\u2019ve achieved and where we\u2019ve come from in order to inform our educational system and make it uniquely Alaska, while still creating the best educational system in the world in terms of competition, in terms of preparing our citizens for the work world, but also preparing them for their life as citizens. I believe that the University of Alaska, for example, can be a world leader in Arctic policy, in the challenges that are before us in areas like climate change, that it can be a world-class leader in indigenous peoples in the Arctic and their contributions and their place and their uniqueness in our state. It\u2019s the core of my belief.\n\nWhat\u2019s your stance on Senate Bill 21?\n\nIt\u2019s a process that seemed to be very flawed. At least many Alaskans don\u2019t understand it. Many Alaskans believe that the balance favors the oil industry. It resulted immediately in a petition effort to overturn it and that is very problematic. The oil industry is hugely important every single day in Alaska and to our future. We as Alaskans need to be engaged fully with that industry in order to maximize both the revenue available to Alaskans \u2026 and to be able to, over time, attract their investment in our state. That\u2019s a careful balance and we need to work toward that.\n\nHow do feel about dipping into the Permanent Fund?\n\nThe Permanent Fund was created as a way to balance Alaska\u2019s fiscal future, to put away some of the dollars that flow from Prudhoe bay, specifically, into a fund that at some unstated time in the future would be available to meet Alaska\u2019s fiscal needs. In addition, the Legislature and the governors over a period of time have created other reserves to be used to meet Alaska\u2019s revenue needs in times of shortfall.\n\nWe have some way to go before we can have a conversation about, for example, the size of Alaska\u2019s dividend. I don\u2019t believe that the dividend should ever go away. It\u2019s a powerful way for \u2026 every single person in the state to be connected directly to our future and to feel the ups and downs and to understand that this unique source of wealth belongs to every single one of us. The Alaska Permanent Fund is crucial to our future.\n\nAs governor, what would be your stance be on subsistence?\n\nSubsistence has been a long-term issue in Alaska that causes difficulty in the relationship between the state and the federal government. It causes difficulty in the relationships between Alaska Native people and their institutions and the state government. It has been an issue that many people, and I think rightfully, point to as a divisive one within our state and it needs to be addressed and it must be resolved. As governor, it is an issue that I would work hard to resolve. It is an issue that can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nWhat are your ideas about development in Alaska?\n\nAlaska is really another country. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful and resource-rich places on the face of earth. We have a small population. We have as a result the ability to benefit by development as it occurs in terms of jobs, in terms of hopefully continuing to diversify Alaska\u2019s economy. Diversifying Alaska\u2019s economy is so crucial to our future that it will be a strong focus of mine. We are also blessed with some of the most beautiful, pristine natural places, not just in our country but in our world. The federal government and the state government have already identified and preserved many of those areas. The forces that play between, for example, the environmental community and the business community and the development community in our state, often times as it is discussed and as it is acted out is treated as a zero-sum game- that someone has to win, that someone has to lose. I don\u2019t believe that. I\u2019ve been involved in many of these issues between development and maintaining sensitive, beautiful places in our state. There is always an opportunity to work together and to understand.\n\nWhat we need to do is to continue to look at all opportunities, both to maintain the incredible natural beauty of this place while at the same time getting a strong, diversified community for every Alaskan.\n\nWhat\u2019s your stance on the Pebble Mine?\n\nI think the Pebble Mine is an indicator of what I just mentioned. It\u2019s a process where a project that seems to be occurring \u2013 and I say seems to be because there is scientific review underway \u2013 located in an area where many, many people, both in Alaska, in our country and worldwide, view as threatening. An open-pit mine, to me, is problematic, but again I want to converse with Alaskans. I want to go out to the Bristol Bay region and talk to the folks. I want to talk to the mining industry about the future that it sees in our state. The state government has an important role \u2026 and must have the ability to deal with industry, to deal with the people in the regions that are most affected. It has to have the ability to work effectively with the federal government, with our local governments. As we look to resource development in our state, we talk about SB 21, we talk about Pebble. Alaska itself, our government, needs to have world-leading regulatory and research and management capacity to fully serve Alaska\u2019s interest in these very complex and difficult issues of regulating and permitting and even fundamentally allowing projects that are hugely controversial. I believe we don\u2019t and that is something that my administration would make a priority, that Alaskans will believe and know that whatever we negotiate, whatever we permit, whatever we allow will be based upon the best science, will be based upon the most sophisticated technology, will be based upon our government having world class leadership and having the world class ability to make the best judgments for Alaska\u2019s people. We aren\u2019t there yet and we need to get there.\n\nWhat\u2019s your view of the relationship that Alaska should have with the federal government?\n\nThe federal government has a very significant role in Alaska, in many, many areas. In the military, in natural resource management, in land management, in making judgments about economics and environmental regulatory everything from our aviation systems to our transportation systems to our educational systems to our universities. There is probably not a single institutional or public responsibility in Alaska that is not influenced by the federal government, and that suggests to me that Alaska should have the best relationships possible with the federal government that allow us to achieve the best results. That doesn\u2019t mean that we give in or cave in or even demonize the federal government. That is the worst possible kind of way to deal with such a powerful presence. It is an important relationship. It is probably the most important governmental and societal relationship that Alaska has is with its own federal government. And to have the best, but likely tension-laden, hopefully in a positive way, relationship with the federal government \u2013 it\u2019s the way of our past and it\u2019s going to be the way of our future.\n\nDo you think Alaska should be open to taking the extra Medicaid money from Obamacare?\n\nIt\u2019s not Obamacare. it\u2019s the Affordable Care Act, passed by the United State Congress, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. To fight it or to use it as leverage in a larger political game is absolutely inappropriate, in my judgment. I\u2019ll tell you one thing that I believe very strongly has nothing to do with being Democrat or being a partisan person. Even before I thought in those kinds of terms, I always believed that in the richest country in the world, in the most powerful country in the world, that every one of our citizens should have access to health care that keeps them healthy, that makes them better citizens, better able to meet their obligations to family, community and in the workforce. And I believe that passionately.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, JENNIFER CANFIELD, Bill Egan, Byron Mallott, Jay Hammond, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "Editor's note: The Juneau Empire will feature Q&amp;A segments with candidates in statewide races leading into the next election.
