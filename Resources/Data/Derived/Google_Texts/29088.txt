The GOP-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday adopted an amendment into a spending bill that would ban the Transportation Security Administration from allowing non-law enforcement personnel to wear metal badges.

In the wake of incidents involving TSA agents sexually assaulting air travelers and conspiring to smuggle drugs, Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) offered the amendment to “rein in” the agency by withholding funding for the badges.

“When you start telling people that they’re an officer and wearing a badge, they’ll start acting like a law enforcement officer,” Rooney said during the markup of the fiscal 2016 Homeland Security funding bill.

“They’re supposed to screen our bags and passengers, and they’re not supposed to act like cops,” he added.

Rep. Judge Carter (R-Texas), chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the spending bill, said he supported the amendment because of the “incorrect perception that screeners are law enforcement officers.”

A few Democrats said they opposed the proposal because it goes too far.

“I would hate for us because of the misconduct of one or two or 10 people out of hundreds of thousands to provide a difficulty for TSA to do its job when one day someone’s wife and children get on a plane and something awful happens,” Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Pa.) said.
