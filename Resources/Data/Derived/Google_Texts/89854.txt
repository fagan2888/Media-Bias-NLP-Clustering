“Legislative revolt on behalf of kids” ... Senate President Andy Biggs tried to bury the bill (KidsCare) without a vote.” This would have taken health insurance from 30,000 Arizona children.

“We’re still waiting on the outcome of a lawsuit filed with the support of Rep. Brenda Barton and Rep. Bob Thorpe that would roll back ... AHCCCS. If that lawsuit succeeds, some 300,000 people could lose their health care.” Three hundred thousand!

Republicans Sen. Sylvia Allen and Barton and Thorpe have, for reasons unfathomable to intelligent Arizonans, fought unceasingly against funding education and health care for the poor citizens of Arizona from the day they took office. Why? And the second “why” is why do the parents and grandparents of Arizona’s children, our next generation, keep electing these people who only want to fund prisons?

Please, please keep this in mind come election time.
