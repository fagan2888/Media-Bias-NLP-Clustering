He demonstrated how to be weak and spineless while playing more subtly with Palin fire by laughingly suggesting that while he has \u201cno doubt\u201d Obama loves this country (not one high profile Republican seems capable of saying Obama loves this country for sure), his polices are so terrible for the nation.\n\nRubio told the AP that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Obama loves the country, \u201cbut I just think his policies are bad for our nation.\u201d\n\nSure, if by bad Rubio thinks record stock market gains, the economy gaining \u201cnearly five times more jobs under President Barack Obama than it did during the presidency of George W. Bush\u201d with the unemployment rate dropping \u201cto just below the historical average,\u201d improved rights and protections for women, lgbtq, and undocumented immigrants, measured responses to international crises, avoidance of Iraq WMD type errors, getting Osama, corporate profits nearly tripling, affordable healthcare via the Obamacare exchanges which are growing more popular by the day, and fighting for a raise to the minimum wage which caused Walmart to grudgingly give a raise to their workers are bad. Just naming a few things. There\u2019s more.\n\nOh, yeah. Obama\u2019s America is almost Bush\u2019s Katrina, but not. It\u2019s the opposite; showing how government can work well.\n\nA refresher: Rudy Giuliani said, \u201cI know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America. He doesn\u2019t love you. And he doesn\u2019t love me. He wasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.\u201d\n\nThis rests on the same cheap hatred as Palin\u2019s desperate 2008 \u201cThis is not a man who sees America the way you and I see America.\u201d\n\nThis is the kind of attack Republicans revel in. It\u2019s a fallacious argument impugning the alleged motives of their opponent. The only time someone engages in this kind of shoddy argument is when the facts and the evidence aren\u2019t on their side.\n\nSo Republicans run entire campaigns on suggesting Obama is \u201cpallin\u2019 around with terrorists\u201d and \u201chates America\u201d. What does it mean and upon what is this based? Let\u2019s see. Obama got Osama. He has fought hard for the middle class. He has managed to rescue this country from the Great Bush Recession of 2008 in spite of relentless and admitted deliberate obstruction by Republicans, who only stood in the President\u2019s way out of spite. If anyone has demonstrated contempt for this nation, it is Republicans.\n\nAnd that is precisely why they rely upon this kind of cheap shot. They are all going Palin, because they can\u2019t go policy. A whole lot of snarling pit bull with no bite. Republicans have a problem and that is that they can\u2019t afford to alienate their base, but their base jumped the hate shark a long time ago. This leaves Republicans looking decidedly unpresidential and petty when responding to easy questions like this. The right answer isn\u2019t hard. It\u2019s a time to pass on cheap shots. It\u2019s a time to act above the fray, to show themselves as presidential \u2014 but they just can\u2019t do it. They can\u2019t resist the cheap shots.\n\nRepublicans are like a crazy stalker ex. They just can\u2019t quit their Obama hate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) tried to walk a finer line when asked to respond to Giuliani's remarks.
