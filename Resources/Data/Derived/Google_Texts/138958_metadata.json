Many people believe this message, but I don\u2019t accept that whites will silently walk into the night.\u201d\n\nRobb then offered an amended version of this scenario. \u201cYes, minorities may be the majority in the United States by 2042, but only on the east and west coasts. When that occurs, you\u2019ll see a white anxiety crisis, which will cause many of them to migrate into the heartland.\u201d\n\nContinuing these thoughts, Robb stated: \u201cRight now, liberals call the heartland \u2018flyover country.\u2019 But within the next 20-30 years, you\u2019re also going to find a rebirth of white identity. The reasons why are numerous. In the Southwest, a growing number of Hispanics are beginning to openly defy U.S. law. Blacks in the South want to establish a new Africa. All of these factors, not to mention disapproval of Obamacare and gun control laws, will lead to a growing secessionist movement in the heartland against the federal government.\u201d\n\nThis divide is already starting today, said Robb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen congressmen elected in the heartland go to Washington, D.C. and seek to return our nation to sanity, their words fall on deaf ears,\u201d he said. \u201cThe D.C. political establishment shows total disdain for these elected officials. At some point, everyone in the heartland will say, \u2018Keep your hands off of us.\u2019 States\u2019 rights issues will then become highly important.\u201d\n\nRobb further explained: \u201cLarger numbers of Hispanics and blacks who depend on the federal government will eventually weaken the entire system. This situation is unsustainable and will lead to an economic collapse. The entire house of cards will come crumbling down. That\u2019s why we established the Soldiers of the Cross Training Institute. It\u2019s our way of preparing for this window of opportunity. Heartland states will wield a great deal of influence when the federal government becomes too weak to survive. When this moment arrives, we\u2019ll declare our independence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is little time to delay, added Robb.\n\n\u201cThe following example seems perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cPrairie dogs always select a sentinel to watch for hawks. When it barks, the other prairie dogs listen. The problem with so many whites today is that they refuse to hear the sentinel\u2019s call that arises from the nationalist movement.\u201d\n\nRather than being discouraged, though, Robb provided another alternative.\n\n\u201cWhat we need right now is a shepherd instead of more sentinels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re missing that sense of love for our own heritage. We\u2019re beyond the point of warnings. The trouble with whites today is that we\u2019re not united together. Our enemies all appear to be joined as one, intent on the destruction of our culture, while we remain fragmented and controlled by fear. We have to break through that barrier and show white Christians how to love our people and heritage instead of letting it be pushed down the memory hole. The people who do that are our country\u2019s real heroes.\u201d\n\nVictor Thorn is a hard-hitting researcher, journalist and author of over 50 books.", "article_metadata": {"globalsign-domain-verification": "sNwcyvAKKVdlvmczGYqW7cfC-jmzl3k_VE0dV90N37"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYes, minorities may be the majority in the United States by 2042, but only on the east and west coasts.\nHeartland states will wield a great deal of influence when the federal government becomes too weak to survive.\nThe trouble with whites today is that we\u2019re not united together.\nThe problem with so many whites today is that they refuse to hear the sentinel\u2019s call that arises from the nationalist movement.\u201dRather than being discouraged, though, Robb provided another alternative.\nMany people believe this message, but I don\u2019t accept that whites will silently walk into the night.\u201dRobb then offered an amended version of this scenario."}
