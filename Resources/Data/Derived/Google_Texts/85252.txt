Tripp, SD

A wind farm with 43 turbines in southeast South Dakota is now producing power.



The Beethoven Wind Farm in Tripp can produce an estimated 80 megawatts when at full capacity.



California-based BayWa r.e. Wind is the farm's operator. Northwestern Energy is purchasing all the energy produced by the project.



Construction for the farm started in September. It is located at the confluence of Bon Homme, Charles Mix and Hutchinson County, near Tripp Lake, about six miles west of Tripp.



The project's cost was estimated between $110 million and $120 million for the turbines during the planning stages. Local landowners are getting paid for the turbines on their land.
