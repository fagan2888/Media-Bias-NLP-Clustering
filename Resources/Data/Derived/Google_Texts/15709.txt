Senator Mikulski has worked tirelessly for more than three decades on behalf of the citizens of Maryland. CCI Health and Wellness public health clinic in Silver Spring has been the recipient of the Senator's efforts. The clinic treats 18, 000 low income patients annually.

"Without her funding assistance we wouldn't be able to keep our doors open" said the clinic's Chief Medical Officer Doctor Marcia LoBrano. "Because of her help five centers including ours received direct funding from the Affordable Care Act that translates into $1200 per patient. " says LoBrano.

The five term member of Congress is the first female Democrat elected to the Senate. She is also the longest serving woman in the Senate. She will join 16 others at a White House ceremony tomorrow where they will receive the honor.
