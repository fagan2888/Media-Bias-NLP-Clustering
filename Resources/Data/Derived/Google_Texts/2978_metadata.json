We can count on investors to overreact to events they don\u2019t understand, including a plump scapegoat like China.\n\nBy the S & P Global Broad Market Index, equities exchanges dropped $2.23 trillion in value in the first week of 2016. This followed a similar frenzy just last summer, when U.S. stocks alone lost $2.1 trillion in six sessions.\n\nChina was the alleged culprit on both occasions. In Pavlovian fashion, selloffs on the Shanghai exchanges unleashed stampedes on trading floors and wave upon wave of sweaty-palmed worry: The technocrats in Beijing are incompetent. They aren\u2019t committed to free-market reforms. As China\u2019s economy transitions, it will never pull off a soft landing.\n\nRelated: Soros Warns We May Be Repeating 2008 Crisis\n\nAll the money investors surrendered is sheer wastage. As to what passes for logic in the markets, it\u2019s a dumb mix of incomprehension, paranoia, and the habits of lemmings. I would have written \u201chold\u201d advisories last week for half the amount the markets gave up and everyone would now be trillions to the good.\n\nThis column\u2019s contribution to a saner week in global markets comes by way of four observations.\n\nThe markets overreacted. Hell broke loose, of course, when China reported new manufacturing data a week ago Monday, the first trading day of the year. The Caixin Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index dropped to 48.2 in December, below market expectations but down only marginally from 48.6 in November. The Shanghai selloff began instantly, and global markets followed.\n\nIt made no sense from the start. \u201cWhile the reading was the lowest in three months,\u201d Trading Economics sensibly observed, \u201cfactory activity has been in a contraction since March.\u201d\n\nEqually, if the Chinese economy is to transition from manufacturing and investment into one led by consumption and services, as all the world urges, these stats are to be expected, if not welcomed. Later in the week, Beijing reported that consumer prices rose by 1.6 percent in December, marginally higher than the previous month but not a rate suggesting any surge in consumer demand.\n\nRelated: Is China or the Middle East a Bigger Threat to Stocks?\n\nAgain, where\u2019s the surprise? There would be none if investors had kept in mind that China\u2019s per capita income, at roughly $3,900, is a third the global average and that China\u2019s consuming middle class is measured at about 109 million. It\u2019s a nice number, putting China statistically ahead of the U.S., but 1 billion Chinese have yet to make it.\n\nIn the course of all this, the yuan dropped against the dollar last week\u20141.5 percent in onshore trading, 1.7 percent in offshore markets. Given the circumstances, so what? This is simply not grounds for panic selling\u2014or calls to reverse the I.M.F.\u2019s November decision to include the yuan in its global basket of currencies.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economic fundamentals are strong,\u201d the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said in a weekend statement. \u201cForeign reserves are relatively abundant and the financial system is largely stable and healthy.\u201d\n\nAdvice to investors: Take SAFE at its word.\n\nRelated: How a Soaring Dollar Forced China to Devalue Its Currency\n\nGlobal markets misread Shanghai. Asian share markets have a very different relationship to the real economy than markets in the West do. They are less about capital formation than speculation and retain a marked casino-like character they grow out of only slowly. Emphatically, they cannot be read to reflect fundamentals.\n\nWestern investors need to understand this fundamental difference. Last week they seemed to think panic sellers and speculators in Shanghai had an inside line to some prevalent incompetence in Beijing\u2019s ministries and the People\u2019s Bank of China. I\u2019ve heard this a hundred times but never seen any evidence of it.\n\nThe take-home: We\u2019re watching a huge, gradual transition in China. Share traders are to this process as mosquitoes skimming a pond.\n\nWe\u2019re scapegoating again. The underlying reality in equities markets is that a Fed-fueled rally that began seven years ago is unwinding quite apart from anything China does. \u201cWe frontloaded a tremendous rally starting in March 2009,\u201d Dick Fisher, former president of the Dallas Fed, remarked just as shares crashed last week. \u201cI would not blame this selloff on China.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 8 Worst-Performing Dow Stocks of 2015\n\nFisher had earlier predicted a 10 percent to 20 percent correction. \u201cI could also see a flat market for quite some time,\u201d he added last week, \u201cdigesting that enormous return the Fed engineered for six years.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s closer to reality. But isn\u2019t China responsible for the glut in commodities markets and the consequent collapse of prices?\n\nThe answer\u2019s another question: Why weren\u2019t commodities companies smart enough to curtail their investments years ago, when the mainland made clear it was serious about transitioning away from manufacturing?\n\nWere the strategic planners asleep at their desks?\n\nWe\u2019re addicted to illusions. Westerners, notably Americans, have finally dropped the thought that foreign investment and exposure to market mechanisms will ineluctably lead to democracy in China. But we now await some kind of 180 by which Beijing abandons the strong state role characteristic of all major non-Western economies. Unless they introduce American-style free-market reforms, China\u2019s leaders are doomed to fail.\n\nNot in a thousand years will this prove out. Economic policy, like stock markets, tax regimes, and regulatory frameworks always has a marked cultural dimension. They are in part artifacts that express a tradition.\n\nWaiting for this imagined evolution is a waste of time. It also sustains a certain blindness as we look across the Pacific and sets us up for future disappointments and another round of costly confusion and fear.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As", "title": "Misreading China Leads to Another Foolish Market Rout", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/11/Misreading-China-Leads-Another-Foolish-Market-Rout", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-economy-policy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/11/Misreading-China-Leads-Another-Foolish-Market-Rout", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-economy-policy_1.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "This column\u2019s contribution to a saner week in global markets comes by way of four observations.\nBy the S & P Global Broad Market Index, equities exchanges dropped $2.23 trillion in value in the first week of 2016.\nWesterners, notably Americans, have finally dropped the thought that foreign investment and exposure to market mechanisms will ineluctably lead to democracy in China.\nThe Shanghai selloff began instantly, and global markets followed.\nHell broke loose, of course, when China reported new manufacturing data a week ago Monday, the first trading day of the year."}
