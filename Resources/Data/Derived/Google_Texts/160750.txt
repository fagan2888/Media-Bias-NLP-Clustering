San Diego and California both scored well in the latest national survey of clean-tech activities. Five of the top seven cities in the survey are in the Golden State.

California held onto its No. 1 ranking among states for the fifth consecutive year in the Clean Tech Leadership Index report.

San Diego moved up four spots to number three among the 50 largest American cities. San Francisco and San Jose rank just ahead of San Diego. Sacramento and Los Angeles are ranked just behind.

The survey measured a host of different indicators including renewable energy, clean-tech policies and clean-tech investment.

Ron Pernick runs Clean Edge, the research firm that put together the report and he said clean-tech has a firm foothold in California.

"Not only are people pursuing climate friendly policies more increasingly in certain state's and regions, but also prices are coming down," Pernick said.

Lower prices, according to Pernick, make it easier for people to install solar, buy electric vehicles, or build energy friendly structures.
