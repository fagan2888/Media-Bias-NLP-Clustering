She says, \"All research shows that a tangible book does more than help actual reading and literacy. But it helps individuals, especially small children, learn how to use their hands. It enhances motor skills. It enhances comprehension. All the things that they'll need to start school and do well once they're in school.\"\n\nThe books will be handed out this Saturday at 713 Albemarle Ave. in Greenville.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of books were given away to children Saturday in Greenville with the help of volunteers.", "language": "english", "author": "Dave Jordan", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Greenville-sorority-gives-away-thousands-of-books-323166331.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/books+giveawayweb.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Thousands of books were given away to children Saturday in Greenville with the help of volunteers.", "title": "Greenville book giveaway a success"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thousands of books were given away to children Saturday in Greenville with the help of volunteers.", "title": "Greenville book giveaway a success", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Greenville-sorority-gives-away-thousands-of-books-323166331.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/books+giveawayweb.jpg", "creator": "@WITN", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Greenville book giveaway a success", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Greenville book giveaway a success"}, "article_summary": "The Delta Sigma Theta sorority Greenville chapter, along with local book publisher Diane Taylor, are giving away 20,000 children's books this weekend.\nThousands of books were given away to children Saturday in Greenville with the help of volunteers.\nPrevious Story:A local service organization is giving away thousands of children's books in an effort to improve literacy.\nGreenville Mayor Allen Thomas also helped hand out the books and said many non-profits and schools came from all across eastern North Carolina.\nThe books arrived Thursday, free of charge, thanks to the non-profit organization \"First Book,\" which provides books and educational resources to schools and communities in need."}
