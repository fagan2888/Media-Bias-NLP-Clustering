One head of state who has made the cut is President Obama.\n\nThe commander in chief will make his seventh appearance on the Comedy Central talk show on Tuesday the 21st, two weeks ahead of Stewart\u2019s final broadcast on August 6, Comedy Central announced Friday. Obama is getting to be an old hand at the late-night goodbye. He was one of David Letterman\u2019s final guests on the Late Show in May, and helped send off The Colbert Report in December, even stepping behind Stephen Colbert\u2019s desk for a special edition of the show\u2019s \u201cThe Word,\u201d all about Obamacare.\n\nObama has appeared on The Daily Show twice as president and four times as a presidential candidate and U.S. senator. Back in 2010, he became the first-ever sitting president to visit the show.\n\nOn Obama\u2019s most recent visit to The Daily Show, on Oct. 18, 2012, the president was in the middle of his re-election campaign and Stewart grilled him about his debate performance against then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. (If you have blocked out the 2012 election in response to the specter of the 2016 election, Obama had a self-professed \u201coff night\u201d during one of his debates against Romney. Don\u2019t worry, he still won the presidency.)\n\nAs for what lies in store for Obama\u2019s third appearance since taking office, Obama could try to sell The Daily Show audience on his Iran deal, talk federal penitentiaries, have a Donald Trump singalong, or simply bid a fond farewell from one boss to another.\n\nTrevor Noah will officially take over as The Daily Show host on Sept. 28.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It will be Obama\u2019s seventh appearance on The Daily Show", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Melissa Locker", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "It will be Obama\u2019s seventh appearance on The Daily Show", "title": "President Obama Will Make One Final Daily Show Appearance", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/07/president-obama-will-make-one-final-daily-show-appearance", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55aa6d09fff2c16856a6df8e/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/s-obama-jon-stewart-daily-show-GettyImages-154351530.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "It will be Obama\u2019s seventh appearance on The Daily Show", "title": "President Obama Will Make One Final Daily Show Appearance", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55aa6d09fff2c16856a6df8e/master/pass/s-obama-jon-stewart-daily-show-GettyImages-154351530.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "President Obama,The Daily Show,Jon Stewart,Television", "pubdate": "2015-07-18T11:13:00Z", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3ff\"", "article_summary": "One head of state who has made the cut is President Obama.\nObama has appeared on The Daily Show twice as president and four times as a presidential candidate and U.S. senator.\nBack in 2010, he became the first-ever sitting president to visit the show.\nTrevor Noah will officially take over as The Daily Show host on Sept. 28.\nThe commander in chief will make his seventh appearance on the Comedy Central talk show on Tuesday the 21st, two weeks ahead of Stewart\u2019s final broadcast on August 6, Comedy Central announced Friday."}
