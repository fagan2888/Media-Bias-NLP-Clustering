In the Times, Bina Shah, a Pakistani \u201ccontributing opinion writer,\u201d complains that \u201cHomeland,\u201d much of which is set in Pakistan this season, demonstrates yet again that \u201cthe world sees us one-dimensionally \u2014 as a country of terrorists and extremists, conservatives who enslave women and stone them to death, and tricky scoundrels who hate Americans and lie pathologically to our supposed allies.\u201d\n\nAnd the problem is not just \u201cHomeland,\u201d she writes, it\u2019s not even just Hollywood, but also \u201cbiased journalism, originating among mainstream American journalists who care little for depth and accuracy.\u201d\n\nShe notes that in \u201cHomeland\u201d and various feature films that use Pakistan as a backdrop (e.g. \u201cA Mighty Heart,\u201d about the kidnapping and murder of reporter Daniel Pearl, and \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d about the killing of Osama bin Laden) she has \u201cseen India\u2019s signature homemade Ambassador cars traveling down Pakistani streets; actors who play tribal Pashtuns but look Bihari; Western women wearing chadors where they don\u2019t have to, or going around bareheaded when they should be covered.\u201d In one scene in \u201cHomeland,\u201d set in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas, she hears \u201ceveryone speaking Urdu, not the region\u2019s Pashto.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s the bias? Seriously?\n\nMs. Shah quotes from the Post piece by Laura Durkay, identified as a \u201cfilmmaker and activist\u201d whose \u201cwriting has appeared in AlterNet, Gay City News, and Socialist Worker, among others.\u201d Ms. Durkay charges that \u201cHomeland\u201d is the \u201cmost bigoted show on television,\u201d and that it \u201cperpetuates racist ideas.\u201d\n\nShe, too, fails to provide any evidence, instead asserting that the series \u201chas churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the clich\u00e9.\u201d She calls the show\u2019s heroine a \u201cblonde, white Red Riding Hood lost in a forest of faceless Muslim wolves.\u201d\n\nFull disclosure: I am a \u201cHomeland\u201d fan. The show has a fast-paced, ripped-from-the-headlines plot and intriguing characters. Among them: Fara Sherazi who is an Iranian-born, observant Muslim -- and CIA agent. She\u2019s smart and beautiful to boot. This season there also is a young Pakistani survivor of a drone attack that killed innocent celebrants at a wedding. He wants to return to his medical studies and not get involved in the war between the jihadis and Americans.\n\nDoes that sound Islamophobic, racist or bigoted to you? Or does it sound like Ms. Shah and Ms. Durkay are attempting to enforce \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u2013 hurling the usual epithets to suppress views with which they disagree. Ms. Durkay is adamant that \u201cHomeland\u201d presents \u201ca Frankenstein-monster global terrorist threat that simply doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Victims of the 41 jihadi terrorist groups now operating in two dozen countries will be relieved to learn that Mr. Durkay, \u201cfilmmaker and activist,\u201d has arrived at that conclusion.\n\nThis little disinformation campaign comes at an interesting moment. Farahnaz Ispahani, a former member of the Pakistani parliament, and Nina Shea, director of the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center for Religious Freedom, warned last week that Pakistan now \u201cabounds with violent sectarian and Islamist groups\u201d and that there is a real risk that \u201cthe world\u2019s second largest \u2013 and only nuclear-armed \u2013 Muslim country\u201d is undergoing a process of \u201cTalibanization.\u201d\n\nC. Christine Fair, a scholar at Georgetown University, has just published \u201cFighting to the End: The Pakistan Army\u2019s Way of War.\u201d Pakistan, she writes, \u201cseems to be on an interminable downward spiral.\u201d She adds: \u201cPakistani terrorists, operating under the banner of the Pakistani Taliban have killed thousands, if not tens of thousands of Pakistanis.\u201d Nevertheless, the government \u201chas remained committed to using Islamist proxies as tools of foreign policy and Islamism as a tool of domestic politics.\u201d\n\nAmong those proxies: the Afghan Taliban, the al Qaeda-affiliated Haqqani Network, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, accused of the 2008 attacks in Mumbai and believed by many \u2013 including Arif Jamal, Pakistani-born author of a well-regarded new book on the LeT -- to be closely linked with Pakistani intelligence. Professor Fair concludes that \u201cthe world should prepare for a Pakistan that is ever more dangerous.\u201d\n\nLast year, former Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. Husain Haqqani published \u201cMagnificent Delusions: Pakistan, the United States, and an Epic History of Misunderstanding.\u201d Critical of both American and Pakistani policies, Mr. Haqqani describes Pakistan as an \u201cangry\u201d nation with deceptive rulers. He does not rule out the possibility that it will become a failed state.\n\nI first visited Pakistan 31 years ago. I met many hospitable and engaging people. I became not a Pakistanophobe but a Pakistanophile \u2013 returning to the country about a year later to trek in the northern reaches of the land, home to eight of the ten tallest mountains in the world. I was privileged to explore such fabled spots as Hunza, Gilgit and the Swat Valley.\n\nFive years ago this month, sponsored by the U.S. State Department, I visited a different and certainly more perilous country. Terrorist attacks were occurring with alarming frequency. I was warned not to linger in public lest someone identify me as an American and alert attackers.\n\nAnother of Ms. Shah\u2019s grievances: Homeland \u201cwas filmed in Cape Town, South Africa, with its Indian Muslim community standing in for Pakistanis.\u201d I would suggest that the likely explanation was security \u2013 not anti-Pakistani bigotry.\n\nA revealing fact: In 1947, religious minorities constituted 23% Of Pakistan\u2019s population. Today, it\u2019s 3%. That said, even on my most recent visit, I did meet many Pakistanis who were warm and welcoming \u2013 and distressed by the rise of intolerance and jihadism in their country.\n\nSuch people understand that many factors are contributing to the deteriorating image of their homeland. \u201cHomeland\u201d is not among them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are the cast, crew and fans of Homeland -- Showtimes television series about a brilliant but neurotic CIA agent  Islamophobes?.05/26/2016 3:10:46AM EST.", "author": "Cliff May", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Are the cast, crew and fans of Homeland -- Showtimes television series about a brilliant but neurotic CIA agent  Islamophobes?", "title": "- \u201cHomeland\u201d Under Attack", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/cliffmay/2014/10/22/homeland-under-attack-n1908585", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/289/2014-10-16T151331Z_1_LYNXNPEA9F0R1_RTROPTP_3_USA-CYBERWAR.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Are the cast, crew and fans of Homeland -- Showtimes television series about a brilliant but neurotic CIA agent  Islamophobes?", "title": "- \u201cHomeland\u201d Under Attack", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/cliffmay/2014/10/22/homeland-under-attack-n1908585", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/289/2014-10-16T151331Z_1_LYNXNPEA9F0R1_RTROPTP_3_USA-CYBERWAR.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\u201cHomeland\u201d Under Attack, Cliff May, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8de\"", "article_summary": "Or does it sound like Ms. Shah and Ms. Durkay are attempting to enforce \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u2013 hurling the usual epithets to suppress views with which they disagree.\nAre the cast, crew and fans of \u201cHomeland\u201d -- Showtime\u2019s television series about a brilliant but neurotic CIA agent \u2013 Islamophobes?\nThis season there also is a young Pakistani survivor of a drone attack that killed innocent celebrants at a wedding.\nSuch people understand that many factors are contributing to the deteriorating image of their homeland.\n\u201cHomeland\u201d is not among them."}
