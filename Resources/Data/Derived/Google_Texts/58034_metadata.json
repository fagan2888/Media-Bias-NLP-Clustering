One is a scum-sucking bottom dweller\u2026and the other is a fish.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the one about McCain\u2019s comeback here in 2008, which Graham uses to lighten his own dim presidential prospects in 2016: \u201cWhat have I learned from being around John all these years? You can be fifth in a four-person race and still win New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the one when Graham asks, \u201cHow many believe ISIS is coming here if we don\u2019t stop \u2019em over there?\u201d (Most hands go up.)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the latest, in which he divides the 2016 election into two parts: \u201cBefore Paris, and after Paris.\u201d\n\nAt seven stops this past Friday and Saturday, from hard-up town halls to a Vietnamese temple, Defense One shadowed the Republican senators as they performed their apocalyptic slapstick. At a sprawling home on Saturday, McCain asked if I was sick of the routine yet, quoting Ted Kennedy: \u201cIf it\u2019s a joke worth telling, it\u2019s worth telling over and over and over and over and over.\u201d\n\nThis discordant refrain of waggery and war is the glue of Graham and McCain\u2019s partnership, which has helped shape national-security politics for more than a decade. Now the Arizona senator and his colleague from South Carolina, the \u201ctwo amigos,\u201d have teamed up for their most quixotic quest yet: making Graham the 2016 Republican nominee.\n\nThey\u2019re hoping that the Paris attacks will give Graham the momentum needed to score an upset here in the first presidential primary. He is the only military veteran left in the field, and was the first to offer specifics about how he would defeat the Islamic State. McCain, who convinced him to run, was the 2008 nominee. Between them, they have more than half a century of service in the military and Congress.\n\nYet Graham was booted off the stage altogether in the last Republican debate, and a Real Clear Politics average of recent New Hampshire polls puts him at 0.8 percent. McCain faces stiff challenges back home in Arizona, and he may well lose his beloved Armed Services Committee gavel in the coming election: 21 other Republican senators are also up for reelection, and two are retiring, to the Democrats\u2019 10.\n\nREAD the full interview, here.\n\nWhat does it say about the GOP when its top national security leaders can\u2019t get traction outside the Beltway?\n\n\u201cThis is the year of an outsider and I\u2019m looked at as an insider,\u201d Graham said, but that was before the recent attacks. \u201cAfter Paris, experience is gonna matter.\u201d\n\nMcCain and Graham relish underdog status, but at stake is a generation of Republican foreign policy leadership. Maybe they endanger their political careers and don\u2019t win the White House \u2014 either way, Graham said, \u201cIt\u2019s one hell of a good time.\u201d With the next attacks on their way, you gotta live a little.\n\nBefore Paris, After Paris\n\n\u201cI am here to translate Sen. Graham\u2019s remarks into English,\u201d McCain joked Friday at a law firm in Manchester. \u201cMy friends,\u201d he continued in his customary style, recent events \u201chave shaken the nation.\u201d\n\nA week before, ISIS-affiliated terrorists killed 130 in Paris. Hours before, al-Qaeda-affiliated gunmen killed at least 19 at a Mali hotel.\n\nThese \u201cclearly indicate that America needs a leader who is experienced, knowledgeable, and ready to lead immediately,\u201d McCain said. \u201cNo on-the-job training, no seminars, no books, no position papers, but a person who has been to Iraq and Afghanistan 35 times.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are gonna have another look,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think they should have a look at Lindsey Graham.\u201d\n\nThe senators spend their share of time relitigating the Iraq War and who\u2019s to blame for ISIS, but Graham is emphasizing: \u201cWhat now?\u201d The Republican field is long on tough talk about ISIS (and criticism of President Obama), but short on detail about what they\u2019d do instead. Graham points to his long-held plan. His early call for 20,000 American boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria was too hawkish for many, but voters and rivals \u201care coming our way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, it was me and John against the world. That\u2019s when isolationism was red-hot,\u201d Graham said Saturday while riding back to his Manchester headquarters. (\u201cThat\u2019s when we were the old hawks,\u201d McCain put in.) \u201cTed Cruz was Rand Paul\u2019s biggest buddy,\u201d Graham said of his fellow senators and 2016 competitors. McCain noted, \u201cRand Paul was on the cover of Time.\u201d\n\nNow, there are two elections, Graham said: \u201cBefore Paris and after Paris.\u201d \u201cAfter Paris, I hope people are looking for somebody with experience in the area of national security. If they look, they will find me.\u201d\n\n\u2018Experience Matters\u2019\n\nThe 2016 campaigns scrambled to respond to the attacks, with several refocusing national security addresses and others bringing heated rhetoric to a boil. Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, in separate speeches last week, called for sending more troops to the combat zones, though Bush declined to say how many and Clinton said they shouldn\u2019t be American. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed with his own address Tuesday, continuing to invoke 9/11.\n\nEach of these candidates and more are hoping that the attacks suggest the country needs a tested leader rather than the inexperienced Donald Trump and Ben Carson, but the results have been mixed. New Hampshire voters say they\u2019re giving Christie another look, while Cruz, who said the U.S. should keep out Muslims, is enjoying a surge. Carson is slumping amid recent scrutiny, but Trump still appears untouchable.\n\nMeanwhile, a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday and conducted just days after the Paris attacks showed more Americans trust Democratic frontrunner Clinton to handle the threat of terrorism than any of the top Republicans \u2014 including Trump, the GOP frontrunner, by a margin of 50 to 42 percent.\n\nGraham predicted his rivals would collapse under the pressure of \u201chaving to tell the American people about future Parises.\u201d Clinton, he said, is \u201crunning away from Obama, but she\u2019s got [Sen.] Bernie Sanders on her back, so she can\u2019t get very far very fast.\u201d\n\nGraham has gone further than any candidate in calling for more U.S. military force against ISIS, which he wants authorized without limits. But it\u2019s too soon to tell if voters will follow.\n\nAccording to Graham\u2019s plan, the U.S. would go after ISIS first. American boots would make up 10 percent of the ground force, while the other 90 percent would be from Arab countries, supplemented by Turkey and a smattering of Western forces, including the French, and \u201cwhat\u2019s left\u201d of U.S.-equipped rebel groups. It would destroy the caliphate in Syria, then turn toward the Bashar Assad regime.\n\n\u201cIf the Russians and Iranians\u201d \u2014 \u201cLet me finish my thought,\u201d he said to McCain, as they spoke over each other like brothers \u2014 \u201cwant to fight for the butcher of Damascus, they\u2019ll be fighting the entire Arab world, Turkey and most of the West, and they\u2019ll fold like a cheap suit.\u201d\n\nGraham said the Saudis had promised their army and the Qataris promised to pay for it, but only if the force would also go after Assad, not just ISIS. There\u2019s the catch: it would ultimately require U.S.military action against Assad and those backing him, a scenario the Obama administration has been reticent to contemplate.\n\nSo then, who follows Assad? \u201cThe people of Syria decide,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHow about that novel idea?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe McCain-Graham approach to foreign policy is now very much the centerpiece of this election,\u201d Graham said. Asked whether it\u2019s here to stay, he said \u201cYes,\u201d then, \u201cWell, it\u2019s here for a while, until we get war-weary again.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hands On\u2019\n\nGraham seemed most at home at Hudson\u2019s Northside Grille Friday night, visiting booths full of diners and hovering at the bar. He often talks on the trail about growing up in the back of a restaurant. He was the first of his family to go to college, then law school. In June, he retired from the Air Force as a colonel.\n\nMcCain, almost 20 years his senior, jokingly calls Graham \u201cmy illegitimate son.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m much smarter,\u201d McCain quips, while Graham retorts, \u201cHe\u2019s a hero; I\u2019m not. Yeah, yeah.\u201d\n\nMcCain entered the Naval Academy in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals. After being shot down over Hanoi during the Vietnam War, he was imprisoned and tortured for years. When he left the military, he moved to Arizona and ran for office.\n\nAsked about the first time they met, Graham laughs: \u201cDuring impeachment \u2026 it\u2019s a hell of a way to meet somebody.\u201d McCain was impressed by the then-congressman, who helped bring the case against former President Bill Clinton from the House to the Senate, and asked him to join his 2000 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI said sure and he said, \u2018Why were you so quick?\u2019\u201d Graham recounted. \u201cI said, \u2018Nobody\u2019s ever asked me before.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, hundreds of miles away from Washington, voters I spoke to said national security is their biggest concern, particularly in the wake of the Paris attacks. This reflects a grim mood nationally; the Monday Post-ABC poll found that a \u201crecord-high\u201d 54 percent of Americans nationwide disapprove of the way Obama\u2019s handling terrorism, and 57 percent disapprove of his handling of ISIS. But the New Hampshire voters aren\u2019t yet sold on Graham.\n\nLinda Locke is usually behind the bar at Northside, but she was off Friday, telling McCain about her youngest son, a B2 bomber crew chief. Another is a military contractor. \u201cI\u2019m an independent,\u201d she told me, then leaned in, \u201cbut I usually vote Republican.\u201d\n\nShe described herself as frightened. \u201cI just want somebody to get in there that\u2019s really gonna do something about it,\u201d she said, but grimaced at Graham\u2019s plan for boots on the ground. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose them going over to the other countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know a lot about him,\u201d she said, but it concerns her that others don\u2019t have military experience, \u201cbecause they\u2019re talkin\u2019 about something they\u2019ve never dealt with, hands on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving fun?\u201d McCain interjected. \u201cHer son is a great patriot.\u201d\n\nLocke confessed she didn\u2019t vote for McCain.\n\nLater at a town hall at the American Legion in Hudson, Howard Ray, a retired Army sergeant, questioned Graham about veterans. Ray served 13 years as a tanker, and received the Army Commendation Medal for saving lives during the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. He said the national-security fervor will fade. \u201cIt comes and goes \u2013 you can go around Fort Hood right now, or here in New Hampshire, and they won\u2019t remember,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the last stops Saturday was the elegant public library in Franklin, one of the state\u2019s poorest towns. The library overlooks an abandoned mill and an island in the river where someone stuck a \u201cBernie\u201d sign.\n\nMcCain got some laughs in his introduction with the one about lawyers and catfish. Then he asked, \u201cCould I be serious?\u201d and rattled off a list of current global security crises. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like an earthquake or a hurricane. It\u2019s because of the failed policies by this president who believed if we get out of wars, then the wars end.\u201d\n\nJoel Bruno knows something about that. He served in the Navy from 1957 to 1960, reenlisted from 1964 to 1966, and saw service from Norfolk to the South China Sea. He said boots on the ground will become necessary: \u201cYou can drop all the bombs from here to hell, but it\u2019s not gonna make a difference.\u201d\n\nSo how will he vote? \u201cI haven\u2019t really made up my mind yet,\u201d he told me. \u201cI like Trump, the things he says. But in a way I\u2019m scared of \u2019em.\u201d\n\nGraham interrupted, \u201cThank you, sir, for coming, and God bless you.\u201d Bruno nodded his Navy ball cap.\n\nThe (Not Quite) Last Ride of the Two Amigos\n\n\u201cIf I ever grow up, I want to be John McCain, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll ever happen,\u201d Graham said in Franklin. He noted that the Arizona senator was spending precious days in New Hampshire instead of stumping for himself in Arizona. \u201cHow many people would do that in this business?\u201d\n\nMcCain cracked: \u201cLast town hall meeting, he said I had to be ambassador to Russia.\u201d\n\nIn the car back to headquarters Saturday night, I asked if this was the last ride of the two amigos, given Graham\u2019s long odds, McCain\u2019s high stakes, and the disconnect between their standing in Washington and the anti-establishment anger outside it.\n\n\u201cI am confident that even if I were out of office and he loses,\u201d McCain began somberly \u2014 Graham laughed, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a good question\u201d \u2014 \u201cWe would still have a role to play.\u201d McCain said he\u2019s doing it \u201cbecause I really am concerned about the world today and a lack of leadership and my belief that [Graham] is by head and shoulders the most qualified to save this nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned about John McCain: He should\u2019ve been dead 20 times,\u201d Graham said. (McCain, mockingly, \u201cHeh, heh, heh.\u201d) \u201cAnd he\u2019s still standing.\u201d\n\nAs for his own viability, Graham said wait and see for the post-Paris impact. \u201cI think we\u2019re already changing the nature of the race,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not about the outcome as much as it is about the fight itself. We believe that the fight that we\u2019re fighting has to be fought. That we have to wake America up, get our system to change so Republicans embrace more of a middle-right center lane, rather than a right-ditch lane.\u201d\n\nMcCain added, \u201cAnd as you can tell \u2026 we enjoy it! It\u2019s not a chore, it\u2019s not a burden \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason for living?\u201d Graham exclaimed. \u201cI have never had more fun than I am having right now. Having him up here by my side has been the highlight of my political life. We\u2019ve got a story to tell and we\u2019re gonna tell it, and those who count us out usually wind up making a mistake.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MANCHESTER,\u00a0N.H.\u2014 Tracking Lindsey Graham and John McCain on the campaign trail means", "title": "How \u2018Paris\u2019 Changed the 2016 Election and Put ISIS in Voters' Crosshairs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/30/How-Paris-Changed-2016-Election-and-Put-ISIS-Voters-Crosshairs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02112013_Graham_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/30/How-Paris-Changed-2016-Election-and-Put-ISIS-Voters-Crosshairs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02112013_Graham_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "MANCHESTER,\u00a0N.H.\u2014 Tracking Lindsey Graham and John McCain on the campaign trail means", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re hoping that the Paris attacks will give Graham the momentum needed to score an upset here in the first presidential primary.\n\u201cAfter Paris, experience is gonna matter.\u201dMcCain and Graham relish underdog status, but at stake is a generation of Republican foreign policy leadership.\nBefore Paris, After Paris\u201cI am here to translate Sen.
