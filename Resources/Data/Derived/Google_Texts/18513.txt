CHINO >> The Chino Valley Independent Fire District is moving some of its paramedics off fire engines and onto new trucks.

The switch comes after requests for fire department emergency medical service dramatically increased in Chino Valley in 2015, which took firefighting capabilities out of service during those calls. This caused fire officials to rethink how they respond to such calls.

The result will be four, two-man paramedic trucks. The fire district’s board of directors has been considering using squads since November 2014. Their purchase was approved for purchase in March 2015, fire spokeswoman Massiel De Guevara said.

The fire district took delivery of the Ford chassis in July, and they were fitted with the special boxes in December at an approximate cost of $100,000 each, De Guevara added.

“We are implementing a new model of service that will increase the fire district’s capabilities to continue to provide high-quality emergency medical service to our community,” said Chief Tim Shackelford in a statement.

The trucks will feature two firefighter/paramedics with all the necessary life-saving equipment on board and will respond along with a fire engine or as a single unit, depending on the call.

Until now, the larger firefighting engines respond to all medical calls, De Guevara said.

“The versatility of the squad allows our firefighter paramedics to provide continuous treatment and care to a greater number of patients in the community,” De Guevara said. “This will leave the fire engines in public service to work on other emergency calls, such as fires and accidents.”

Officials say more than 76 percent of 911 calls in 2015 were for medical services. Changes in the Affordable Care Act, increased population, and the use of 911 as a primary medical care source have helped contribute to the rise.
