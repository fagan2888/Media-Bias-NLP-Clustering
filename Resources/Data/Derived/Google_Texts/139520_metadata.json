Its $100 million debt was cleared and a new chapter begun as a Duke LifePoint hospital. Soon it will have a brand-new building, somewhere in or around Marquette.\n\nSince 2010, nearly a dozen community hospitals in Michigan have done the same, joining larger systems like McLaren Health, Spectrum Health and University of Michigan Health System. Like Marquette General, they faced the same economic pressures: lower Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates; billing and quality mandates of the Affordable Care Act; a trend away from inpatient care, and a tougher time accessing money to upgrade infrastructure. But while the hospitals cite greater clout with insurers, studies also warn of the likelihood of rising health-care costs.\n\nFor struggling hospitals in communities like Marquette, the new investment these growing for-profit hospital systems are making is a positive, says Brett Jackson, president of the Economic Alliance for Michigan, a statewide labor-business coalition.\n\n\u201cWe always keep our eyes open to see what the reaction is and what the consequences will be,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, independent community hospitals that may have once been in danger of closing have been able to be maintained, and have even seen investment in those properties that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve.\u201d\n\nYet the consolidations don\u2019t sit well with some. The disappearance of independent hospitals, which once represented the noblest aspirations of the community \u2013 a barometer of its sophistication and altruism \u2013 has some observers worried that bottom-line thinking will affect quality of care, result in a loss of jobs and services, a rise in costs, and indifference to the people who nurtured the hospital for generations. They are correct on at least one point: There is some evidence that hospital consolidation can mean higher health-care costs.(link to sidebar).\n\n\u201cWe do have concerns about the ability of very large corporations, especially for-profit corporations, to interact and respond to the community\u2019s needs in the same way as hospitals in the past have been able to do. The decisions are being made far away,\u201d says Marjorie Mitchell, executive director of the Michigan Universal Health Care Access Network www.michuhcan.org, an organization that promotes comprehensive health care coverage and better health outcomes.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak, who represented the Upper Peninsula and part of northern Michigan for 18 years, said he wonders how committed Duke LifePoint is to continuing the traditions of MGH, given its outsider status and its profit motive. And he said it troubles him that the hospital may move outside the city, leaving behind a giant husk of an old building.\n\n\u201cAll the years taxpayers have supported this hospital, what did they receive in return?\u201d Stupak asked. \u201cI have a bit of a problem with a for-profit taking over a nonprofit and pledging to invest in the community. Will they bring more services, more specialists? I\u2019m not sure those questions were explored. Who spoke for the citizens of Marquette County?\u201d\n\nWhen Duke LifePoint Healthcare \u2013 a joint venture between Tennessee-based LifePoint, with 56 hospitals in 19 states, and the Duke University Health System \u2013 applied for a tax status change with the state attorney general\u2019s office, it agreed to set aside at least $15 million for the Marquette General Foundation. The company gave the foundation $23 million, but then broadened its mission to fund health-related projects throughout the U.P., and was renamed the Superior Health Foundation. Stupak finds that unfair.\n\n\u201cThat foundation is to benefit health care across the UP, but if I\u2019m a resident who has supported the hospital, why would Iron Mountain be able to access our foundation?\u201d Stupak asked.\n\nHe is seemingly among the few skeptics. At a community forum held in Marquette in 2012 to discuss the impending sale of Marquette General, only one person \u2013 a local hospital pathologist -- expressed concern about the \u201cmonopolistic\u201d intentions of LifePoint; otherwise, there was widespread enthusiasm about the sale.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nFor-profit hospital systems can fatten city and county coffers and breathe new life into old, often struggling institutions \u2013 even if it\u2019s at the expense of local control and a sense of homegrown responsibility to a community.\n\nDuke LifePoint, for example, promised to bolster the regional hospital with more specialists. And as a for-profit entity, it has generated new revenues for Marquette. Last year, the hospital paid $2.6 million in property taxes. LifePoint also bought two other small U.P. hospitals last year, extending its reach in the U.P. health-care market by establishing new referral bases.\n\nAnother example is unfolding in Detroit. Vanguard Health Systems, a Nashville company (later bought by Tenet Healthcare), dramatically increased revenues for the Detroit Medical Center\u2019s eight hospitals in the first two years after purchasing DMC in January 2011. (Vanguard in turn was purchased by Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. last fall) According to Crain\u2019s Detroit Business, profits rose by $70 million in those years by treating more patients while aggressively cutting costs (and jobs). Vanguard also made large capital improvements, helping to contribute to the rising fortunes of the Midtown Detroit community.\n\nIn Detroit, as elsewhere in Michigan, whether this trend is ultimately beneficial to the hospitals and the communities they serve depends on the execution. Are the new regimes caring for patients in a more efficient way, or rushing cases through to churn admissions? Are they cutting administrative bloat, or shortchanging care to squeeze profits?\n\nOn the flip side, nonprofits like Flint-based McLaren Health are no less constrained in their acquisitive behavior, and without paying taxes. McLaren has been on a buying spree, continually adding to its stable of hospitals (11 and counting) and other health-care properties (e.g., nursing homes, assisted living facilities) throughout Michigan.\n\nCEO Philip Incarnati said McLaren looks for hospitals along the I-75 and I-69 corridors that have the greatest market share in their respective regions and can benefit from the \u201cscale synergies\u201d and access to capital that McLaren can provide.\n\nIndeed, McLaren\u2019s capital investments are impressive. It plans to spend upwards of $100 million to replace an outdated tower at McLaren Northern Michigan in Petoskey; it invested in physical changes at Cheboygan Memorial Hospital after buying it out of bankruptcy and turning it into an outpatient center, and it plans to build a cancer center and replace an old tower at Port Huron Hospital, one of its recent acquisitions.\n\nIncarnati insists, however, that nonprofits, even large nonprofits, are different. \u201cNonprofits borrow money no different than for-profits, but at better rates,\u201d Incarnati said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in terms of who owns you: Our master is the community; in a for-profit, it\u2019s shareholders.\u201d\n\nUnlike for-profits, he said, his company doesn\u2019t sweep out the local hospital board so it can replace it with its own people. \u201cAs long as you meet your quality and financial goals, you won\u2019t hear from us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice blend of local independence, yet with the benefits of larger player.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "center-for-michigan", "title": "For-profit hospital systems are absorbing community hospitals across Michigan", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"For-profit hospital systems are absorbing community hospitals across Michigan\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/03/for-profits_gobbling_up_commun.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/oldhospjpg-aa93e1471520a2f4.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12452873\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-18T11:37:40Z\", \"author\": \"The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine\", \"tags\": [\"@la-river\",\"@mlive-health\",\"@mlive-news\",\"@mlive-river\",\"center-for-michigan\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.mlive.com/health_impact/photo/14506711-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Nonprofit community hospitals, once a backbone of civic life, are increasingly selling out as health care changes make survival difficult.
