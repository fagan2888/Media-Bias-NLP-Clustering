One man is dead after an early morning shooting in Harrisburg. Police got a call around five o'clock this morning with reports of shots fired in the area just off of Reese and Evergreen Streets. When the cops arrived, they saw 39-year-old Nathaniel Green lying on the street with several gun shot wounds.

"They located a young man behind the church right here to the rear parking lot. Upon further examination of his body, it was noticed that he was bleeding from his upper torso and lower torso," said Chief Thomas Carter with Harrisburg Police.

Green was then taken to Harrisburg Hospital but later died of his injuries. Neighbors told FOX43 that they were upset when they heard of Green's death. A teddy bear and memorial was created in his memory, just feet away from where the shooting occured.
