Ted Cruz is responsible for Obamacare.\n\nTrump shot back at Cruz\u2019s recent claims that Trump supports the Affordable Care Act, and proposes a single payer system. Trump has dismissed the claims, calling to repeal and replace the legislation. Although he favored a single payer system in the past, he has since changed his position.\n\nHe went further at a campaign event Wednesday in Little Rock, Arkansas, claiming Cruz is to blame for the Supreme Court upholding the law\u2019s key provisions because he put Justice John Roberts on the bench. The conservative justice sided with the president in the 6-3 decision in June.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Ted Cruz \u2013 he\u2019s the one that got Justice Roberts onto the United States Supreme Court. He pushed him. He approved him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt would have been dead if we had a different justice on the United States Supreme Court \u2013 put there by him.\u201d\n\nAlthough Cruz was a vocal supporter of Roberts at the time, Cruz had no hand in the Senate\u2019s approval of Roberts to the court. Roberts was appointed in 2005, seven years before Cruz would be elected to the Senate. Cruz has since denounced Roberts and called his support for the justice a mistake.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s claim is ridiculous, especially considering that he has advocated and supported a single-payer health care system along with many other social liberal policies,\u201d Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told the AP.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMi90cnVtcC10ZWQtY3J1ei1nYXZlLXVzLW9iYW1hY2FyZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Christine Ayala", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2013 GOP front-runner Donald Trump says Sen.
