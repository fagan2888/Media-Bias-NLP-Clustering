Notice anything different? If you did, it was probably the unusual grain on the legs. It\u2019s not actually a natural grain; it\u2019s the seams from the layers of wood attached to create it. This stool was 3D printed by startup 4 AXYZ, which hopes to use its technology to offer custom, affordable furniture made out of high-quality wood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means there are differences beyond just that layered look. For example, a stool made with current methods might be manufactured in nine pieces and then need to be hand-assembled. This stool is made of three pieces and no humans have to get involved in assembly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother difference: Without any extra manufacturing cost, a customer could increase or decrease the size of the object they order, or substitute in a different kind of wood. More interestingly, they could combine different types of wood and materials (think carbon fiber or Kevlar) to create composite items that would currently be very difficult to make.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounder and CEO Samir Shah said that while machines have long been trying to catch up to humans with their woodworking abilities, \u201cthis time, hands can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I spoke with 4 AXYZ last year, the company was closely guarding its product. But at the Launch festival Monday, Shah showed me a few printed wood pieces. Here are some examples of what 4 AXYZ can do:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShah said 4 AXYZ has also since begun collaborating with Portuguese home company A Catedral. A Catedral is developing smart windows that can collect data from the environment, but need integrated electronics that are attractive and functional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter 4 AXYZ, which developed a system to embed electronics within the window frames. Its machine is capable of printing hollow objects or embedding objects directly in wood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShah said 4 AXYZ could eventually print \u201csmart wood\u201d studded with sensors. A smart railing could detect when people go up or downstairs and switch off lights on turn on heat. Smart floors could detect when a stranger enters a home and alert its owners or the authorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4 AXYZ\u2019s printing method involves adapting an existing German woodworking machine to operate in 3D. It works by combining small, uniformly cut pieces of wood. Shah actually prefers to put the manufacturing technique under the broader term of \u201cadditive manufacturing,\u201d as there is at no point any liquid \u201cink\u201d involved, as is generally the case in 3D printing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4 AXYZ is currently seeking funding to buy its own woodworking machine. With money in hand, it would be ready to set up shop immediately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShah said that while they have thought up major applications like furniture, he\u2019s sure people will think of many more ways to use the machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have the technology and we don\u2019t know how far someone else can take this,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "This is what 3D printed wood looks like", "application-name": "Gigaom", "dcterms.modified": "2014-03-03", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "dcterms.creator": "Signe Brewster", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-25", "keywords": "3d printing, 4 axyz, additive manufacturing, furniture, internet of things, \u201csmart home\u201d networks", "news_keywords": "3d printing, 4 axyz, additive manufacturing, furniture, internet of things, \u201csmart home\u201d networks", "author": "Signe Brewster", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ecebe6", "dcterms.publisher": "Gigaom", "description": "4 AXYZ reveals the aesthetics of its additive manufactured furniture and explains how it can make a smart window smarter.", "robots": "NOODP", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/themes/go-ossein/library/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "6AFF4FA8C591A576B80A612AF591A343", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-02-25", "og": {"image": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-24-at-11-00-05-pm-804x425.png"}, "dcterms.subject": "3d printing; 4 axyz; additive manufacturing; furniture; internet of things; \u201csmart home\u201d networks", "google-site-verification": "qCPIC6UK_23CR6SxLn2bCjE-Ow0OSYoDExoi699IE98", "y_key": "a09dd3172406080e"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5ac2\"", "article_summary": "But at the Launch festival Monday, Shah showed me a few printed wood pieces.\nThis stool was 3D printed by startup 4 AXYZ, which hopes to use its technology to offer custom, affordable furniture made out of high-quality wood.\nAdvertisement4 AXYZ\u2019s printing method involves adapting an existing German woodworking machine to operate in 3D.\nAdvertisementAdvertisementShah said 4 AXYZ could eventually print \u201csmart wood\u201d studded with sensors.\nIt\u2019s not actually a natural grain; it\u2019s the seams from the layers of wood attached to create it."}
