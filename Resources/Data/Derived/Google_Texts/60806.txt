It’s been just over 20 days since the pipe near IHop collapsed and crews have been working almost non-stop to get things back in order.

“Part of their contract with us, is to work through the holidays to get this done,” Meridian Mayor Percy Bland says.

Installed are interlocking metal sheets. Bland says this will help prevent future problems.

“Hemphill is doing work trying to shore up this line and protect it over here. We have sheet metal going in about 60 feet into the ground trying to protect the side the IHop is on,” Bland says.

Soon after the collapse, Mayor Bland declared a state of emergency. He says this was done in order to get construction crews working immediately to prevent any further complications.

“We have those businesses over there pumping retail revenue into our city. Without them, we can’t pay our bills, so this was an emergency situation to protect all of our businesses,” Bland says.

Bland says if it wasn’t for the crews getting things cleared out, water would have done further damage by going into businesses across the interstate. He says that’s why declaring a state of emergency was necessary.

“When the heavy rains came we were very proud of them because they completed that work just in time. If that would not have happened, we would have had a very critical situation,” Bland says.

The company doing the work is Hemphill Construction out of Florence Mississippi. Mayor Bland says work should be complete within the next 4 weeks, but a long term plan is still being looked at. It is also uncertain of when IHop might re-open.
