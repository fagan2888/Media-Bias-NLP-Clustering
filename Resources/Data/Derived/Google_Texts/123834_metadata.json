Brandeis expressed this principle of judicial restraint 80 years ago in a concurring opinion to which the court often makes reference.\n\nSo the court\u2019s action two weeks ago in accepting the Obama administration\u2019s appeal in a major immigration case was startling. The surprise was not that the court agreed to hear the case, United States v. Texas, an appeal from a ruling that the president lacked authority under the immigration laws to defer deporting undocumented immigrants whose children are American citizens or lawful permanent residents. It was rather the blockbuster constitutional question that the justices added to the case, a question the court had not been asked, and one that neither of the lower federal courts had even addressed when they ruled on purely statutory grounds against the administration.\n\nThis is what the court said in its Jan. 19 order: \u201cIn addition to the questions presented by the petition, the parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: \u2018Whether the Guidance violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, \u00a73.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWow. The \u201cguidance\u201d is the memo that established the deferred-action program, issued in November 2014 by Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security. The Take Care Clause provides that the president \u201cshall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d It is a constitutional provision that the Supreme Court has hardly ever addressed directly. Justice Antonin Scalia invoked it years ago, in a 1992 decision holding that environmental organizations lacked standing to challenge the adequacy of the Reagan administration\u2019s enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe statute\u2019s explicit \u201ccitizen suit\u201d provision was not sufficient to authorize a lawsuit for a \u201cgeneralized grievance,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife. It was \u201cobvious,\u201d he said, that \u201cto permit Congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in executive officers\u2019 compliance with the law into an \u2018individual right\u2019 vindicable in the courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the president to the courts the chief executive\u2019s most important constitutional duty, to \u2018take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Lujan decision, one of Justice Scalia\u2019s most important opinions in 30 years on the court, thus used the Take Care Clause to protect a president\u2019s prerogatives. But times change. By transforming an important but still ordinary statutory interpretation case (Does the Immigration and Nationality Act give the president this degree of prosecutorial discretion? Should the \u201cguidance\u201d have been issued as a formal rule under the Administrative Procedure Act? On what basis do the 26 states that brought this lawsuit have standing?) into a major constitutional one, the court turns the Take Care Clause from shield to sword, with the conservative justices brandishing the sword.\n\nThe protests I expected to hear from the administration and its allies have not materialized. The message from such progressive organizations as America\u2019s Voice, an immigration advocacy group, seems to be that it\u2019s just as well that the Supreme Court will address the Take Care Clause because the issue might otherwise re-emerge, after a narrow Supreme Court ruling, in the Brownsville, Tex., courtroom of the openly hostile federal district judge, Andrew S. Hanen, who imposed a nationwide injunction against the deferred-action program a year ago. (The states had raised the Take Care Clause in their initial District Court complaint, but Judge Hanen didn\u2019t address it, and neither did the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the injunction.)\n\nI understand the strategy. The administration\u2019s job is not to criticize the court but to make its best argument on the law and persuade five justices that it\u2019s right. After all, if the court finds that Congress has given the president sufficient authority for the deferred-action program, there is no Take Care Clause issue to discuss.\n\nCall me a cynic, but I just don\u2019t see the Take Care Clause question as the benign or even neutral act of a court seeking efficiency in clearing up an unsettled issue. For one thing, there\u2019s nothing about this rarely invoked clause that needs settling. (In their response to the administration\u2019s Supreme Court petition, the states wait until page 37 of their 39-page brief even to mention the Take Care Clause.) For another, it\u2019s impossible for me to divorce the court\u2019s action from the ever more strident anti-Obama rhetoric filling the right-wing airwaves and blogosphere.\n\nThere has been a concerted effort to portray a \u201clawless\u201d president, an \u201cemperor of the United States,\u201d in the words of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama. \u201cFederal courts need to stop Obama from flouting the Constitution,\u201d was the headline on a Washington Post op-ed co-written by David B. Rivkin Jr., a Washington lawyer who was a force behind the legal attack on the Affordable Care Act. George F. Will, a Washington Post columnist deeply in tune with the capital\u2019s conservative elite, wrote in a June 2014 column titled \u201cStopping a Lawless President\u201d that while many presidents seek to enhance their power, President Obama\u2019s \u201coffenses against the separation of powers have been egregious in quantity and qualitatively different.\u201d Immigration was only one item on Mr. Will\u2019s list of the president\u2019s offenses, which included implementation of the Affordable Care Act, welfare, education and drug policy. Republicans in the House of Representatives have frequently mentioned impeachment.\n\nImpeachment aside, Justice Scalia, ever more unconstrained and therefore ever more useful as a barometer of right-wing thought, made his own notable contribution to this chorus. In June 2012, the court decided a high-profile immigration case from Arizona, invalidating several provisions of the state\u2019s recently enacted anti-immigrant statute on the ground that immigration policy was the province of the federal government. Justice Scalia dissented and, reading a statement from the bench, provided his own rationale for the Arizona law.\n\nTen days earlier, President Obama had announced a program to defer deportation for young undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. Yet even though the president\u2019s action had nothing to do with the case before the court, Justice Scalia nonetheless channeled the Republican criticism of the president\u2019s action in his statement from the bench: \u201cThe president has said that the new program is \u2018the right thing to do\u2019 in light of Congress\u2019s failure to pass the administration\u2019s proposed revision of the immigration laws. Perhaps it is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing applications of federal immigration law that the president declines to enforce boggles the mind.\u201d\n\nWhat had come to pass, he continued, was \u201cthe specter that Arizona and the states that support it predicted: a federal government that does not want to enforce the immigration laws as written, and leaves the states\u2019 borders unprotected against immigrants whom those laws exclude. So the issue is a stark one: Are the sovereign states at the mercy of the federal executive\u2019s refusal to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws? A good way of answering that question is to ask: Would the states conceivably have entered into the union if the Constitution itself contained the court\u2019s holding?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe concluded with this red-meat line: \u201cIf securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign state.\u201d\n\nIn the context of the 2012 election year, this was an amazing public statement by a sitting Supreme Court justice. Am I the only one to think that it explains a good deal about the order the court issued last month, or to wonder whether the court can be unaware of the politically charged discourse its order embraces?\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nI noted earlier that the Supreme Court has hardly ever examined the Take Care Clause. There was, however, an early sign last term that the clause might be moving from the wings to center stage. In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, a case decided last June, the court upheld the State Department\u2019s refusal to list \u201cIsrael\u201d as the place of birth on passports issued to American citizens who were born in Jerusalem, despite an act of Congress directing the department to do so at the individual\u2019s request. With a majority opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court held that the statute was an unconstitutional infringement by Congress on the president\u2019s exclusive power to recognize foreign governments, a power the court said was \u201cessential to the conduct of presidential duties.\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. dissented in an opinion that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. also signed. \u201cThe court takes the perilous step \u2014 for the first time in our history \u2014 of allowing the president to defy an act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs,\u201d the chief justice wrote. \u201cThe first principles in this area are firmly established. The Constitution allocates some foreign policy powers to the executive, grants some to the legislature, and enjoins the president to \u2018take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThere\u2019s a difference, of course, The law at issue in that case was clear, as was the State Department\u2019s defiance of it. In the immigration case, by contrast, the administration argues that the deferred-action program is an application of long-recognized discretion in immigration enforcement policy that dates back to regulations adopted during the Reagan administration. Of course, a court genuinely mindful of principles of judicial restraint would not even need to reach the statutory question, let alone the constitutional one. The states\u2019 claim to injury, let alone the kind of injury that gives them standing to sue for nonenforcement of the immigration laws is even more tenuous than the long-ago claim of the environmentalists, thrown out of court by Justice Scalia\u2019s Lujan decision. (I discussed the issue of the states\u2019 standing in an earlier column.\n\nThis is a case that should have been tossed out of Federal District Court in the first instance. Instead, its stakes are now heightened enormously. If the justices approach their task as judges and not as politicians, the administration will easily prevail. It is the Roberts court that now needs to take care.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160204032102, "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court has abandoned judicial restraint to challenge the president\u2019s authority and discretion.", "title": "The Supreme Court vs. the President", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/opinion/the-supreme-court-vs-the-president.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004185572"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/opinion/the-supreme-court-vs-the-president.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004185572", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/opinion/the-supreme-court-vs-the-president.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 4, 2016", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Homeland Security Department", "keywords": "Illegal Immigration,Constitution (US),Supreme Court (US),Deportation,Kennedy  Anthony M,Obama  Barack,Scalia  Antonin,Texas,Immigration and Emigration,Homeland Security Department", "news_keywords": "Deportation,Texas", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Linda Greenhouse", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Scalia, Antonin", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By LINDA GREENHOUSE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Supreme Court has abandoned judicial restraint to challenge the president\u2019s authority and discretion.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-thumbStandard-v2.png", "description": "The Supreme Court has abandoned judicial restraint to challenge the president\u2019s authority and discretion.", "CN": "linda-greenhouse", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 4, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/linda_greenhouse/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-02-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Homeland Security Department", "published": "2016-02-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "04greenhouse", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160204032102, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/opinion/the-supreme-court-vs-the-president.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/greenhouse-circular/greenhouse-circular-superJumbo-v2.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Supreme Court has abandoned judicial restraint to challenge the president\u2019s authority and discretion.", "title": "The Supreme Court vs. the President"}, "pdate": 20160204, "des": "Immigration and Emigration", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/linda-greenhouse", "tagline": "The Supreme Court and the law.", "uri": "/column/linda-greenhouse", "display-name": "Linda Greenhouse", "identifier": "linda-greenhouse", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004185572, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Supreme Court vs. the President", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "The Take Care Clause provides that the president \u201cshall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d It is a constitutional provision that the Supreme Court has hardly ever addressed directly.\nI noted earlier that the Supreme Court has hardly ever examined the Take Care Clause.\nSo the court\u2019s action two weeks ago in accepting the Obama administration\u2019s appeal in a major immigration case was startling.\ninto a major constitutional one, the court turns the Take Care Clause from shield to sword, with the conservative justices brandishing the sword.\n(In their response to the administration\u2019s Supreme Court petition, the states wait until page 37 of their 39-page brief even to mention the Take Care Clause.)"}
