Several representatives to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the 40-year-old \u201cnonpartisan membership association for state lawmakers who shared a common belief in limited government, free markets, federalism, and individual liberty,\u201d floated the concept in 2014.\n\nUnlike my proposal, however, the ALEC proposal focused more on setting the stage for an Article V Convention of the States as opposed to a \u201cbest practices\u201d 10th amendment gathering.\n\nLike the Article V Convention of the States, however, state legislatures under my proposal do not need any authorization from their state\u2019s governor to either host the Assembly of the States, or send a delegation to the Assembly of the States.\n\nThe hosting state legislature would invite state legislatures of the other 49 states to authorize and send a five-member delegation to the Assembly of the States, which I propose be held in May 2016 in the capital city of the host state.\n\nThe Assembly of the States would convene irrespective of the number of state legislatures that choose to send a delegation. Should all 50 states choose to send a delegation, a total of 250 delegates would be present. Should just the host state\u2019s delegates attend, a total of only 5 delegates will be present.\n\nThere is little concern in my mind, however, that only the host state will send delegates to the proposed Assembly of the States.\n\nSeveral states may be in the competition to serve as host of the proposed initial Assembly of the States in 2016, including my own state of Tennessee. Texas, Montana, Oklahoma, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, and Idaho all have state legislatures with the independence of spirit necessary to consider hosting the gathering of state delegations.\n\nI doubt any of the state legislatures from the \u201cdirty dozen\u201d blue states in which President Obama received more than 56.2 percent of the vote in 2012 will send delegations, but I leave open the possibility one of them might surprise me. After all, one of the most popular conservative radio talk show hosts in the country, Howie Carr, is based in Boston, Massachusetts and is heard daily in at least half of those \u201cdirty dozen\u201d states.\n\nWhether the proposed Assembly of the States attracts delegations from a mere handful of solid limited government states, all of the \u201cGreat 38 States\u201d in which President Obama received less than 56.2 percent of the vote in 2012, or an even greater number, the mere fact that such a gathering convenes at all will send a shot across the bow of the ever growing usurpations of the new federal royalty.\n\nEven more importantly, it will help the states develop a concrete set of action steps that can be undertaken to re-assert their 10th amendment rights and begin to reverse the course of the Big Government juggernaut.\n\nAs to the matter of approval of the recommendations made by the Assembly of the States, I propose that each state\u2019s delegation have one vote.\n\nEach state legislature may determine how it wishes to select its 5 delegates. They may select from among their member legislators, appoint any citizens of their state they determine have the appropriate qualities of character and judgment, or hold a statewide election to choose all or some of the 5 delegates in a manner akin to the selection of the delegates to the statewide Constitution ratification conventions of 1787 to 1791.\n\nThose states that choose to elect delegates can do so in the most economical way by \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d those elections to the Presidential primary contests already budgeted for and planned in their states for 2016.\n\nMy personal preference for my home state of Tennessee would be to select one member of the delegation from the state\u2019s lower legislature, one from the state\u2019s upper legislature, and elect three members of the delegation statewide, either at-large or by geographic area.\n\nThe Assembly of the States is intentionally scheduled for May 2016, immediately prior to the 2016 Republican and Democratic conventions so as to allow the Assembly to invite Presidential candidates of both parties to address it.\n\nBy watching which candidates accept an invitation to address the Assembly of the States and paying close attention to what those who show up say in their addresses, we should have a good indication which Presidential contenders are serious about restoring constitutionally limited government to the country, and which are mere pretenders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Call for an \u2018Assembly of the States\u2019 in May 2016", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Call for an \u2018Assembly of the States\u2019 in May 2016", "title": "Call for an \u2018Assembly of the States\u2019 in May 2016 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/veteran-american-flag-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/05/call-for-an-assembly-of-the-states-in-may-2016/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Call for an \u2018Assembly of the States\u2019 in May 2016", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/veteran-american-flag-AP.jpg", "title": "Call for an \u2018Assembly of the States\u2019 in May 2016 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "10th Amendment, ALEC, Article V Convention of the States, Assembly of the States, Constitution, dirty dozen blue states, federal royalty, Great 38 States, State Sovereignty,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "State Sovereignty", "published_time": "2015-07-05T06:26:26-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb059\"", "article_summary": "Like the Article V Convention of the States, however, state legislatures under my proposal do not need any authorization from their state\u2019s governor to either host the Assembly of the States, or send a delegation to the Assembly of the States.\nThe proposed Assembly of the States is not an Article V Convention of the States as recommended by conservative author Mark Levin, but there would be no restriction upon the Assembly discussing proposed constitutional amendments for the consideration of any future Convention of the States.\nAs to the matter of approval of the recommendations made by the Assembly of the States, I propose that each state\u2019s delegation have one vote.\nSeveral states may be in the competition to serve as host of the proposed initial Assembly of the States in 2016, including my own state of Tennessee.\nThe Assembly of the States is intentionally scheduled for May 2016, immediately prior to the 2016 Republican and Democratic conventions so as to allow the Assembly to invite Presidential candidates of both parties to address it."}
