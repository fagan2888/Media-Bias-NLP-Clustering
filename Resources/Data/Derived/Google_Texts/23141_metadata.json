It\u2019s more like KickStarter or GoFundMe for believers, in which members rely on the goodwill of others to cover their medical costs.\n\n\u201cThis is a position of faith,\u201d said David Wilson, a co-founder of the program. \u201cThis is saying that I believe in my faith so deeply, that I am willing to expose myself to the provision of resources by God, the faith filled community, and the Holy Spirit.\u201d\n\nThe program is part of a small but growing movement of individuals choosing to walk away from the insurance marketplace, often in response to new government regulations that require insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMembers receive a monthly newsletter in which medical costs of others members are listed, and CURO members contribute a monthly financial payment that directly covers those costs.\n\nThe money is loaded onto a debit card that is used to pay for office visits and hospital stays. If there\u2019s not enough money, the member waits until next month, when there may be more funds available. If not, the member may be eligible to draw from a special savings plan.\n\nBut there are catches.\n\nMembers agree to attend church \u201cat least 3 times a month,\u201d according to the CURO website, and \u201cto abstain from sinful practices such as drug abuse and sexual immorality,\u201d including homosexuality.\n\nThat means if a member contracts HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases, the costs won\u2019t be published unless the member is able \u201cto demonstrate that the disease was contracted innocently,\u201d meaning through a blood transfusion or medical procedure, according to member guidelines.\n\nBut if it is \u201ccontracted sexually outside of marriage, or through irresponsible behavior such as sharing hypodermic needles for illegal drugs,\u201d the member is out of luck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, abortion and contraception is not publishable, meaning there\u2019s no opportunity for members to recoup expenses.\n\nWilson said that aside from an annual letter from a priest or deacon confirming the member is active in the parish, there\u2019s no way to determine if members are living up to the \u201cstatement of faith\u201d as published in the guidelines.\n\nOne of the primary benefits for members, advocates say, is that it costs less than traditional insurance. Each month, members pay $250 to just under $500 based on family size. This can be much cheaper than traditional health insurance plans, though members are on the hook for all bills lower than $300.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to meet the needs for a lot less,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the bureaucracy of the insurance company, we don\u2019t have the bureaucracy of the regulation around the insurance industry to deal with.\u201d\n\nBut that freedom from government oversight is a double-edged sword, said Sabrina Corlette, a research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. Consumers should be careful before dropping traditional insurance for a cost-sharing program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much buyer beware,\u201d she said, noting that members won\u2019t be able to turn to a state insurance commissioner or attorney general in the event they feel they were wronged.\n\nPlus, she said, life happens. \u201cIt could be an accident you have because you\u2019re drunk,\u201d she said, referring to the strict morality clause that would make some conditions ineligible for refund.\n\nMore than 300,000 Americans are members of these kinds of programs, due in large part to a provision of the ACA that exempts members from paying penalties even though they don\u2019t carry traditional insurance.\n\nCardinal Raymond Burke, an adviser to CURO, said on a conference call Wednesday that government regulation is threatening to hinder Catholics from caring for the sick and that CURO is one step in addressing this development.\n\n\u201cWe live in very difficult times when it becomes more and more difficult to care for those in most need that in the best way possible that is in accord with our faith and our life in Christ,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an attempt to constrain us in our care of the sick or our care of the poor to do things that are immoral, to do things that are not truly good to those for whom we care.\u201d\n\nCritics say cost-sharing programs like CURO leave members vulnerable in the case of catastrophic medical events, such as cancers or accidents. CURO shares costs only up to $250,000 per event. A single stay in a hospital for something such a bacterial meningitis infection, for example, can easily run well beyond that.\n\nIn addition, CURO doesn\u2019t cover costs for pre-existing conditions, including pregnancy. Obamacare closed that loophole, a component of the bill drawing praise even from many of its Catholic opponents.\n\nBut Wilson, the co-founder, said additional layers of protection exist, such as a charity option that might list the needs of members ineligible for regular contributions. Samaritan Ministries International, based in Peoria, Ill., and founded in 1997, hasn\u2019t left any members on the hook for medical bills since it was founded, he said.\n\nAnd Wilson emphasized that the power of cost-sharing health programs like CURO is that members live a certain lifestyle, one that ultimately drives down costs.\n\n\u201cWe have people going to church every week, so in reality they don\u2019t have lifestyle behaviors that compound illnesses, and the onset of illnesses,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2015/05/06/for-catholics-opposed-to-obamacare-an-alternative-emerges/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/library/images/favicons/favicon-200.png", "type": "article", "description": "A new organization has a message for Catholics concerned about being forced to pay for plans that include contraception: Opt out of the insurance game altogether.", "title": "For Catholics opposed to Obamacare, an alternative emerges"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96ae\"", "article_summary": "This can be much cheaper than traditional health insurance plans, though members are on the hook for all bills lower than $300.\nIt\u2019s more like KickStarter or GoFundMe for believers, in which members rely on the goodwill of others to cover their medical costs.\nHere\u2019s how it works:AdvertisementMembers receive a monthly newsletter in which medical costs of others members are listed, and CURO members contribute a monthly financial payment that directly covers those costs.\nLaunched last October, CMF CURO describes itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s first Catholic health sharing experience and provides an alternative that respects and protects Catholics\u2019 conscience rights.\u201dThe \u201cChristian sharing ministry\u201d is not health insurance.\nConsumers should be careful before dropping traditional insurance for a cost-sharing program."}
