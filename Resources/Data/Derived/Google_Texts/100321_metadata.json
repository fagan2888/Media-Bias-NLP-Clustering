Scott Brown's decision to explore entering the 2014 U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire is likely to turn an expected easy victory for Democratic incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen into an expensive and protracted battle.\n\n\"The Shaheen organization goes from being basically favored to be reelected with significant advantages in a fairly easy race to being in something that could be a knock-down drag-out race, where there's tens of millions of dollars being spent, and they're going to be have to be at the top of their game,\" said former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Fergus Cullen.\n\nBrown's expected entrance also changes the tenor of the race. It brings national money and attention to New Hampshire. Republicans are highlighting national issues, like the Affordable Care Act, while Democrats hope to focus on New Hampshire issues, to highlight Brown\u2019s recent move from Massachusetts. Both sides are turning up the vitriol, anticipating a difficult seven months.\n\n\u201cThe first thing (Brown\u2019s entrance) does is it removes the prospect of a Republican candidate from New Hampshire,\u201d said Peter Burling, a member of the Democratic National Committee and former New Hampshire state senator. \u201cIt is now a race that\u2019s on the Republican side entirely about gaining control of the U.S. Senate, so the Koch brothers and their affiliated economic interests can get what they want.\u201d (David and Charles Koch are major conservative donors, whose family money comes from oil and other industries.)\n\nBrown won an upset victory in a 2010 special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, due in large part to anger over Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform. Brown lost his seat to Democrat Elizabeth Warren in 2012 by eight points. That race was the costliest Senate contest in history, with Brown spending $35 million and Warren $42 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nBrown quickly started courting New Hampshire voters, showing up at political events. He sold his house in Massachusetts last year and moved to Rye, N.H., where his summer home became his primary residence.\n\nNew Hampshire, a political swing state, is more friendly territory for Brown than overwhelmingly liberal Massachusetts. Although three Republicans are already running for U.S. Senate \u2013 former state Sen. Jim Rubens, conservative activist Karen Testerman and former U.S. Sen. Bob Smith, who recently moved back to New Hampshire from Florida \u2013 polling finds that Brown is the most well-known of the Republicans. A recent Suffolk University/Boston Herald poll put Brown far ahead of his GOP competitors.\n\nAt the same time, several recent polls show Brown trailing Shaheen by around 10 points.\n\nOutside groups have already involved themselves in the race. The conservative group Americans for Prosperity launched a $750,000 TV and radio ad buy in January, when Brown was still ambivalent about the race, attacking Shaheen for supporting the Affordable Care Act. This week, American Crossroads, the group founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove purchased $600,000 in ads against Shaheen, also focused on her support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe pro-environment League of Conservation Voters spent $220,000 on anti-Brown ads in February.\n\n\u201cWith Scott Brown in the race, it brings a significant amount of national interest here beyond what had been,\u201d said Greg Moore, state director of Americans for Prosperity in New Hampshire and a long-time Republican activist. Moore said since Brown announced his exploratory committee, Moore has gotten calls from reporters for Politico, The Hill, National Journal and Fox News.\n\nShaheen tried to blunt the impact of the conservative groups by proposing a People\u2019s Pledge, like the one Brown and Warren signed in 2012, barring outside advertising. Brown rebuffed her, calling Shaheen \u201chypocritical.\u201d\n\nFor Brown, the key to race will likely be tying Shaheen to unpopular national policies \u2013 in particular, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In his remarks to the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference launching his exploratory committee, Brown focused heavily on the health care law. \u201cHere\u2019s the message Americans are waiting for right now: \u2018If we don\u2019t like Obamacare, we can get rid of it, period,\u2019\u201d Brown said, according to his prepared remarks.\n\nBrown and national Republican groups have focused on a pledge Obama made that those who like their doctor can keep their doctor. In New Hampshire, Anthem, the major health insurer selling individual policies, has dropped 10 hospitals from its network for individual policies sold under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201c(Shaheen) made a very firm statement like the president did, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor,\u201d said New Hampshire State Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley, a former Republican U.S. Congressman. \u201cI think Obamacare is going to be a very difficult issue for Sen. Shaheen.\u201d\n\nAndy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said Obama\u2019s approval rating in New Hampshire has been dropping and is now around 42 percent. The number of people viewing Shaheen unfavorably has risen since last fall \u2013 something Smith said is typical before an election and also represents the impact of the ads that have run against her. Midterm elections also typically favor the party opposing the president.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans hope national factors combined with local distrust of the health care reform will work in their favor. \u201cI think more and more, all elections take on a national flavor, and that\u2019s certainly been the case in New Hampshire,\u201d said Jamie Burnett, a Republican strategist who founded the Profile Strategy Group in New Hampshire. \u201cIt certainly seems like the national mood is shaping up to favor Republicans, and a great deal of that has to do with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAlready, Republicans are talking about how having Brown atop the ticket could impact elections down the ballot \u2013 both congressional races, where there are Democratic incumbents, and the State Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Cullen predicated that a Brown candidacy would increase turnout among Republicans and turn out moderate Republicans, rather than only the most conservative parts of the base. \u201cIt\u2019s got lots of ramifications well beyond the Senate race,\u201d Cullen said.\n\nBut Brown will not have an easy time. He has already faced protests from pro-gun rights groups, who dislike his support for a federal assault weapons ban. His favorability ratings are significantly lower than Shaheen\u2019s, according to a UNH Survey Center poll.\n\nDemocrats say the election is about who can best represent New Hampshire, and Brown is a so-called \u201ccarpetbagger.\u201d Though Brown was born in Portsmouth and spent summers in Rye, his adult and political life was spent in Massachusetts.\n\nJackie Cilley, a former Democratic state senator and gubernatorial candidate from New Hampshire, said she has no problem with people moving to New Hampshire and getting involved in civic life. But, she said, for Brown, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t in my mind be any clearer that this is simply a staging area for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he had been elected a year ago in Massachusetts, he\u2019d be serving in the U.S. Senate as the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts,\u201d Cilley said. \u201cThe only thing that changed is the fact he lost that election, so now he\u2019s in New Hampshire. I haven\u2019t heard him say anything specific about New Hampshire and how he\u2019s going to fight for us and why he wants to fight for us.\u201d\n\nIn a UNH Survey Center poll from January, 28 percent of voters, including 11 percent of Republicans, said they would be less likely to vote for Brown because he was a former Massachusetts senator. Shaheen moved to New Hampshire in the 1970s and served as a state senator and then a three-term New Hampshire governor from 1997 to 2002. She lost a U.S. Senate race in 2002, then won in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf 5 percent of Republicans decide to vote for Shaheen because (Brown\u2019s) a \u2018carpetbagger,\u2019 then that could cost him an election,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a significant issue.\u201d\n\nDemocratic National Committeewoman and former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan pointed out that Brown told the New Hampshire news station WMUR during the first day of his statewide listening tour that he had not yet taken a position on the Northern Pass, a controversial electrical power line project that has been major news in New Hampshire for years. (Brown said later in the day that he opposed the Northern Pass project.)\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see (the election) really focus on New Hampshire: who\u2019s best to represent New Hampshire\u2019s interests, who knows our state, who\u2019s trusted by the voters of our state,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nIn Brown, Sullivan said, \u201cYou have someone who doesn\u2019t really know New Hampshire issues.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that Brown said later that he opposed the Northern Pass project, although that was not included in the original WMUR story.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@homepage','@mobile','jeanne-shaheen','new-hampshire','new-hampshire-senate-race','politics','scott-brown','us-senate'", "title": "Potential Scott Brown vs. Jeanne Shaheen Senate race in New Hampshire brings national attention and money to Granite State", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Potential Scott Brown vs. Jeanne Shaheen Senate race in New Hampshire brings national attention and money to Granite State\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/scott_brown_-_jeanne_shaheen_s.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/republican/photo/2014/03/14493833-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12466805\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-19T17:01:13Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"jeanne-shaheen\",\"new-hampshire\",\"new-hampshire-senate-race\",\"politics\",\"scott-brown\",\"us-senate\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@masslivenews", "image": "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2014/03/14493833-small.jpg", "description": "Brown's supporters are going after Shaheen for supporting the Affordable Care Act, while Shaheen's supporters accuse Brown of being a \"carpetbagger.\"", "card": "summary", "creator": "@#!/shiraschoenberg"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, March 19, 2014,  1:44 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2014/03/14493833-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sschoenberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"10164552\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Brown's supporters are going after Shaheen for supporting the Affordable Care Act, while Shaheen's supporters accuse Brown of being a \"carpetbagger.\"", "title": "Potential Scott Brown vs. Jeanne Shaheen Senate race in New Hampshire brings national attention and money to Granite State", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/scott_brown_-_jeanne_shaheen_s.html", "image": "http://www.masslive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, March 19, 2014,  1:00 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Brown's supporters are going after Shaheen for supporting the Affordable Care Act, while Shaheen's supporters accuse Brown of being a \"carpetbagger.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1752\"", "article_summary": "She lost a U.S. Senate race in 2002, then won in 2008.\nBrown and national Republican groups have focused on a pledge Obama made that those who like their doctor can keep their doctor.\nNew Hampshire Republicans hope national factors combined with local distrust of the health care reform will work in their favor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got lots of ramifications well beyond the Senate race,\u201d Cullen said.\nBrown rebuffed her, calling Shaheen \u201chypocritical.\u201dFor Brown, the key to race will likely be tying Shaheen to unpopular national policies \u2013 in particular, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act."}
