The average daily cost comes to $11 million over 495 days of operations.\n\nAs expected, the Air Force picked up most of the tab, with $3.8 billion, or 69 percent of the overall cost, spent on operations, including $2.8 billion on daily airstrikes inside Iraq and Syria. The Army comes in a distant second, spending $725 million on the effort, about 13 percent of the total.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S.", "title": "ISIS Cash Goes Up in Smoke as US Targets Terror Group\u2019s Finances", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/12/ISIS-Cash-Goes-Smoke-US-Targets-Terror-Group-s-Finances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-anbar_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/12/ISIS-Cash-Goes-Smoke-US-Targets-Terror-Group-s-Finances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-anbar_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: The Fight Against ISIS Has New Price Tag: $5 Billion and CountingAnd the price tag for the effort keeps going up.\nThe U.S. military\u2019s push to cut off the cash flow to Islamic extremists has taken an explosive turn.\nThe Army comes in a distant second, spending $725 million on the effort, about 13 percent of the total.\nThe mission seems to be an extension of the recent Defense Department push to pinch ISIS in its wallet by hitting the extremist network\u2019s oil infrastructure.\nWhile ISIS generates most of its revenue through black market oil and antiquities sales, the group also finances itself through taxation and extortion within the territory it controls."}
