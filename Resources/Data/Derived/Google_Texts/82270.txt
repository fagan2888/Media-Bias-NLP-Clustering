The Southwest Minnesota State University football team will continue its 2013 season for one more game as SMSU accepted a bid today to play in the 48th Mineral Water Bowl on Dec. 7 in Excelsior Springs, Mo. SMSU will face an opponent from the Mid-American Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) with kickoff slated for 12 p.m. at Tiger Stadium. The opponent will be announced on Monday.

It’s the first-ever bowl appearance for SMSU and just the third postseason game in the program’s 46-year history. SMSU lost its previous two postseason games, 49-7 at home to Mesa State (Colo.) in the first round of the 1987 NAIA playoffs and 35-6 at Carson-Newman (Tenn.) in the first round of the 1990 NAIA playoffs.

“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to play one more football game in 2013,” said Cory Sauter, SMSU head football coach. “It is a great reward for all the hard work that our players have invested in this season. We were able to finish strong with four straight wins to put us in position for postseason play.”

SMSU finished the regular season 7-4 overall, tying for the third highest win total in program history and highest since moving to NCAA Division II in 1995. The Mustangs closed the regular season winning its final four games - its longest winning streak since 1999.

The NSIC started playing in the bowl game in 2000, with NSIC teams recording a 4-9 all-time record in the game. The NSIC has won the last two games, with Minnesota State defeating Northeastern State (Okla.) 28-14 in 2011 and Winona State beating Lindenwood (Mo.) 41-21 last season.
