Developer should remove them ASAP.\n\n'We've spent \u00a334m on the likes of 'no 2nd night out, reaching 3/4s of rough sleepers, but must do more. Spikes are simply not the answer.'\n\nA row of one-inch spikes were also removed from outside a Tesco Metro supermarket on Regent Street in central London after activists protested against them.\n\nThe move was reminiscent of the metal spikes that were installed outside a luxury apartment in Southwark\n\nAway from the capital, Cardiff University came under fire for building a cage around a set of hot air vents to prevent homeless people sleeping on its campus.\n\nThe move prompted complaints from students - but university insisted the cages were a health and safety measure to stop the homeless breathing in harmful boiler fumes including carbon monoxide.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Fury,French,mayor,installs,anti,homeless,cages,city,s,public,benches,Christmas,Eve", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2889240/Fury-French-mayor-installs-anti-homeless-cages-city-s-public-benches-Christmas-Eve.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Metal cages put over benches on Christmas Eve in Angouleme, south-west France, to banish homeless people over the festive period have been described as 'sickening'.", "title": "Fury as French mayor installs anti-homeless cages around city", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2889240/Fury-French-mayor-installs-anti-homeless-cages-city-s-public-benches-Christmas-Eve.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/28/2442C8C900000578-0-image-a-8_1419790086861.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2889240/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2889240/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2889240, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Fury,French,mayor,installs,anti,homeless,cages,city,s,public,benches,Christmas,Eve", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-12-28T18:23:03.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Thomas+Burrows+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-12-29T08:44:15.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Fury French mayor installs anti homeless cages city s public benches Christmas Eve"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Metal cages put over benches on Christmas Eve in Angouleme, south-west France, to banish homeless people over the festive period have been described as 'sickening'.", "title": "Fury as French mayor installs anti-homeless cages around city", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2889240/Fury-French-mayor-installs-anti-homeless-cages-city-s-public-benches-Christmas-Eve.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/28/2442C8C900000578-0-image-a-8_1419790086861.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/bc/rtmp_uds/1418450360/2014/12/29/1418450360_3963897160001_france.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Metal cages put over benches on Christmas Eve in Angouleme, south-west France, to banish homeless people over the festive period have been described as 'sickening'."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0bc\"", "article_summary": "But that did not stop a mayor in south-west France installing metal cages over public benches to banish homeless people from the city.\nThe mayor put up the cages on Christmas Eve in an effort to prevent 'drunk people' snoozing on the benches.\nXavier Bonnefont, Angouleme's 34-year-old Right-wing mayor, has been criticised for his lack of empathy and Christmas spirit.\nHe tweeted: 'Spikes outside Southwark housing development to deter rough sleeping are ugly, self defeating & stupid.\nOne commentator on Twitter even suggested the mayor will go one step further next year and 'electrify' the cages."}
