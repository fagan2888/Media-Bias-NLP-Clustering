He was on his way to visit his parents in Keller, according to Fort Worth police, who haven\u2019t decided whether to charge him in the wreck.\n\nThe survivors from the Camry are Moriah\u2019s family: James and Bethany Modisette in the front, and 8-year-old Isabella Modisette in the back.

It\u2019s state law to pull over into the left lane or slow to 20 miles under the speed limit when there is a traffic stop being conducted and traffic was slowing in both lane. The family had stopped in the left lane when a 2002 Toyota 4 Runner rear ended them.\n\nThe girl\u2019s parents and an 8-year-old boy were hospitalized at Denton Regional ER. The girl was sitting behind the driver and was air lifted to Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center in Fort Worth where she was pronounced dead.\n\nThe driver of the 4 Runner may have been on his cell phone at the time of the crash, police said.
