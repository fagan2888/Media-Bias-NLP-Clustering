Parents are blasted with this message in pediatricians\u2019 offices, at preschool, on TV, even with billboards on the city bus. Reading books with children on a daily basis advances their language skills, extends their learning about the world, and helps their own reading later in school. Reading with your child from a young age can instill a lifelong love of books. A new study published in Science even shows that reading literary fiction improves adults\u2019 ability to understand other people\u2019s emotions.\n\n\u201cDad, tell me a story from when you were little. Tell me the story about the time you met your best friend Chris at school.\u201d Six-year-old Alex, who has just started school himself, snuggles into his pillow and catches his dad\u2019s hand in the dark. They have finished the nightly reading of Tin Tin and now it\u2019s time for \u201cjust one more story\u201d before Alex goes to sleep.\n\nOver the last 25 years, a small canon of research on family storytelling shows that when parents share more family stories with their children\u2014especially when they tell those stories in a detailed and responsive way\u2014their children benefit in a host of ways . For instance, experimental studies show that when parents learn to reminisce about everyday events with their preschool children in more detailed ways, their children tell richer, more complete narratives to other adults one to two years later compared to children whose parents didn\u2019t learn the new reminiscing techniques. Children of the parents who learned new ways to reminisce also demonstrate better understanding of other people\u2019s thoughts and emotions . These advanced narrative and emotional skills serve children well in the school years when reading complex material and learning to get along with others. In the preteen years, children whose families collaboratively discuss everyday events and family history more often have higher self-esteem and stronger self-concepts . And adolescents with a stronger knowledge of family history have more robust identities, better coping skills, and lower rates of depression and anxiety. Family storytelling can help a child grow into a teen who feels connected to the important people in her life.\n\nYet what most parents don\u2019t know is that everyday family stories, like the one that Alex\u2019s dad spun out that night, confer many of the same benefits of reading\u2013and even some new ones.\n\nThe cozy image of cuddling up with your young child while poring over a book, however, doesn\u2019t fit with reality for some parents and children. Parents from some cultures are not as comfortable reading with their children because books were not part of their everyday lives growing up. For other parents, reading with children is a fraught activity because of their own negative experiences learning to read. And for some highly active children, sitting down with a book is a punishment, not a reward. Fortunately, parents can learn new ways of reading books with their children to engage even the most irascible customer\u2013and to engage themselves.\n\nBest of all, unlike stories from books, family stories are always free and completely portable. You don\u2019t even need to have the lights on to share with your child a story about your day, about their day, about your childhood or their grandma\u2019s. In the research on family storytelling, all of these kinds of stories are linked to benefits for your child. Family stories can continue to be part of a parent\u2019s daily interactions with their children into adolescence, long past the age of the bedtime story.\n\nAll families have stories to tell, regardless of their culture or their circumstances. Of course, not all of these stories are idyllic ones. Research shows that children and adolescents can learn a great deal from stories of life\u2019s more difficult moments\u2013as long as those stories are told in a way that is sensitive to the child\u2019s level of understanding, and as long as something good is gleaned from the experience.\n\nTelling the story about the time the Christmas tree ignited because of faulty wiring and burned up the presents is fine, as long as you can find a tinsel lining. For example: Luckily you were able to save some favorite ornaments from the blaze, and your family ended up at a soup kitchen for Christmas dinner where you met Marion, who would become a treasured family friend.\n\nBooks contain narratives, but only family stories contain your family\u2019s personal narratives. Fortunate children get both. They hear and read stories from books to become part of other people\u2019s worlds, and they hear and tell stories of their family to understand who they are and from whence they came.\n\nAs Ursula LeGuin said, \u201cThere have been great societies that did not use the wheel, but there have been no societies that did not tell stories.\u201d Oral storytelling has been part of human existence for millennia. Toddlers start telling primitive stories from nearly as soon as they can speak, beginning with simple sentences about past experiences such as \u201cCookie allgone.\u201d Adults quickly build on these baby stories, \u201cWhat happened to your cookie? You ate it!\u201d so that by age three or four, most children can tell a relatively sensible story of a past experience that a na\u00efve listener will (mostly) understand. By the time they are in school, children will regale a sympathetic adult with highly detailed stories about events of great importance to them, such as scoring a goal at a soccer game, but they may fail to mention the bigger picture that their team still lost. In the preteen and early adolescent years, children tell highly proficient stories about events in their lives, but they still need help understanding difficult events, such as the time their best friend dumped them for someone else. It is not until mid-adolescence that teens can understand the impact of events on their lives and on who they are becoming. Even older adolescents still benefit from their parents\u2019 help in understanding life\u2019s curveballs.\n\nThe holidays are prime time for family storytelling. When you\u2019re putting up the tree or having your holiday meal, share a story with your children about past holidays. Leave in the funny bits, the sad bits, the gory and smelly bits\u2013kids can tell when a story has been sanitized for their protection. Then invite everyone else to tell a story too. Don\u2019t forget the youngest and the oldest storytellers in the group. Their stories may not be as coherent, but they can be the truest, and the most revealing.\n\nFamily stories can be told nearly anywhere. They cost us only our time, our memories, our creativity. They can inspire us, protect us, and bind us to others. So be generous with your stories, and be generous in your stories. Remember that your children may have them for a lifetime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reading to children has education benefits, of course\u2014but so does sharing tales from the past.", "author": "Elaine Reese", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Reading to children has education benefits, of course\u2014but so does sharing tales from the past.", "title": "What Kids Learn From Hearing Family Stories", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/196808155_af60b8d717_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/what-kids-learn-from-hearing-family-stories/282075/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e0e\"", "article_summary": "Family storytelling can help a child grow into a teen who feels connected to the important people in her life.\nBest of all, unlike stories from books, family stories are always free and completely portable.\nIn the research on family storytelling, all of these kinds of stories are linked to benefits for your child.\nThe holidays are prime time for family storytelling.\nFortunately, parents can learn new ways of reading books with their children to engage even the most irascible customer\u2013and to engage themselves."}
