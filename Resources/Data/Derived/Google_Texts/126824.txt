State Sen. Whitney Westerfield of Hopkinsville managed to clinch a primary victory Tuesday night for the Republican nomination for Kentucky Attorney General.

The results came in with 53 percent of the vote for Westerfield and 47 percent for opponent Michael T. Hogan of Lawrence County.

Westerfield says his priorities include working with the General Assembly to improve public policy, beef up the AG’s cyber crimes unit and fight against the Affordable Care Act and the federal government.

“These are the things that I would like to do if given the chance to serve as the next Attorney General," Westerfield said. "But I think that message, I’m the only one talking about it. The message appeals to everybody in Kentucky, and my job over the next five months is to get that message to as many people in Kentucky as I possibly can.”

Westerfield faces off against Democrat Andy Beshear, son of Gov. Steve Beshear, in the fall.
