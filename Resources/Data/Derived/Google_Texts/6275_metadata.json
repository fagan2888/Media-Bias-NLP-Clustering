Previously, British airstrikes against the brutal Islamist terrorist group had been limited to Iraq.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s 10-hour debate in the House of Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron urged lawmakers to vote to approve airstrikes against \u201cwoman-raping, Muslim-murdering, medieval monsters.\u201d Cameron added:\n\nDo we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands, from where they are plotting to kill British people? Or do we sit back and wait for them to attack us?\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn tried to rally his Labour Party to vote against the airstrikes, but the lawmakers ultimately voted 397 to 223 to approve the measure, with 66 out of 231 Labour members voting in favor. Corbyn criticized what he called Cameron\u2019s \u201cill-thought-out rush to war.\u201d\n\nThe Labour Party leader wrote on Facebook: \u201cBritish service men and women will now be in harm\u2019s way and the loss of innocent lives is sadly almost inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe expansion of Britain\u2019s air war against ISIS into Syria also follows a whirlwind, transcontinental diplomatic marathon by French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in the weeks following the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris that left 130 dead. Hollande has been pressing for a more forceful international coalition, including Russia, to defeat ISIS.\n\nA statement posted to the Elys\u00e9e Palace website Thursday said: \u201cThe president of the Republic welcomes the first British aerial operations over Syria.\u201d\n\nLimited Effects\n\nBritain\u2019s expanded role in Operation Inherent Resolve\u2014the name of the U.S.-led multinational coalition in Iraq and Syria\u2014holds symbolic value and highlights worldwide solidarity after the Paris attacks. But questions linger about the overall utility of British strikes to the long-term goal of defeating ISIS.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s decision to expand its airstrikes to Syria is welcome and long overdue,\u201d said Luke Coffey, the Margaret Thatcher fellow at The Heritage Foundation and former special adviser to Liam Fox, Britain\u2019s former secretary of state for defense.\n\nCoffey added:\n\nHowever, this move is more about the symbolism of Britain supporting its allies than about achieving any great military effect on the ground in Syria. Britain has very limited airpower in the region and is not in a position to beef it up with additional assets.\n\nThe expansion of British airstrikes into Syria likely will have little impact on the day-to-day operational tempo of Royal Air Force pilots already flying missions over Iraq.\n\nThe major complicating factor, according to current and former RAF and U.S. Air Force pilots, is how \u201ccrowded\u201d the battlespace in Syria has become. With Russian warplanes now patrolling Syrian skies alongside those of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, the risk of an unexpected, potentially deadly air-to-air encounter has escalated.\n\nAdditionally, without U.S. or coalition ground forces in theater to control warplanes or identify friendly positions as opposed to enemy positions, pilots rely almost entirely on ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) aircraft, both manned and unmanned, to select targets.\n\n\u201cThe fog of war is thick,\u201d said one U.S. Air Force A-10 pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity from an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf region in September.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nOperation Inherent Resolve comprises 62 countries, of which about a dozen actively are carrying out airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. After nearly 18 months, the air war against ISIS is at a stalemate, and it isn\u2019t clear whether the addition of British air power in Syria will make a measurable difference. Many military personnel in the field say the limits of what airpower alone can achieve already have been reached.\n\nCoalition airstrikes (of which U.S. warplanes constitute the overwhelming majority) have been killing about 300 ISIS fighters a week, or about 1,000 a month. That\u2019s roughly on par with the terrorist group\u2019s rate of recruitment, capping its manpower at about 30,000 to 40,000 fighters.\n\nBecause of the geography of northern Iraq and Syria\u2014where urban centers resemble man-made islands amid vast, open terrain\u2014ISIS essentially is hunkered down in the cities and towns it controls. The group is unable to mass forces or move freely in the open spaces in between because of the risk of interdiction by coalition airpower.\n\nWhile preventing civilian casualties is the top moral imperative of U.S. pilots and allied counterparts, the most pressing challenge in Syria and Iraq is coordinating air-to-ground operations without reliable ground forces with which to communicate.\n\nIt is much easier, for example, for pilots and analysts staring at a black-and-white infrared sensor feed to distinguish women and children from military-aged males than it is to tell apart Free Syrian Army troops\u2014which the U.S. and allies support\u2014from ISIS fighters.\n\nSo while the British expansion into Syria certainly will increase the coalition\u2019s firepower and operational capabilities, military analysts say it will not resolve the No. 1 limiting factor in the war\u2014the absence of U.S. or coalition ground forces.\n\nThe U.S. does have specialized joint terminal attack controllers, or JTACs, in theater. These elite troops are trained to guide airstrikes and control warplanes from the ground. But they are conducting their missions while sitting inside operations centers looking at ISR sensor feeds on video screens.\n\nPatience and Persistence\n\nPart of the stated mission of Operation Inherent Resolve, apart from destroying ISIS through airpower, is to train and equip partners on the ground such as the Kurdish Peshmerga, the Free Syrian Army, and the Iraqi Army to take the reins in rooting ISIS out of their strongholds and then holding recaptured terrain.\n\nPresumably, coalition airpower has given friendly ground forces the time and space to train and rearm in preparation for the inevitable ground war.\n\nYet privately, many U.S. commanders and personnel in theater complain that the Iraqi military isn\u2019t yet up to the task. The consensus is that the Kurdish Peshmerga is a capable fighting force with a strong will to fight but needs better equipment and training. Consequently, military leaders and politicians stress that combat actions against ISIS will require a long-term campaign, likely lasting for years.\n\n\u201cWe are going to need to be patient and persistent,\u201d Cameron said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "British lawmakers voted 397 to 223 to authorize military action against the Islamic State in Syria.
