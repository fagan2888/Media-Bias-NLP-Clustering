All participants had visited sexual health clinics in England between March and August 2011. About 75 percent had previously been offered HPV vaccination \u2014 significantly less than the 80-percent minimum required to impact cervical cancer rates.\n\nCertain subsets within this group had even lower rates. For example, only 66 percent of those living in London and 64 percent of those whose ethnicity was not white said they had been offered the HPV vaccine. For unemployed women who were not in school or other training, the figure was less than 50 percent.\n\nOverall, two-thirds of respondents received the remaining two shots after getting the initial injection. The completion rate was significantly lower in non-whites, 17- to 19-year-olds, and those with previous sexually transmitted infections. \u201cThis survey demonstrates the vulnerability of this sample of young women,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nAlthough cervical cancer rates have declined dramatically since the introduction of the Pap smear, the disease still kills thousands of American women every year, with 12,200 annual diagnoses. According to the National Institutes of Health, virtually all of these cases are caused by subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV). Vaccines like Gardasil and Ceravix are highly effective in preventing some of these strains.\n\nSacks and her team submit that in order to drive up acceptance and completion rates, public health officials must become better at targeting these at-risk groups. \u201cIn our survey, the most commonly cited reasons for declining the vaccination offer suggest a lack of information is given to women and their parents,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cOur data highlights that better information for patients, as well as for parents and peers, is a key lever to increase acceptance levels.\u201d\n\nSource: Sacks RJ, Copas AJ, Wilkinson DM, Robinson AJ.
