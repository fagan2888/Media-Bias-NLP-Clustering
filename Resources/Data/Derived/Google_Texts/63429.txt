Adding to Lifestyle-Brand M&A, Bruckmann Rosser Acquires Simpson Race Products

Carousel Capital invested in Simpson in 1998

New York private equity firm Bruckmann Rosser Sherrill & Co. has acquired Simpson Performance Products Inc., which makes race car-related products, from Carousel Capital.

Simpson, headquartered in New Braunfels, Texas, provides motorsports safety equipment, including head and neck restraints, helmets, fire suits, seat belts, window nets, parachutes, racing gloves and footwear. The company owns the Simpson and Hans brand neck restraints.

Bruckmann plans to help the company expand into new racing segments and geographies. The firm has $1.4 billion under management and focuses on investing in consumer goods and services businesses.

Carousel, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, invested in Simpson in 1998.

Kirkland & Ellis LLP was Bruckmanns legal adviser for the deal. Fidus Partners was financial adviser to Carousel, and K&L Gates LLP provided legal advice.

Lifestyle-focused consumer products companies have been attracting investor interest for a while. Recent transactions include J.W. Childs Associates acquisition of Cycle Gear in January, and Bass Pro Group LLCs deal for Fishing Holdings LLC in December.
