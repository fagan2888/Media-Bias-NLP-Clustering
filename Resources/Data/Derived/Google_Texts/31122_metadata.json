Sean Parnell tens of thousands of dollars to work as a consultant to improve relations with state officials.\n\nThe House Republican Conference paid Sean Parnell $10,000 in both March and April. Furthermore, taxpayers have covered more than $6,000 in travel expenses for Parnell, according to a recently released House spending report.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNate Hodson, a spokesman for House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), said Parnell is helping \u201cimprove coordination, collaboration, and communication between Republican state elected officials and House Republicans.\u201d Hodson said the effort is one of McMorris Rodgers\u2019 \u201cgoals.\u201d\n\nThe initiative included regular calls with governors in the leadup to the King v. Burwell Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare, as well as meetings and conversations between state-based aides to governors and House GOP leadership. Parnell\u2019s contract is a short-term arrangement.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for a former statewide official to serve as an adviser to a member of Congress. Former Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) briefly served as chief of staff for former Rep. Chip Cravaack (R-Minn.).\n\nParnell, who served as Sarah Palin\u2019s lieutenant governor, mounted an unsuccessful primary challenge to longtime Alaska Rep. Don Young in 2008. Young beat Parnell by several hundred votes. Parnell assumed the governorship after Palin resigned in 2009. He lost to Independent Bill Walker in 2014.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Sean Parnell received tens of thousands of dollars to work as a consultant.", "title": "House Republicans paying ex-Alaska gov", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/house-gop-paying-sean-parnell-alaska-governor-213128", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c5/6e/083e24c747ae86ccb8463c552146/150828-sean-parnell-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Sean Parnell received tens of thousands of dollars to work as a consultant.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda284\"", "article_summary": "AP Photo House Republicans paying ex-Alaska govHouse Republicans are using taxpayer money to pay former Alaska Gov.\nThe House Republican Conference paid Sean Parnell $10,000 in both March and April.\nSean Parnell tens of thousands of dollars to work as a consultant to improve relations with state officials.\nFurthermore, taxpayers have covered more than $6,000 in travel expenses for Parnell, according to a recently released House spending report.\nParnell, who served as Sarah Palin\u2019s lieutenant governor, mounted an unsuccessful primary challenge to longtime Alaska Rep.
