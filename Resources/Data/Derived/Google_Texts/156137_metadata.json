Morgan Griffith for the 9th District U.S. House seat in November.\n\nAll say the Republican incumbent, who is seeking re-election to a fourth term, doesn\u2019t represent the entire district, which they say he doesn\u2019t visit very often.\n\nDerek Kitts, who calls himself a conservative Democrat, used the tornado that devastated Glade Spring in 2011 as an example of how he believes Griffith didn\u2019t step up.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t show up for two weeks,\u201d said Kitts, of Christiansburg. \u201cThe way I\u2019m wired and the way the Army brought me up is you take care of your people and if you take care of your people they will take care of you. ...His [Griffith] excuse was ... he didn\u2019t want to get in the way. ... That just burned me to the core. You don\u2019t have to do anything. Nobody\u2019s asking you to go save people \u2014 just be there, shake hands, show them that you actually care.\u201d\n\nGriffith said in 2011 that he visited Glade Spring the Sunday after the early morning tornado on Thursday, April 28. He said he was on vacation when the tornado struck.\n\nBill Bunch, who calls himself a liberal Democrat and environmentalist who believes in green industry, said he decided to enter the race because he\u2019s tired of the congressman failing to represent the entire district and its needs.\n\n\u201cWhile our district does depend on coal and fossil fuels to a large extent, we are actually quite diverse in our agriculture and other types of manufacturing,\u201d Bunch said. \u201cWe need a good, strong coal industry as far as deep mining and steel is concerned, but our people have suffered health-wise and economically by the mining of coal.\u201d\n\nBunch, from Tazewell County, also believes in legalizing marijuana.\n\nClay Pugh, a Democrat from Sugar Grove, said he believes that Griffith has had very little presence in the whole district, especially the southern part, which Pugh and Kitts compare to the size of New Jersey.\n\nPugh says he has spent his life \u201cnurturing people\u2019s spiritual needs\u201d as a clergy member and believes that experience would aid him in representing the district.\n\n\u201cThe congressman\u2019s job is not just to represent the people in Washington three days a week but is to spend the other three to four days a week being present with the people,\u201d he said.\n\nPugh\u2019s said his focus to help people would be to build cell towers and bring high speed Internet to areas that need it along with improving education, income, prosperity, and the well-being of the district\u2019s constituents.\n\nKitts believes his 24 years on active duty in the Army have equipped him to be a leader for the district.\n\n\u201cYou can delegate authority, but you can never delegate responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth care is Kitts\u2019 other hot button issue. He said the Affordable Care Act is a good starting point, but it needs controls. Kitts called it a \u201ccrying shame\u201d that thousands come out every year to get free medical care at Remote Area Medical clinics in the district because they can\u2019t afford health care.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be other options because as RAM shows you there\u2019s a large need,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I just want to help people. ...Too many people and politicians have an over-exaggerated feeling of their own self-importance.\u201d\n\nBunch said he believes the Affordable Health Care Act is really just an insurance company welfare bill.\n\nGriffith, from Salem, told the Bristol Herald Courier that it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s still work to be done in the district.\n\n\u201cI came here saying that I would fight the Obama administration on their anti-coal policies and other policies that hurt business,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been one of the leaders in that fight in the House [of Representatives].\u201d\n\nGriffith said he wants to continue his work on the \u201cregulatory scheme that is overly burdensome\u201d on the coal industry and farmers.\n\nHe added that\u2019s he\u2019s worked to protect gun rights and believes he has made headway in building his credibility with the House\u2019s Health Subcommittee, particularly in rural health, including telemedicine and mental health issues.\n\nNo other Republican candidates for the congressional seat have surfaced.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "HeraldCourier.com", "description": "Three political newcomers want to be the Democratic candidate to challenge U.S. Rep.
