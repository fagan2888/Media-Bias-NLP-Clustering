Truman to Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. Some say as many as seven presidents attempted to pass some form of national health care with few results, often stymied by the notion that social welfare should be left up to the states.\n\nBut Barack Obama, in his first term as president, succeeded where so many had found failure, becoming the first president to pass a reformative plan for national health care, one that also confronted the practices of insurance companies that have historically disqualified from quality medical coverage millions of Americans, many with pre-existing health conditions or predisposition to them.\n\nIn this next installment of The Root\u2019s series His Lasting Legacy, we take a look at the Affordable Care Act, arguably Obama\u2019s greatest demonstration of efficacy. It was signed in 2010, when the country was still staggering to its feet from the Great Recession that had consumed the previous 18 months and left some 6 percent of the job force unemployed and, essentially, uninsured.\n\nEconomically, President Obama inherited a hot, nightmarish mess. Still, he pressed the issue, making the Affordable Care Act, the ACA, Obamacare\u2014whether you call it by its official name or critics\u2019 pejorative of choice\u2014his signature piece of legislation. Its historical impact is being lived out by 20 million previously uninsured people who now have health coverage, which, according to the White House, is the highest number of insured Americans in history. More than 3 million black people and 4 million Latinos now have health coverage, a particular victory for communities that disproportionately succumb to diseases that can be prevented and controlled. Obamacare has given people, especially people of color, access to care where there previously was none.\n\nWhile there have been other successes in the Obama administration\u2014the legalization of same-sex marriage, restored relations with Cuba\u2014the Affordable Care Act shines as a standout accomplishment.\n\n\u201cDespite its shortcomings\u2014and it clearly has many because it\u2019s built on an existing system that is problematic\u2014it is a remarkable political achievement,\u201d said Michael Gusmano, associate professor of health policy at Rutgers University and research scholar at the Hastings Center. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to adopt some form of comprehensive health coverage since the Teddy Roosevelt administration, and with the notable exception of the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, this is really the first major success.\u201d\n\nAn Alignment of Ideal Circumstances\n\nTiming played a major factor in the success of Obamacare. Built on national health care achievements that started with the introduction of Medicaid by Lyndon Johnson in 1965, there were several variables in play that made Obama\u2019s platform more likely than that of many previous presidents: He had a majority in both houses, with 60 votes\u2014at least for a while\u2014in the U.S. Senate. Democrats, who had learned from the failure of the Clinton attempt at health care reform introduced back in the 1990s, were deliberate about working cohesively. That helped set the mood to push Obamacare forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always about an alignment of time and circumstances, but I think even when his Congress was Democratic in both houses, which is a pretty good alignment for him for a short time; even when some of his top advisers said, \u2018Don\u2019t do this. Do the economy, do something else. Don\u2019t get bogged down in something that can turn out to be disastrous for you the way the Clinton plan was,\u2019 he said, \u2018Nope. I\u2019m doing it.\u2019 He made a commitment to health care that people around him thought was foolhardy. He stuck with it and did it,\u201d said Sandra Tanenbaum, professor of health services management and policy at Ohio State University.\n\nAdding to that diligence, said Gusmano, was the president\u2019s political skill and the amount of personal political capital.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/97969576-president-barack-obama-is-applauded-after-signing-the.jpg?w=50", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theRoot", "site_name": "The Root", "description": "His Lasting Legacy:\u00a0Many people tried, but President Barack Obama succeeded in passing health care reform in the United States.", "title": "The Affordable Care Act: A Defining Moment in Barack Obama\u2019s Presidency", "url": "http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2016/04/the_affordable_care_act_a_defining_moment_in_barack_obama_s_presidency", "image": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/97969576-president-barack-obama-is-applauded-after-signing-the.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-21 03:00:00", "sailthru.title": "The Affordable Care Act: A Defining Moment in Barack Obama\u2019s Presidency", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 110960888944481}, "sailthru.tags": "Politics", "sailthru.description": "<p>So many presidents tried it.</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/97969576-president-barack-obama-is-applauded-after-signing-the.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Adding to that diligence, said Gusmano, was the president\u2019s political skill and the amount of personal political capital.\nI\u2019m doing it.\u2019 He made a commitment to health care that people around him thought was foolhardy.\nDemocrats, who had learned from the failure of the Clinton attempt at health care reform introduced back in the 1990s, were deliberate about working cohesively.\nEconomically, President Obama inherited a hot, nightmarish mess.\nSome say as many as seven presidents attempted to pass some form of national health care with few results, often stymied by the notion that social welfare should be left up to the states."}
