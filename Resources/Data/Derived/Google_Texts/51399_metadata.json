The U.S. Government\u2019s theme this year is \u201cFocus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-free Generation.\u201d\n\nLeading up to World AIDS Day, AIDS.gov is sharing 10 simple, ready-to-use resources on a daily basis to help you reach specific subsets of your audiences as you plan local observances. There are many audiences to reach with World AIDS Day messaging, but below are additional resources to reach three key groups: young adults, clinicians, and people disproportionately at risk for getting HIV.\n\nReach Young Adults\n\nReach Clinicians and Service Providers\n\nAn important way to educate medical and social service providers who may not be serving people living with HIV every day is to share the facts:\n\nHave you learned the most recent statistics from the HIV Basics section on AIDS.gov or referred a patient to find services through the HIV Testing Sites & Care Services Locator?\n\nHave you read and shared policy and research updates from the AIDS.gov blog? If you offer these current, reliable sources, you may pique provider interest.\n\nFinally, remember that customizable posters may be very useful to providers this week.\n\nReach Individuals at Risk\n\nMany of the resources noted above can help you reach people at risk.\n\nFor outreach to specific populations, check out the many resources on AIDS.gov\u2019s Federal Campaigns page. CDC and other agencies have produced graphics, videos, and social media assets that are ready to incorporate into your World AIDS Day communications.\n\nMore resources are available on the AIDS.gov World AIDS Day awareness page.\n\nThere are many subsets of people who can and should be reached on and around World AIDS Day. A vital aspect of this observance is that each effort to reach a different community group can make a difference in moving us towards an AIDS-free generation. Through your work, I hope you will take this opportunity to contribute to this year\u2019s theme: Focus, Partner, and Achieve: An AIDS-free generation.\n\nWhat tools are you using for your communication this World AIDS Day?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
