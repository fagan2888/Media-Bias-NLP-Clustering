The Greenwich, Conn., estate was bought by Trump and then-wife Ivana for $4 million back in 1982, according to TopTenRealEstateDeals.com . The site says Ivana Trump gave the couple’s abode an ultra-deluxe look, transforming it into a “residence dripping in gold leaf, elegant chandeliers, and crown moldings.”

Later owners eventually swapped the over-the-top décor for “more livable neutrals.”

The 19,773-square-foot main house and a guest house boast eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, a putting green, tennis courts, a theater, indoor and outdoor pools and a private boat dock, among other über-upscale features.
