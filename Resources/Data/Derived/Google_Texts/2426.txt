Victim's car on the scene

One person is arrested early Sunday morning after a high speed chase ends in a crash in west Wichita.

Sgt. Justin Antle says it happened around 2:30 a.m. Sunday near Maple and Clara. After a Deputy pulled over the suspect, made contact with him, the driver then drove off eastbound on Maple.

The suspect then collided into another vehicle that was heading south on West St. During the collision with the victim's vehicle, an axle flew off of one of the vehicles striking a QuikTrip gas pump. That station is located near West and Maple.

Both cars were totaled, but none of the people had any serious injuries.
