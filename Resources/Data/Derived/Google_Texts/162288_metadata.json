(AP) \u2014 The handlers of Pennsylvania\u2019s most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said Monday the furry rodent has forecast six more weeks of winter.\n\nMembers of the top hat-wearing Inner Circle announced the \u201cprediction\u201d Monday morning.\n\nA German legend has it that if a furry rodent sees his shadow on Feb. 2, winter will last another six weeks. If not, spring comes early.\n\nThe forecast was also announced on Twitter, as was referenced in the official proclamation read by Jeff Lundy, the Fair Weatherman of the Inner Circle.\n\n\u201cForecasts abound on the Internet, but, I, Punxsutawney Phil am still your best bet. Yes, a shadow I see, you can start to Twitter, hash tag: Six more weeks of winter!\u201d\n\nThe forecast was delivered after a steady pre-dawn rain turned to snow as temperatures dropped from the high 30s to around freezing. They were forecast to keep dropping over much of the state, prompting the state Department of Transportation to lower the speed limit to 45 mph for many interstate highways which were already wet and expected to freeze or be covered with snow as the day wore on.\n\nThe rain kept some revelers away, with state police estimating the crowd at around 11,000, slightly smaller than in recent years when upward of 15,000 attended.\n\nNo mention was made of Sunday night\u2019s Super Bowl, unlike Groundhog Day 2009 \u2014 the last time the celebration occurred the morning after the big game \u2014 which was won by the nearby Pittsburgh Steelers that year.\n\nDespite the German legend, Phil\u2019s handlers don\u2019t wait to see if he sees his shadow \u2014 as he likely would not have on such an overcast day. Instead, the Inner Circle decide on the forecast ahead of time and announce it on Gobbler\u2019s Knob, a tiny hill in the town for which the groundhog is named, about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.\n\nRecords going back to 1887 show Phil has now predicted more winter 102 times while forecasting an early spring just 17 times. There are no records for the remaining years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The handlers of Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said Monday the furry rodent has forecast six more weeks of winter.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The handlers of Pennsylvania\u2019s most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said Monday the furry rodent has forecast six more weeks of winter.", "title": "Punxsutawney Phil, Pennsylvania groundhog, offers his \u2018forecast\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/2/pennsylvania-groundhog-to-forecast-winters-end-or-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/02/bfbccebf2ad3ec056c0f6a706700d072.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/02/bfbccebf2ad3ec056c0f6a706700d072.jpg", "description": "The handlers of Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said Monday the furry rodent has forecast six more weeks of winter.", "card": "summary", "title": "Punxsutawney Phil, Pennsylvania groundhog, offers his \u2018forecast&"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa.
