But the market appears to be deviating from this model, as skilled nursing as a whole faces an uncertain future, plagued by negative operating margins and reimbursement risk.\n\nInstead, there has been a bifurcation of skilled nursing into long-term care and post-acute care, some say.\n\n\u201cSkilled nursing historically has always been synonymous with long-term care,\u201d says Mainstreet Founder and CEO Zeke Turner. \u201cOver time you had the emergence of assisted living and independent living and other categories to fulfill more residential functions, leaving more of the medical piece to long-term care. For the last 25 years, people have been saying we need something new in skilled nursing. Over the last year or so that\u2019s become clear: There\u2019s been a bifurcation in skilled nursing between short-term rehab/therapy and long-term medical residence.\u201d\n\nWith the second-largest health care REIT backing the post-acute model, it seems HCN is betting big on the segment dominating the skilled nursing space in the coming years, despite what others might identify as hefty risks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re attracted to these properties because they are typically the lowest cost alternative for Medicare and managed care patients,\u201d says Scott Brinker, chief investment officer of HCN. \u201cThe importance of cost efficiency will only increase going forward. Reimbursement rates fluctuate over time, so when we invest in these types of properties, we structure them as triple-net leases with a large payment coverage cushion to insulate our rent payment from changes in reimbursement rates.\u201d\n\nMainstreet\u2019s model allows HCN the opportunity to invest in a segment of skilled nursing that has remained largely untouched by health care REITs, become a player in the accountable care organization (ACO) landscape, and extend its network of third-party operators.\n\nHCN\u2019s Big Bet on the \u201cNew\u201d Skilled Nursing\n\nThough HCN has invested in post-acute properties for years including partnerships with operators Genesis and Trilogy among them, Mainstreet\u2019s properties offer a unique mix of post-acute and assisted living suites, which differs from traditional skilled nursing portfolios.\n\n\u201cThis partnership with Mainstreet allows us to deliver a product that is in high demand yet short supply,\u201d Brinker says. \u201cOne-third of the units in these properties are private-pay assisted living, which serve as a complementary step-down unit for the post-acute patients. Meanwhile the on-site post-acute services, such as rehab therapy, allow the assisted living residents to receive services that are otherwise rarely available in an assisted living setting.\u201d\n\nBut HCN\u2019s big bet lies on a largely untested \u2014 and higher-risk \u2014 model. While other models of senior housing have long track records of proven success, Mainstreet\u2019s property type is unique in that it is a relatively new product and there isn\u2019t anything quite like it in the market. Because of this, some analysts say the investment still comes with its share of risk.\n\n\u201cThe Mainstreet [properties] really are different,\u201d says Rob Mains, research managing director at Stifel Financial Corp. \u201cThe two reasons I don\u2019t think everyone will go after that are: one, since it\u2019s medically complex, and [two], you are making a bet on where health care delivery evolves. \u2026 Not everyone is willing to make those two bets.\u201d\n\nWhile Mainstreet\u2019s 45-property future pipeline will offer a first purchase option to HCN, other investors are expected to follow with their own moves in the post-acute space.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be investment into this category,\u201d Turner says. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re the only development group of any note focusing on this area; I expect this to change at some point. Over time, within three to five years, there will be others that will play into this space \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of time before people get there.\u201d\n\nWhen this time comes, there will be a move away from investing in the costly, Medicaid-reimbursed long-term care segment of skilled nursing, to private pay or Medicare-reimbursed post-acute care, experts say.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to see a trend away from Medicaid and that\u2019s really what\u2019s desirable from the standpoint of the Big Three,\u201d says Kevin Tyler, analyst with Green Street Advisors. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for higher quality mix so that means more private pay and Medicare on a skilled nursing basis.\u201d\n\nWhat HCN\u2019s Deal Means to ACOs\n\nBy investing in these Mainstreet properties, HCN also is becoming a major player in the ACO landscape.\n\n\u201cThe exact details of ACOs will take many years to play out, but we believe there are a few certainties,\u201d Brinker says. \u201cOne, the need for efficient outcomes. The Mainstreet properties allow patients to leave the hospital and enter a lower cost setting where they get highly focused services.\u201d\n\nPost-acute care \u2014 with its rehab and go home model \u2014 is largely designed to help improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions, a central focus of ACOs, set forth by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nBy having post-acute care with the option to move residents to an on-site assisted living suite, the Mainstreet properties are well-positioned to attract recently discharged patients.\n\n\u201cThis is unique and we probably will continue to see it as a trend in skilled nursing, where there\u2019s more of a focus on post-acute with a component of assisted living rather than long-term care,\u201d says Tyler, of Green Street Advisors.\n\nSenior living operators have made a concerted effort to figure out the best strategies for establishing themselves as partners in ACOs. Some rely on diversified service offerings across the post-acute care continuum, while others are building near existing hospitals and health systems to carve out their niches in the ACO fold.\n\nThough strategies vary, one thing is clear in this space: Size matters. The need for scale is essential, Brinker says.\n\n\u201cLarge operators will be better equipped to invest into infrastructure and to contract with managed care payers,\u201d he says. Mainstreet, as the largest developer of senior housing and post-acute facilities in the U.S., has a sizable hold on the market, not to mention access to several large-scale operators such as Life Care Services, which has more than 115 properties.\n\nFinally, Mainstreet\u2019s upscale Next Generation design sets a precedent for future post-acute properties with its high-end amenities and private rooms and baths.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s nice about post-acute care is the hospitals like it,\u201d Turner says. \u201cIt\u2019s also much more efficient when it comes to cost. And if the properties are designed well, then the consumer also finds the product desirable.\u201d\n\nThe need for high-quality real estate is a certainty in the ACO landscape, Brinker says.\n\n\u201cConsumers increasingly have a choice in health care. Shared rooms and low-quality food will not be acceptable to consumers who have a choice. The Mainstreet properties cater to consumers who have a choice,\u201d he says.\n\nSourcing Future Growth Today\n\nHCN\u2019s Mainstreet partnership may signal forthcoming industrywide trends that could shift health care REITs\u2019 investment strategies in the future, making them bigger players in the U.S. health care system as a whole. But the deal also provides HCN another definitive advantage: access to senior housing operators.\n\nREITs have long attributed their performance to working with strong, stable operators. Some of HCN\u2019s partnerships include Benchmark, Sunrise and Brookdale Senior Living. Through the 62-property deal with Mainstreet, however, HCN will have access to new operators and, potentially, future properties through those partnerships.\n\n\u201cThis partnership with Mainstreet expands our existing relationships with Genesis and Trilogy and establishes new relationships with well-respected operators such as Ensign and Life Care Services,\u201d Brinker says. \u201cWe own the highest-quality, most modern properties in the sector. These properties will stand the test of time, allowing us to deliver superior internal growth.\u201d\n\nGrowth won\u2019t be hard to come by with 45 properties in Mainstreet\u2019s future pipeline. Partnering with a developer was a strategic move that will give HCN access to a steady stream of properties in the future.\n\n\u201cThe overall transaction was really consistent with Health Care REIT\u2019s overall strategy in terms of working with their operating partners,\u201d Tyler says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great deal in that what they\u2019ve effectively created is a way for them to source future growth, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s been on everyone\u2019s mind. By partnering with a developer you\u2019ve got the opportunity to do that at the price you\u2019ve set today.\u201d\n\nWritten by Emily Study", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "green street advisors, health care reit, mainstreet, stifel, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Health Care REIT (NYSE: HCN) has long invested in skilled nursing properties, but the REIT\u2019s recent $1.4 billion partnership with Mainstreet signals a shift in the investor\u2019s strategy of late that\u2019s representative of a much larger transition for health care in general.
