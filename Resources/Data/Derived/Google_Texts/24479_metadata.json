Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) certainly thinks so. During the course of his 10-and-a-half hour filibuster yesterday to prevent the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, Paul repeatedly lambasted the federal government for its failures and refusals to safeguard the fundamental privacy rights of American citizens. \u201cThere is a general veil of suspicion that is placed on every American now,\u201d Paul observed. \u201cEvery American is somehow said to be under suspicion because we\u2019re collecting the records of every American.\u201d It has to stop.\n\nPaul\u2019s staunch defense of privacy rights puts him at odds with many of his fellow conservatives. In fact, as I\u2019ve previously noted, many conservatives believe the Constitution does not protect the right to privacy at all, since the word privacy is mentioned nowhere in the text of the Constitution. As the late conservative legal theorist Robert Bork once put it, there are no individual rights in those areas where \u201cthe Constitution has not spoken.\u201d\n\nDuring his filibuster yesterday, Paul tackled this conservative orthodoxy head on.\n\n\u201cSome conservatives say, well, there is no right to privacy. I don\u2019t see it in the Constitution,\u201d Paul observed. But those conservatives forget the text of the Ninth Amendment, he countered. \u201cThe Ninth Amendment says that all the rights aren\u2019t listed, but those that aren\u2019t listed are not to be disparaged. Even our Founding Fathers worried about this.\u201d\n\nThe founders certainly did worry about it. According to James Madison, the author of the Ninth Amendment, one of the dangers of adding the Bill of Rights to the Constitution was that \u201cby enumerating particular\u201d rights\n\nit would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow, by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against.\n\nWhat was Madison\u2019s method for guarding against the misguided view that the Constitution does not protect unenumerated rights? It was the addition of the Ninth Amendment, which reads: \u201cThe enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\u201d\n\nIn his filibuster yesterday, Rand Paul echoed Madison\u2019s arguments. While the constitutional powers of the government are \u201cfew and limited,\u201d Paul explained, \u201cit\u2019s the opposite with your rights. Your rights are many and infinite. Your rights are unenumerated and you do have a right to privacy.\u201d\n\nAs the 2016 White House race gets going, I look forward to finding out where the other GOP candidates stand on this fundamental constitutional debate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The Kentucky senator tells conservatives to respect the Ninth Amendment.", "title": "Rand Paul Filibuster: 'Your Rights Are Many and Infinite...
