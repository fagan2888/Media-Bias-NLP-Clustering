Her personal history of what she describes, very provisionally, as a \u201cmystical\u201d experience is the subject of Ehrenreich\u2019s latest book, a memoir, \u201cLiving With a Wild God: A Nonbeliever\u2019s Search for the Truth About Everything.\u201d\n\nThe impetus for \u201cLiving With a Wild God\u201d came in 2001 while Ehrenreich, who at the time was undergoing treatment for breast cancer, assembled her papers for a university library that had offered to archive them. Among those documents was a collection of diary-like entries on loose sheets of paper, a journal of sorts, written between Ehrenreich\u2019s 14th and 24th birthdays. The chief subject \u2014 indeed, the very purpose \u2014 of the journal was not the usual stuff of adolescent preoccupations (crushes, fantasies, plans of future glory) but what the young Ehrenreich called \u201cthe situation.\u201d To whit: \u201cWhat is the point of our brief existence? What are we doing here and to what end?\u201d Raised in a stoutly atheist household, the young seeker wasn\u2019t about to opt for the \u201cready answers\u201d of established religion, particularly Christianity, which she saw as \u201d a kind of prefab metaphysics requiring no intellectual effort on the part of the user.\u201d She resolved to think it out.\n\nPerhaps the most humbling revelation in \u201cLiving With a Wild God\u201d (at least for some of us) is that even as a teenager and bearing her maiden name of Alexander, Barbara Ehrenreich was still \u2026 Barbara Ehrenreich: wicked smart, tough-minded, highly principled, independent and a gifted writer whose prose seamlessly fuses vigor and precision. \u201cThere are two things which need only to be announced to be destroyed,\u201d the young diner waitress once wrote of a particularly pious and annoying customer, \u201cand they are silence and virtue.\u201d From the age of 8, she had commanded herself to \u201cThink in complete sentences.\u201d\n\nWhile her father \u2014 a Montanan miner turned metallurgist turned businessman who blamed his family obligations for forcing him to renounce science \u2014 drank and her mother stewed with unrealized ambitions, the teenage Ehrenreich was filling pages with such rumination as \u201cAny thing which either perceives or is perceived exists and qualifies as Something. Just how much the perceived thing exists is very important to know but I don\u2019t see how I ever can. Therefore Nothing has to be just opposite of Something.\u201d She had, she writes, no idea \u201cthat a long line of grown-ups \u2014 generally male and wealthy or at least well financed by monarchs \u2014 had wrestled with the exact same questions that tormented me.\u201d Eventually she found her way to Dostoyevsky and Nietzsche, reliably troubling milestones in many a young person\u2019s quest for truth. Her pursuit of the ontological questions tormenting her culminated in the small California desert town of Lone Pine in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nEhrenreich, a friend and her brother had decided to spend the night in their car while returning from a skiing trip. She\u2019d eaten little and placed herself \u201cin the kind of condition that the Plains Indians sought in their vision quests \u2014 low on blood sugar, but high on the stress hormones engendered by sleep deprivation.\u201d On impulse, while her companions slept, Ehrenreich decided to go for a walk and as she wandered the deserted streets of Lone Pine, she was struck by an understanding that, she feels, beggars the descriptive power of language; fire is the operative metaphor in the long human history of such revelations. \u201cThere were no visions, no prophetic voices or visits by totemic animals, just this blazing everywhere. Something poured into me and I poured out into it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Celebrated author Barbara Ehrenreich recalls her strange, life-changing experience in a small desert town", "title": "An atheist\u2019s secret mysticism", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Celebrated author Barbara Ehrenreich recalls her strange, life-changing experience in a small desert town", "title": "An atheist\u2019s secret mysticism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/13/an_atheists_secret_mysticism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/barbara_ehrenreich3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Celebrated author Barbara Ehrenreich recalls her strange, life-changing experience in a small desert town", "title": "An atheist\u2019s secret mysticism", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/barbara_ehrenreich3.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barbara Ehrenreich, Books, Editor's Picks, Living with a wild god, Memoirs, Must-Do, Religion, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Just how much the perceived thing exists is very important to know but I don\u2019t see how I ever can.\nEhrenreich, a friend and her brother had decided to spend the night in their car while returning from a skiing trip.\n\u201cThere were no visions, no prophetic voices or visits by totemic animals, just this blazing everywhere.\nThe chief subject \u2014 indeed, the very purpose \u2014 of the journal was not the usual stuff of adolescent preoccupations (crushes, fantasies, plans of future glory) but what the young Ehrenreich called \u201cthe situation.\u201d To whit: \u201cWhat is the point of our brief existence?\nAmong those documents was a collection of diary-like entries on loose sheets of paper, a journal of sorts, written between Ehrenreich\u2019s 14th and 24th birthdays."}
