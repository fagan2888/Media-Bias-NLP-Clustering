The 3rd floor with the gabled roof burned and was never replaced (Photo: FILE PHOTO )Buy Photo\n\nThe school district\u2019s historic Church Street school was sold to the highest bidder at a public auction, officials have said.\n\nThe winning bid was made by Jemals Church Street, LLC.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens and dozens of inquiries and at least six bidders at the auction,\u201d said Bob Dann, chief of operations at Max Spann Real Estate & Auction Company, the auctioneer hired by the school district to sell the property.\n\nMORE: District has plans for old high school\n\nDann said the bidding started at $200,000 and within five minutes was sold at $550,000.\n\nAccording to the Board of Education, the school district has been trying to sell the old school property for about a decade, but buyers were hesitant because the building has an historic easement on it.\n\n\u201cThat was an issue. There are things you can\u2019t do it there. A developer can\u2019t knock it down and build townhouses, for example,\u201d said Lucille Perez, president of the city Board of Education.\n\nThe Church Street school was built in 1891 and is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nJemals Church Street, LLC signed the contract on Oct. 8, and has 45 days from that date to close on it, said Dann.\n\nThe school is 16,634 square feet and sits on about 1\u00bd acres.\n\nOne of the owners of Jemals Church Street, LLC, Douglass Jemal of Long Branch, bought and restored two former Takanassee Beach Club buildings, the Captain's House and Port Huron House.\n\nThe buildings are located at his home at 900 Ocean Ave.\n\nPerez said the school district could use the money for capital projects, but nothing formal has been brought before the school board yet. Superintendent Dr. Michael Salvatore said earlier this month if they sold the school they could use the money to help fun the renovation of the old Long Branch High School.\n\nThe total cost for that project is estimated to cost $11.5 million.\n\nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1wbqKgs", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Church Street School was built in 1891 and was sold at auction for $550,000", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Church Street School was built in 1891 and was sold at auction for $550,000", "title": "Long Branch sells historic Church Street school", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/eatontown-asbury-park/long-branch/2014/10/17/long-branch-church-street-school-sold/17458775/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Church Street School was built in 1891 and was sold at auction for $550,000", "title": "Long Branch Church Street School sold", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0eb67aeccb8eba5dce6815b99e5fcb47b682470e/c=152-0-872-720&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/10/17/churchstreet.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Historic photo of the old Church Street School.\nThe Church Street school was built in 1891 and is on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe 3rd floor with the gabled roof burned and was never replaced (Photo: FILE PHOTO )Buy PhotoThe school district\u2019s historic Church Street school was sold to the highest bidder at a public auction, officials have said.\nOne of the owners of Jemals Church Street, LLC, Douglass Jemal of Long Branch, bought and restored two former Takanassee Beach Club buildings, the Captain's House and Port Huron House.\nJemals Church Street, LLC signed the contract on Oct. 8, and has 45 days from that date to close on it, said Dann."}
