Over five million people \u2014 mostly poor people of color \u2014 will fall into a coverage gap in which they make too much money to qualify for public insurance through Medicaid, but too little to qualify for federal subsidies to help them purchase private insurance in the exchanges.\n\nTexas, which has the highest uninsured population in the nation, is home to the largest number of people in that gap. About one million low-income Texans won\u2019t have any access to affordable health coverage under Obamacare because of Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s (R) refusal to expand Medicaid, a bleak reality that forces some uninsured people to seek care across the border in Mexico. Now, at least some of those people are fighting back.\n\n\u201cTexas Left Me Out\u201d is a new campaign that\u2019s collecting stories from uninsured Texans, with the ultimate goal of pressuring state officials to start cooperating with health reform. \u201cSign our petition to tell elected officials to act so these Texans can get the health coverage they need,\u201d the site, which was built by Progress Texas and the Texas Research Institute, proclaims.\n\n\u201cWe launched the \u2018Texas Left Me Out Campaign\u2019 with a number of state-based health care nonprofits so that we can identify who falls into the coverage gap and motivate them to action,\u201d Phillip Martin, the Deputy Director at Progress Texas, explained to ThinkProgress. The campaign\u2019s purpose is two-fold: first, make sure that the Texans who are losing out on Medicaid coverage understand exactly who\u2019s to blame for that, and then, turn them into a political force to be reckoned with.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to mobilize them in the coming year so anyone who is denied health coverage can hold Greg Abbott and Rick Perry accountable,\u201d Martin said. \u201cMedicaid expansion is an electoral issue progressives can win with, even in Texas.\u201d\n\nIndeed, polling has found that Texans sharply disagree with their lawmakers\u2019 position on Medicaid. Two-thirds of Texas residents support the expansion of the public program, and a long list of organizations \u2014 including at least 18 Chambers of Commerce in the state \u2014 have also publicly come out in support of the policy. In March, more than a thousand people rallied at the state capitol building to push for expansion.\n\nAt an event in Dallas last month, President Obama urged Perry to reconsider his stance. If Texas agreed to expand Medicaid, the state could collect up to $100 billion in federal funds over the next decade to help finance it. But Texas officials, who have dug in their heels on every aspect of reform, haven\u2019t relented.\n\nSo Progress Texas and its nonprofit partners are planning to start an aggressive campaign to promote \u201cTexas Left Me Out,\u201d as well as a Spanish version of the site, in 2014. In addition to getting people mobilized to fight back against Texas\u2019 decision to reject Medicaid expansion, the websites also provide residents with information about the federal HealthCare.Gov site, which could still offer an avenue for coverage for those who can find a way to afford private insurance. They\u2019ll host community events, run online campaigns, and knock on doors to keep spreading the word about health care reform \u2014 and who\u2019s getting left behind.\n\nThe number of people in Texas who fall into the coverage gap certainly represent enough voters to sway an election. The National Memo points out that Perry won re-election by 631,178 votes in 2010.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that other states whose governors are refusing to expand Medicaid follow our model,\u201d Martin told ThinkProgress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Grassroots groups in Texas want to mobilize the low-income people who are locked out of Medicaid to push for political change.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Grassroots groups in Texas want to mobilize the low-income people who are locked out of Medicaid to push for political change.", "title": "\u2018Texas Left Me Out\u2019: How The Millions Of People Being Denied Medicaid Coverage Are Fighting Back", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/19/3091311/texas-left-medicaid/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/medicaid-texas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Grassroots groups in Texas want to mobilize the low-income people who are locked out of Medicaid to push for political change.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/medicaid-texas-321x214.jpg", "title": "\u2018Texas Left Me Out\u2019: How The Millions Of People Being Denied Medicaid Coverage Are Fighting Back", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/medicaid-texas.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/medicaid-texas.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-19T15:52:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb47\"", "article_summary": "The number of people in Texas who fall into the coverage gap certainly represent enough voters to sway an election.\nHealth \u2018Texas Left Me Out\u2019: How The Millions Of People Being Denied Medicaid Coverage Are Fighting Back CREDIT: AP Photo/Eric Gay Texans rally for Medicaid expansion at the state capitolThanks to the ongoing politicized fight over the health reform law, 23 states are refusing to accept Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program, a move that\u2019s ultimately denying health coverage to millions of the poorest Americans.\nSo Progress Texas and its nonprofit partners are planning to start an aggressive campaign to promote \u201cTexas Left Me Out,\u201d as well as a Spanish version of the site, in 2014.\n\u201cOur goal is to mobilize them in the coming year so anyone who is denied health coverage can hold Greg Abbott and Rick Perry accountable,\u201d Martin said.\nAbout one million low-income Texans won\u2019t have any access to affordable health coverage under Obamacare because of Gov."}
