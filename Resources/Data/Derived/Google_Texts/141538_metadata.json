It owes the Army rather less thanks for giving us a real-world example.\n\nIn Heller\u2019s tale, Catch-22 refers to a set of rules that exempt those who are insane from flying combat missions. But since any sane person wishes to avoid combat, those who feign insanity to get out of it cannot be insane: \u201cIf (Orr) flew them, he was crazy and didn\u2019t have to; but if he didn\u2019t want to, he was sane and had to.\u201d\n\nThe real-world equivalent of Orr is Iknoor Singh, a student at Hofstra and a devoted Sikh. In addition to English he speaks Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi, and wanted to join the school\u2019s ROTC program, in hopes of one day becoming a military intelligence officer.\n\nEnter the Army\u2019s regulations on grooming, which prohibit Singh\u2019s long hair, beard, and turban. Rather than ditch those emblems of his faith so he could join, Singh sought an exemption to the rules. He was refused. So he sued, claiming his rights under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act had been violated. A few days ago U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled in his favor.\n\nJackson noted that the Army has granted religious exemptions to other Sikhs, who have served with distinction. It also has granted exemptions to men who need to grow beards for medical reasons, and it has granted hundreds of thousands of exemptions for otherwise prohibited tattoos.\n\nLast August, Lt. Gen. James McConville explained to Singh\u2019s lawyers why Singh could not have an exemption: He could not \u201capprove or deny a waiver of Army uniform and grooming policy ... because prospective cadets, applicants, and enlistees are not subject to the Army\u2019s uniform and grooming policy.\u201d\n\nAs Judge Jackson wryly noted in her opinion, \u201cIn other words, the Army took the position that it was unable to consider (Singh\u2019s) request for a religious accommodation that would enable him to enroll in ROTC because (he) was not yet enrolled in ROTC.\u201d\n\nExactly. To be eligible for an exemption, Singh would have to dispose of his articles of religion\u2014which would make him ineligible for a religious exemption.\n\nThis would be little more than an amusing (except for Singh) tale except for one thing. Several times in her ruling in support of Singh, Jackson relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby. What\u2019s more, Singh was supported by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty\u2014which also fought on behalf of Hobby Lobby and is currently fighting a similar battle to help Little Sisters of the Poor avoid the contraceptive mandate as well.\n\nIn the Hobby Lobby case, the High Court said the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) inoculated the craft-store chain\u2019s owners from having to provide contraception coverage, as required by regulations promulgated under Obamacare. In Singh\u2019s case, as in Hobby Lobby\u2019s, the government had to show its requirement served a compelling interest, and that it did so in the least restrictive way possible.\n\nNo one disputes the Army\u2019s regulations serve a compelling interest. As McConville explained at great length, \u201cuniformity is central to the development of a bonded and effective fighting force.\u201d It is the \u201cprimary means by which we convert individuals into members of the Army.\u201d It \u201cpromotes cohesive bonds by instilling a common identity,\u201d shows \u201ca willingness to submit (one\u2019s) individuality to the larger organization\u201d as well as to \u201cinhibit personal desires and impulses that may be antithetical to mission accomplishment.\u201d Also, it provides \u201ca readily available means of instilling the practice of inspection and compliance\u201d and a means \u201cto assess a Soldier\u2019s competency and attention to detail.\u201d Such things are necessary to field a professional military capable of executing the federal government\u2019s most basic purpose: defending the nation.\n\nBut that still wasn\u2019t good enough, Jackson concluded. Because even though the Army\u2019s rules are rules of \u201cgeneral applicability,\u201d they need not obtain in Singh\u2019s specific instance\u2014particularly given the many other exceptions, religious and otherwise, the military has made over the years.\n\nWhat the Army was doing, she explained, was imposing a substantial burden on Singh as the price of his religious fidelity. A substantial burden exists when government puts \u201cpressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.\u201d\n\nThat is what Obamacare did to the owners of Hobby Lobby. And what others, including courts, have done in cases when various service providers\u2014such as photographers and bakers\u2014have declined to help facilitate gay weddings. Because RFRA applies only to federal action, and not the states, many states have considered their own religious-freedom measures. Nineteen states already have measures equivalent to RFRA, but those introduced more recently have elicited great fury because they are such obvious reactions to the growing acceptance of gay marriage. The other day North Carolina lawmakers overruled Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s veto and enacted a measure that lets state magistrates decline to perform a marriage if they have sincere religious objections.\n\nOne response to the religious objections of devout Christians has been breezy dismissal: If you don\u2019t want to photograph gay weddings, then you shouldn\u2019t become a photographer. Don\u2019t want to pay for contraceptive coverage? Don\u2019t become an employer.\n\nArguments like that force people into an untenable choice: Give up your religion, or give up your vocation (which, along with faith and background, is one of the principal ways people define themselves). By the same token, the Army essentially said the same to Iknoor Singh: You can have your faith or you can have an ROTC commission, but not both. Take your pick.\n\nSociety also could impose a similar choice on, say, doctors who object to lecturing abortion-seeking women about fetal development. Last year the Richmond-based Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a North Carolina (again!) law requiring physicians to do just that while showing the women sonograms of their unborn children.\n\nCommendably, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson and his colleagues ruled that such compelled speech violates a doctor\u2019s rights under the First Amendment. But they could have offered the take-it-or-leave-it rejoinder: Don\u2019t like narrating ultrasounds? Don\u2019t become a doctor.\n\nIndividual rights\u2014whether to religious freedom or to freedom of speech\u2014deserve more dignity and decency than that. Weighed against compelling governmental interests, they still might sometimes lose. But at the very least, freedom deserves a respectful hearing for all who seek it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The case of Iknoor Singh highlights the importance of protecting religious freedom.", "title": "The Case for Religious Liberty", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/06/22/the-case-for-religious-liberty", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14349882821224.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14349882821224.jpg", "description": "The case of Iknoor Singh highlights the importance of protecting religious freedom.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Case for Religious Liberty"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Civil Liberties", "published_time": "2015-06-22T16:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/a-barton-hinkle"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Individual rights\u2014whether to religious freedom or to freedom of speech\u2014deserve more dignity and decency than that.\nSo he sued, claiming his rights under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act had been violated.\nIn the Hobby Lobby case, the High Court said the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) inoculated the craft-store chain\u2019s owners from having to provide contraception coverage, as required by regulations promulgated under Obamacare.\nSeveral times in her ruling in support of Singh, Jackson relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby.\nJackson noted that the Army has granted religious exemptions to other Sikhs, who have served with distinction."}
