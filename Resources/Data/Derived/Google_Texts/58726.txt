In a White House meeting Tuesday, President Obama will try to recruit Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to pressure the Castro regime in Cuba for democratic reforms.

The talks between the two leaders come less than a month since Mr. Obama announced plans to normalize diplomatic relations with Havana, reversing more than 50 years of U.S. policy.

“The leaders will discuss our new approach to Cuba, which will create opportunities for us to work together with key partners like Mexico to encourage positive change in Cuba and reinforce democratic principles,” a senior administration official said.

Mr. Obama has said the previous U.S. policy toward Cuba damaged relations with other Latin American countries, and that his push for more cordial relations with the Castro regime would encourage other countries in the region to work with the U.S. to reform the Communist nation.

The administration official said the White House also is seeking support from other Latin American leaders to lobby Cuba to improve human rights and allow greater freedom for its citizens. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Recognition said in a report Monday that Cuba arrested about 100 more dissidents in December compared to November, the month before Mr. Obama’s announcement.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said improving human rights in Cuba is “a critical focus” of the administration’s proposal.

“We know that the situation in Cuba remains poor,” she said.

Mexico has maintained diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba, while the U.S. imposed an embargo after Fidel Castro seized power in the early 1960s. Mr. Castro’s brother, Raul, is now president.

Mr. Peña Nieto has traveled to Havana to meet with the Castros, and the Mexican government has waived most of Cuba’s trade debt.
