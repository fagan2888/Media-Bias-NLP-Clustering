Marco Rubio inserted language into the omnibus spending bill which specifically barred the Department of Health and Human Services from dipping into the general funds of the Treasury to bailout failing insurance companies, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMarc Thiessen, writing for the Post, observed that the provision is \u201cquietly killing\u201d Obamacare, while the New York Times headlined in December, \u201cMarco Rubio Quietly Undermines Affordable Care Act.\u201d The Hill called the provision, \u201cthe biggest blow in the GOP\u2019s five-year war against Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nBoth the Post and the Times pointed out that private insurers have been taking heavy losses participating in the healthcare exchanges, and to entice them to stay, the Obama administration had been subsidizing the companies with taxpayer dollars.\n\nAccording to the Times, in 2014 \u201cinsurers lost $2.9 billion more than expected on Obamacare\u2026Thanks to Rubio\u2019s provision, the administration was allowed to pay only 13 cents of every dollar insurers requested. Without the taxpayer bailouts, more than half of the Obamacare insurance cooperatives created under the law failed.\u201d\n\nSeveral insurers have pulled out of the remaining exchanges. United Healthcare and Aetna, two of the nation\u2019s largest providers, have indicated they are considering pulling out of Obamacare altogether, due to the billions in losses they have sustained.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nAs a means of mitigating the disastrous financial impact of the law on insurers, the Obama administration announced earlier this month it will hand out $7.7 billion to companies from fees collected through the ACA. The only problem is $2 billion of that money is supposed to go the Treasury\u2019s general funds.\n\nDoug Badger, a senior fellow with the Galen Institute, writes the \u201creinsurance fee\u201d is $107 for every man, woman and child with a private health plan, which adds up to billions in collections each year.\n\n\u201cThe law states a fixed share \u2018shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used\u2019 to offset insurance companies\u2019 losses. But the administration gave all of it to the insurance companies last year, and got away with that heist. So they\u2019re trying it again,\u201d Betsy McCaughey wrote in Investors Business Daily.\n\nAccording to Badger, the amount the Treasury is supposed to receive \u2014 but won\u2019t because the Obama administration directed it be paid to private insurers \u2014 is $3.5 billion over the two years.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe Daily Signal reported Thursday that the House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating the multi-billion dollar transfer of taxpayer money.\n\n\u201c[Earlier this month], the administration announced that they would be using billions of taxpayer dollars to make payments to insurance companies under the Obamacare reinsurance program,\u201d Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Penn., a member of the committee said Wednesday during a hearing with Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell. \u201cThe announcement that the administration made represents an illegal wealth transfer from hardworking taxpayers to insurers.\u201d\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee has also taken up the issue. Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas; Subcommittee on Oversight Chairman Peter Roskam, R-Ill.; and Subcommittee on Health Chairman Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, asked Burwell for documents related to the reinsurance program in a letter sent Feb. 9.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the administration has illegally diverted funds from the U.S. Treasury to fund the transitional reinsurance program established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\u201d they wrote. \u201cNot only is this diversion inconsistent with past policies promulgated by the administration but it is incompatible with clear congressional instructions contained within the ACA. We ask that HHS immediately submit to the Treasury all diverted funds.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s diversion of funds is just the latest example of changing provisions of ACA without congressional approval. Other instances included delaying implementation of the employer mandate twice, delaying the individual mandate for two years, and not creating a means to adequately verify whether those signing up were actually eligible for health care subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest example of Obama trying to change the ACA without Congress.", "author": "Randy DeSoto", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "The latest example of Obama trying to change the ACA without Congress.", "title": "Exposed: Obama Admin Caught Making Illegal Move That Makes ObamaCare Look Even Worse", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Obamacare-signed-by-Obama-e1456440626872.jpg", "height": 614}, "updated_time": "2016-02-27T07:53:47-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/exposed-obama-admin-caught-making-illegal-move-that-makes-obamacare-look-even-worse/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest example of Obama trying to change the ACA without Congress.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Obamacare-signed-by-Obama-e1456440626872.jpg", "title": "Exposed: Obama Admin Caught Making Illegal Move That Makes ObamaCare Look Even Worse", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-25T15:52:31-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2016-02-25T15:52:31-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-27T07:53:47-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "obama, obamacare, diverting funds, billions, illegally, congress, health, marco rubio, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "But the administration gave all of it to the insurance companies last year, and got away with that heist.\nWithout the taxpayer bailouts, more than half of the Obamacare insurance cooperatives created under the law failed.\u201dSeveral insurers have pulled out of the remaining exchanges.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowThe Obama administration has been caught \u2014 once again \u2014 seeking to circumvent the law related to Obamacare by diverting billions in funds intended for the U.S. Treasury to cover private insurance companies\u2019 losses.\n\u201cThe law states a fixed share \u2018shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used\u2019 to offset insurance companies\u2019 losses.\nAccording to Badger, the amount the Treasury is supposed to receive \u2014 but won\u2019t because the Obama administration directed it be paid to private insurers \u2014 is $3.5 billion over the two years."}
