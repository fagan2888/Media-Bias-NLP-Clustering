But he really needed a CD.\n\nA freshman girl he had a huge crush on had asked if she could take one of his demos home with her over the holiday break, but he was 100-percent sure he had given them all away. Rummaging around his bedroom in a near full sweat, he finally found one, pressed up against the wall underneath his bed, and ran back to the party to hand it to her.\n\n\u201cI thought, here is this girl, she\u2019s leaving tomorrow for a month, and she wants to take my music with her,\u201d Brandon says. \u201cAs a musician, that\u2019s flattering, but as a guy who has a crush on her\u2026\u201d\n\nThe freshman girl turned out to be a fellow voice major Jamelle Mallon. They went on a first date when they returned to school in January, and immediately bonded over a shared love of music and childhoods spent singing in school and church choirs. They were married less than three years later.\n\nNext week the two of them, who have spent their entire careers post-college supporting other country music artists\u2019 visions (her, as a backup singer for Carrie Underwood; him, touring with Gretchen Wilson and Danny Gokey), will host a listening party where they will debut their first EP as duo \u201cTwo Story Road.\u201d A release date for the record is yet to be set. It marks the end of their days spent on other artists\u2019 time, and the beginning of an all-consuming, honest shot at the American Dream.\n\n\u201cTwo Story Road means two stories, finally going down one road, together,\u201d Brandon says.\n\nSchool of Rock\n\nDespite their big-city chops, Brandon and Jamelle Fraley were born in Sylvania, Ohio and Chester, Va. respectively. Both knew early on that music was their calling. (Jamelle, who idolized power singers like Martina McBride and Celine Dion, remembers being told by her choir teacher that she\u2019d be \u201cbig time\u201d at a relatively young age.)\n\nThe two chose to attend Belmont\u2014a Christian university ranked by Time and Rolling Stone as one of the nation\u2019s best \u201cmusic business schools\u201d\u2014for both the music program and the school\u2019s proximity to the famed Music Row.\n\nFor his part, Brandon, who sings in addition to playing the guitar and piano, insists he was hyper-focused on musical development and not at all interested in dating\u2014until he met vocalist Jamelle, who he calls \u201cJamie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have Nashville to thank for our paths crossing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been blessed to have two seats on what has been a musical roller coaster ever since.\u201d\n\nThough they\u2019d moved to Music City with the hopes of becoming solo artists, their talents initially caught the eyes of executives who had other ideas: One took note of Brandon\u2019s songwriting, and helped him sign a songwriting deal with Sony Music Publishing right out of school. Meanwhile, a Grammy winning writer and producer heard Jamelle sing and began pulling her into the studio for assistance on various records he was working on.\n\nOver time, the Fraleys found themselves working with bigger and bigger names in country music. In 2010, Brandon became the band leader for singer and former church music director Danny Gokey, of American Idol fame, and found himself on stage with acts like Tim McGraw and Taylor Swift. In 2008, Jamelle landed the deal with Underwood and began a five-year stint touring with her.\n\nCombined, they\u2019ve played over 1,000 shows, including more than 100 at the famed Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, and have performed at almost every TV and award show there is. Content to stand off to the side while crowds cheered on the headliner, the couple is quick to acknowledge that standing in the shadows isn\u2019t without merit.\n\n\u201cWe were touring the globe doing country music. The amazing artists [we\u2019ve worked with] led by example and we paid attention to every detail,\u201d Jamelle says. \u201cTo be around someone like a Carrie Underwood and watch all the hard work she put into every day \u2026 was simply invaluable. To go on a 100-city radio tour with Danny Gokey and see what it takes to launch a single is something you can\u2019t teach.\u201d\n\nAll Roads Lead Home\n\nTheir immense success touring ultimately led to a tough decision in early 2011.\n\n\u201c2010 was rough,\u201d Jamelle says. \u201cBrandon did over 120 shows with Danny and I did over 150 with Carrie. We figured out at the end of the year that I had spent only about 12 nights in my own house the whole 12 months.\u201d\n\nThey decided it was time to take their talents off the road\u2014and to take a shot at fulfilling a longtime dream\u2014together.\n\n\u201cWe both had an ear for harmony and we loved singing together every chance we got,\u201d Brandon says. \u201cForming a duo just made sense.\u201d\n\nThey each finished out their tour commitments and\u2014with the blessing of their former bosses\u2014stepped down to focus on Two Story Road full time.\n\nIt\u2019s been a humbling experience for the Fraleys, who recount what it was like to have their iPhones autocorrect \u201cTwo Story Road\u201d to \u201cTwo Story Toad\u201d for \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t believe how long.\u201d\n\nFor the past few years, they\u2019ve spent nearly every minute together (\u201cThe only thing we do separate from one another is exercise,\u201d Brandon says, adding that they\u2019ll still text throughout if there is something important going on). The focus has been on writing, recording, forming a fan-base of \u201cRoadies,\u201d and honing a sound that\u2019s all their own.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that we still have to pinch ourselves over is the group of fans that we have somehow acquired,\u201d Brandon says. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but smile when you see friendships that have formed through a mutual love of our music. That\u2019s some feels right there.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve also worked with some of Nashville\u2019s biggest names to complete the six-track EP they\u2019re previewing for fans at a listening party at Nashville\u2019s Country Music Association (CMA) Fest. Mark Bright, the man behind big names like Luke Bryan and Rascal Flatts produced the disc.\n\nWatching the two perform, a string of songs punctuated by adoring banter, it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re pros, and genuinely very in love. When Brandon tells the story of writing a love song called \u201cBetter When You\u2019re Home\u201d while Jamelle was away on tour, it\u2019s hard not to eat it up.\n\nThe Fraleys also very visibly complement one another. While Brandon assumes the role of leader and charismatic storyteller with the audience, Jamelle shines as a vocal powerhouse. They seem perfectly positioned for success as one of very few modern couples-turned-musical duos in the music world.\n\n\u201cAbove all, we want to truly see how far this road can take us,\u201d Brandon says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Husband and wife musical duo Brandon and Jamelle Fraley are putting their years as backups for Carrie Underwood and Danny Gokey behind them.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Husband and wife musical duo Brandon and Jamelle Fraley are putting their years as backups for Carrie Underwood and Danny Gokey behind them.", "title": "Two of Country Music\u2019s Finest Backups Take Center Stage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TSR_feature.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-09T17:05:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1dMRiAN"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Husband and wife musical duo Brandon and Jamelle Fraley are putting their years as backups for Carrie Underwood and Danny Gokey behind them.", "title": "Two of Country Music\u2019s Finest Backups Take Center Stage", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TSR_feature.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream,Marriage & Family,society", "published_time": "2015-06-06T03:01:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-09T17:05:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Two Story Road, country music, Nashville, Brandon Fraley, Jamelle Fraley"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3899\"", "article_summary": "Over time, the Fraleys found themselves working with bigger and bigger names in country music.\n\u201cWe were touring the globe doing country music.\nSchool of RockDespite their big-city chops, Brandon and Jamelle Fraley were born in Sylvania, Ohio and Chester, Va. respectively.\nThat\u2019s some feels right there.\u201dThey\u2019ve also worked with some of Nashville\u2019s biggest names to complete the six-track EP they\u2019re previewing for fans at a listening party at Nashville\u2019s Country Music Association (CMA) Fest.\n\u201cTwo Story Road means two stories, finally going down one road, together,\u201d Brandon says."}
