There\u2019s plenty of speculation, ranging from no big deal to absolute, total catastrophe.\n\nAn article published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine tries to answer the question with a little bit more precision. It\u2019s conclusion, however, is that disallowing those subsidies would be a devastating blow to ObamaCare.\n\nThe case \u2014 King v Burwell \u2014 centers on language in the statute which says that federal tax subsidies meant to offset the cost of ObamaCare insurance can only be provided through state-run exchanges. The plaintiffs in the case make a strong argument that the law is pretty clear on this.\n\nAt the very least, the fact that the court decided to take the case before there was a split ruling at the appellate level suggests that they aren\u2019t nearly as dismissive of this challenge as those on the left were.\n\nAuthors Nicholas Bagley, David Jones and Timothy Jost \u2014 who are with the University of Michigan Law School, Boston University Public Health, and Washington and Lee University School of Law respectively \u2014 say that anyone who thinks the Obama administration can simply wave its executive order wand and make such a ruling go away is deluding themselves.\n\n\u201cACA supporters,\u201d the authors say, \u201chave good reason to worry.\u201d\n\nThe loss of tax subsidies in dozens of states that refused to set up their own ObamaCare exchanges would, the authors say, cause \u201cimmediate destabilization of its insurance market.\u201d\n\nAnd the ideas being floated to sidestep such a court ruling don\u2019t stand up to much scrutiny. Besides, the authors say, \u201cany attempt to work around King is sure to face legal challenges, which would introduce additional uncertainty and delay.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the authors argue, the fate of \u201cmillions of people\u201d and their ability to \u201ccontinue to have access to affordable, comprehensive health insurance\u201d stands in the balance.\n\nBut that last point presupposes that ObamaCare actually is providing access to affordable care. Catherine Keefe, writing in the Washington Post, would disagree. She says that, although she was a big Obama supporter, ObamaCare has \u201churt my family.\u201d\n\nTheir premiums went up \u2014 $121 a month for her, $82 for her husband \u2014 and the new plans exposed them to bigger out-of-pocket costs. They also couldn\u2019t keep their doctors, and if they keep their current ObamaCare plans next year, their premiums will shoot up another $95 a month.\n\nThere are many other health reform ideas out there besides ObamaCare that don\u2019t need a trillion dollars and actually would reduce health insurance costs. If the Supreme Court strikes down the federal exchange subsidies next summer and ObamaCare unravels, it might just provide the newly minted Republican majority in Congress the chance to get them enacted.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline", "article_metadata": {"description": "What would happen if the Supreme Court rules that ObamaCare doesn't allow subsidies through the federal exchange?
