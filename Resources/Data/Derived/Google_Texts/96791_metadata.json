He may have received bad intel from a key military command that might have embellished progress in the campaign against ISIS.\n\nThe investigation by the Pentagon inspector general was first disclosed by The New York Times and agency officials have since confirmed the probe\u2019s existence. The inquiry was launched after an analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) came forward claiming officials at U.S. Central Command, which oversees the fight against the terror group, altered intelligence assessments before they reached leaders in Washington, including President Obama.\n\nRelated: ISIS Fight, Iran Deal Sink Obama\u2019s Numbers\n\nA disagreement within the intelligence community is nothing new, one only need look at the ongoing dust-up between the State Department and others over the degree of classification of messages from Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal email server. But the results of the IG probe, either way, will provide fresh ammunition for both supporters and opponents of the anti-ISIS campaign.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have debated for roughly a year now whether the president\u2019s airpower-heavy strategy has degraded the extremist group or hasn\u2019t gone far enough or if U.S. grounds troops should be deployed to take back large swaths of territory inside Iraq and Syria.\n\nTheir arguments have grown more heated as other parts of the administration\u2019s strategy, namely training and equipping moderate Syrian rebels to take on ISIS inside that country, have faltered.\n\nEarlier this month, a defense official told the Associated Press that the intelligence community recently concluded that despite hitting Islamic State forces with over 5,500 airstrikes, the group\u2019s strength remains between 20,000 and 30,000 fighters.\n\nRelated: More Than 5,000 Airstrikes and ISIS Is as Strong as Ever\n\nAsked about the IG investigation on Wednesday, the White House responded with praise for the intelligence community. The \u201cpresident's expectation is that his national security team will work diligently to get information to him and other members of the team that reflects an accurate assessment of what\u2019s exactly happening on the ground,\u201d Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during a briefing.\n\nHe later added, \u201cThe president does have confidence that that's what he\u2019s receiving [because the] intelligence community has placed a priority in trying to get a variety of viewpoints when offering up their analysis\u201d of the campaign.\n\nDisagreement over a military effort\u2019s progress is \u201cnot an unprecedented kind of thing\u201d but if the DIA\u2019s allegation is proven, it will undermine any future assessments by Central Command, said Jeffrey White, defense fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nWhite said investigators could ultimately chalk up the claim to an \u201canalytic disagreement\u201d between DIA and Central Command or they might discover something more serious. \u201cThe impact will be stronger at a bureaucratic level depending on how high up you get,\u201d according to White, who worked at the DIA for 34 years.\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Calls for Troops on the Ground to Break ISIS Stalemate\n\n\u201cA lieutenant colonel can be sacrificed,\u201d but if it\u2019s found a general officer distorted the numbers to the command\u2019s advantage that\u2019s a \u201cmuch more serious problem,\u201d he added.\n\nCentral Command spokesperson Sheryl Lawry said in a statement that they welcome the IG\u2019s independent oversight. She said while the command \u201ccannot comment on ongoing investigations, we can speak to the process and about the valued contributions of the Intelligence Community (IC).\u201d Lawry noted that members of the community are typically able to comment on any draft assessments.\n\n\u201cIt is ultimately up to the primary agency or organization whether or not they incorporate any recommended changes or additions. Further, the multi-source nature of our assessment process purposely guards against any single report or opinion unduly influencing leaders and decision-makers,\u201d she said.\n\nThe administration maintains it has the right strategy for countering ISIS, even though Earnest conceded, \u201cThe president has described this as a campaign that is likely be marked by periods of progress and periods of setback.\u201d He then rattled off a series of important gains, such as intelligence estimates that ISIS has lost 30 percent of the territory it once held.\n\nEarnest also touted that nearly 6,400 airstrikes have been conducted against the group, including one that recently killed the network\u2019s second-in-command, and the Pentagon\u2019s effort to train Iraqi security forces to battle militants.\n\nThough on that last score, he said, \u201cThere's no denying that -- that there's a lot more work to be done in this area.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama might be as confused about the U.S. military\u2019s success against ISIS as the American people are.
