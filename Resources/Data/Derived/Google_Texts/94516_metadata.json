Like many vulnerable Democrats, Sen. Kay Hagan has put a good deal of effort in distancing herself from Obama and his policies. In fact on hearing of the president\u2019s visit Hagan blasted Obama over the Veterans Affairs medical treatment scandal saying his administration \u201chas not yet done enough to earn the lasting trust of our veterans and implement real and permanent reforms at the VA.\u201d And like other Senators trying to hold on to their seats in November, Hagan doesn\u2019t seem too keen on doing cozy photo ops with her party\u2019s standard bearer. As AP reports: \u201cHagan was scheduled to speak to the American Legion too, but her spokeswoman declined to say whether she would appear on stage with the president.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Tepid Tar Heel greeting - WaPo: \u201cWhen President Obama arrives in North Carolina today, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) will be there to greet him on the tarmac\u2026Obama\u2019s approval rating is a paltry 45 percent in North Carolina, according to a recent USA Today/Suffolk University survey, which showed Hagan and[Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis] neck and neck.\u201d]\n\n\n\nPen wielding - Washington Examiner: \u201cThe president will announce executive initiatives that automatically enroll those receiving mental health services through the Defense Department into similar Department of Veterans Affairs programs, expand mental health peer support for veterans being treated in primary care settings and invest nearly $115 million in suicide prevention and treatment of diseases like post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d\n\n\n\nOBAMA MAY GO IT ALONE IN SYRIA\n\nJust last year President Obama punted to Congress for authority to launch punitive airstrikes against the regime of Bashar Al-Assad over the use of chemical weapons. Now, the president is struggling with the consequences of past inaction \u2013 deciding whether to order strikes in Syria against the Assad\u2019s enemy, the Islamist extremist group ISIS \u2013 with the White House signaling it may bypass Congress. Surveillance drones are already flying over the country, a move that could presage airstrikes. While it remains unclear if Obama will order the expanded bombing, the administration\u2019s mixed-messages on the threat posed by the terror group can\u2019t be helping members of the president\u2019s party. On Monday one Democratic senator said the White House lacks the authority to go it alone. And with Obama\u2019s foreign policy ratings in the basement, a battle over congressional authorization would put even more pressure on vulnerable Democrats with just seventy days to go to the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nA tickling, that\u2019s too little too late - Daily Beast: \u201cFor the Free Syrian Army, the Obama administration\u2019s recent bluster about possibly using U.S. military force to strike ISIS inside Syria is too little, too late. On the one hand, moderate rebels say they can\u2019t prepare for U.S. military intervention in Syria because they don\u2019t have confidence President Obama will make good on his threat. On the other hand, if Obama does expand the U.S. air war against ISIS into Syria without a real plan to combat it on the ground, the American intervention will do more harm than good\u2026 \u2018Airstrikes against ISIS inside Syria will not be helpful. Airstrikes will not get rid of ISIS. Airstrikes are like just tickling ISIS,\u2019 Hussam Al Marie, the spokesman for the FSA in northern Syria, told The Daily Beast. \u201cISIS is not a real state that you can attack and destroy; they are thugs who are spread all over the east of Syria in the desert. And when they are in the cities, they are using civilian buildings. So airstrikes will not be enough to get rid of these terrorists and at the same time, they might hit civilians. That\u2019s the problem.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel examines if Congress will give President Obama the authority to launch airstrikes against ISIS by providing funding.]\n\n\n\nWATCHDOG: LOST LERNER E-MAILS LIKELY STILL EXIST\n\nWhile administration and IRS officials have repeatedly claimed e-mails of the former official tied to the targeting of conservative groups have been lost, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch tells Fox News the Department of Justice has suggested the \u201clost\u201d e-mails may still exist on backup computers. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says DOJ attorneys told him the federal government backs up all computer records to ensure the continuity of government in event of a catastrophe. They told him that retrieving the emails from Lois Lerner would be \u201ctoo onerous\u201d - a legal burden that can exempt an agency from complying with FOIA requests. An administration official pushed back saying, \u201c There was no new back-up system described last week to Judicial Watch. Government lawyers who spoke to Judicial Watch simply referred to the same email retention policy that Commissioner [John Koskinen] had described in his Congressional testimony.\u201d\n\n\n\nCompromising - Fox News: \u201cHouse Republicans are calling on the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel for its probe into the IRS targeting scandal, claiming new evidence shows the investigation is \u2018compromised\u2019 due to multiple instances of conflict of interest. One example, according to House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Jim Jordan, involved a DOJ attorney representing the IRS in litigation relating to the scandal who used to work for the IRS and was involved in the targeting\u2026 The lawmakers also claim that a DOJ employee in the Office of Legislative Affairs maintained a close relationship with [Lois Lerner], and has worked to fundraise for Democratic candidates.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE OBAMACARE TAXMAN COMETH\n\nDaily Caller: \u201cAmericans who underestimated their income for 2014 when they applied for health insurance might see their tax refund reduced or eliminated completely\u2026 The Obama administration is warning taxpayers that they need to provide updates about changes in income\u2026 Taxpayers who make use of tax credits to help pay health insurance premiums are at serious risk, since if income increases unexpectedly during the year, the tax credit could not only dry up completely, but instead reverse, leaving taxpayers with an additional bill. In response to the confusion, the IRS is working on new tax forms to help facilitate insurance tax credits, but experts are finding that the forms will likely only make an already complex process even more convoluted.\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nIf you have ever answered your phone instead of turning off your alarm in the morning, you are not alone. Displays of confusion or odd behavior, known as sleep drunkenness, are more prevalent than previously thought according to a new study. New York Magazine\u2019s Melissa Dahl explains: \u201cOther common examples are that foggy feeling you get when you first wake up with a start on a Saturday before realizing it\u2019s the weekend, or when you wake up in a hotel room and can\u2019t immediately figure out where you are. For most people, and especially if this only happens to you every once in a while, it\u2019s nothing to worry about. But for people who experience sleep drunkenness once a week or more, it could signal an undiagnosed sleep disorder. It could also be a sign of sleep deprivation, as these episodes were more common in people who\u2019d had several nights with less than six hours of sleep in the last week. Or it could be that you\u2019re getting too much sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Should Maness manage to peel away double-digit support it could prove problematic for establishment candidate Cassidy as he seeks to top the 50 percent support threshold necessary to prevent a runoff election. Maness\u2019 support from conservative groups like SCF and conservative leaders like Tony Perkins and former Gov. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska, along with any financial boost Maness gets from these groups could further complicate matters for Cassidy.\n\n\n\nPOLL: NUNN LEADS IN PEACH STATE\n\nIn the latest WSB/Landmark poll Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn leads Republican David Perdue 47 percent to 40 percent. The Real Clear Politics average for the race give Perdue a 4.2 percent advantage and Republicans point to a similar WSB poll giving Republican Jack Kingston a seven point advantage ahead of their July runoff in which Perdue prevailed.\n\n\n\nKENTUCKY DEBATE CRASHES OVER FORMAT CLASH\n\nLouisville, Ky., Courier-Journal: \u201cCentre College announced Monday that it is cancelling its plans to host a U.S. Senate debate between [Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.] and [Democrat] Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes because they can't agree on a format\u2026 McConnell had previously said he would attend only debates that were done in the Lincoln-Douglas format, without a moderator asking questions and without an audience in the room. Centre's original plan was to hold the debate in the 1,470-seat Norton Center for the Arts.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has launched a digital attack against Senate Minority Leader McConnell tying him to last fall\u2019s government shutdown.]\n\n\n\nNEW MEXICO GOP USES FOLEY KILLER IMAGE IN AD\n\nSen. Tom Udall\u2019s, D-N.M., Republican opponent Allen Weh and the state\u2019s GOP are under fire for using images of the masked man who killed American journalist James Foley in its latest ad. The ad does not include Foley, but briefly features his assassin followed by video of President Obama golfing interspersed between news reports tying Udall to the presidents low approval ratings on foreign policy.\n\n\n\nTOO LITTLE TOO LATE FOR MCDANIEL?\n\nWashington Examiner: \u201cChris McDaniel will finally get his day in court, but it may already be too late. The Mississippi state senator, who lost a Republican primary runoff to Sen. Thad Cochran in late June, will get a hearing on his legal challenge on Sept. 20 \u2014 just four days before absentee voting begins in the general election. With arguments scheduled to run through Oct. 6, that suggests McDaniel\u2019s chances of winning a decision that resulted in a new runoff campaign \u2014 or even being named the GOP nominee in place of Cochran \u2014 are slim.\u201d\n\n\n\nPICK SIX: PLUS TWO\n\nMany Fox News First readers have already sounded off about which six seats Republicans could pick up to win back control of the Senate from Democrats. So which seats do readers think are most likely to flip from blue to red? The current consensus is: Arkansas (13.6%), Montana (12.1%), Louisiana (11.5%), West Virginia (11.3%), South Dakota (10.9%) and North Carolina (9.6%). Reader Carole McMeel of Plano, Texas is confident the Red Team will \u201cwin more than six\u201d and predicts Republicans \u201cwill pick up at least 8.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Ed Note: According to our reader consensus, Alaska (8.7%), Iowa (4.8%) would make it eight.]\n\n\n\nShare your top six picks.

Arizona, Florida and Vermont hold primaries and in Oklahoma, a runoff. Here are the highlights.\n\n\n\nArizona: ObamaCare battle - Nearly a half-dozen candidates are vying to succeed Gov. Jan Brewer, R-Ariz., in a battle pitting those who supported Brewer\u2019s Medicaid expansion against those who bucked the governor. Mixed polling has shown former Cold Stone CEO Doug Ducey, who opposes the ObamaCare expansion, ahead of the pack. Brewer has endorsed former Mesa Mayor Scott Smith.\n\n\n\n[In the Democratic primary to determine Rep. Ed Pastor\u2019s, D-Ariz., successor, Democrats are split along generational lines as longtime Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox takes on former two-term state Rep. Ruben Gallego.]\n\n\n\n[Polls close in Arizona at 10 pm ET. For results: Ariz. Secretary of State]\n\n\n\nFlorida: Crist the chameleon - A Republican-turned-independent who then became a Democrat in 2012, former Florida Governor Charlie Crist is expected to win the Sunshine State\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary over Nan Rich. However, if Rich can muster more than 25 percent it could signal Florida Democrats are not totally sold on Crist\u2019s conversion.\n\n\n\n[Polls close in Florida at 8:00 pm ET. For results: Florida Division of Elections]\n\n\n\nOklahoma runoff: Sooner to face the music - Oklahoma Democrats will choose their Senate nominee in a runoff, with state Sen. Connie Johnson expected to best perennial candidate Jim Rogers. The winner is expected to face an uphill battle against Rep. James Lankford, R-Okla., for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Tom Coburn.\n\n\n\n[Polls in Oklahoma close at 8 pm ET. For results: The Okla., State Board of Elections]\n\n\n\nVermont - Republican Voters will decide which candidate will take on two-term incumbent Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin. The winner face a tough slog against Shumlin, who has a cash advantage, better name recognition and a more robust political machine behind him. Still, after four years in office, Shumlin has been taking hits over his handling of the state\u2019s new health-insurance exchange and his efforts for a government-financed health coverage system. Businessman Scott Milne has the support of the state\u2019s GOP establishment but faces Libertarian Dan Feliciano, a Libertarian, whose write-in campaign has been gaining momentum.\n\n\n\n[Polls in Vermont close at 8 pm ET. For Vermont results: Vt., Secretary of State]\n\n\n\nPRO-WARREN GROUP PUSHING \u2018FULL STEAM AHEAD\u2019\n\nAlthough liberal darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has formally disavowed a group urging her to compete against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in 2016, the group is not backing down. Despite Warren\u2019s lawyers warning the Federal Elections Commission the group could confuse donors,Erica Sagrans, campaign manager for Ready for Warren, said in a statement the group plans to move \u201cfull steam ahead\u201d with its campaign to draft Warren for 2016.\n\n\n\nWarren\u2019s home state is ready for Hillary - A new Suffolk University/Boston Herald poll finds Massachusetts voters favor Hillary Clinton over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., 55 percent to 17 percent.\n\n\n\nPERRY SAILS ON TO SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nGov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, is not letting allegations of abuses of power stop his whirlwind tour of early primary states. Perry will headline a fundraiser for South Carolina State Representative Kirkman Finlay Thursday.\n\n\n\nSANDERS SETTING SIGHTS ON 2016?\n\nBurlington Vt., Free-Press: \u201cSen. Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.] is headed back to two key presidential-priming states this week and next month. The independent, who is considering a run for president in the Democratic primary in 2016, is due in South Carolina on Thursday, sandwiched between stops in North Carolina the day before and Mississippi the day after. He has titled the tour \u2018The Fight for Economic Justice.\u2019 Sanders is then scheduled to take a trip to Iowa from Sept. 13-14 with stops in Dubuque, Des Moines and Waterloo.\u201d\n\n\n\nHE\u2019S NOT OLD NEWS\n\nHe may be 100 years old but Walter Sharp is making sure residents of the Central Lowlands of Scotland stay on top of the news. The Scotsman reports Walter, who was born just three days after the start of the Great War and survived the D-Day landings during WWII still wakes up each morning at 6:30 to deliver newspapers. Walter\u2019s son Brian believes his Dad may be the world\u2019s oldest paperboy. Sharp started the job after retiring from an iron foundry 35 years ago. Despite having to take heart and blood pressure tablets to keep him ticking along, Walter, along with his West Highland terrier, Harry, brave the elements to complete their appointed rounds. \u201cIf you keep walking you\u2019ll keep living,\u201d says the centenarian.\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cYou wonder...whether this administration, that can\u2019t even get its story straight in one day, can conduct an operation of that delicacy and complexity, military, diplomatic and political. The president simply can\u2019t decide\u2026I think this really ought to make us think twice about whether we can entrust a man of this lack of decisiveness.\u201d \u2013Charles Krauthammer, on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nWant FOX News First in your inbox every day?
