Sean Hannity is headed to the State of the Union address as the guest of a politician whom he could one day serve alongside.

The conservative radio host will join Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, a fellow outspoken critic of President Barack Obama who has been a guest for Hannity many times and filled in for him on his radio show, according to a report by the Dallas Morning News.

The event could be a chance for Hannity to schmooze with a guy he could later work with. Hannity told his Fox News viewers Wednesday that he would also consider running for office in the Lone Star State.

He discussed moving from his home state of New York after statements by Gov. Andrew Cuomo that there is no room in the Empire State for “extreme conservatives.”

“The answer is yes, I’d think about it,” he responded to a Facebook post inquiring whether he’d ever run for office. “I’m leaving New York as you know … so it would either be in Texas or Florida.”

This isn’t the first time a State of the Union invitation has been used to make a statement to the president. Last year, Texas Rep. Steve Stockman invited rocker Ted Nugent, an outspoken gun-rights proponent who once said he would either be “dead or in jail by this time next year” if Obama were reelected. This year, Stockman is bringing Chad Henderson, a former Obama volunteer who has since come out against the Affordable Care Act.
