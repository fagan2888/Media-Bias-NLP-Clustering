DUBLIN, Nov. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mtct3b/us_market_for) has announced the addition of the "US Market for Hemostasis Devices - 2016 (Forecasted to 2022)" report to their offering.

This segment includes only the analyzers and reagents used in core labs of hospitals and in independent commercial labs, without taking into consideration the point-of-care (POC) equipment. The U.S. hemostasis testing is a well-established market, with nearly every hospital and reference lab having an analyzer, and most large hospitals having a backup unit in addition to their primary analyzer. The matured nature of the market and high installed base has led to relatively stable annual unit sales, with replacement of the older machines accounting for a majority of the total sales.

Routine high volume tests such as prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and D-dimer account for more than 65% of the total hemostasis tests. Tests for monitoring anticoagulant therapies are expected to decrease as new anticoagulant drugs that do not require monitoring are expected to enter the market.

Aging population and the inclusion of millions of people into the health insurance bracket due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will create increased demand for routine hemostasis tests. However, transitioning to outcome-based reimbursements model from fee-for-service model, due to the emergence of accountable care organizations (ACOs), will increase POC testing volumes, thus driving down the volumes and cost per test at both core lab sites and reference labs.

The competitive analysis outlines Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics as a leader in this market segment, but with Instrumentation Laboratory and other close behind.
