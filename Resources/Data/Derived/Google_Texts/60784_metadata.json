McClelland picked up four local endorsements last week, but this one may be particularly personal for her. McClelland\u2019s father was an IBEW member.\n\n\u201cThis endorsement is extremely personal for me. The IBEW fed me, clothed me, sheltered me and educated me. I am immensely grateful for the many opportunities they have afforded me throughout my life,\u201d McClelland said. \u201cTheir continued support is an honor and a reminder that I, along with all of labor\u2019s children, must fight to protect the future of America\u2019s workers and the middle class.\u201d\n\nMcClelland\u2019s primary opponent is Col. John Hugya, a former Chief of Staff to Rep. John Murtha who represented the 12th district for 45 years. McClelland is a businesswoman from New Kensington.\n\nNovember 25th, 2013 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 4 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 5 endorsed Erin McClelland in her campaign for the Democratic nomination in PA-12.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-12-ibew-local-5-endorses-mcclelland/53197/", "description": "International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 5 endorsed Erin McClelland in her campaign for the Democratic nomination in PA-12.", "title": "PA-12: IBEW Local 5 Endorses McClelland"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "mcclelland,endorsement,pa 12", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdceb0\"", "article_summary": "PA-12: IBEW Local 5 Endorses McClellandWritten by Brittany Foster, Deputy EditorErin McClelland picked up a big union endorsement from IBEW Local 5 in her campaign to win the Democratic primary and face incumbent Rep.
