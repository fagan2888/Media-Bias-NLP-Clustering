Before Obama was exploding the national debt, George W. Bush was nearly doubling it. Republicans say they\u2019re for the Constitution and individual liberty, but have been an enemy of the Bill of Rights and privacy protections. Dick Cheney was no civil libertarian.\n\n+ Elaine Thompson Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump campaigns in Washington state last week. Elaine Thompson \u00d7\n\nIt says it cares about its voters, but betrays them every chance it gets. Obamacare, illegal immigration and Ex-Im bank/cronyism, to name just a few offenses the base found intolerable.\n\nMany forget that the tea party movement didn\u2019t originally begin with Barack Obama, but with President George W. Bush when he \u201cabandoned free market principles\u2026 to save the free market system\u201d with the bank bailout in 2008.\n\nThe GOP presidential nominee that year, John McCain, suspended his campaign to rush back to Washington to assist Bush in pushing this through. \u201cThe fundamentals of the economy are strong,\u201d said McCain.\n\nOf course, Obama defeated McCain handily in 2008. Americans-at-large were fed up with the GOP at that point, too.\n\nBy 2012, the tea party had actually elected a number of its own \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz stand out \u2014 and yet the GOP nominee that year essentially promised to keep the same old Republican model intact that the base had been rejecting since the last presidential election.\n\nObamacare was a primary issue in 2012 \u2014 and the Republican nominee who campaigned against it was also the architect of the model it was based on \u2014 Romneycare in Massachusetts. Seriously?\n\nOf course, Romney lost too.\n\nDonald Trump, policywise, is against virtually everything the tea party ever stood for. He\u2019s a crony capitalist who wants single-payer health care and even supported the bank bailouts that sparked conservative grassroots uprisings in 2008.\n\nBut most of Trumps\u2019 Republican supporters don\u2019t give a rip about policy.\n\nThey just wanted something different. Finally.\n\nThere are plenty of conservatives and libertarians who oppose Trump and who genuinely wanted something different too. I\u2019m one of them.\n\nBut so many of the #NeverTrump politicians and pundits in the media are seen by pro-Trump conservatives as establishment shills who would\u2019ve been completely happy with another McCain, Romney or whatever George W. Bush 4.0 they could have nominated this year.\n\nThe GOP grassroots was never happy with McCain or Romney, but endured them in the hope of defeating Barack Obama.\n\nNow, many in the Republican establishment \u2014 including former President Bush himself and Jeb Bush \u2014 are either saying they won\u2019t support the Republican nominee or even will vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhat\u2019s a grassroots Republican voter supposed to think about that?\n\nIntellectually, I disagree with conservatives and libertarians who support Trump.\n\nEmotionally \u2014 and the Trump phenomenon is primarily one of angst \u2014 I find it hard to get too angry with conservatives and libertarians who support Trump after years of disappointment and rejection. I share their frustration.\n\nBut I\u2019d be just as angry if half the candidates who ran this year had become the nominee.\n\nRepublicans desperately wanted something different \u2014 but different doesn\u2019t mean better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I\u2019ve spent most of the last decade hammering one message: The Republican Party is awful.", "author": "By Jack Hunter - Rare.us", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/opinion/hunter-why-its-hard-to-take-nevertrump-seriously/nrKqr/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/05/10/db/25/Campaign-2016-North-Car-2-.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "I\u2019ve spent most of the last decade hammering one message: The Republican Party is awful.", "title": "Hunter: Why it\u2019s hard to take #NeverTrump seriously"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/05/10/db/25/Campaign-2016-North-Car-2-.jpg", "description": "I\u2019ve spent most of the last decade hammering one message: The Republican Party is awful.That is, if you\u2019re a conservative or libertarian.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hunter: Why it\u2019s hard to take #NeverTrump seriously"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myaas", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/opinion/hunter-why-its-hard-to-take-nevertrump-seriously/nrKqr/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3339288/news/news/opinion/hunter-why-its-hard-to-take-nevertrump-seriously/nrKqr/", "keywords": "usworld_aas,politics_aas,statesman,commentary", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ve spent most of the last decade hammering one message: The Republican Party is awful.\nObamacare was a primary issue in 2012 \u2014 and the Republican nominee who campaigned against it was also the architect of the model it was based on \u2014 Romneycare in Massachusetts.\nRepublicans desperately wanted something different \u2014 but different doesn\u2019t mean better.\nNow, many in the Republican establishment \u2014 including former President Bush himself and Jeb Bush \u2014 are either saying they won\u2019t support the Republican nominee or even will vote for Hillary Clinton.\nThere are plenty of conservatives and libertarians who oppose Trump and who genuinely wanted something different too."}
