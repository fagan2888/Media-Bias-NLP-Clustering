Like most working parents, she finds making time for doctor\u2019s appointments a challenge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the time or energy to drive around town and then wait,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s why Badgley, 36, switched from her previous doctors to Zoom+, a medical provider and health insurer that aims to give patients more control and transparency. She can make same-day appointments through a mobile app, and she\u2019s usually in and out within 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one-stop shopping,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a big fan of getting everything quickly \u2026 I get my medication, my tests, everything in one visit.\u201d\n\nZoom, which serves patients in Portland, Seattle and Vancouver, Wash., is trying to buck the traditional health-care system by offering what it bills as convenient, affordable care in a hip and user-friendly environment. The retail clinics, painted a vibrant turquoise, are stylish and simple. The prices are posted on the walls.\n\nZoom was created by doctors Dave Sanders and Albert DiPiero to address problems that have plagued medical care for decades: rising costs, poor service and low quality, Sanders said. \u201cWe fundamentally wanted to change the system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company targets millennials, who have been at the forefront of change in other industries. Zoom is designed for an imaginary patient named Sarah, who is in her early thirties and wants to get her health care the way she gets other services in her life \u2014 quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe waiting rooms illustrate that dynamic: There are no magazines because patients don\u2019t typically wait long enough to read.\n\nZoom started as a single clinic in Portland 10 years ago and now has more than 30 locations, with seven in Seattle. Last year, the company expanded in Portland and now offers dental care, mental-health services and chronic-disease management, as well as appointments with cardiologists and other specialists.\n\nIt also opened a \u201cperformance studio\u201d to help people reach their fitness goals and a clinic that treats emergencies such as broken bones and concussions.\n\nIn Oregon, Zoom this year began selling insurance through the state\u2019s health exchange. Sanders said that by having insurance members of its own, Zoom will be able to better assess its success at controlling expenses and improving care.\n\nSo far only about 2,500 have signed up for Zoom\u2019s insurance.\n\nIn some ways, Zoom is similar to Kaiser Permanente or Seattle-based Group Health, which also provide medical care and insurance. But Kaiser and Group Health are closed systems, accepting only members.\n\nZoom is more of a hybrid, treating not only Zoom insurance members but people with other health plans and self-paying patients as well. So the company is both a partner and a competitor.\n\nPeople covered by Zoom insurance can get care at Zoom medical facilities or with Zoom partners, including Oregon Health & Science University hospitals.\n\nIn recent years, more health-care providers have been offering insurance, but the vast majority of them are hospital systems, said Katherine Hempstead, director of coverage for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s unique for a network of retail clinics to add an insurance arm, and Zoom\u2019s model is distinct because it is selling a branded experience to a specific population, Hempstead said. One Zoom poster says the complete health system is \u201cdesigned to make you happier, healthier, smarter, faster, sexier, creativer.\u201d\n\nHempstead said Zoom seems to be betting on the idea that young people are brand-loyal and view health broadly. As a result, they may be coming to Zoom not only to see a doctor but also to work with a fitness coach, get therapy or take cooking classes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally new-school approach,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is: Will the economics work out?\u201d\n\nThat could be a challenge given how saturated the Portland insurance market is, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute. In addition, millennials aren\u2019t typically heavy users of the health-care system, she said.\n\nDarcy Hoyt, a veterinarian, said she signed up for Zoom insurance after using the clinics for the past few years. The monthly premiums to cover her and her two children are lower than what her previous insurer charged, and she appreciates knowing in advance how much everything will cost.\n\n\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d Hoyt said.\n\nThe model appeals to people who want a different approach to medicine that doesn\u2019t have the \u201cvestigial appendices of a health-care system that has been around for 50 years,\u201d said John McConnell, director of Oregon Health & Science University\u2019s Center for Health Systems Effectiveness.\n\nZoom is selective about its patient population. While it sees privately insured patients and uninsured ones with the ability to pay, it doesn\u2019t accept people who are on Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nBy limiting whom they serve, McConnell said, the company\u2019s providers may be cherry-picking the least costly patients and leaving other medical groups and hospitals to deal with medically needier people.\n\nSanders countered that one company can\u2019t be all things to all people and Zoom has decided to invest its resources in serving a population that was ignored by the health system before the Affordable Care Act came along.\n\nZoom keeps costs low by providing care in neighborhood clinics and avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures. It relies on nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and maintains small staffs. It also has its own electronic health-record system.\n\n\u201cThe whole process has been stripped,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe took out a lot of the people, we took out all the paper, we took out the whole Taj Mahal.\u201d\n\nThe emergency clinic is one place where doctors said they are able to avoid overhead and pass savings along to patients. For patients paying out of pocket, a visit costs less than $300.\n\nBadgley, who has private insurance, came in to the clinic recently because she had been in bed for days with what she thought was the flu but still felt horrible after returning to work.\n\nIn the exam room, Dr. Aviva Zigman pulled out a pen and wrote Badgley\u2019s symptoms on an oversized white board, along with the tests she might need and how long the appointment would take. Soon afterward, Zigman determined that Badgley had an ear infection and gave her antibiotics.\n\nZigman said that as a provider, the Zoom model is much more efficient than a typical emergency room for routine ailments.\n\nAnother Zoom patient, Amy Cannon, 45, goes to the company\u2019s new primary-care clinic for management of her high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and high blood pressure. Cannon said it feels more like a private club than a doctor\u2019s office, and the assistant greets her with a hug.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Cheers\u2019 for health care,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cEverybody knows your name.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Portland-based Zoom is bucking the traditional health-care system with an expanding network of affordable local clinics that are billed as convenient and user-friendly \u2014 as long as you\u2019re not on Medicaid or Medicare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Portland-based Zoom is bucking the traditional health-care system with an expanding network of affordable local clinics that are billed as convenient and user-friendly \u2014 as long as you\u2019re not on Medicaid or Medicare.", "title": "Zoom+ offers new formula for health care aimed at app-using millennials", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/zoom-offers-new-formula-for-health-care-aimed-at-app-using-millennials/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/31db1f0a-17de-11e6-a536-f24bc4e96e77-1560x1170.jpg", "height": 1170}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Zoom+ offers new formula for health care aimed at app-using millennials", "description": "Portland-based Zoom is bucking the traditional health-care system with an expanding network of affordable local clinics that are billed as convenient and user-friendly \u2014 as long as you\u2019re not on Medicaid or Medicare.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/31db1f0a-17de-11e6-a536-f24bc4e96e77-780x585.jpg", "site": "@seattletimes"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124, app-argument=st://article/10007778", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2016-05-14 08:00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-16 10:17:57"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Business, Local Business, Wellness"}, "article_summary": "People covered by Zoom insurance can get care at Zoom medical facilities or with Zoom partners, including Oregon Health & Science University hospitals.\nIn some ways, Zoom is similar to Kaiser Permanente or Seattle-based Group Health, which also provide medical care and insurance.\nZoom is more of a hybrid, treating not only Zoom insurance members but people with other health plans and self-paying patients as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Cheers\u2019 for health care,\u201d Cannon said.\nDarcy Hoyt, a veterinarian, said she signed up for Zoom insurance after using the clinics for the past few years."}
