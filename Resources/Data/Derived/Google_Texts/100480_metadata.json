Because his smoking habit clearly couldn\u2019t\u2019ve had anything to do with it.\n\nAnyway, Obama\u2019s not taking this climate change stuff lying down:\n\nPresident Obama launched an initiative Tuesday aimed at highlighting the connections between climate change and public health, bringing both medical and data experts to the White House this week. \u2026 Speaking to a group at Howard University, which included the school\u2019s College of Medicine Dean Edward E. Cornwell, III and Tyra Bryant-Stephens, who directs the community asthma prevention program at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, Obama that warmer temperatures contribute to health problems such as asthma both by increasing smog-forming pollutants and by fueling wildfires that emit fine particles, or soot, into the air. \u201cAnd so there are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans. Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can\u2019t cordon yourself off from air or from climate.\u201d\n\nReally? Because judging by what we\u2019ve heard from this president for the past six-plus years, we could\u2019ve sworn he was cordoning his brain off from oxygen!\n\nNow, we could sit here and bust Obama for his climate change fear-mongering \u2026 but why would we, when there\u2019s someone who can do it even better?
