President Jacob Zuma told the ANC\u2019s 103rd anniversary gathering that our electricity catastrophe and corruption are the results of apartheid. He could\u2019ve added that apartheid explains why South African Airways (SAA) cannot get off the ground, why we have schools without education, why the Post Office does not deliver post, why young black people are unemployed, why if people drive straight it means they are drunk and forgetting to avoid potholes, why state hospitals are sickening, and why Bafana Bafana cannot play soccer.\n\nBefore Zuma\u2019s insight, I thought bad things were caused by bad policies, corruption, nepotism, deployment, affirmative inaction, incompetence, Zionism, Islam, the Boeremag, or Steve Hofmeyr. Now I know apartheid is the white in the woodpile and denialists are closet reactionary, anti-transformation, historically advantaged, right-wing, unreconstructed, bigoted, neoconservative, neoliberal, neofascist, neo-colonial, neo-vetkoek, white racist apartheid apologists.\n\nApartheid caused the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, Nkandla, Boko Haram and George Bush. Very few things \u2014 such as Obamacare, e-tolls, Islamic State and fever blisters \u2014 have other causes. There was unjustified scoffing at Zuma\u2019s epiphany.\n\nThe evil regime caused everything that afflicts us, including Eskom, the South African Broadcasting Corporation and the Financial Services Board (FSB). Apartheid forced blacks to live, as they do to this day, on government land. It concealed corruption, caused black youth unemployment, created a nanny state to control our lifestyles, established the propaganda broadcaster, mandated the Reserve Bank to nationalise foreign exchange and diverted money from poor blacks to black holes called state-owned \u201centerprises\u201d. Corruption, Zuma pointed out, \u201cexisted before 1994\u201d and his government was \u201cdealing with\u201d it.\n\nWhen delegates to the 1987 Dakar Conference visited Burkina Faso, which is twice as far from Pretoria (5 250km) as London is from Moscow (2 500km), tens of thousands of people chanted anti-apartheid slogans. Brutal dictator Thomas Sankara explained that apartheid caused their destitution.\n\nSo yes, Zuma is right, apartheid is the smoking gun behind everything his government inherited. That it merged with its former oppressor may explain why it perpetuates most of the apartheid legacy, including racist policies. But for the wealth that apartheid dinosaurs such as Eskom, the Post Office, Transnet, SAA and the FSB destroy, a decent house could have replaced every shack, and all road maintenance and new roads could have been completed. Private electricity could have electrified all homes and thousands of factories, mines, office parks and shopping centres; our economy could have been 20% richer and we could be booming like China, India and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFew people comprehend the magnitude of the electricity catastrophe. No one knows how much has been wasted on doing without electricity. \u201cEnergy efficiency\u201d is a euphemism for extreme waste and inefficiency (\u201clow-energy\u201d technology, insulation, diesel, renewables and the like). \u201cLoad shedding\u201d is a euphemism for blackouts. \u201cKeeping the lights on\u201d is a euphemism for keeping us in the dark. It entails cutting production and jobs in mines and factories.\n\nThe Transnet rail catastrophe forces suppliers to fund thousands of coal trucks taking coal to power stations while causing congestion and destroying roads. The SAA catastrophe requires endless bail-outs euphemistically called \u201cloans\u201d or \u201cguarantees\u201d. The nationalised healthcare catastrophe inflicts disease and death on the poor. While Rome burns, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi fiddles with what works, private care. Wherever you look \u2014 courts, education, roads, security, policing, transport, welfare \u2014 catastrophe lurks. All inherited from apartheid. That is as obvious as the solution, which is for the government to jettison Neanderthal socialists, fascists and communists in order to implement true transformation, namely the deregulation and privatisation of everything it does badly.\n\nLouw is executive director of the Free Market Foundation", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "Times Media Group", "description": "The Rand Daily Mail \u2013 The National Conversation in opinion pieces from Times Media newspapers", "application-name": "Rand Daily Mail", "author": "Leon Louw", "og": {"site_name": "Rand Daily Mail", "title": "Mr President, stop blaming apartheid for everything"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to Jacob Zuma, the evil apartheid regime caused everything that afflicts us", "card": "summary", "title": "Mr President, stop blaming apartheid for everything"}, "title": "Mr President, stop blaming apartheid for everything", "msapplication-tooltip": "RDM.co.za", "language": "english", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "publicationdate": "2015-01-20 22:08:28.0", "msapplication-starturl": "./", "Keywords": "South Africa, Opinion, Intellectual, Thought leadership, Sunday Times, Business Day, The Times, The Sowetan, newspaper, SowetanLIVE, Maverick, politics, Daily, columns, views, writers, world, africa, news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "publication": "Rand Daily Mail"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd6c\"", "article_summary": "President Jacob Zuma told the ANC\u2019s 103rd anniversary gathering that our electricity catastrophe and corruption are the results of apartheid.\nApartheid caused the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, Nkandla, Boko Haram and George Bush.\nBrutal dictator Thomas Sankara explained that apartheid caused their destitution.\nCorruption, Zuma pointed out, \u201cexisted before 1994\u201d and his government was \u201cdealing with\u201d it.\nThe SAA catastrophe requires endless bail-outs euphemistically called \u201cloans\u201d or \u201cguarantees\u201d."}
