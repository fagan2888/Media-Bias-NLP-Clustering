It\u2019s all about the 4K, or ultra-HD. The show floor is full of the top tier TVs, but Sharp isn\u2019t having any of it. The company is going big, and announcing a virtual 8K television.\n\nBefore you mortgage the house, there are some caveats to the announcement. The TV in question is a Sharp Aquos Beyond 4K Ultra HDTV. There\u2019s no mention of it being a legitimate 8K TV, and the company is quick to avoid any direct mention advertising it as such.\n\nBut, there is four times the pixels of a 4K TV, making it the virtual 8K. The effective display, thanks to some serious pixel magic, is 7,680 x 4,320. That gives you the headline \u2013 8K Ultra HDTV.\n\nSharp pulls off the feat by employing subpixels. Each pixel has four subpixels, instead of the normal three. Sharp added yellow to the normal trio of red, green and blue. In total, the set boasts 66 million subpixels \u2013 42 million more than your standard 4K TV.\n\nWhile not true 8K definition, it is undoubtedly the sharpest television you will be able to buy on the market. Right now, the upscaled definition would be bragging rights only. There\u2019s little to no content that takes advantage of the ultra-HD.\n\nOther features on the television include Sharp\u2019s Android-TV system. That gives you access to the library of Google Play apps.\n\nAs for a real 8K television? Sharp will be demonstrating a non-virtual 8K TV on the show floor. It\u2019s a prototype, so get ready for a wait.\n\nSo, when and how much? Price isn\u2019t known, but if you have to ask\u2026 As to the when, Sharp says late 2015. Expect some Christmas trees to have a giant TV under them. I will definitely add one of these to my list.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sharp aquos, 4k ultra hdtv, virtual 8k ultra hdtv, new sharp 4k tv, ces 2015 4k tv, sharp, tv, ultrahd", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "News Ledge", "description": "The TV in question is a Sharp Aquous Beyond 4K Ultra HDTV.
