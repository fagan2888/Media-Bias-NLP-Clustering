Indeed, this terrible toll does not arise in a cultural vacuum, but reflects attitudes that assume dead is better than disabled. And, there is no doubt, that included in the number of patients dying in this sobering New York Times article, regardless of its title, are those with cognitive disabilities who, every single day, are being starved and dehydrated to death \u2013 persons who are not dying, but who are simply living with their disability, and only need basic care \u2013 food and water (via a feeding tube) to live.\n\nIt was not long ago that feeding tubes were considered basic and ordinary care and therefore it was illegal, an act of euthanasia, to stop feeding and hydrating a person in need of a feeding tube. Today, however, feeding tubes have been redefined as \u201cartificial nutrition and hydration\u201d \u2013 and therefore a form of \u201cmedical treatment\u201d. Consequently, the removal of food and water from cognitively disabled patients, and countless other medically vulnerable, is now legal, and routine in all fifty states.\n\nIn his book, Culture of Death: The Assault on Medical Ethics in America, author and bioethicist, Wesley J. Smith, writes that, \u201cdefining \u2018artificial nutrition\u2019 as treatment instead of human care was a crucial step in the development of the culture of death.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smith, as far back as the early 80\u2019s, bioethicists began to debate out loud whether or not \u201cthe profoundly disabled and frail elderly were living too long\u201d. In particular, was bioethicist Daniel Callahan, who saw the feeding tube as a serious hurdle, boldly stating that changing its classification from \u201cbasic care\u201d to \u201cmedical treatment\u201d would be, \u201cthe only effective way to make certain that a large number of biologically tenacious patients actually die.\u201d\n\nEventually, more bioethicists agreed with Callahan\u2019s view, as well as health care professionals, politicians, judges, and others, ultimately accomplishing their goal of redefining the administration of food and hydration via a feeding tube.\n\nToday, either the general public is unaware of this change, or they just don\u2019t care. But if you think dehydrating to death our medically vulnerable isn\u2019t happening, then you are not paying attention.\n\nWhatever the reason, the mainstream media does very little to properly clear up any confusion that may exist, as they continue to report that persons who receive food and water via feeding tubes are receiving \u201cartificial life support\u201d, giving the perception that these people are aided by machines.\n\nLike this pro-life news article?

It seems we no longer know how to love, and we place more significance and value on what a person can or cannot do, instead of understanding the value and dignity of the human person, simply because they are human.\n\nAs a consequence, every single day, decisions are being made for our medically defenseless to be barbarically starved and dehydrated to death. Not to mention the offensive claim that to slowly dehydrate persons to death over a period of weeks is an act of compassion; that they are somehow experiencing death in a dignified way. This is not compassion, this is not love. This is intentionally killing, and in the most undignified way.\n\nRecently, Germany made the decision to inaugurate a memorial for the people with physical and mental disabilities, who because of their disabilities, were killed by the Nazis after their lives were deemed \u201cworthless.\u201d Estimates of over 200,000 were killed.\n\nPerhaps we should consider erecting one here in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, We Have a Culture of Death", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "According to research reviewed by board-certified medical geneticist and Co-Director of the Down Syndrome Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Skotko,", "title": "Yes, We Have a Culture of Death", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/09/23/yes-we-have-a-culture-of-death/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/proabort30b.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "yes,we have a culture of death", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce008\"", "article_summary": "But if you think dehydrating to death our medically vulnerable isn\u2019t happening, then you are not paying attention.\nAs a consequence, every single day, decisions are being made for our medically defenseless to be barbarically starved and dehydrated to death.\nNot to mention the offensive claim that to slowly dehydrate persons to death over a period of weeks is an act of compassion; that they are somehow experiencing death in a dignified way.\nCurrently, there is a strong push advocating the removal of spoon feeding from Alzheimer\u2019s patients if they so requested in an advance directive.\nToday, however, feeding tubes have been redefined as \u201cartificial nutrition and hydration\u201d \u2013 and therefore a form of \u201cmedical treatment\u201d."}
