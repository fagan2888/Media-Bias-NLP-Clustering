The 26-year-old star\u2019s body has been the subject of media scrutiny since her debut in 2010. Is it possible that constant focus on Kesha\u2019s appearance drove her to disordered eating?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a crusader for being yourself and loving yourself, but I\u2019ve found it hard to practice,\u201d the singer said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ll be unavailable for the next 30 days, seeking treatment for my eating disorder \u2026 to learn to love myself again, exactly as I am.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, eating disorders are a group of conditions marked by a preoccupation with food and weight. They range from anorexia nervosa to bulimia nervosa to binge-eating disorder. Females, those with a family history of eating disorders, and people in the public eye are among those who are at a higher risk of developing one of the disorders. While treatment for an eating disorder varies, it usually includes some combination of psychotherapy, nutrition education, and sometimes medication. In Kesha\u2019s case, TMZ reports that she is receiving treatment at Timberline Knolls rehabilitation center in Chicago.\n\nKesha\u2019s body has been fair game for media fodder for years now. Various publications and entertainment news shows have followed the star\u2019s \u201cweight loss transformation,\u201d covered her revelations about \u201cbody insecurities,\u201d taken polls about whether her toned buttocks is an \u201coptical illusion,\u201d and gone as far as calling her body \u201chideous.\u201d Unfortunately, it seems the constant media scrutiny may have taken a toll on the star, who has been appearing uncharacteristically thin in recent public appearances. Hopefully this stint in treatment will give her a fresh start for the new year.\n\n\"Cheers to this year being the best year ever,\" the singer tweeted on New Year\u2019s Day. \"2014 gon\u2019 be the year of truth and freedom.\"\n\nFor more information on eating disorders and when you should seek help, visit the Mayo Clinic online.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kesha, ke$ha, rehab, eating disorder, tmz", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pop singer Kesha, notorious for promoting self-love and self-acceptance, checked into a rehabilitation center Friday for eating disorder treatment.", "title": "Is Media Scrutiny To Blame For Kesha's Eating Disorder?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kesha-enters-rehab-eating-disorder-medias-body-scrutiny-blame-266327", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/kesha.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pop singer Kesha, notorious for promoting self-love and self-acceptance, checked into a rehabilitation center Friday for eating disorder treatment.", "title": "Is Media Scrutiny To Blame For Kesha's Eating Disorder?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kesha-enters-rehab-eating-disorder-medias-body-scrutiny-blame-266327", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/kesha.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/kesha.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-04T15:08:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-04T15:08:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pop singer Kesha, notorious for promoting self-love and self-acceptance, checked into a rehabilitation center Friday for eating disorder treatment."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0718\"", "article_summary": "The 26-year-old star\u2019s body has been the subject of media scrutiny since her debut in 2010.\nFor more information on eating disorders and when you should seek help, visit the Mayo Clinic online.\nWhile treatment for an eating disorder varies, it usually includes some combination of psychotherapy, nutrition education, and sometimes medication.\nFemales, those with a family history of eating disorders, and people in the public eye are among those who are at a higher risk of developing one of the disorders.\nPop singer Kesha (also known as \u201cKe$ha\u201d) announced on Friday that she checked into a rehabilitation facility to treat an unspecified eating disorder, according Us Weekly."}
