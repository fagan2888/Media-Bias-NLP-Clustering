WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — Laney High School will host a two day high school basketball showcase this weekend. It will be wall to wall basketball Friday and Saturday at the end of the holiday week.

On day one of the Laney Big Shots Hoop Feast the East Bladen girls got things started Friday morning at the Eagles faced-off against Jack Britt. The Eagles clenched the close victory 46-42 with Lacy Suggs leading the way with 20 points.

On the boys end, Laney took on Wilmington Christian Academy. Laney racked up a big lead at half time keeping them under 20 points. The Buccaneers keep the momentum going with a 70-24 win over Wilmington Christian Academy. Hunter Cook led his team with 15 points.

Laney Head Coach Nathan Faulk said this type of tournament is a good way to kick-off the high school basketball season for players and fans.

“They get to play a competition that they probably usually wouldn’t see until the playoffs, it also gives a chance for everybody to come together and give the Port City a premier tournament,” said Faulk.
