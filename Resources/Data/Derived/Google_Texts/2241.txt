Pierre, SD

There has been a massive data breach at Home Depot stores across the U.S. Because of this, Attorney General Marty Jackley is asking that South Dakotans watch their accounts closely for unauthorized charges.

Home Depot doesn’t know yet what exactly has been stolen, but criminals could have taken customers’ names, credit and debit numbers, expiration dates and the three digit security codes.

If you are worried about your information being stolen, you can check your credit report at www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling 1-877-322-8228 for a free copy. If errors are found, contact the reporting agency in writing.

You can also place fraud alerts to your credit reports. Just contact:

Equifax – 1-800-525-6285

Experian – 1-888-397-3742

TransUnion – 1-800-680-7289

If you used your credit/debit card at Home Depot during this spring or summer, you should monitor for unauthorized charges. If unauthorized charges appear, you should contact your card issuer immediately.

If you do not see any unauthorized charges, but are still uneasy, you can call your card issuer and discuss whether it is necessary to cancel your card or not.
