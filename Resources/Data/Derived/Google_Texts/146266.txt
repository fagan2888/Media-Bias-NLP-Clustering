A Regional Transportation District light rail train derailed at the end of its line in southwest metro Denver Sunday night, causing electric wires to fall across the tracks.

Nobody was injured, RTD spokesman Nate Currey said.

“The operator was shaken up. … The wires are down,” Currey said. “The wires are electric. We are asking people to not be in the vicinity of that station.”

Such derailments are rare, Currey said.

The incident happened about 9 p.m. at the Mineral station. RTD officials hadn’t determined why. RTD stopped running trains to the Mineral station pending removal of the wires. RTD ran a shuttle from the station to the north, Littleton, to the Mineral station.

Trains are expected to run as usual Monday morning.
