Today’s edition of quick hits:

* Chile : “More than one million people were evacuated from their homes after a massive 8.3-magnitude earthquake struck near the central coast of Chile Wednesday evening. At least 10 people were killed by the quake that damaged buildings and slammed powerful waves into coastal towns, causing flooding in some.”

* The Fed made the right call: “Investors will have at least one more month to worry about whether the Federal Reserve is raising rates. In the face of jittery financial markets and a global slowdown, the Fed blinked on Thursday.”

GM : “The Justice Department has reached a settlement with General Motors over the issue of faulty ignition switches that led to over 100 deaths and hundreds of injuries, according to officials familiar with the case.”

Charleston : “The man who gave shelter to Dylann Roof in the weeks before the June killings of nine African-Americans in a Charleston church has been arrested by the FBI. Agents picked up Joseph “Joey” Meek Jr., 21, of Red Bank while he was at work Thursday afternoon, his girlfriend Lindsey Fry told The State newspaper just before 4 p.m.”

Missouri : “Lawmakers have rejected an effort to make Missouri the 26th right-to-work state. The Republican-led House voted 96 to 63 for the right-to-work bill during a veto session Wednesday. The vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to overcome Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon’s veto.”

* McConnell goes 0 for 3 : “Senate Democrats blocked a resolution disapproving the Iran nuclear deal for a third time Thursday, sealing a major foreign policy victory for President Obama. Senators voted 56-42 against ending debate on the resolution of disapproval, falling short of the 60 votes needed on the procedural motion.”

Sarah Feinberg shouldn’t face too much resistance: “President Obama’s choice to run the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) will face lawmakers in the Senate for a confirmation hearing on Thursday amid an intensifying fight over automating trains on the nation’s railways.”

Good point : “On Wednesday night, for this year’s debate at the Reagan Library, the [Affordable Care Act] got almost no attention at all…. So why didn’t the CNN hosts ask about it? Why didn’t any of the Republican candidates strain to bring it up, the way Bachmann did in 2011? Here’s one theory: The issue is losing its resonance, even among Republicans.”
