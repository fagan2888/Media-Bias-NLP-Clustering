Smart Benefits: Self-Funded Insurance - A Growing Option Among Employers

As employers continue to face rising health care costs and added fees imposed by the ACA, many are turning to self-funded insurance plans.

With self-funded plans, employers assume direct financial responsibility for their employees’ claims. The advantages?

Responsibility for administration and paying claims is handed over to a Third Party Administrator or insurance carrier

The Health Insurance Industry Fee doesn’t apply to self-insured plans

Self-funded plans do not have to meet all the benefit design requirements under Obamacare, just the minimum essential value and affordability requirements

Self-funded plans from most state insurance laws, including reserve requirements, mandated benefits, premium taxes, and consumer protection regulations.

But self-funding also has some downsides, most notably, risk. Claim activity can vary monthly and, as a result, so can costs – a challenge for companies with cash flow issues. And, since claims of members are not comingled with the insurer’s risk pool, a handful of large, unexpected claims can be crippling. To help protect against large, unexpected claims, employers may buy stop-loss coverage.

While self-funded have traditionally been more common among large employers, small groups are starting to take notice. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation 2014 Employer Health Benefits Survey, 15% of workers in small companies (3-199 employees) were covered by self-funded plans. That figure rose with the number of employees: 81% of employees in large firms (200+ workers), 83% in companies with 1,000-4,999 employees are, and 91% of covered workers in firms with 5,000 or more workers were in self-funded plans in 2014.
