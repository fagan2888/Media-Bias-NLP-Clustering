Va. area, and Penn State Hershey Medical Center\u2019s merger with Pinnacle Health System in the Harrisburg, Penn. area. The Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General joined the latter challenge.\n\nIn the Chicago situation, the agency argued that merger would likely harm consumers with rising health care costs and diminished incentives to upgrade services and improve quality, according to the FTC complaint filed in federal court.\n\nFTC said Advocate and North Shore are close competitors with a history of upgrading medical facilities, investing in new technologies, and adjusting their approach to managed care contracting to compete against each other.\n\nIn the West Virginia situation, FTC alleges the two hospitals are each other\u2019s closest competitor for health plans and patients, and that the acquisition would substantially lessen competition between the hospitals for patients and for inclusion in health plan networks.\n\nThe FTC, which describes itself as a bipartisan federal agency with a unique dual mission to protect consumers and promote competition, says it files a complaint in federal court when it has \u201creason to believe\u201d that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.\n\nIssuance of an administrative complaint marks the beginning of a proceeding in which the allegations will be tried in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge.\n\nU.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., said the FTC apparently doesn\u2019t believe the narrative in health care that consolidation of services will lower costs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened in the hospital sector is it\u2019s so regulated now,\u201d Roe, a former physician, said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) gave hospitals the idea they would get a lot more paying customers. They did get some more but those people weren\u2019t able to pay, and now the majority of uncollectable debt are people with insurance.\u201d\n\nMedicare also gives Wellmont and Mountain States less reimbursement for the same service offered in, say, California, said Roe.\n\nIn a pre-submission report on their merger, Roe pointed out Wellmont and Mountain States put in language about how they would hold down cost increases.\n\nWhen asked about the FTC\u2019s recent actions to block hospital system mergers, Mountain States President and CEO Alan Levine contends the planned Wellmont-Mountain States merger is a completely different matter.\n\n\u201cThose organizations were not applying for state oversight. Those were traditional, standard mergers,\u201d Levine, who would lead the merged system, said after a briefing on the merger status held at the Bristol Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIndeed, Wellmont and Mountain States plan to file applications for a Certificate of Public Advantage (COPA) with the Tennessee Department of Health and a cooperative agreement with the Southwest Virginia Health Authority in late January.\n\nShould both states approve the applications and the merger becomes final, the state and commonwealth will supervise the new organization.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re following the regulatory process,\u201d Levine explained. \u201cFederal law permits the supplanting of competition with regulation. As long as we\u2019re being properly regulated by the state, we believe case law precedent in (U.S.) Supreme Court rulings will validate what we are trying to do ... They can\u2019t do anything without the court. The FTC typically has to act through the courts so we would have our say in the courts and make our case. We\u2019re following the law. We\u2019re not close to the edge. We\u2019re right in the middle ... If the COPA is violated, we would have to submit a plan for separation, and that would also subject us to FTC scrutiny at that point.\u201d\n\nNeither Wellmont nor Mountain States, Levine said, have to file any supporting merger documents with the federal government.\n\nThe two health care providers, he added, also feel any moves to change the law regulating mergers in Tennessee and Virginia will be turned away by the region\u2019s state lawmakers.\n\nNortheast Tennessee\u2019s top lawmaker, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, said he\u2019s sold on the merger.\n\n\u201cMy basic business sense is competition is good,\u201d Ramsey, R-Blountville, said. \u201d ... Health care is controlled by the federal government and the insurance companies ... What really sold me was (East Tennessee State University President) Brian Noland and the research dollars he tells me can come here (as a result of the merger).\u201d\n\nThe full pre-submission report can be viewed at www.BecomingBetterTogether.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>KINGSPORT &mdash; Just as the planned Wellmont Health System-Mountain States Health Alliance merger is gaining traction, there could be something ahead standing in the way.", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesnews.net/Business/2016/01/11/Will-the-feds-stand-in-the-way", "site_name": "Kingsport Times-News", "image": "http://www.timesnews.net/image/2016/01/08/x720_q60/Merger-folo-jpg.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Will the feds stand in the way?"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.timesnews.net", "creator": "TimesNewsOnline", "image": {"src": "http://www.timesnews.net/image/2016/01/08/x720_q60/Merger-folo-jpg.jpg"}, "title": "Will the feds stand in the way?", "site": "@TimesNewsOnline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 306444286209772}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 201701010086}}, "keywords": "Kingsport Times-News,Business", "google-site-verification": "uiTHhc2bxN1N0pBi249F-jCDqA59bFKW1qHORL26uvo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "When asked about the FTC\u2019s recent actions to block hospital system mergers, Mountain States President and CEO Alan Levine contends the planned Wellmont-Mountain States merger is a completely different matter.\nU.S. Rep.
