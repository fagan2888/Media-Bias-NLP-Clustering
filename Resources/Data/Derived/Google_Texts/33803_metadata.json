Some Democrats boycotted the speech out of protest for what they saw as campaigning from Congress.\n\nThe announcement's aims are two-fold: to quell concerns about Carson's grasp of foreign policy, and to shore up his credentials with Jewish Republicans after failing to captivate the audience at last week's Republican Jewish Coalition's (RJC) Candidates Forum.\n\nA New York Times piece last month quoted a Carson foreign policy adviser describing weekly foreign policy calls to \u201cmake him smart\" and framed him as struggling to understand the issues. That prompted a rebuke by the Carson campaign, which accused the Times of taking advantage of an \"elderly gentleman.\"\n\nThe GOP candidate stumbled over the name of a Palestinian group that's long clashed with Israel, and his speech resembled a term paper that went through a detailed history of the region.\n\n- This story was updated at 9:42 a.m. on Dec. 9.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The move comes as Carson's foreign policy knowledge has been questioned.", "description": "The move comes as Carson's foreign policy knowledge has been questioned.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The move comes as Carson's foreign policy knowledge has been questioned.", "title": "Carson hires former Netanyahu aide as foreign policy adviser", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/262520-carson-hires-former-netanyahu-aide-as-foreign-policy", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/carson_ben_2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/262520-carson-hires-former-netanyahu-aide-as-foreign-policy", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-08T16:36-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cheryl Segal", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Ben Carson,Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-08T16:36:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/262520-carson-hires-former-netanyahu-aide-as-foreign-policy", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The move comes as Carson's foreign policy knowledge has been questioned.", "card": "summary", "title": "Carson hires former Netanyahu aide as foreign policy adviser"}, "dcterms.title": "Carson hires former Netanyahu aide as foreign policy adviser"}, "article_summary": "A New York Times piece last month quoted a Carson foreign policy adviser describing weekly foreign policy calls to \u201cmake him smart\" and framed him as struggling to understand the issues.\nBen Carson's presidential campaign is bringing on a former top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a foreign policy adviser amid concerns about the retired neurosurgeon's chops on the issue.\nGeorge Birnbaum has worked with three Israeli prime ministers as well as its foreign minister, and has advised political leaders in Bulgaria, Romania, Kosovo, Serbia and the Czech Republic.\nIn a statement that noted his \"pride and excitement\" in joining Carson's team, Birnbaum noted the integral relationship between America and Israel.\nThat prompted a rebuke by the Carson campaign, which accused the Times of taking advantage of an \"elderly gentleman.\""}
