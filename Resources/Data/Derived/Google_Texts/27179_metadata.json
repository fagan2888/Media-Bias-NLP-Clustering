We were together three years, and he dumped me suddenly. I\u2019m still struggling to understand. I think I am entitled to an explanation and want to hash things out. The less he responds, the more I feel I need to get through to him that this is all I want.\n\nA: Just because you might be entitled to an explanation does not mean that he is capable of giving you one. And even if he were, it might not ever make sense, as his reasons would probably never be deemed good enough, thus running the risk of making you feel even more confused and hurt.\n\nYou can\u2019t picture it now \u2014 that\u2019s the nature of the breakup beast \u2014 but closure will come on your own time, with perspective, the comfort and distraction of friends, interests, passions or just an occasional good bowl of pho. If you\u2019re willing to write for my advice, hopefully you\u2019ll be willing to heed it: No long-term good is likely to come from you continuing to contact him, despite how strong the urges are in the short term.\n\nA: There could be many things going on here. Maybe you notice it more with your brother, or she feels a comfort with him that she doesn\u2019t with other people, or \u2014 less pleasant \u2014 she feels something for him that brings out the flirtation in her.\n\nThe important thing is that you\u2019re honest with yourself about how much it bothers you, and if it\u2019s significant, talk to her about it. Here\u2019s the rub: You\u2019re not complaining or accusing; you\u2019re sharing something that\u2019s been on your mind.\n\nAnd in terms of her behavior, I\u2019d urge you not to overanalyze (did I actually just write that?) because, depending on how she is with other male family members, it could be that what you interpret as flirtation is actually more of familial comfort and affection.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Stalking the ex for an explanation won't bring closure... only time will"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3b0\"", "article_summary": "Q: My ex-boyfriend is accusing me of \u201cstalking\u201d him because I continue to text and ask him to reconsider our breakup.\nHere\u2019s the rub: You\u2019re not complaining or accusing; you\u2019re sharing something that\u2019s been on your mind.\nAnd in terms of her behavior, I\u2019d urge you not to overanalyze (did I actually just write that?)\nThe less he responds, the more I feel I need to get through to him that this is all I want.\nA: Just because you might be entitled to an explanation does not mean that he is capable of giving you one."}
