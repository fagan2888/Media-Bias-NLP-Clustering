Matt Edge/The New York Times\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After Paul Minton graduated from college, he worked as a waiter but always felt he should do more.\n\nArea code Prospective coders in the Charleston area have at least two choices. CODECamp was launched by the city\u2019s public-private Charleston Digital Corridor initiative. A four-week class called \u201cWeb Basics 101 \u2014 Intro to the Web\u201d starts Aug. 17. The cost is $250. Go to www.chscodecamp.com for details. Also, Iron Yard Academy, a privately run program that was started in Greenville, offers 12-week crash courses three times a year in Charleston. It is relocating its local site to 17 Princess St. on the peninsula later this month. Tuition ranges from $2,500 to $12,000 depending on the program. Go to www.theironyard.com for details.\n\nSo Minton, a 26-year-old math major, took a three-month course in computer programming and data analysis. As a waiter, he made $20,000 a year. His starting salary last year as a data scientist at a Web startup here was more than $100,000.\n\n\u201cSix figures, right off the bat,\u201d Minton said. \u201cTo me, it was astonishing.\u201d\n\nStories like his are increasingly familiar these days as people across a spectrum of jobs \u2014 poker players, bookkeepers, baristas \u2014 are shedding their past for a future in the booming tech industry. The money sloshing around in technology is cascading beyond investors and entrepreneurs into the broader digital workforce, especially to those who can write modern code, the language of the digital world.\n\nInternet giants like Google and Facebook have long fought over the top software engineers in the country, and that continues. But now, companies in most every industry, either by necessity or to follow the pack, are pursuing some sort of digital game plan \u2014 creating lucrative opportunities for computing-minded newcomers who, like Minton, want to reboot their lives.\n\n\u201cThese are skilled and ambitious people who are seeking an on-ramp to the tech industry,\u201d said Jim Deters, chief executive of Galvanize, the school Minton attended.\n\nWhether the on-ramp proves to be a lasting pathway to high pay and stimulating work remains to be seen. The boom-to-bust cycles in the tech business can be wrenching, like the last downturn in the early 2000s after the dot-com bubble burst. Nearly everyone in the industry was hit. Yet software development and engineering jobs held up better than ones in finance, marketing, sales and administration.\n\nFor now, at least, it is a seller\u2019s market for those who can master new technology tools for lowering a business\u2019 costs, reaching its customers and automating decision-making \u2014 notably, cloud computing, mobile apps and data analytics.\n\nBoot camps\n\nCompanies cannot hire fast enough. Glassdoor, an employment site, lists more than 7,300 openings for software engineers, ahead of job openings for nurses, who are chronically in short supply. For the smaller category of data scientists, there are more than 1,200 job openings. Demand is highest in San Francisco. Nationally, the average base salary for software engineers is $100,000, and $112,000 for data scientists.\n\nIn March, the White House announced an initiative, TechHire, to coordinate the efforts of the federal government, cities, corporations and schools to train workers for the thousands of current job openings in the tech sector. The Obama administration points to coding schools like Galvanize, Flatiron and Hack Reactor, which offer accelerated training in digital skills as a way to \u201crapidly train workers for a well-paying job.\u201d\n\nThe graduating classes of these coding schools support the trend. They will graduate about 16,000 students this year, more than double the 6,740 graduates last year, according to a survey published by Course Report in June. The 2015 total would be about one-third of the estimated number of computer science graduates from U.S. universities. The largest concentration of the schools, often called boot camps, is in San Francisco, which has 12, followed by New York, with nine, and Seattle, eight.\n\nStudents are of a wide age range, but most are in their 20s and 30s. The typical student is a \u201c29-year-old career changer,\u201d said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report, which tracks these schools.\n\nPast shifts and surges in the information technology industry \u2014 the early Internet boom in the 1990s, the personal computer revolution in the 1970s and 1980s, and the minicomputer and mainframe eras before \u2014 have often opened doors to job seekers of diverse backgrounds.\n\nLois Haibt was a freshly minted graduate of Vassar College when she was hired by IBM to join the original team that created Fortran, a pioneering programming language. Recalling the hiring practices of the late 1950s and 1960s, she said, \u201cThey took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills \u2014 bridge players, chess players, even women.\u201d\n\nFemale factor\n\nOne sure way to fill job openings in technology these days would be to attract more women. Only 18 percent of computer science graduates at four-year universities were women in 2013, the most recent statistic. By contrast, 35 percent of students at the specialized coding schools are women.\n\nSavannah Worth majored in English and graduated last year from Colorado College. Jobs that might use her skills, she says, seem limited to writing marketing materials or blog posts for websites.\n\n\u201cThe good jobs were all in computer science,\u201d she recalled.\n\nIn college, she had dismissed computer programming as all math and numbers and not a creative pursuit. But she dropped into an open house one evening at the Galvanize school in Denver. She found it filled with creative, smart people, and not at all just dry math.\n\nWorth, 22, signed up for the Galvanize 24-week Web programming class and excelled. Shortly after completing the course, she was hired by IBM as a software developer in San Francisco. She helps IBM\u2019s corporate clients design and build Web and mobile applications that run in remote cloud data centers, and she earns a six-figure salary.\n\nGalvanize\u2019s 24-week Web programming course is one of the largest among the coding schools. The average class length among the schools is just under 11 weeks, and costs $11,000. Galvanize\u2019s Web programming course is also among the most expensive, at $21,000. The company offers scholarships and deferred payment plans and has partnerships with online lenders like LendLayer and Earnest.\n\nThe job placement rate for Galvanize students is 98 percent.\n\n\u201cGraduation here is you get a job,\u201d Deters said.\n\nEmployers are recruiting for immediate needs but with the future in mind.\n\n\u201cWhat we hire for is the ability to learn,\u201d said Rachel Reinitz, an IBM distinguished engineer, who is Worth\u2019s boss. \u201cThe technology changes so fast.\u201d\n\nGalvanize is selective, accepting about 20 percent of applicants. The vast majority are college graduates, but there are exceptions, like Reyna DeLoge. She grew up in northwestern Montana in a working-class family and logged long hours in part-time jobs throughout high school. She went to Montana State University but dropped out after a year, uninspired and in debt.\n\nDeLoge, 24, worked for years mostly as a barista and assistant manager. She moved to Denver and a year ago got a job at the coffee shop in the Galvanize building there. She found the environs, bustling with aspiring coders and fledgling start-ups, appealing. She applied to the Web-programming course and was accepted.\n\nTo help pay for the course, DeLoge got a $5,000 scholarship and a no-interest loan from Galvanize. She graduated last month, immediately received a few job offers and decided to take one from Galvanize, as a teaching assistant and mentor to new students. In the past, DeLoge never made as much as $30,000 a year. Her salary now is nearly $80,000.\n\nShe is making more than her father, an experienced machine-tool operator and instructor.\n\n\u201cThat blows me away,\u201d said DeLoge, who sees her new skills as a gateway to opportunity. \u201cWho knows where I\u2019ll be in a year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "As tech booms, workers turn to coding for career change, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalTechnology, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Coding,Galvanize,Silicon Valley,tech boom", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After Paul Minton graduated from college, he worked as a waiter but always felt he should do more.", "title": "As tech booms, workers turn to coding for career change", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150801/150809972/as-tech-booms-workers-turn-to-coding-for-career-change", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC05/150809972/AR/0/AR-150809972.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC05/150809972/AR/0/AR-150809972.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After Paul Minton graduated from college, he worked as a waiter but always felt he should do more.", "title": "As tech booms, workers turn to coding for career change", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150801/PC05/150809972/AR/0/AR-150809972.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150809972}}, "keywords": "As tech booms, workers turn to coding for career change , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalTechnology, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Coding,Galvanize,Silicon Valley,tech boom", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T20:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-31T14:04:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After Paul Minton graduated from college, he worked as a waiter but always felt he should do more."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0cd\"", "article_summary": "Galvanize\u2019s 24-week Web programming course is one of the largest among the coding schools.\nGalvanize\u2019s Web programming course is also among the most expensive, at $21,000.\nSo Minton, a 26-year-old math major, took a three-month course in computer programming and data analysis.\nIn college, she had dismissed computer programming as all math and numbers and not a creative pursuit.\nWorth, 22, signed up for the Galvanize 24-week Web programming class and excelled."}
