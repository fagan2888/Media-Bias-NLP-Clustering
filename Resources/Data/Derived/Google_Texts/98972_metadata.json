The woman said Magni and Jenks resident Kelsey Strickland, 22, took the Honda Accord from a Sapulpa McDonald's on August 31, 2013, before dropping her off at her house.\n\nThe woman got into an argument with Magni, who sped off while she was still getting out of the car, running over her foot and leg, the report states.\n\nThe deputy later learned Tulsa Police found the stolen car - with the couple inside - at a hotel in east Tulsa. He arrested both on complaints of possession of a stolen vehicle and Magni for assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nWhile taking the couple to jail, the deputy said they would not stop discussing the arrest.\n\n\"I told them numerous times to stop or I would charge them with obstruction of justice,\" Deputy Justin Kaczynski said in his report.\n\n\"Dillon and Kelsey continued to discuss the arrest, and Dillon stated, 'Charge me.'\"", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A Tulsa County Sheriff's Deputy arresting two people for possession of a stolen car added another complaint when they would not stop arguing.", "author": "Dee Duren", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/23313570/couple-argues-their-way-to-tulsa-jail", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23313570_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Tulsa County Sheriff's Deputy arresting two people for possession of a stolen car added another complaint when they would not stop arguing.", "title": "Couple Argues Their Way To Tulsa Jail"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23313570_SA.jpg", "description": "A Tulsa County Sheriff's Deputy arresting two people for possession of a stolen car added another complaint when they would not stop arguing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Couple Argues Their Way To Tulsa Jail"}, "wnreadableurl": "couple-argues-their-way-to-tulsa-jail", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2013/09/01", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4c8\"", "article_summary": "The deputy later learned Tulsa Police found the stolen car - with the couple inside - at a hotel in east Tulsa.\nDillon Magni and Kelsey Strickland are in Tulsa County Jail.\nThe woman said Magni and Jenks resident Kelsey Strickland, 22, took the Honda Accord from a Sapulpa McDonald's on August 31, 2013, before dropping her off at her house.\nA Tulsa County Sheriff's Deputy arresting two people for possession of a stolen car added another complaint when they would not stop arguing in the back of his patrol car.\nWhile taking the couple to jail, the deputy said they would not stop discussing the arrest."}
