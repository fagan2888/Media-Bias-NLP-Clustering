Congratulations, Mr. President!\n\nRunner Up: Ed Schultz\n\n\u201cThanks to a lot of Republican policies, the city [Detroit] is now filing for bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nMSNBC personality Ed Schultz came in a not-even-close second place. Still, his eye-popping statement about the cause of Detroit\u2019s downfall deserves to be recognized as disgraceful.\n\nStaff Picks\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz\n\n\u201cIt was not a lie, let\u2019s just be very clear.\u201d\n\nFrancesca Chambers: As if lying about the disastrous effects Obamacare would have on millions of Americans\u2019 plans wasn\u2019t enough, Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schutlz continued to defend the falsity. Just a few days later President Obama would apologize to the nation for misleading them about Obamacare. It was a lie, let\u2019s be very clear.\n\nBarack Obama\n\n\u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d\n\nChris Deaton: The president\u2019s words carry uniquely heavy weight. These were supposed to reassure Americans who were already insured that there was no need to panic under his law. It ended up that his promise was a total falsity \u2014 and as NBC News pointed out in October, the administration knew for at least three years that it would turn out that way. It was an egregious misjudgment at best, a shameless political ploy to save him from losing electoral votes at worst \u2014 and either way, a lie for the ages.\n\nMelissa Quinn: Upwards of 10 million Americans received cancellation notices from their health insurance companies, in addition to seeing their premiums and deductibles increase. This law is Obama\u2019s namesake, and for him to make sure a promise \u2014 in the interest of drumming up support for the law \u2014 and then turn his back on it, speaks volumes to his character and leadership skills.\n\nKathleen Sebelius\n\n\u201cThe website never crashed.\u201d\n\nKatie LaPotin: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius spent much of the fall trying to convince the American people that there wasn\u2019t a problem with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act when it was blatantly clear that the website was a complete failure. It\u2019s a perfect example of why Americans have so little faith in their elected officials these days.\n\nKelsey Osterman: There\u2019s proof that Kathleen Sebelius knew HealthCare.gov was fatally flawed well before its launch \u2014 but she still kept telling the American people that the website would work. And when it didn\u2019t, she tried to claim she never knew how bad the problems were. All around, a disgracefully deceitful year for her.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Here's who you picked as the 2013 Red Alert Politics Liar of the Year.", "title": "And the 2013 'Liar of the Year' is . . . - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/12/Liar-of-the-Year-2013-600x257.jpg", "height": 257}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/03/and-the-2013-liar-of-the-year-is/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "published_time": "2014-01-03T10:14:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-03T12:18:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b3b\"", "article_summary": "you selected President Barack Obama as your 2013 Liar of the Year.\nThese were supposed to reassure Americans who were already insured that there was no need to panic under his law.\nAnd when it didn\u2019t, she tried to claim she never knew how bad the problems were.\nMelissa Quinn: Upwards of 10 million Americans received cancellation notices from their health insurance companies, in addition to seeing their premiums and deductibles increase.\nBarack Obama\u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201dChris Deaton: The president\u2019s words carry uniquely heavy weight."}
