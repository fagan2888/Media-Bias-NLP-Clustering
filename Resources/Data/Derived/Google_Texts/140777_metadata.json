(WFSB)\n\nThere were about 3,000 Trump supporters in attendance on Saturday. (WFSB)\n\nAs anticipated, protestors did gather outside of the high school in Waterbury ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s visit. It was a much smaller demonstration than what we saw in Hartford last Friday.\n\nStanding just feet apart, Trump supporters and protesters couldn't have been more divided on the presidential hopeful.\n\n\u201cI don't doubt that Donald Trump is intelligent,\u201d protestor Robbie Goodrich said. \u201cI doubt the use of his intelligence. The way that he uses rhetoric is really anti-American.\"\n\n\u201cHe doesn't have all the answers, but he's going to get the people around him, who do have the appropriate answers and take their advice and make American great again,\u201d Trump supporter Jonathan Lebeau, said.\n\nAs the line of supporters looped around the Crosby High School parking lot, a handful of protestors stood in solidarity armed with signs and slogans.\n\nAmong them were three University of Connecticut students, who will be voting for the first time in this election.\n\n\u201cI would be extremely disappointed and very scared for the future because I don't know what the future would be like with Trump as President and I really don't want to find out,\u201d protestor Kathleen Mulhall said.\n\nThe latest Quinnipiac University poll shows Trump has a 20 percent lead in the state. Voters on either side said it's Trump's off-the-cuff remarks that really set him apart from the other candidates.\n\n\u201cEverything comes out of him,\u201d Trump supporter Alan Carvalho said. \u201cIt's not scripted, so you more or less believe him over the other people.\"\n\n\u201cWe don't need his hate in our state,\u201d Goodrich said. \u201cIt's very important to understand that Donald Trump is not going to be the President of the United States.\"\n\nCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
