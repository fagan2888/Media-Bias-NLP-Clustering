Saul Loeb / Pool\n\nThey say Americans don\u2019t vote on national security issues. (You don\u2019t have to take my word for it; even former U.N. ambassador and leader of the \u201cBe Very Afraid\u201d caucus John Bolton said so.) So, what was Barack Obama doing when he became the fourth consecutive U.S. president to go on primetime television to announce military action in Iraq?\n\nWait, what? Apples and oranges, you say? This was a speech about foreign policy in its own right, not electioneering \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re going with?\n\nO.K. Maybe. But let\u2019s look at the speech a bit anyway.\n\nFirst, this new four-point strategy \u2014 what is the president saying he will do differently?\n\n\u201cFirst,\u201d Obama said, \u201cwe will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists.\u201d But that is exactly what the U.S. is already doing; the president touted it in this very speech, just paragraphs earlier.\n\n\u201cLast month, I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSince then, we have conducted more than 150 successful airstrikes in Iraq.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d POTUS continued, \u201cwe will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground.\u201d\n\nAlso not new; also mentioned in the Wednesday address: \u201cIn June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi Security Forces.\u201d\n\nYes, Obama said he will now deploy several hundred more \u201cservice members,\u201d and the escalation should not go without notice, but that is what this is \u2014 mission creep, not a policy pivot.\n\nThe president also said the U.S. will aid Kurdish forces \u2014 something the administration stepped up over the summer \u2014 and \u201csupport Iraq\u2019s efforts to stand up National Guard Units.\u201d\n\nI know it\u2019s been a long war, but was that not in the works for, say, the last dozen years?\n\nAnd, as for having \u201cramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition,\u201d as Obama added under this same point, is this after backing off the military assistance to rebels that has in some cases fallen quite neatly into the hands of the Islamic State, or is this just a re-calculation of who the U.S. identifies as \u201cthe good rebels?\u201d And how is this different from the administration\u2019s June request for $500 million to outfit and train non-IS Syrian rebels?\n\n\u201cThird, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks.\u201d Come on! This point has the not-new-ness baked right in! \u201cWe will continue ...\u201d followed in the next sentence by \u201cwe will redouble.\u201d\n\nAnd the same can be said for point number four: \u201cwe will continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organization.\u201d Again, already happening, and, of special note here, there is no language that says this effort will be \u201cramped up.\u201d\n\nEven the point most observers are calling the big policy announcement in this address \u2014 airstrikes on IS inside Syria \u2014 wasn\u2019t actually part of the speech.\n\n\u201cI have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not hesitate to take action\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cI have taken action,\u201d or \u201cI will take action.\u201d The president very well might, but, then again, he might not. Airstrikes in Syria are far more complicated, for both political and logistical reasons, than what has already been done in Iraq. Striking inside Syria will take a lot of under-the-table conversations, and a lot of on-the-ground intelligence and military intervention.\n\nFor all those reasons and more, the U.S. hasn\u2019t flown sorties inside Syrian space yet, and may not even want to in the future. Hesitation, actually, might not only be on tap, it might turn out to be prudent.\n\nSo, what has changed? What justified, in the eyes of this White House, a national primetime address?", "article_metadata": {"description": "President takes to TV to talk foreign policy to an electorate that cares only in that they are unhappy with his", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/9/11/obama-speech-2014election.html", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/blogs/scrutineer/2014/9/11/obama-speech-2014election/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article", "description": "President takes to TV to talk foreign policy to an electorate that cares only in that they are unhappy with his", "title": "Obama speech thinks local, acts global"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/blogs/scrutineer/2014/9/11/obama-speech-2014election/jcr:content/image.img.jpg", "title": "Obama speech thinks local, acts global", "description": "President takes to TV to talk foreign policy to an electorate that cares only in that they are unhappy with his", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "ISIL, Iran, Islamic State, Syria, Iraq, Foreign policy, Election 2014, Barack Obama, Bashar al-Assad, U.S., ISIS", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Good night and good luck: President Obama departs after delivering a live televised address to the nation on his plans for military action against the Islamic State.\nSo, what was Barack Obama doing when he became the fourth consecutive U.S. president to go on primetime television to announce military action in Iraq?\n\u201cI have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,\u201d Obama said.\n\u201cLast month, I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances,\u201d Obama said.\nAirstrikes in Syria are far more complicated, for both political and logistical reasons, than what has already been done in Iraq."}
