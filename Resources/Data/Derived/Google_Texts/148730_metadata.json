If the short circuit occurs, restraint devices including the air bags, pretensioners, and side curtains might not work in a crash.\n\nThe short circuit could also affect the car\u2019s stability control and other systems.\n\nFord Motor Co. says it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem.
