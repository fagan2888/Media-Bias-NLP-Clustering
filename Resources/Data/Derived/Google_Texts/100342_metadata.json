Doesn\u2019t anybody ever stay together anymore? And if love never lasts forever, tell me, what\u2019s forever for?\u201d\n\nThe question posed by Rafe Van Hoy\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Forever For,\u201d made famous by Michael Martin Murphey in 1982, resonates today.\n\nRecently, when a newspaper headline hit my heart, I remembered those lines. The headline read, \u201cFirst gay divorce finalized in Colorado.\u201d The article said a recent court ruling will enable same-sex couples who made vows in another state to divorce here \u201cwithout uprooting their lives.\u201d\n\nJuli Yim and Lorelei Jones entered a legal same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2009. According to Yim, the relationship soured and she found a new partner in Colorado, necessitating dissolution of the Massachusetts marriage. Yim\u2019s was among seven same-sex divorce cases filed here since May 1, when Colorado\u2019s new civil union law took effect.\n\nThe article says Yim plans on marrying her new partner next year, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine either woman finding much to celebrate in making legal history while losing someone she loved.\n\nWhat\u2019s forever for?\n\nWe\u2019ve become a nation bitterly divided over human sexuality, marriage and reproduction, but could we collectively ache for just a moment?\n\nThe national marriage debate rarely considers context. It simply asks whether everyone should have the right to marry who they love. But the first attempt at redefinition occurred well before anyone challenged the historic understanding of marriage. Decades ago, heterosexuals decided to discard marital permanence for a more convenient \u201cno fault\u201d approach to divorce.\n\n\u201cNo fault\u201d sounds a lot like \u201cno worries,\u201d but where sexual relationships are concerned, it\u2019s never that simple. Psychological complications around bonding and breaking wound even the so-called winners.\n\nSadly, human inclinations often derail their best intentions. Infidelity and abuse are tragic realities. That\u2019s why the law, favoring permanence, once protected the vulnerable spouse, usually a woman, from being quickly cast aside for a more appealing partner.\n\nCourts also protected children from hasty marital dissolution. The kids, who often experience devastating emotional trauma when parents decide to split, were thought to deserve more than cavalier consideration about where their pillows would be at night and what kind of financial support they deserved if their parents called it quits.\n\nThe presumption of permanence was inconvenient, but it protected the innocent. It made for a more stable society. It helped those entering marriage to take their vows seriously.\n\nSince the admittedly imperfect time when marital permanence was the norm, advocates of the revolution seduced us into preferring sexual freedom. But each victory along the way has been accompanied by increases in societal instability, emotional insecurity and children\u2019s vulnerability.\n\nOne more win may make headlines, but it won\u2019t make broken hearts mend. Nor will it support our young, many of whom, having experienced more familial disruption than any other generation, have begun to mask the pain of hooking up and breaking up by calling it \u201cthe new normal.\u201d\n\nIt all seems so reasonable. Our sexuality begs to be expressed, and desiring to pursue our passions without shame or legal hindrance, we\u2019ve spent decades pushing against the things that limit our opportunity for perceived happiness. We laugh and we label. We love and we leave.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t anybody ever stay together anymore?\u201d\n\nThe now-classic song reminds those of us who lived through the last few decades that we still long for lasting love. We just haven\u2019t worked very hard to preserve the things that improve our chances.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s forever for?\u201d\n\nA union of love and responsibility.\n\nWe\u2019ve undermined it for too long, and our wounded hearts know it.\n\nPeggy Haslar writes from Monte Vista.
