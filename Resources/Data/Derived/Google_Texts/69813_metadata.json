Since the last election, they have kept Republican campaign offices in 11 states where there are significant Latino populations.\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic community is about trust and being face-to-face,\u201d said Guerra in an interview on Capitol Hill with Fox News Latino. \u201cWe\u2019re getting candidates to go to the communities, to the events, to engage with Hispanics, Otherwise, Hispanics are going to hear about Republicans from Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe DNC is also coming out with a strategy of its own. It is launching the \"Hispanic Caucus,\" and ambitious get-out the vote effort to bolster Latino support for their party's presidential nominee. DNC officials declined to give more details about the caucus. If successful, it could be repeated in other battleground states.\n\nThe 2012 presidential election was a wake-up call for the GOP. President Barack Obama swept up 71 percent of the Latino vote, and his GOP challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney got a paltry 27 percent.\n\nMany surveys of Latino voters revealed that they viewed Republicans as anti-Latino, in no small part because of some harsh rhetoric regarding immigration during the GOP primaries.\n\nRomney, political observers have said, remained something of a caricature or enigma to many Latinos that he never was able to overcome.\n\nLast year, for the mid-term, Republicans tried different strategies, including making Republican candidates more accessible, and more real, so to speak, to Latino voters.\n\nIn Central Florida, where Republicans made concerted efforts to court Latinos, two GOP candidates beat Democratic incumbents.\n\nOne of the victors was GOP candidate Rene Plasencia, a teacher and track coach who won 51 percent of the vote in the congressional district, which has a growing Puerto Rican community. He beat a Democratic incumbent.\n\n\u201cThey did a lot of Hispanic engagement\u201d with the support of the national RNC, Guerra said, \u201cand they defeated Democrat incumbents.\u201d\n\nRepublicans applied a similar approach in Colorado, where U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, a conservative Republican, beat Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Udall in one of the most closely watched races in the nation.\n\nGardner won 51 percent of the vote, and Udall got 43 percent with 71 percent of the precincts reporting.\n\n\u201cWe got them out to community events,\u201d Guerra said about Gardner and U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, who beat the Democratic challenger, Andrew Romanoff, by a large margin.\n\nCoffman and Romanoff made national headlines when they participated in Colorado\u2019s first such all-Spanish political debate on TV. Coffman, who was taking Spanish lessons, agreed to take part even though Romanoff is fluent and, thus, had an edge.\n\n\u201cCoffman still is taking Spanish classes,\u201d Guerra said.\n\nDemocrats balk at the GOP\u2019s plans to improve their image among Latinos.\n\nThey say Latinos will not be fooled by cosmetics. If the basic positions of Republicans continue to be against comprehensive immigration reform and raising the minimum wage and the Affordable Care Act, they will continue to alienate the country\u2019s fastest voting bloc, said Holly Shulman, the national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cIssues matter,\u201d Shulman said to Fox News Latino. \u201cThe reality is people are going to make their selection based on what candidates believe.\u201d\n\nWhen the GOP tells Latinos that theirs is the party that shares with them such things as strong family values, Shulman said, Latinos contrast the rhetoric with the actions GOP lawmakers have taken to deport more people and separate families.\n\n\u201cRepublicans in the last few months have tried to shut down the Department of Homeland Security because they wanted to stop a policy that would keep families together,\u201d she said.\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.
