After last week's mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the debate over whether to remove the flag from the statehouse was reignited.

He said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that investigations often \"do no good\" in encrypted chat rooms, so Americans should be diligent about reporting suspicious activity to the proper authorities because \"we are having a tough time tracking terrorist cells within the United States.\"\n\nUpcoming rulings\n\nThe Supreme Court has 11 rulings left to issue before the end of the month.
