Together, they have overshadowed the rapidly increasing federal debt. Now, with the deficit down from its heights and interest rates up from their lows, a looming menace is becoming clear: The federal government\u2019s increasing debt has created the equivalent of a large, new entitlement-spending program in the form of debt-service costs.\n\nNo longer a peacetime record, the deficit still remains very large. The fiscal 2013 deficit came in at 4.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). While much lower than its 9.8 percent peak in 2009, it is also still much higher than either its 40-year average of 3 percent, calculated by the Congressional Budget Office, or the fiscal 2007 level of 1.1 percent \u2014 the last year before the recession. Had it not been for the large deficits of the previous four years, fiscal 2013\u2019s rate would have been the highest since 1992.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these high deficits have exploded the federal debt. Since fiscal 2007, the federal debt held by the public has more than doubled in absolute terms, rising from just above $5 trillion to just under $12 trillion at fiscal 2013\u2019s close. It also increased sharply as a share of the nation\u2019s economy, climbing from 35.1 percent of GDP to 72.1 percent, according to the Department of Treasury.\n\nIt is surprising, though, that the interest costs of this combination of rapidly increasing deficits and debt has been almost entirely muted by recent record-low interest rates.\n\nAccording to the CBO, fiscal 2007\u2019s net interest on debt held by the public was an enormous $237.1 billion. However, let\u2019s look at what has happened since then: Despite the federal debt more than doubling in both nominal terms and relative to the economy, it was \u201conly\u201d $259 billion last fiscal year.\n\nRapid deficit and debt increases, but declining-to-flat debt-service costs, are more than an oddity. They obscure the looming debt threat to Washington\u2019s budget and America\u2019s economy. To get a sense of just how great this could become, it helps to put it into context:\n\nLast year\u2019s debt-service cost amounted to 1.6 percent of GDP \u2014 lower than the 1.7 percent it was in fiscal 2007. According to the CBO, the federal net interest cost has averaged 2.2 percent of GDP during the past 40 years. Once we see a reversion to the long-term average as interest rates rise, we can expect federal debt service to rise, too. During fiscal 2013, had the rate surpassed its 2.2 percent 40-year average by 0.6 percent of GDP, the deficit would have been 4.7 percent \u2014 its highest level since 1986, when the federal deficit was fueled by a successful push to end the Cold War.\n\nReal as that problem is, federal debt-service costs will not simply return to that level, because the federal debt is much greater now. The federal debt\u2019s 40-year average is 38 percent of GDP, but last fiscal year, it was almost double at 72.1 percent.\n\nFuture debt-service costs will also climb. Raising the 40-year average federal debt-service cost of 2.2 percent by the same factor as the federal debt\u2019s hike would boost federal debt-service costs to a whopping 4.2 percent of GDP \u2014 2.6 percent higher than it was last year.\n\nCombining these two adjustments \u2014 raising federal debt-interest costs to their 40-year average and then adjusting it for the federal debt\u2019s increase \u2014 would add 2.6 percentage points of GDP to last fiscal year\u2019s deficit, raising it to an extremely high 6.7 percent of GDP. At that level, the federal deficit would be the highest of any year in the last 40 \u2014 were it not for those of the previous four years.\n\nSimilarly, converting a federal interest cost of 4.2 percent of GDP in fiscal 2013 into nominal dollars would equal $694 billion, which falls between the two largest federal entitlement programs \u2014 Medicare ($495 billion) and Social Security ($803 billion).\n\nIn effect, Washington has created the equivalent of a new entitlement-spending program, of which we have only seen this large iceberg\u2019s tip.\n\nBefore Washington makes too much noise celebrating the deficit\u2019s decline, it had better be careful to not wake the real monster still slumbering: federal debt-service costs. Once they begin to stir, the federal deficit and the debt will accelerate again very quickly.\n\nJ.T.
