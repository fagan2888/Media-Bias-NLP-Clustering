And he now has enough experience in Washington to effectively work in their best interests.\n\nHe is the best choice for Democratic voters in the March 1 primary over community activist Carlos Quintanilla.\n\nVeasey, 45, of Fort Worth, has generally been a loyal supporter of President Barack Obama \u2014 backing anti-terrorism efforts and the Affordable Care Act. But he\u2019s also shown thoughtfulness and independence, deviating from the party line when he felt it necessary.\n\nFor example, he crossed the aisle and voted for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, saying it was the safest way to transport oil and created jobs.\n\nStill, Veasey\u2019s duties in Washington have not prevented him from being a visible presence in this district, which stretches from east Fort Worth to west Dallas. That\u2019s important to staying grounded in local issues.\n\nQuintanilla, 58, has been a champion of several causes over the years. He was at the center of combating \u201ccheese\u201d heroin in this area and led efforts to bring Breakfast in the Classroom to DISD.\n\nBut his abrasiveness, tendency toward misleading overstatements, and inability to collaborate with others would hinder his ability to represent his district\u2019s interests well.\n\nConsider Quintanilla\u2019s digging in against the USA Freedom Act, whose provisions regarding data searching actually moved toward his interest in restoring citizen privacy. Because the act didn\u2019t give him everything he wanted, he says he would have voted against it altogether.\n\nIt\u2019s this sort of digging in, all-or-nothing attitude and overt dismissal of national security concerns that make him unappealing for public office.\n\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican opposition in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He knows the issues that matter to his constituents and has enough experience in D.C. to work in their best interests.", "og": {"description": "He knows the issues that matter to his constituents and has enough experience in D.C. to work in their best interests.", "title": "Editorial: We recommend Marc Veasey in Democratic race for 33rd Congressional District", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160125-editorial-we-recommend-marc-veasey-in-democratic-race-for-33rd-congressional-district.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160120-voter_id_test_36244139.ece/BINARY/original/VOTER_ID_TEST_36244139", "height": 807}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-25T20:55:29Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-25T20:47:40Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Editorial: We recommend Marc Veasey in Democratic race for 33rd Congressional District\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160125-editorial-we-recommend-marc-veasey-in-democratic-race-for-33rd-congressional-district.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160120-voter_id_test_36244139.ece/BINARY/original/VOTER_ID_TEST_36244139\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2624926\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-25T20:47:40Z\", \"section\": \"Editorials\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160120-voter_id_test_36244139.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/VOTER_ID_TEST_36244139", "publishtime": "2016-01-25T20:47:40Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "After four years representing the 33rd Congressional District, Marc Veasey knows the issues most important to his Fort Worth and Dallas constituents.\nVeasey, 45, of Fort Worth, has generally been a loyal supporter of President Barack Obama \u2014 backing anti-terrorism efforts and the Affordable Care Act.\nStill, Veasey\u2019s duties in Washington have not prevented him from being a visible presence in this district, which stretches from east Fort Worth to west Dallas.\nHe is the best choice for Democratic voters in the March 1 primary over community activist Carlos Quintanilla.\nIt\u2019s this sort of digging in, all-or-nothing attitude and overt dismissal of national security concerns that make him unappealing for public office."}
