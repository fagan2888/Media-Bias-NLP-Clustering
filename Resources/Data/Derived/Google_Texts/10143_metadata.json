The goal is to raise $25,000 to cover the cost of sending 10 art therapy students to Cambodia in the summer, where they'll work mainly with an organization that helps children and women who are victims of sex trafficking.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's an amazing cause,\u201d said Kelly Watt, who works in admissions at Naropa, as she added more color to the canvas. Erin Boylan, foreground, and Ida Drey add their contribution during the last nine hours of a painting marathon. The MA Transpersonal Counseling Psychology program within Naropa University's Graduate School of Psychology held its third annual 48-Hour Painting Marathon. The project raises money for a summer service learning project to Cambodia.

Children also had their own small canvas to paint.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, four people formed an a cappella group that improvised based on the painting, singing to each canvass and even the 40-plus plastic tubs of different colors of paint on a table.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's magic,\u201d said Sue Wallingford, a Naropa professor who spearheads the art marathon and Cambodia trip. \u201cI'm so, so proud of what they've done.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe top three donors to the fundraiser will get the finished canvases, which will be on display for the next week. The deadline to donate is Nov. 18.\n\n\n\nFor the Cambodia trip, the plan is to spend most of the time working with the Cambodian Women's Crisis Center, which helps victims of the sex trade. The main goal is to teach the clinical some of the basics of art therapy and to use art themselves for self-care.\n\n\n\nThey'll also work with an organization where women make and sell handicrafts, helping them make a craft, buying them and then bringing them back here to sell.\n\n\n\n\u201cStudents get an amazing experience,\u201d Wallingford said. \u201cWe want to really try to make a difference in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo donate, go here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 48 hours this weekend, more than 100 volunteers added to three large canvasses being painted with a mandala theme in a marathon to raise money for a Naropa University art therapy service learning trip.The event, organized by professor Sue Wallingford and students in the art therapy program, is in its third year.
