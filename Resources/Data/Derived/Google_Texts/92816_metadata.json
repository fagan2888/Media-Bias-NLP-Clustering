For now, the nonprofits must object in writing to an insurer or third-party administrator, or to the Department of Health and Human Services, so that other people can manage and pay for the coverage while the nonprofits themselves do nothing.\n\nMany religious nonprofits say the forms serve as triggers for services to which they object.\n\nPriests for Life has asked the D.C. Circuit to hear their case en banc, with a full slate of judges.\n\nIn its response Thursday, the administration said the nonprofits may opt out, but their role stops there.\n\n\u201cOn plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning, a conscientious objector to the draft can not only can refrain from serving himself, but can also allege that his religion is substantially burdened if the government drafts a replacement to serve instead,\u201d the government wrote.\n\nPriests for Life does not have to comply with the prior ruling while their appeal is pending, and the group has said it would refuse to anyway.\n\n\u201cIt makes no difference whether plaintiffs must pay for the contraceptive coverage,\u201d the ministry\u2019s attorneys said in court papers. \u201cWhat matters is that, in their religious judgment, it would be immoral for them to contract with a vendor that will provide the offending coverage to their plan beneficiaries.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration said Thursday that faith-based nonprofits should comply with Obamacare's birth control mandate because they enjoy much greater leeway than the corporations that sued and won before the Supreme Court last year.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration said Thursday that faith-based nonprofits should comply with Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate because they enjoy much greater leeway than the corporations that sued and won before the Supreme Court last year.", "title": "Hobby Lobby ruling on birth control doesn\u2019t apply to religious groups, feds say", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/15/hobby-lobby-ruling-birth-control-doesnt-apply-reli/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/15/birth-control.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/15/birth-control.jpg", "title": "Hobby Lobby ruling on birth control doesn\u2019t apply to religious g", "description": "The Obama administration said Thursday that faith-based nonprofits should comply with Obamacare's birth control mandate because they enjoy much greater leeway than the corporations that sued and won b", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Religion Belief, Law Crime, Barack Obama, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0be7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUnlike plaintiffs here, the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby were closely held for-profit companies that were not eligible for the accommodations,\u201d the government\u2019s attorneys said.\nBut the administration said nonprofits should not expect the Hobby Lobby case to bail them out.\nMany religious nonprofits say the forms serve as triggers for services to which they object.\nThe group says the November decision contradicted the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, which said closely held corporations did not have to insure contraceptives that conflicted with their owners\u2019 beliefs, particularly morning-after pills that some equate with abortion.\n\u201cIt makes no difference whether plaintiffs must pay for the contraceptive coverage,\u201d the ministry\u2019s attorneys said in court papers."}
