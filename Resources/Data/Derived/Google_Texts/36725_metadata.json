Jim Fannin (Photo: Gannett Louisiana file photo)\n\nState Rep. Jim Fannin, R-Jonesboro, has announced he will run for the Senate District 35 seat in the fall elections.\n\nFannin currently represents District 13, which includes sections of Winn, Bienville, Jackson and Ouachita parishes.\n\nHe is chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget.\n\n\"I will listen to the people like I always have and do my very best to represent their voice in Baton Rouge,\" Fannin said. \"This job doesn't belong to me; it belongs to the people. I'll continue to work hard to earn their trust for a few more years.\"\n\nFannin announced his candidacy for the Senate District 35 seat, currently held by Bob Kostelka, during a Kiwanis Club meeting in Winnfield this week. Kostelka is term-limited from running for the Senate seat, as is Fannin in the House.\n\nSenate District 35 includes parts of Rapides, Grant and Winn parishes in addition to Jackson, Lincoln and Ouachita parishes.\n\nRepublican Stewart Cathey Jr., a small business owner and veteran, said Tuesday he will also run for the seat.\n\n\"We'll be making a formal announcement in the coming weeks, but I do plan to seek the office,\" Cathey said.\n\nState Rep. Jay Morris, R-Monroe, who once considered running, said he instead will focus on re-election to his House District 14 seat.\n\n\"I'm excited about the work I have started and look forward to building on that in the House,\" Morris said.\n\nZach Dasher, the Republican \"Duck Dynasty\" cousin from Calhoun who just missed the runoff in last fall's 5th Congressional District race, said he's undecided.\n\n\"I'm keeping my options open, but right now I'm focused on my new (cyber security) company that I've started,\" he said.\n\nGannett Louisiana reporter Greg Hilburn contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2015/01/13/jim-fannin-to-run-for-senate-district-35-seat/21696239/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "State Rep.
