Dick Durbin movingly described his sick child\u2019s preexisting condition as a reason to support Obamacare last week, but the Illinois Democrat neglected to mention that his late daughter was easily covered by existing insurance, and that he used taxpayer money to reward the hospital that treated her.\n\nDespite her preexisting condition, Christine Durbin, who suffered from a lifelong heart condition and died at age 40 in 2008, was eligible for coverage under existing laws in multiple states, including the senator\u2019s state and the state she ultimately settled in.\n\nDurbin also neglected to mention that he sent his daughter to one of the best children\u2019s hospitals in the country, to which he earmarked millions of dollars from 2002-2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a situation in my family \u2014 a child \u2014 who had serious physical problems, who could not have qualified but for group health insurance available to me as a member of Congress,\u201d Durbin said in response to a pointed question to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\n\u201cIf I had gone on the open market to buy a policy I\u2019m not sure I could have bought one for my family to cover my child,\u201d said Durbin, who was first elected to Congress in 1982 when his Christine was fourteen.\n\nIn fact, Durbin wasn\u2019t sure about buying a policy on the open market because he never had to, having been a state employee from 1969 to 1982 and a federal employee from 1982 to now. His daughter, Christine, who was born in 1968, never went without the cushy government benefits offered to government workers and their families.\n\nState law also addressed the problem of individuals in the open market suffering from preexisting conditions. In 1987, Illinois passed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan (CHIP, which covered any Illinoisan who could not \u201cobtain individual coverage from private insurance companies because of medical conditions.\u201d Thirty-five other states have similar programs, including Maryland, where Christine ultimately settled.\n\nDurbin also sent his daughter to the very expensive Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital for care. Durbin was able to pay Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital back with U.S. taxpayers\u2019 money, giving the hospital over $650,000 in just one earmark in 2002.\n\n\u201cThis new state of the art facility will enhance Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s reputation as one of America\u2019s best pediatric hospitals,\u201d Durbin told the Chicago Tribune in 2012, at the opening of a new 23-story building.\n\nManaged by the politically-connected Crown family, Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital is one of the hospitals that has received the most federal earmarks of any hospital in the country, having received millions from Durbin and then-Sen.
