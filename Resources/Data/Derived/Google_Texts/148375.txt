Patrick O’Shea’s Irish Pub isn’t afraid to say how it really feels about University of Louisville President James Ramsey following his Friday announcement that the men's basketball team would self-impose a postseason ban.

In a move applauded by many of the restaurant's customers Saturday, restaurant owner Tom O’Shea hoisted a banner above its Whiskey Row storefront bearing the words “Ramsey is a coward."

General manager Kelly O’Shea said in a brief interview Saturday her brother erected the banner in support of graduate transfers Damion Lee and Trey Lewis, who now will not have the opportunity to experience their first NCAA tournaments as a result of the ban.

The pub is located across South Second Street from the KFC Yum! Center, where the Cards defeated Boston College 79-47 Saturday afternoon. The restaurant had been busy all day, serving customers who were talking about the ban, Kelly O'Shea said.

“We have not had one person come in not in support of it,” she said.
