It seems like the outfits are getting a makeover all the time, with artistry and an explosion of colors, contemporary designs and patterns.\n\n\u201cPow wow clothes are forever evolving. They are evolving at a faster pace now because of the Internet and social media. These allow dancers across the country to see the changes in dance clothes,\u201d said Michael Knapp, dancer, designer and owner of KQ Designs Custom Beadwork, a studio based in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nIt\u2019s the large competition prize money that has the biggest effect on regalia said Jack Heriard, editor and publisher of Whispering Wind and who also published \u201cThe Evolution of Powwow Dance Clothes\u201d for the Louisiana Indian Heritage Association.\n\n\u201cIt is important to understand that while the clothing worn by today\u2019s pow wow dancers has historical significance, they are ever changing and evolving. What was once considered fashionable in as little as ten years past, may be considered out of style today,\u201d he wrote in a booklet.\n\nICTMN has called on dancers, regalia makers, pow wow organizers and educators to come up with a short list of what was then and now.\n\nHere are four ways regalia has changed throughout the years and how:\n\n1. Economic sense\n\nFactor in the economy, said Heriard. The materials used in regalia change now and then depending on the business cycle.\n\n\u201cThe elimination of beaded women\u2019s leggings in the 1980\u2019s was replaced by leggings decorated with sequins\u2014good example of an economic reality.Ribbon-work applique in place of beadwork on yokes and shawls is another example. As economic times improve beadwork becomes more elaborate and plentiful,\u201d he said.\n\nIn men\u2019s fancy, a pow wow style that became popular in the 1940s and 1950s, a swing in the economy made an impact on the clothing. \u201cThe economy of the 1980s saw the elimination of the beaded harness and the emergence of the applique yoke with fringe and the use of more ribbons on shirts and bustles,\u201d said Heriard.\n\n\u201cAs the economy improved into the 1990s and to the present, beadwork in all its splendor and beauty is back as well as the making of more elaborate bustles. The arm bustles are also back, smaller but reminiscent of the 1940s,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "4 Ways Pow Wow Regalia Has Changed Throughout the Years", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/12/4-ways-pow-wow-regalia-has-changed-throughout-years-155805", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/pow_wow_regalia.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "4 Ways Pow Wow Regalia Has Changed Throughout the Years"}, "abstract": "4 Ways Pow Wow Regalia Has Changed Throughout the Years", "dc": {"title": "4 Ways Pow Wow Regalia Has Changed Throughout the Years"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/12/4-ways-pow-wow-regalia-has-changed-throughout-years-155805", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Larry Yazzie, Jack Heriard, pow wow regalia, Marsha MacDowell, intertribal, fancy dance, jingle dress,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-12T11:24-04:00", "dcterms.title": "4 Ways Pow Wow Regalia Has Changed Throughout the Years"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5816\"", "article_summary": "If you think you\u2019ve seen everything there is to see in pow wow regalia, think again.\nICTMN has called on dancers, regalia makers, pow wow organizers and educators to come up with a short list of what was then and now.\n\u201cPow wow clothes are forever evolving.\n\u201cIt is important to understand that while the clothing worn by today\u2019s pow wow dancers has historical significance, they are ever changing and evolving.\nIn men\u2019s fancy, a pow wow style that became popular in the 1940s and 1950s, a swing in the economy made an impact on the clothing."}
