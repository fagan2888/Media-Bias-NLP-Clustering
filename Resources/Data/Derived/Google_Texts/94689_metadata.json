This is proving especially problematic in rural counties where beneficiaries were moved into HMO-like managed care plans last year.\n\nOfficially, the word from the managed care companies serving Medi-Cal patients in these counties is that \u201cof course there\u2019s access,\u201d said Linda Satchwell, public relations coordinator for Eastern Plumas Health Care, which runs a hospital and clinic in the town of Portola in addition to a few clinics in smaller communities.\n\n\u201cWhat they don\u2019t say is we\u2019ll get it four hours or nine hours away,\u201d she said.\n\nLast fall, California contracted with a handful of insurance companies to supply health care to low-income residents in 28 rural counties, including Plumas, as part of its statewide conversion of Medi-Cal from fee-for-service to managed care.\n\nUnder the transition, patients get care from a provider network that agrees to a per-capita reimbursement rate instead of billing for each service. In theory, the state saves money and the patient gets a coordinated \u201cmedical home\u201d that looks after all health care needs.\n\nJavier Portela, an administrator with the state Department of Health Care Services, said the move to managed care has gone very well.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any access issues or concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nRefusing new patients\n\nBut Mimi Hall, the county\u2019s public health director, said specialists, pharmacists and durable medical equipment providers are refusing new patients or abandoning Medi-Cal altogether, citing long-standing low reimbursement rates and the bureaucratic demands of managed care operations.\n\nThat\u2019s not good news for the more than 3,700 Plumas County residents \u2014 a quarter of the county\u2019s under-65 population \u2014 who now depend on Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid.\n\nMany are now having to travel 230 miles to San Francisco to see specialists referred by their primary care physicians. Because most of them can\u2019t afford to stay in a hotel, a brief appointment can necessitate a nine- or 10-hour round-trip journey. Reno is nearer, but most specialists there no longer accept Medi-Cal patients in their offices because of California\u2019s low reimbursements, local providers and health officials say.\n\nAnd UC Davis Medical Center is also denying a larger percentage of patients, as demand for care eclipses capacity there.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we\u2019re not limitless,\u201d said Dr. J. Douglas Kirk, UC Davis\u2019 chief medical officer. \u201cWe often get many more patients arriving than we have capacity to care for, and that\u2019s getting worse, not better.\u201d\n\nShelly Pendley, 52, who lives with her 9-year-old son in a neat, modest apartment on the main street in East Quincy, said she was desperate to find a specialist when she needed treatment for severe acid reflux several months ago.\n\nAt times, the pain was so bad at night, Pendley stopped breathing, she said. She spent days calling providers, but everyone told her they either didn\u2019t have space for her or didn\u2019t accept Medi-Cal, she said.\n\nEventually, with help from Legal Services of Northern California and a referral coordinator at Plumas District Hospital Clinic, she was able to see a specialist in Sacramento. But, even then, it took months to get an appointment, she said.\n\nWhile Plumas\u2019 sprawling geography and relative isolation make health care access particularly difficult, other counties also report problems.\n\nInsurance isn\u2019t access\n\nJeff Brown, director of Placer County\u2019s Health and Human Services department, described the specialty referral system in his county as \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d\n\nIn Calaveras County, Marcie Caywood, deputy director of the child health and disability prevention program, said, \u201cYou can insure people all day long, and it doesn\u2019t equate to access.\u201d\n\nPortela, of the Department of Health Care Services, said the department will not respond to what he called \u201canecdotal comments from the counties.\u201d\n\nDepartment officials emphasize that they collect data from the plans to ensure they maintain adequate provider networks, and also monitor grievances filed with the state ombudsman. They say they have not noticed a significant increase in complaints.\n\nHall, the Plumas public health director, said she\u2019s been told this before. But, she noted, when an attorney from Legal Services of Northern California visited the county in March, that attorney left with 27 new potential grievance cases after three days.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s gotten worse, and I hope it gets better, but I don\u2019t think it will,\u201d she said.\n\nMedi-Cal managed care has existed for decades in many of the state\u2019s urban and suburban counties, where specialists are more plentiful. Until last year, however, 28 of the state\u2019s most rural counties still continued to operate on a fee-for-service model, in which providers billed the state directly.\n\nIn switching to managed care, the state handed off administration and payment for the program to private insurance companies, which agree to cover services within their own networks of providers. Medi-Cal enrollees in the majority of the new counties can now choose between two insurance companies \u2014 Anthem Blue Cross, or California Health & Wellness. A smaller group of counties is working exclusively with the nonprofit Partnership HealthPlan.\n\nUnder the managed care arrangement, the insurance companies must help patients find doctors and clinics, offer transportation for appointments \u2014 including those hundreds of miles away \u2014 and operate an adequate provider network of at least one physician for every 1,200 patients.\n\nInsurance companies say that they are complying with all of these requirements. But they also say that the state\u2019s Medi-Cal reimbursement rates, which are among the lowest in the country, make it difficult to attract specialists.\n\nIt is a \u201cfundamental problem,\u201d said Patrick Johnston, CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurance companies.\n\n\u201cWe do our best to find primary care physicians and specialists,\u201d said Darrel Ng, a spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross. \u201cWe can\u2019t force providers to provide these services if they choose not to.\u201d\n\nMedi-Cal managed care paid doctors 65 percent less than private insurance for an office visit, according to a July report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. It paid 10 percent less than fee-for-service Medi-Cal.\n\nReferrals needed\n\nSpecialists also find Medi-Cal managed care undesirable because patients can\u2019t see them without a referral from a primary care doctor.\n\nThe switch to managed care also has hurt some rural Medi-Cal patients\u2019 ability to buy medication.\n\nIn Plumas County, two of the five pharmacies there have said they will refuse at least some Medi-Cal insurance plans, said Hall, the public health director.\n\nHarry LeSeur runs Lassen Drug in Chester, serving an area he describes as \u201cabout the size of Los Angeles, except it\u2019s mostly trees, thank God.\u201d He said he has refused to contract with Anthem Blue Cross for Medi-Cal because of the low reimbursement rates along with burdensome administrative requirements.\n\n\u201cThey want everything and want to pay nothing or less than nothing,\u201d he said. He eventually reached an agreement with California Health & Wellness.\n\nMike Kibble, who operates Quincy Drug, a quaint old-time pharmacy adorned with wood siding and antique glass bottles of tinctures, said he has considered leaving Medi-Cal. A month\u2019s supply of loratadine \u2014 generic Claritin \u2014 used to fetch $8.97 under fee-for-service Medi-Cal; now he receives $4.25. Prescription Fluticasone nasal spray used to reimburse at $69.72; now it pays $6.54, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically giving away the prescriptions,\u201d he said.\n\nLower reimbursement\n\nDave Shramel, who runs a durable medical equipment business out of Taylorsville, said reimbursement rates for hospital beds and oxygen tanks have also dropped off.\n\nShramel said under fee-for-service he used to receive $182 a month to deliver oxygen to patients; he now receives $108.26. He anticipates that he may soon be less able to respond to urgent calls for equipment, requiring patients to wait a week or more for a delivery instead of a day or two \u2014 and extending hospital stays.\n\nThe state and managed care plans say that, in rural areas, mail-order medications and medical equipment may sometimes make the most sense. Ultimately, they say, their responsibility is not to keep mom-and-pop businesses afloat but to serve patients.\n\nShramel and Kibble said in many cases, patients are not well served if they can\u2019t get antibiotics, pain medications or hospital beds when they need them.\n\nJocelyn Wiener writes for the California HealthCare Foundation Center for Health Reporting\n\nat USC Annenberg, a news partner\n\nof The San Francisco Chronicle.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "sailthru.author": "By Jocelyn Wiener, CHCF Center for Health Reporting", "description": "Officially, the word from the managed care companies serving Medi-Cal patients in these counties is that \u201cof course there\u2019s access,\u201d said Linda Satchwell, public relations coordinator for Eastern Plumas Health Care, which runs a hospital and clinic in the town of Portola in addition to a few clinics in smaller communities.
