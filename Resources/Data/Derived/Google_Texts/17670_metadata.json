Samuel Forrest, GoFundMe\n\nCountless parents-to-be have said some iteration of the phrase \u201cas long as the baby\u2019s healthy.\u201d But what if it\u2019s not? It\u2019s devastating to find out your child is unhealthy, especially when the entire pregnancy has gone by without any indications of a problem. But these moments are also when the quality of a person is determined. Case in point: The birth of a baby boy with Down syndrome in Armenia, whose parents have now divorced after a dispute over whether he should be kept.\n\n\u201cThis pediatrician walks out of the room with a little bundle \u2014 that was Leo,\u201d the baby\u2019s father Samuel Forrest told ABC News. \u201cShe had his face covered up and hospital authorities wouldn\u2019t let me see him or my wife. When the doctor came out, he said \u2018there\u2019s a real problem with your son.\u2019\u201d After following hospital staff into a private room, they told him Leo had Down syndrome.\n\nIn a country where education and awareness of Down syndrome isn\u2019t as widespread, hospitals\u2019 policies have followed suit \u2014 they give parents the option to give their children away for adoption. Leo\u2019s mother Ruzan Badalyan was onboard with this decision, however, Forrest was not. \u201cThey took me in [to] see him and I looked at this guy and I said, \u2018he\u2019s beautiful \u2014 he\u2019s perfect and I\u2019m absolutely keeping him.\u201d\n\nForrest said the decision to send Leo out for adoption was made behind is back, explaining why he wasn\u2019t initially allowed to see the child or his mother. But the situation took a turn for the worse when Badalyan threatened Forrest with divorce if he didn\u2019t agree, and he didn\u2019t. A week after Leo\u2019s birth on Jan. 21, she had filed for divorce \u2014 she confirmed to ABC News the birth of Leo and her divorce to Forrest, but refused to say anything else.\n\nThe divorce left Forrest essentially helpless, and he\u2019s set up a GoFundMe page to try to get him and his son back to New Zealand, where he\u2019s originally from. \u201cHis Armenian mother and her family abandoned him at birth,\u201d the GoFundMe page says. \u201cHis father, a New Zealander, was no longer welcome in the family home because he wanted to \u2018keep\u2019 Leo. The mother refused to even look at or touch the newborn for fear of getting attached in a society where defects are not accepted, often bringing shame on the family involved.\u201d As of Saturday morning, the page has already raised over $450,000.\n\nDown syndrome affects one in 830 newborns, and currently affects about 250,000 people in the U.S. It\u2019s usually caused by a chromosomal abnormality in which each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 rather than two. This abnormality causes a variety of defects, from heart and digestive abnormalities to delayed development and behavioral problems.\n\nStill, it doesn\u2019t really matter how many of these problems a baby is born with. As Forrest\u2019s GoFundMe page shows, there\u2019s support everywhere you look. Moreover, communities are full of both parent groups and organizations that are there to help \u2014 the National Down Syndrome Society alone says it has 375 local affiliates throughout the U.S. But most importantly, let\u2019s not forget that babies with Down syndrome will grow into adults with feelings, ideas, and beliefs, too.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "down, syndrome, birth, leads, parents, divorcing, after, dispute, over, giving, baby, adoption", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The mother of a newborn with Down syndrome has divorced her husband after he decided to keep the baby rather than giving him up for adoption.", "title": "Dad Forced To Choose Between Wife And Son With Down Syndrome Chooses Son", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/down-syndrome-birth-leads-parents-divorcing-after-dispute-over-giving-baby-adoption-321324", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/leo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The mother of a newborn with Down syndrome has divorced her husband after he decided to keep the baby rather than giving him up for adoption.", "title": "Dad Forced To Choose Between Wife And Son With Down Syndrome Chooses Son", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/down-syndrome-birth-leads-parents-divorcing-after-dispute-over-giving-baby-adoption-321324", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/leo.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/07/leo.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-07T16:18:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-07T16:20:46-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The mother of a newborn with Down syndrome has divorced her husband after he decided to keep the baby rather than giving him up for adoption."}, "article_summary": "The mother of a newborn with Down syndrome has divorced her husband after he decided to keep the baby rather than giving him up for adoption.\nCase in point: The birth of a baby boy with Down syndrome in Armenia, whose parents have now divorced after a dispute over whether he should be kept.\nBut most importantly, let\u2019s not forget that babies with Down syndrome will grow into adults with feelings, ideas, and beliefs, too.\nBut the situation took a turn for the worse when Badalyan threatened Forrest with divorce if he didn\u2019t agree, and he didn\u2019t.\n\u201cHis Armenian mother and her family abandoned him at birth,\u201d the GoFundMe page says."}
