Revisions to the KidCare program will cover children of legal immigrants.\n\n\n\nThere are few things less popular in the GOP than immigration reform. Past flirtations with the policy are being lobbed at presidential candidates, and Florida\u2019s lawmakers are pursuing measures clamping down on so-called sanctuary cities and discouraging Middle Eastern refugees.\n\n\u201cThis bill authorizes and enables the governor to protect Florida from those who would settle here with the intentions of committing acts of war,\u201d Rep. Lake Ray (R-Jacksonville) says. \u201cIt identifies dangerous immigrants, defines as an invader anyone who enters with the intent of committing acts of war, it defines as a restricted person any refugee or immigrant intending to settle in Florida if they come from a location associated with invaders or prospective invaders\u201d\n\nCritics say Ray\u2019s proposal is unlikely to pass constitutional muster, but it speaks to an abiding wariness toward immigration within the GOP. Opposition has found root in fears related to employment, safety and illicit drugs.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say Republicans lack empathy.\n\n\u201cIf these kids were anywhere else\u2014in any of the states that have approved this language\u2014they would be receiving care,\u201d Rep. Jose Diaz (R-Miami) says. \u201cBut unfortunately because of whatever reason, Florida hasn\u2019t been there, but we will be there with your support.\u201d\n\nDiaz is spearheading an expansion of Florida\u2019s KidCare program. It offers subsidized health coverage for kids who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, and under Diaz\u2019s bill children of documented immigrants will be able to get coverage within the program immediately.\n\n\u201cThe genesis of it is really\u2014it\u2019s really driven by the federal government,\u201d Diaz says. \u201cThrough 2009, the population in question\u2014which is lawfully residing citizens, kids that are here legally\u2014would not be entitled to receive federal dollars for things like Medicaid until they were here for five years.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s been a long time coming. KidCare gets most of its funding through a federal plan called the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. It began in 1997, and like Diaz says, it mandated a five year waiting period before documented immigrants could take part in the program. In 2009, Congress passed an expansion allowing states to drop the waiting period\u2014paying for the new enrollees by increasing taxes on cigarettes and tobacco.\n\nNow after years of trying, it appears Florida will join the 20-plus other states that have already removed their waiting periods. Vance Aloupis from the children\u2019s movement of Florida says that\u2019s a pretty big deal for the state.\n\n\u201cI could have very easily waived in support, but I personally and publicly want to thank Representative Diaz for his tireless leadership on this bill,\u201d Aloupis says. \u201cThis bill ensure that 17,000 children in this state who currently may not have a relationship with a pediatrician, may be using emergency rooms as their primary care, are covered.\u201d\n\nAnd those emergency room visits are important. Diaz says the decline in expenditures devoted to emergency care will offset the state\u2019s contribution to program. Rep. Fred Costello (R-Port Orange) commends Diaz for his attention to the balance sheet.\n\n\u201cI guess I have to make one comment. I supported this back when it had a fiscal impact because we\u2019ve got to take care of the kids,\u201d Costello says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine going from $500 million down to almost nothing. You did an amazing job, thanks for everything you did to make this happen.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Diaz again.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons this bill is so important to me is because, you know, I am the child of immigrants, and people who came to this country for all the right reasons and went about the process the right way,\u201d Diaz explains.\n\nThe measure doesn\u2019t expand coverage to undocumented immigrants. It has made it to the floor of both chambers without a no-vote in committee.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The state Legislature is on the verge of extending healthcare to thousands of Florida children.\u00a0 Revisions to the KidCare program will cover children of", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/kidcare-delays-could-be-thing-past", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/465753080.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The state Legislature is on the verge of extending healthcare to thousands of Florida children.\u00a0 Revisions to the KidCare program will cover children of", "title": "KidCare Delays Could Be A Thing Of The Past"}, "story_id": 465753047, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Nick Evans", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "KidCare Delays Could Be A Thing Of The Past"}, "nid": 13545, "datePublished": "2016-02-07", "keywords": "Florida KidCare, Florida Legislature, Florida Legislature 2016", "wordCount": 776, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The state Legislature is on the verge of extending healthcare to thousands of Florida children.\nRevisions to the KidCare program will cover children of legal immigrants.\nKidCare gets most of its funding through a federal plan called the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\u201cBut unfortunately because of whatever reason, Florida hasn\u2019t been there, but we will be there with your support.\u201dDiaz is spearheading an expansion of Florida\u2019s KidCare program.\nPast flirtations with the policy are being lobbed at presidential candidates, and Florida\u2019s lawmakers are pursuing measures clamping down on so-called sanctuary cities and discouraging Middle Eastern refugees."}
