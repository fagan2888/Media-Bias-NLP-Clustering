150 years is a very long time. It's hard to think about all the things that have come and gone in that amount of time. But one church hasn't gone anywhere. In fact, Hickory Baptist Church has grown tremendously. This month, they celebrated 150 years of worship.

The date was September 22, 1865, roughly five months after the end of the Civil War, when Hickory Baptist Church first opened its doors.

"After Grierson’s Raiders destroyed Newton Station. They destroyed the railroad all the way to Chunky. As they were rebuilding the railroad, Clarke had a vision to put churches along the way. This was one of them,” Hickory Baptist Church pastor Randy Rich says.

The man Pastor Rich refers to is Reverend Nathan Lytle Clarke. Clarke led a group of men that helped establish Hickory Baptist Church. Hickory became a town in 1860, and after the Civil War, Rich says merchants began building and Hickory was a business center of sorts.

"So as all of that rebuilt the people who are Baptist formed the church. The Methodist Church was formed. These two churches have been here for a very long time,” Rich says.

After the fire 1924, the congregation met at a local school while a new building was being constructed.

"The white building on the corner was its replacement. It opened in 1925 and it has been since renovated for education space. We still use it every day,” Rich says.

Over the years, and after many cosmetic changes, the Hickory Baptist Church sees just about 200 people every Sunday. That’s a big difference from the 23 members it had in 1879. Pastor Rich says he has been blessed to preach at this historic church for the past few years.

"These people are dedicated. They love the Lord. They’re not your typical Baptist, as the stereotype would go. They’re just good hardworking people. They love each other. They love the community. They’re very committed to missions and reaching out for Jesus wherever they can,” Rich Says.
