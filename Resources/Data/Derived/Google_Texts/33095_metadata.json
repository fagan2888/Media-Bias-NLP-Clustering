Trey Gowdy doesn\u2019t think the GOP\u2019s \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d strategy turned out to be such a smart plan.\n\n\u201cWhat did Republicans get for 16 days of a government shutdown with people being hurt? We have absolutely nothing to show for it, other than a damaged brand,\u201d the tea party favorite told The Greenville News, noting that Republicans were ultimately forced to capitulate to the president.\n\nGowdy said that the GOP ended up worse off after the 16-day shutdown than the party had been beforehand.\n\n\u201cWe had a government shutdown, we were at the precipice of hitting the debt ceiling and our strategy \u2014 or the strategy of some \u2014 has resulted arguably in (more of) a worst-case scenario than where we were on Oct. 1,\u201d he said.\n\nThe failure of the strategy, which Gowdy voted along with, has prompted reflection by the congressman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to cast stones,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to go home and work on being more persuasive myself, and hopefully my colleagues will have a period of self-reflection and evaluate why they\u2019re in public service as well.\u201d\n\nWhile poll numbers for President Obama and Democrats in Congress dropped during the shutdown, the opinion of Republicans in Congress suffered the worst. The public generally pinned most the blame for the shutdown on the GOP, according to polls.\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken during the shutdown even found President Obama\u2019s health-care law shot up in the public\u2019s estimation during the shutdown, despite the troubled launch of Obamacare\u2019s online exchanges. Before the shutdown, just 31 percent of the public said Obamacare was a \u201cgood idea,\u201d while during the shutdown 38 percent of the public indicated they thought the law was a \u201cgood idea.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Greenville News, Gowdy was also critical of President Obama\u2019s reluctance to negotiate with Republicans over changes to Obamacare, suggesting that it would be more difficult now for the GOP to work with the president on an immigration reform bill.\n\n\u201cI think there is less trust now than in the three years I\u2019ve been here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I hear the president say immigration reform is coming next? No, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "South Carolina Republican Rep.
