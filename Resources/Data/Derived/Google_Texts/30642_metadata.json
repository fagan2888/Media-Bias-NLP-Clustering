This gives those who cannot attend meetings an opportunity to listen to proceedings.\n\nFinancial audits and the county budget in its entirety are also now posted and residents now have the ability to file documents online.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, Wagoner County\u2019s website has been honored by the Sunshine Review, an agency which monitors governmental transparency, with an A- rating.\n\nFiscal responsibility is a strong focus and Hendricks noted the county clerk is largely responsible for putting together budgetary documentation for the governing boards.\n\nShe now provides this information on a five year trend to allow leaders to make better fiscal decisions for the county.\n\nHendricks said purchasing procedures have been improved by competitively shopping more than what is required by statute. This ensures citizens are getting the most for their tax dollars.\n\nHendricks said she and her staff have continued to train with the Oklahoma State University county officers training program. She and several of her staff have achieved the highest level of certification and Hendricks now serves on the program\u2019s advisory board.\n\nKnowing that Oklahoma is no stranger to natural disaster, Hendricks\u2019 latest endeavor is to ensure all county records are stored electronically and backed up redundantly off-site.\n\n\u201cYou cam be confident that your records are now fully recoverable should we ever experience a catastrophic event at the courthouse,\u201d the county clerk assured.\n\nHendricks has served on a number of organizational boards including the Tulsa Youth Lacrosse Association, the Broken Arrow Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Magalassi Memorial Scholarship Foundation which promotes teen suicide awareness and prevention.\n\nShe and her husband Steve have been married for 25 years and have made their home in Broken Arrow since 1996. Together they have three children and two grandchildren.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "lori hendricks,county clerk,www.lorihendricks.com,the sunshine review,sunshine review,wagoner county,government,news,local", "og": {"site_name": "Wagoner Tribune", "description": "Wagoner County Clerk Lori Hendricks has announced her bid for re-election.", "title": "Lori Hendricks seeks re-election as Wagoner County Clerk", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/communities/wagoner/government/lori-hendricks-seeks-re-election-as-wagoner-county-clerk/article_dbaae8ce-7668-518f-bcbb-2aa6cd67483d.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/b8/9b8be2b7-3277-54c7-bf07-8679396f6369/571c74584e2d8.preview-100.jpg?resize=200%2C250", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "lori hendricks,county clerk,www.lorihendricks.com,the sunshine review,sunshine review,wagoner county,government,news,local", "description": "Wagoner County Clerk Lori Hendricks has announced her bid for re-election."}, "article_summary": "Wagoner County Clerk Lori Hendricks has announced her bid for re-election.\n\u201cYou cam be confident that your records are now fully recoverable should we ever experience a catastrophic event at the courthouse,\u201d the county clerk assured.\nFiscal responsibility is a strong focus and Hendricks noted the county clerk is largely responsible for putting together budgetary documentation for the governing boards.\nInitially running on a promise to increase transparency, Hendricks has made improving the county website a priority.\nHendricks said she and her staff have continued to train with the Oklahoma State University county officers training program."}
