The legislature finally managed to do the almost impossible: provide financing for the new "Arkansas Works" Obamacare medical program for low income people.

I would like to think that once the names of the 10 obstructionist senators who were against it were published in the papers, they started receiving calls from the voters.

Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway, who was for Arkansas Works, would voice an objection that it would pay for a "morning after" anti-pregnancy pill. We see too many state legislators attempting to pass these types of fanatical Taliban Christian bills.

The state has had to pay out over $100,000 in lawyers fees to the attorneys who sued in court to stop them and won. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, would not even allow the pill if rape has occurred. In almost all cases a condom broke during sex, and the pill was given within 12 hours almost guarantees that conception will not happen. It becomes less effective within the next five days and cannot be used to abort a later term pregnancy.

AfterPill.com is a web site that will ship the morning pill for about $25 to bypass the legislative fanatics. It's sort of like having a first-aid kit in the car. You may never need it, but it's good to have, just in case.
