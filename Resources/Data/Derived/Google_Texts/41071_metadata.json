Julian Nunez probably won't remember the red Santa costume he wore to visit Santa on Sunday, or that he took a break from his complacent expression to grin for just a moment when asked what he wanted for Christmas, but his family will remember the way he snuggled into Santa's beard. The 3-month-old visited Santa with his parents, Ashley Ferguson and Rafael Nunez, and other relatives Sunday afternoon at the Promenade Shops at Centerra. When Santa held the newborn as his many relatives snapped photos, Julian yawned and curled into Santa's red coat and beard. \"I know he looks like a mini you but you cannot keep him,\" Mrs. Claus said with a grin from the sidelines. His parents are starting a new tradition at Christmas now that they have Julian: They plan to take impressions of his feet or hands for ornaments every year. They've already done feet for this year. \"As he gets bigger, we'll probably have to switch to hands,\" Ferguson said. After Santa relinquished the baby back to them, Ferguson said, \"You did so good, baby,\" as they walked away. Mrs. Claus said that around 400 children visited Santa on Saturday and she had already seen around 200 by 2:15 p.m. on Sunday. She said that a lot of children are asking for anything from the movie \"Frozen\" this year, especially the snowman Olaf, and also Legos, Star Wars and Monster High dolls. Santa Claus leads children with actions in singing \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" at the Promenade Shops at Centerra on Sunday afternoon. Santa has his workshop there every weekend until Dec. 21. (Jessica Benes / Loveland Reporter-Herald) \"You also still get the popular trains, race cars, etc,\" she said. A shy Madeline Davis, 6, and a shyer Samantha Davis, 4, explained that Santa will come to the house by driving in his sleigh on Christmas Eve. \"We don't have a chimney at our mom's house but we do at our dad's,\" Madeline said. Madeline asked Santa for \"a baby Elsa doll and a Elsa dress\" from \"Frozen.\" Samantha, in just a whisper, asked for a trampoline and a Barbie. When asked what Santa does, 7-year-old Cameron Priest said clearly with a shrug, \"I have no idea.\" \"What does Santa do at Christmas Eve? You know what he does!\" his mother, Noelle Ruggles, said. Mrs. Claus, helpfully standing nearby, leaned over and whispered in Cameron's ear to prompt him. \"He brings presents on Christmas,\" Cameron said in a small voice. Cameron asked for a Nerf gun and a car set, and he plans to leave out cookies and oranges for Santa. Santa Claus also took periodic breaks from interacting with, and joking, with children who came to visit him. He invited children forward to sing songs like \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and \"Jingle Bells\" with actions. Neighbors Jayden Douglas and E.J. Dotson were excited about what they wanted to ask Santa. Jayden wants a purple laptop, a purple iPad or a video game. And E.J. hopes for an Xbox video game, Madden 15. After Jayden's visit with Santa, Santa handed him a candy cane and said, \"You have to promise you will brush your teeth and not end up with reindeer breath!\" The two boys go to different schools \u2014 Jayden is at Immanuel Lutheran and E.J. at Carrie Martin \u2014 but both said they have similar Christmas projects at school. Immanuel does an Angel Tree and Carey Martin has a Giving Tree where families are adopted and presents bought for children who might not otherwise receive them.
