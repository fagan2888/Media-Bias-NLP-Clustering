Sioux Falls, SD

After a successful Big Sioux River Greenway Clean-up event last year, the city of Sioux Falls is hoping to present a bigger and better event for 2015.

The city is seeking volunteers to participate in the 2015 Big Sioux River Greenway Clean-up on Saturday, May 16 from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.

At last year's event, nearly two tons of garbage and 260 pounds of recyclables were cleaned up from the Big Sioux River with the help from several organizations and an estimated 200 volunteers.

“The Big Sioux River is an incredible asset to Sioux Falls, and this cleanup event is a great way for the entire community to get outside and make a difference. Our goal is to get the river and its banks in top-notch shape for summer activities and to improve the water quality of this critical natural resource,” Matthew Gedney, Environmental Analyst said in a press release.

You can contact the Public Works Environmental Division at 605-367-8276 if you are interested in participating.
