So let\u2019s get rolling.\n\n1. Michelle Obama and those suspicious-looking communist flags\n\nA chain email circulated recently showing First Lady Michelle Obama waving a red flag in each hand during a March 2014 trip to China. A reader wanted PolitiFact National to gauge the accuracy of a superimposed caption reading, \u201cMichelle Obama waves red communist flags on her taxpayer-funded visit to China.\u201d\n\nSnopes.com beat us to the check, but PolitiFact\u2019s own investigation showed that Obama\u2019s \u201cflag-waving\u201d took place innocently enough during a folk-dancing demonstration. The flags turned out to be long red banners and the claim was rated Pants on Fire.\n\n2. All those carriers, suspiciously together again\n\n\n\nA second chain email labeled President Barack Obama irresponsible for ordering five aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval base together \u2013 purportedly the first time this has been done since World War II.\n\nThe rendezvous, it turned out, took place in 2012, a similar grouping that took place at the base in 1997. The reason for the group? So naval personnel could spend time with their families. The claim earned a False.\n\n3. The Kochs show off their environmental cred\n\n\n\nThe once-reclusive Koch brothers suddenly seem to be everywhere these days. Charles Koch, in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, defended Koch Industries and their subsidiaries from attacks, saying, \u201cEPA officials have commended us for our \u2018commitment to a cleaner environment\u2019 and called us \u2018a model for other companies.\u2019\u201d\n\nPolitiFact\u2019s check showed that the EPA was focusing on very limited aspects of Koch Industries and not the company as a whole. Further, Koch Industries has a history with the EPA that was completely glossed over, and it includes multiple violations of rules. Koch\u2019s claim was rated Mostly False.\n\n4. Rubio on Obamacare: It's coming up short\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, recently proclaimed that the Affordable Care Act was falling short of its goals. It was supposed to cover 30 million people, he said, not the six or seven million who have signed up so far.\n\nRubio does have a point that many Americans will remain uninsured under the reform, but the White House did, indeed, hit its stated goal of 7 million enrollees by the March 31 deadline. Many millions more are expected to enroll in Obamacare in months and years to come.\n\n5. Florida and its two dueling governors\n\n\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Charlie Crist adores Obamacare and isn\u2019t afraid to say it. In the same breath, he alleges that his Republican opponent, incumbent Gov. Rick Scott, wanted to go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nPolitiFact Florida could not find many comments from Scott about pre-existing conditions, but he does support tax breaks that would leave those who end up uninsured for more than a few months in danger of being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. The story\u2019s diagnosed the claim as Mostly True.\n\nSo there you have it, today\u2019s roundup. Thoughts? Anything we missed? Toss your comments our way and let\u2019s start talking.\n\n-- Dana Tims\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "politifact florida, politifact national, politifact oregon, politifact oregon roundup, news", "title": "Michelle Obama, Charles Koch, Marco Rubio: PolitiFact Oregon Roundup", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Michelle Obama and her \"communist flag-waving,\" Charles Koch's green industry practices and Marco Rubio on the Affordable Care Act.
