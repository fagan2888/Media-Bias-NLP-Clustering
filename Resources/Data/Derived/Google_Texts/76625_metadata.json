And, sure, that's sad for any individual snake, but Ward is most worried about the entire population of northern pine snakes. Pine snakes are a threatened species in South Jersey, and you'd have to travel to North Carolina to see next closest population.\n\nSo why do these reptiles cross the road? At this time of year, pine snakes are looking for places to nest. Sometimes the best spot is on the other side of the Garden State Parkway or the Atlantic City Expressway.\n\n\"Females may spend most of their time in a forest but then when they need to build this nest they will actually find an open sandy patch and they will place their eggs in that for better incubation,\" Ward said.\n\nFrom 60 to 100 adult snakes in the area may be lost each year to road kills or habitat changes, Ward said. He and his mentor Bien are both state-certified snake surgeons. The reptiles they track each have an implanted radio transmitter.\n\nWard hopes Drexel's work will spark more discussion about protection efforts and policies.\n\nOne idea: Some conservationists would like to build culverts, tunnels or alternatives paths to direct wildlife traffic away from busy roadways.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe \"Snake Crossing\" signs along the highway would encourage speeding drivers to slow down.\n\nThe snakes have a brown base color similar to the color of dead pine needles and black blotches that look like burnt pine combs. They've evolved to camouflage nicely in the forest, but stand out on the roadway.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Biologists at Drexel University are championing the cause of the northern pine snake which often ends up as road kill during the summer The snakes make their home in the Pine Barrens which some", "title": "Drexel trying to make roads safe for snakes near the Pine Barrens", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "Biologists at Drexel University are championing the cause of the northern pine snake, which often ends up as road kill during the summer.\r The snakes make their home in the Pine Barrens, which..."}, "twitter": {"description": "Biologists at Drexel University are championing the cause of the northern pine snake, which often ends up as road kill during the summer.\r The snakes make their home in the Pine Barrens, which...", "creator": "@taunyaenglish", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_pine-snake-closeup-2x1200.jpg", "title": "Drexel trying to make roads safe for snakes near the Pine Barrens", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-07", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/healthscience/70046-drexel-trying-to-make-roads-safe-for-snakes-near-the-pine-barrens", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "author": "Taunya English", "keywords": "snakes, their, snake, drexel, pretty, about, northern, sandy, travel, species, would, highway, state, which, population, barrens, color, forest, reptiles, looks", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_pine-snake-closeup-2x1200.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde135\"", "article_summary": "At this time of year, pine snakes are looking for places to nest.\nBiologists at Drexel University are championing the cause of the northern pine snake, which often ends up as road kill during the summer.\nAnd, sure, that's sad for any individual snake, but Ward is most worried about the entire population of northern pine snakes.\nPine snakes are a threatened species in South Jersey, and you'd have to travel to North Carolina to see next closest population.\nThe rare ecosystem in the Pine Barrens is home to several species that don't live anywhere else, Ward said."}
