SEATTLE — Training camp moves in whispers and Twitter pics. The NFL conducts business with a veil of secrecy befitting an upcoming invasion. Generalities rule. Conclusions difficult to draw.

In spring training, I was practically in the batter’s box as prospects Jon Gray and Eddie Butler threw side sessions. Baseball spring training is sun screen, flip flops and talking swings behind the cage. Football training camp is license-and-registration sunglasses.

With that, there was news Sunday night as my colleague Mike Klis chronicled. The Broncos released their depth chart.
