But he said the Interfaith Alliance is an excellent match.\n\n\u201cI know this organization. I love this organization,\u201d said Moline, who chaired its board from 2006-2008 and was on the search committee that picked the alliance\u2019s last leader, the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, who stepped down in December after 16 years. \u201cWe will not lose any momentum as we continue to protect faith and freedom, challenge extremism and build common ground.\u201d\n\nSaid Gaddy of Moline: \u201cWhen you care about an organization and its mission like I do, knowing that organization is in good hands is very satisfying, comforting and exciting.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased to have a leader with his qualities guiding the direction of an organization whose mission is probably more important today than it was when it was founded,\u201d Gaddy continued.\n\nDefenders of church-state separation have become alarmed in recent years as more people, waving the banner of religious liberty, have waged campaigns to keep religion firmly planted in the public square.\n\nAn example is the Hobby Lobby case, in which a business owner refused to comply with all provisions of the Affordable Care Act, citing his faith. The Supreme Court sided with the business; the Interfaith Alliance supported the Obama administration.\n\nOther issues the Interfaith Alliance lobbies on include women\u2019s rights, LGBT rights and anti-bigotry education. The nonprofit operates on about $1 million a year.\n\nMoline was ordained in the Conservative stream of Judaism, which sits between the liberal Reform and the traditional Orthodox movements in its interpretation of Jewish law. He has advised many in higher office, including former President Clinton, on questions of policy as well as personal matters.\n\nMoline ruffled some feathers while at the NJDC, criticizing two major Jewish groups \u2014 the American Jewish Committee and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee \u2014 which, he said, applied too much pressure to congressional Democrats to oppose President Obama\u2019s strategy on Iran. He also said the Democratic Party had not done enough to mobilize Jewish voters in key states, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Jewish Social Justice Organizations Jewish Social Justice Organizations\n\n1 of 8 Jewish Farm School The Jewish Farm School is dedicated to teaching about contemporary food and environmental issues through innovative trainings and skill-based Jewish agricultural education.
