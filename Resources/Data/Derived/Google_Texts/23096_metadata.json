Ted Cruz lit up the Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday: \u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d he told conservative activists before he slipped in a Biblical allusion: \u201cThe Word tells us you will know them by their fruit.\u201d That is, the proof\u2019s in the pudding.\n\nAnd Cruz was just getting rolling; he challenged his potential rivals for the 2016 Republican nomination to, in effect, put up or shut up:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIf you say you oppose the president\u2019s unconstitutional executive amnesty, show me where you stood up. If you say you support life and you support marriage, show me were you stood up and fought. If you say you say you\u2019ll stand up to the Washington establishment, the career politicians of both parties that got us in this mess, then show me where you stood up and fought.\n\nCruz received massive applause when he called for the complete repeal of Obamacare, the lockdown of the US-Mexico border, the rollback of EPA, and the abolition of the IRS.\n\nOf course, other GOPers, also in Des Moines on Saturday, made similar points in their speeches, and other GOPers have also walked the walk.\n\nStill, Cruz\u2019s analysis is worth examining, because he is perhaps the most articulately consistent in making the the \u201cstand up\u201d point and explaining what it means for the 2016 general election. As Cruz says, activist can\u2019t let the leadership say one thing and do another. Indeed, in the wake of the recent fiasco over the fetal-pain legislation in the House, Cruz\u2019s critique takes on new force.\n\nSo even those Republicans who might not support his candidacy should consider his argument about winning a year from November.\n\nAt the Myrtle Beach Tea Party gathering on the 18th, Cruz made fun of \u201cWashington Graybeards\u201d\u2014his term for the loss-prone elite Republican consultant class\u2014for giving the rest of us lectures on how to win elections. Their advice, Cruz continued, always seems to be that the GOP should move to the \u201cmushy middle.\u201d\n\nTo which Cruz answered: \u201cIf we nominate another candidate in the mold of Bob Dole or John McCain or Mitt Romney, the same people who stayed home in 2008 and 2012 will stay home in 2016 and the Democrats will win again.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Republicans losing, we should remember that it was less than two years ago, in the wake of Romney\u2019s defeat, that the DC Graybeards at the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an \u201cautopsy\u201d report\u2014that was their chosen phrase\u2014for the GOP. And one of their signature conclusions was that in order to win, the GOP had to move to the middle, notably on immigration.\n\nYet interestingly, as we know, spurred by grassroots activists, the GOP mostly went in the opposite direction, towards a more hawkish position on border security\u2014and won big in the 2014 midterms.\n\nSo who\u2019s right today? Cruz? Or the Beltway Graybeards? In seeking the answer to this question, we might bear in mind that the fate of the Republican Party in 2016\u2014an election that RNC chairman Reince Priebus calls \u201cdo or die\u201d for the Party\u2014is hanging in the balance.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a closer look at this matter of the mushy middle. Is it the path to triumphing victory? Or the way to drowning defeat? (Cruz has also used the word \u201cmilquetoast\u201d as a synonym for \u201cmushy middle,\u201d but for the moment, we\u2019ll stick with \u201cmushy middle.\u201d)\n\nAs a matter of simple mathematics, the Graybeards might seem to have a point: It is necessary for a political aspirant to win a majority of the two-party vote\u2014and yes, that means winning the middle quintile of voters. But politics is a bit more complicated than mathematics: Sometimes, to win, one must start out at the edge, build a strong base, and then work to win over the middle.\n\nWe can find proof of that point in Cruz\u2019s own electoral career.\n\nIn 2012, Cruz\u2014never before elected to anything more than the editorship of the Harvard Law Review\u2014entered Texas\u2019 GOP Senate primary to succeed the retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison; his principal opponent was David Dewhurst, the longtime Lieutenant Governor. Dewhurst was not only the choice of the Austin GOP Establishment, but he was also a wealthy \u201cself-funder.\u201d And so of course he was the early favorite. Indeed, a poll taken in November 2011, six months before the primary, showed Dewhurst ahead of Cruz, 50 percent to six percent. Underfunded, Cruz was the decided underdog; yet he kept on going\u2014and gaining.\n\nIn the primary balloting in May 2012, Dewhurst held the lead, with 44 percent of the vote, but Cruz had pulled to a relatively close second, at 34 percent. And crucially, the frontrunner had fallen below the 50 percent threshold, and so Dewhurst and Cruz both moved on to the runoff. In that second vote, in July, Cruz came from behind and bested Dewhurst, 57 percent to 43 percent. It was an astounding victory for Cruz\u2014and proof that the Tea Party still had its mojo.\n\nAnd then, of course, in the November 2012 general election balloting, Cruz defeated Democrat Paul Sadler, 56:40\u2014a margin of slightly more than 16 points. In other words, the \u201cmushy middle\u201d rallied to Cruz, in both the primary and the general. So much for the idea that one must start in the middle to win the middle. Instead, Cruz did it his way: He built a rock-hard base on the right, and then, from that fortress, he ventured out to win over centrists.\n\nWe have seen this argument\u2014mushy middle vs. rock-hard base\u2014played out before.\n\nNearly half a century ago, Ronald Reagan was derided by the GOP Graybeards of his day as too \u201cright-wing\u201d to be electable. Yet the Gipper proved the insiders wrong: Coming from nowhere, he won the 1966 Republican gubernatorial primary, and then went on to win the general election by a million votes. It was the first time since 1954 that Republicans had won the Sacramento statehouse.\n\nThen, in the 1970s, as Reagan geared up to run for the White House, the same argument\u2014mushy middle vs. rock-hard base\u2014played out again. In 1975, Reagan spoke to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC, declaring, \u201cOur people look for a cause to believe in.\u201d But what sort of cause? What message would galvanize the voters? His answer: In making the case to the nation, Republicans don\u2019t need \u201cpale pastels,\u201d but rather \u201cbold colors, which make it unmistakably clear where we stand on all of the issues troubling the people.\u201d\n\nThat was the Reagan idea: bold colors, another way of saying rock-hard-base. It was the same idea that George Washington had outlined two hundred years before when he declared, \u201cLet us raise a standard to which the wise and the honest can repair.\u201d\n\nReagan made his bold-colors argument when he challenged Gerald Ford for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination. As we know, Reagan fell short in that campaign, but the results of the 1976 general election, Ford vs. Democrat Jimmy Carter, speak to the wisdom of the mushy middle strategy.\n\nIf the only thing that mattered was grabbing for the mushy middle, Ford should have done fine. After all, he agreed with Carter on many of the biggest issues of the day, including better relations with the Soviet Union, passage of the Panama Canal Treaty, and \u201cchoice\u201d on abortion. Moreover, during the \u201976 Republican primaries, Ford had relentlessly attacked Reagan\u2019s plan for a 25 percent cut in federal spending; so by that logic, Ford went into the general election as a staunch defender of the federal status quo.\n\nIn other words, by any reckoning, Ford was firmly ensconced in the mushy middle. And yet, of course, Carter won the election. And how did a former one-term governor of Georgia defeat an incumbent president? Answer: Carter was the fresh face, the new broom; he promised, among other strategies, a new approach to controlling federal spending, which he called \u201czero-based budgeting.\u201d Now some will say that Carter was too incompetent or dishonest to accomplish anything good, but that became obvious only in retrospect. All that the voters knew in 1976 was that Carter was claiming the mantle of energetic reform.\n\nJerry Ford was a good man, but not a strong candidate. And so, like Bob Dole, John McCain, and Mitt Romney, he lost to the Democrats.\n\nSo now we can see better the consequences of the two Republican visions: Cruz in Texas in 2012, and Ford in the national election of 1976. That is, mushy middle vs. rock-hard base. Now of course, some will say that the two elections are not comparable, because Cruz was running in just the state of Texas, whereas Ford was running nationwide. That\u2019s a fair point, all about comparing apples to oranges. So let\u2019s compare apples to apples: two presidential elections, back to back. Yes, let\u2019s enter into evidence the 1980 election, in which the same Ronald Reagan\u2014he of the rock-hard base of \u201cbold colors\u201d\u2014ran against Carter, and won in a landslide. In other words, the mushy middle that rejected Ford in 1976 turned around and embraced Reagan in 1980.\n\nThe lesson of history is clear: Yes, elections are won in the mathematical middle, but a strong candidate, with a strong message, can transform the political mathematics.\n\nSo now we can take a look at the likely politics of 2016: In many ways, the two parties would seem to be evenly matched; the Democrats won the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, while the Republicans won the 2010 and 2014 midterms. (And as we consider the fact that the GOP has more seats in the House than any time in nearly a century, we can recollect, once again, the folly of the RNC\u2019s \u201cautopsy\u201d report.)\n\nIndeed, if we drill down on some of the issues of 2016, it\u2019s evident that the country is not only deeply divided, but moving in different directions\u2014in some places to the left, in some places to the right.\n\nFor example, on certain issues, such as gay marriage and marijuana legalization, the country is clearly moving to the left\u2014or, if one prefers, to a more libertarian stance.\n\nMeanwhile, on other issues, the picture is mixed: On taxes and economics and income distribution, many Americans are rallying to, say, the message of Elizabeth Warren, while others are saying, \u201cNot one more dime should go to DC!\u201d So which side has the edge, issue-wise? The fact that the Obama administration chose to make its 2015 State of the Union message an exercise in class-warfare suggests that it\u2019s confident that the polling data are on its side.\n\nIn response to this class-warfare onslaught, Republicans should of course stand strong for free enterprise and limited government. Yet at the same time, we might ask ourselves: At a time when the top 1 percent are said to own half the world, will Republicans be at an advantage, or disadvantage, 2016-wise, if the battleground is the Obama plan to raise taxes on the one percent and cut taxes for the middle class? Do Republicans want to be known as the party that defends, for example, the \u201ctrust fund loophole\u201d above everything else? Looking ahead to what\u2019s sure to be a close-fought election next year, do Republicans really want to carry that much water for the rich\u2014especially when the wealthiest of the wealthy are mostly donors to the Democrats?\n\nSo maybe it would be good strategy for the Republicans to develop new issues\u2014that is, identify new dividing lines and set off the distinction with the Democrats in the boldest possible colors.\n\nRepublicans already understand that national security is a powerful issue, but, in addition, there\u2019s the emerging nexus between national security and homeland security. We can start with counter-terrorism: Even the White House admits that the President made a mistake in not attending the Charlie Hebdo march in Paris on January 11. So here\u2019s a question: Come to think of it, which Republicans were in Paris?\n\nCloser to home, the hot-button issues are immigration and law and order. The human wave that crossed the border in the spring and summer caught the attention of the country, and contributed to the defats of a half-dozen red-state Democrats in November.\n\nThen, of course, the troubles in Ferguson, Missouri, starting in August and the assassination of two New York City policemen in December. Once again, Democrats were thrown on the defensive.\n\nAnd just this month came the release of the new Clint Eastwood movie, American Sniper, which is breaking box office records. Even the liberal Daily Beast has had to admit, \u201cAmerican Sniper is a bona fide cultural phenomenon.\u201d\n\nThe late Chris Kyle was a bold-colors American patriot if there ever was one. Defending his honor should be a project of every Republican seeking to build a rock-hard base.\n\nYet interestingly, for the most part, the GOP has been silent on these issues. Yes, the GOP has been noisy on ISIS overseas, but it has said little about law-and-order here at home. A few voices, such as Robert W. Patterson here at Breitbart News, have cited the immanence of the issue, but it\u2019s hard to hear the chorus across the GOP.\n\nIndeed, it appears that the Republican Establishment\u2014the GOP Graybeard champions of the mushy middle\u2014have been deliberately downplaying these hot-button populist issues. For Beltway Republicans, pale pastels, it seems, are much to be preferred over bold colors.\n\nOn Fox News\u2019s Political Insiders show on January 18, former Republican Congressman John LeBoutillier\u2014a conservative outsider all his career\u2014made the point that the GOP leadership, was once again sending a powerful message to activists: Get lost. (And that was before the recent abortion-vote fiasco, which calls into question the basic competence of the House Republican leadership.)\n\nMeanwhile, Jeb Bush, who seeks to lead the post-2014 GOP, is unabashed in his championing of \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nAs Cruz said to the Tea Partiers in South Carolina, \u201cThere is a better way.\u201d That better way, Cruz continued, is for the Republican leadership to respect the views of the activists after the elections\u2014and not just when they need their energy and enthusiasm to win elections. As Cruz said in a recent interview, \u201cWe need to honor our commitments.\u201d He continued, \u201cRepublicans all over the country campaigned, saying, \u2018If you give us a Republican majority in the Senate, we will stop President Obama\u2019s illegal and unconstitutional amnesty.\u2019 We should do exactly what we said we would do.\u201d\n\nWhereupon Cruz reiterated his message, which might be called the Four R\u2019s: Repeal Obamacare, Repeal Common Core, Roll Back EPA regulation, and, for good measure, Repeal the IRS. Will the Graybeards heed the Tea Partiers on any of these issues? Only time will tell.\n\nAnd here we can pause to dwell, once again, on the issue of immigration: It was, after all, the border issue that began the process of nationalizing the 2014 election\u2014turning it into a red wave.\n\nYet by now it\u2019s perfectly obvious that a) the Republican leadership is not really interested in overturning the Obama amnesty, and b) that elite Republicans aren\u2019t interested in making the 2016 elections a referendum on immigration policy. And a big factor in this pale-pastel thinking, of course, is the influence of the US Chamber of Commerce\u2014which never met a cheap foreign worker it didn\u2019t like. The Chamber is perfectly willing to work with Silicon Valley Democrats, such as Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, in order to have its way on the immigration issue. If these elitists had their way, \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d would be the law of the land\u2014the activists be damned!\n\nMeanwhile, of course, national Democrats are smiling: If demography is destiny, they figure that a few more years of open-borders will turn Texas into another California.\n\nFortunately, the GOP has Sen. Jeff Sessions and others, all of them willing to buck the power of the buck for the sake of American sovereignty and self-determination. But Sessions, influential as he is, is only a Senator: He has to deal with a House leadership that is, well, a lot less enthusiastic about border security.\n\nTo really turn the tide, we will need a president. And as Republicans Ford, Dole, McCain, and Romney all learned, the presidency cannot be won in the mushy middle. We need those bold colors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
