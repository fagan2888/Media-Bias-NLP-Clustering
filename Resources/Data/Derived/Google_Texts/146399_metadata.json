Sutter\u2019s was near the State University of New York at Buffalo \u2013 a student hangout, not a rough dive. Walter, now a seasoned detective, still can\u2019t shake the bizarre and bloody memory of that night.\n\nThe men didn\u2019t notice the cop pull into the parking lot. Walter grabbed his baton and approached, then saw a glint of metal. One of the men held a knife, the blade protruding three inches from his clenched fist.\n\nInstantly a geyser of blood spurted from the unarmed man\u2019s neck onto Walter\u2019s uniform \u2013 10 feet away. The man collapsed, his neck slashed open \u201cfrom his ear to his Adam\u2019s apple,\u201d Walter said, recalling what he wrote in the police report. Blood pulsed onto the pavement from his severed carotid artery and jugular vein.\n\nWalter drew his gun and pointed it. The attacker dropped the knife and clasped his hands around his victim\u2019s gashed neck to stanch the bleeding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a medical student,\u201d the attacker said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nTwenty-five years later, Dr. Constantine Toumbis sat at a large conference table at Citrus Memorial Hospital in Central Florida. On the night he was arrested outside Sutter\u2019s Saloon, his clothes and hair were splattered with blood. At the board meeting in August 2014, he wears a dark tailored suit, a crisply knotted tie, a monogrammed shirt and cuff links. His salt-and-pepper hair was neatly cropped. He jotted notes with an elegant pen.\n\nBy many measures, Toumbis\u2019 career is a success. He\u2019s been chief of staff at Citrus and sits on its board of trustees. He is among Florida\u2019s busiest spinal surgeons, operating at Citrus in Inverness and also at Seven Rivers Regional Medical Center in nearby Crystal River. He earned $1.2 million just from Medicare in 2012.\n\nBut when ProPublica compared the performance of nearly 17,000 surgeons who do elective operations under Medicare, Toumbis stood out for another reason: His complication rates for routine spinal procedures were among the highest in the nation. At least two of his patients died and 44 were readmitted to the hospital with postoperative complications over five years.\n\nWhen we travelled to Florida to find out more, we interviewed someone who knew Toumbis and mentioned hearing he had once been convicted of a violent crime. A Google search turned up a story from the Buffalo News headlined \u201cFormer Medical Student Gets Public Service Term.\u2019\u2019 It set out how Toumbis had stabbed a classmate and been found guilty of felony assault.\n\nWhile Toumbis\u2019 criminal record was not relevant to our examination of surgical complications, it did raise questions about systems for licensing and vetting doctors.\n\nDoctors applying for state medical licenses and jobs are typically asked to disclose any criminal convictions. Records show that Toumbis omitted or misrepresented his crime and felony record when he applied for a hospital internship and in filings submitted to Florida medical regulators. In one of those records, he even portrayed himself as a victim \u2013 of an attacker who thrust his neck onto Toumbis\u2019 dagger.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if both of the hospitals where Toumbis operates are aware of his past.\n\nCitrus Memorial did not respond to questions about Toumbis\u2019 criminal history.\n\nRyan Beaty, the hospital\u2019s chief executive for about 10 years until he retired in 2014, said he didn\u2019t know about Toumbis\u2019 felony conviction until ProPublica told him about it. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t seem like that kind of guy to me,\u201d Beaty said. \u201cIt also surprises me that I didn\u2019t know. Somehow I missed that bit of information.\u201d\n\nSeven Rivers officials said Toumbis disclosed his felony conviction to them. \u201cDr. Toumbis further shared his unwavering determination to fulfill his career goal to become an orthopedic surgeon despite this unfortunate incident that interrupted his lifelong ambition,\u201d Dorothy Pernu, the hospital\u2019s director of marketing and communications, said in an email.\n\nToumbis, 49, declined multiple requests to answer questions about his record.\n\nIn May, a ProPublica reporter visited Toumbis\u2019 office and left a note. Toumbis did not reply, but a Citrus County sheriff\u2019s deputy called to say Toumbis did not want to be contacted. A week later, a notice arrived from Toumbis warning that future visits would be prosecuted as trespassing.\n\nIt began with a dispute about karate.\n\nWhen Toumbis was about 12, he helped a teenage karate instructor put on demonstrations for Cub Scouts. As a reward, he received what he would eventually acknowledge in a medical school hearing was an \u201chonorary\u201d black belt. He acknowledged \u201cpuffing\u201d up his medical school application by saying he was a karate instructor. He also told friends he was a black belt in the martial art.\n\nIn fact, Toumbis worried about defending himself. While an undergraduate at New York University, he bought a knife to ward off any threats. Called an Urban Skinner, it was a push dagger \u2013 designed to be held in a fist with a three-inch blade protruding outward.\n\nToumbis didn\u2019t get into medical school on his first try, so he went to the SUNY at Buffalo, commonly known as University of Buffalo, for a master\u2019s degree in natural science. There he befriended the student who would become his victim, Frank Slazyk. The two earned their degrees together, then entered the university\u2019s medical school.\n\nToumbis and Slazyk socialized with the same group and studied in Toumbis\u2019 apartment. That\u2019s how Slazyk saw Toumbis\u2019 black belt, which he believed to be real, and heard Toumbis\u2019 claim that he was a karate instructor, which he believed to be true.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, March 26, 1989, Slazyk invited Toumbis to celebrate with pierogi and Polish sausage at his grandmother\u2019s house. Toumbis couldn\u2019t make it, so that night they went to a bar to play darts, eat chicken wings and drink beer.\n\nAccording to the bartender\u2019s statement to the police, Slazyk and Toumbis had been having a good time but got unruly late in the night. Slazyk was making karate motions and feigning punches and kicks at Toumbis, who was blocking the blows and coming back with some of his own shadow-boxing moves.\n\nThe horsing around got rowdy enough that the bartender asked them to leave, and the two walked out together. There didn\u2019t seem to be any actual hostility between them, the bartender said. Another person at the bar told police Slazyk had apologized to Toumbis before they left.\n\nToumbis later claimed at his trial that Slazyk was goading him into a fight at the bar, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s see some of your karate.\u201d Toumbis said that after a few blows made contact and it got heated, the bartender agreed to delay Slazyk so Toumbis could leave first. Slazyk followed and attacked him in the parking lot, Toumbis said.\n\nSlazyk told ProPublica in an interview that Toumbis lost his temper when he saw that Slazyk hadn\u2019t locked his car door. He said they were arguing about the door when Toumbis said, \u201cDon\u2019t get lippy with me. I have a black belt.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Slazyk said the brawl began.\n\n*****\n\nWhen other officers joined Walter outside Sutters\u2019 Saloon, they found Toumbis trying to stop Slazyk\u2019s hemorrhaging. His white canvas jacket and face were smeared with Slazyk\u2019s blood.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d one of the cops asked.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been stabbed,\u201d Toumbis said, according to a police report. \u201cBy me. I stabbed him. He came at me with lethal force. I have a right to protect myself.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent accounts, however \u2013 before a medical school committee and when he applied for his hospital internship and Florida medical license \u2013 Toumbis would not admit to stabbing Slazyk. His versions of the incident would include details that were inaccurate or contradicted by other witnesses.\n\nAbout two weeks after the stabbing, a committee of professors from the University at Buffalo medical school met to determine whether the two students should be expelled. According to a transcript of the meeting, Toumbis told the panel the Urban Skinner was a hunting knife he had bought at the nearby Boulevard Mall.\n\n\u201cIt was not purchased for self-defense,\u201d Toumbis said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it as a weapon.\u201d\n\nThat clashes with Toumbis\u2019 testimony under oath during his trial more than a year later, when he said he bought the knife in New York City to frighten off would-be attackers.\n\nToumbis told the medical school committee that he pulled the knife to scare Slazyk, but that his friend \u201cmoved his neck in the way\u201d and \u201crushed into it,\u201d according to the meeting transcript.\n\nToumbis argued that he should be allowed to continue his studies because it was a tragic accident. He added that he saved Slazyk\u2019s life by stopping the bleeding.\n\nThe medical school expelled Toumbis. He enrolled in a doctoral program at the same university and obtained a Ph.D. in experimental pathology in 1993. The school declined to comment for this story.\n\nAt his two-week trial in November 1990, Toumbis testified that he had intended to scare Slazyk, held the knife in front of him and said, \u201cStay the hell away from me.\u201d Walter, the police officer who witnessed the stabbing, testified that he did not hear Toumbis say anything to Slazyk before he stabbed him.\n\nToumbis testified that he never intended any harm and that he would have to live the rest of his life knowing that \u201cthe instrument that I held in my hand was the cause of almost taking a life.\u201d\n\nThe jury convicted Toumbis of second-degree assault, which New York State law defines as recklessly causing serious physical injury to another person with a deadly weapon.\n\nToumbis called several character witnesses who pleaded with the judge not to send him to prison. His mother, Evelyn Toumbis, sent a letter saying the health of her husband began deteriorating the day of their son\u2019s arrest. The dream Toumbis\u2019s father had of his son becoming a doctor had \u201csuddenly vanished.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say to you honestly, Judge Drury, that my husband died of a broken heart,\u201d Evelyn Toumbis wrote.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing, the judge chastised Toumbis for not being truthful about the stabbing. The Urban Skinner dagger he used to cut Slazyk\u2019s throat was not a hunting knife upon which Slazyk had accidentally been impaled. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious street weapon\u201d the judge said.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou impaled yourself on this \u2013 on your own testimony and led to your conviction.\u201d\n\nToumbis was sentenced to probation and 2,000 hours of community service.\n\nToumbis was accepted into the Wayne State University Medical School in Detroit in 1994. Documents on file in Florida show that an official at Wayne State later told the Florida Department of Health that the school reviewed \u201cthe incident at Buffalo,\u201d spoke to the judge and interviewed Toumbis before deciding \u201cthat he would make a good physician.\u201d\n\nIn May 1998, Toumbis applied for a surgical internship at the University of Florida Health Science Center in Jacksonville, according to documents on file with the Florida Department of Health.\n\nThe application asked if he had ever been convicted of a felony. In the sworn statement, Toumbis answered \u201cNo.\u201d He was accepted into the internship program.\n\nOn the application for his United States Medical Licensing Examination, Toumbis was asked to list all medical schools he had attended, \u201cwhether completed, or not.\u201d He did not list the University of Buffalo Medical School, which had expelled him.\n\nToumbis did acknowledge a felony conviction and medical school expulsion on his Florida medical license application. The statement he attached casts the stabbing as a matter of self-defense.\n\nThe statement says he went for a late-night snack at a restaurant and encountered another medical student who became hostile and aggressive. Toumbis alleged he asked a restaurant employee to detain the student, but as Toumbis went to his car, the statement says, the student threatened him.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to deter any further aggression, I displayed a small knife which I legally possessed,\u201d Toumbis wrote in the statement. \u201cUndeterred, my assailant lunged at me and was cut. Bearing no personal animus against my attacker, I immediately rendered first aid.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the statement, Toumbis describes the Urban Skinner as a \u201cpocket knife.\u201d\n\nMara Burger, a spokeswoman with the Florida Department of Health, confirmed that Toumbis did not disclose his felony on his internship application, and that his U.S. medical licensing exam application did not list the medical school that expelled him.\n\nWhether the committee that approved his license noticed the discrepancies is unknown, she said. Although the department reviewed the court documents Toumbis provided when he applied for his license, it did not do any further investigation to determine the nature of the crime, she said.\n\nThe state\u2019s file contains several recommendations from Toumbis\u2019 supporters. A professor from SUNY Buffalo praised Toumbis for his diligence, hard work, intellectual excellence and medical competence. \u201cI believe he is of good character and well motivated to combine research, teaching and clinical service in academic medicine.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. J.J. Tepas III, director of the general surgery residency program at the University of Florida Health Science Center, rated Toumbis low on most of the categories measured: medical knowledge, teaching ability, fitness for clinical practice, motivation, initiative, responsibility and integrity. Tepas declined to comment for this story.\n\nIn a follow-up letter, Tepas reiterated his negative assessment, saying he had observed Toumbis in practice on many occasions. \u201cI have been consistently impressed by his obvious lack of interest in some of the very basic tenets of bedside clinical care,\u201d Tepas wrote.\n\n*******\n\nIn his trailer home near Buffalo in August, Slazyk, 51, sat at the kitchen table drinking coffee and chain smoking Seneca cigarettes. There\u2019s no missing the faded, jagged lines of the scar on his neck.\n\nSlazyk\u2019s left eyelid permanently droops \u2013 a result of a stroke from losing so much blood the night he was stabbed, he said. Words come out raspy because his voice box was torn.\n\nSlazyk had grown up in a poor neighborhood of Buffalo called Black Rock. Medical school was supposed to be his ticket out. His dream was to become a surgeon specializing in cancers affecting women, he said.\n\nBut Slazyk never really recovered from the stabbing. He went back to medical school but was too traumatized to continue. That contributed to the alcoholism that sent him into a tailspin, he said.\n\nThe stabbing \u201cknocked me off the track\u201d in medical school, Slazyk said. \u201cI was doing fine until then. Then after that, even being the victim, they put me on leave for a year-and-a-half. I was punished.\u201d\n\nA couple of years ago, Slazyk learned that Toumbis had become a successful surgeon. He said he had an attorney contact him and they reached a confidential financial settlement.\n\nToday, Slazyk does not work because of his manic depression and anxiety. His wife works as a housekeeper and he gets $730 a month in Social Security income. His medical school loans were expunged because of his disability, he said.\n\nProPublica made many attempts to speak to Toumbis.\n\nAfter the Citrus Memorial meeting in August, a reporter approached him for an interview.\n\n\u201cOh \u2013 little old me?\u201d the surgeon said. \u201cI don\u2019t grant interviews. You\u2019ll have to call the hospital public relations department.\u201d\n\nWalter, the cop who saw the stabbing, was stunned to find out that Toumbis is a prominent surgeon.\n\nRecalling that night at Sutter\u2019s, he said Toumbis chose to engage in the fight. One detail in particular stuck: Toumbis\u2019 eyeglasses were folded and placed on the hood of the car, he said, which seemed inconsistent with portrayals of being attacked by Slazyk.\n\nWalter told ProPublica that he did not see how Toumbis could justify the stabbing. Had he wanted, he could have run away or fled back into the bar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just love to know how a guy who\u2019s convicted of a crime like that can be a doctor,\u201d Walter said.\n\nMarshall Allen is a ProPublica reporter covering health care and patient safety issues.
