Cruz speak.\n\nOne of those people was undecided voter Kristin Kaufmann.\n\n\"We want to hear what he has to say and we want to get some of our questions answered today,\" explained Kaufmann.\n\nKaufman's biggest question for Cruz was how he would turn the country around.\n\nCruz's solution involves focusing on three things.\n\n\"Jobs, freedom, and security,\" said Cruz.\n\nThe Texas Republican said that in order to create more jobs, he would repeal Obamacare and ease pressure put on small businesses.\n\n\"This is the result of seven years of failed economic policies,\" Cruz claimed. \"The Obama-Clinton economic agenda is a disaster and the people who get hurt the most are working men and women.\"\n\nHis plan to fight ISIS includes beefing up America's military and their presence in the Middle East.\n\n\"If we continue to have a president who won't stand and fight radical Islamic terrorism and keep this country safe, then I think we risk losing the greatest country in the history of the world,\" added Cruz.\n\nSen. Cruz also said he would impose a flat tax system and abolish the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nKaufmann, the undecided voter, says regardless of who you vote for, at least be informed.\n\n\"There's so much information out now it's unacceptable, you have to know,\" said Kaufmann.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "CAPE GIRARDEAU -- With the\u00a0Illinois and Missouri primaries just days away, presidential candidates are making their way through our area this weekend.", "author": "Brandon Merano", "og": {"url": "http://www.wsiltv.com/story/31455928/presidential-candidate-ted-cruz-holds-rally-in-cape-girardeau", "image": "http://WSIL.images.worldnow.com/images/10088552_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CAPE GIRARDEAU -- With the\u00a0Illinois and Missouri primaries just days away, presidential candidates are making their way through our area this weekend.", "title": "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz holds rally in Cape Girardeau"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WSIL.images.worldnow.com/images/10088552_G.jpg", "description": "CAPE GIRARDEAU -- With the\u00a0Illinois and Missouri primaries just days away, presidential candidates are making their way through our area this weekend.", "card": "summary", "title": "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz holds rally in Cape Girardeau"}, "wnreadableurl": "presidential-candidate-ted-cruz-holds-rally-in-cape-girardeau", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WSIL", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "date": "2016/03/12", "KEYWORDS": "Sen Ted Cruz, SEMO, Cape Girardeau, Southeast Missouri State, presidential campaign, rally, Vote 2016, Illinois primary, Missouri primary, undecided voters, conservative, Republican, WSIL TV 3, News 3", "wn-base": "IIS06", "news_keywords": "Sen Ted Cruz, SEMO, Cape Girardeau, Southeast Missouri State, presidential campaign, rally, Vote 2016, Illinois primary, Missouri primary, undecided voters, conservative, Republican, WSIL TV 3, News 3"}, "article_summary": "On Saturday night, Republican candidate Ted Cruz held a rally in Cape Girardeau.\nKaufmann, the undecided voter, says regardless of who you vote for, at least be informed.\nCAPE GIRARDEAU -- With the Illinois and Missouri primaries just days away, presidential candidates are making their way through our area this weekend.\nOne of those people was undecided voter Kristin Kaufmann.\nMore than a thousand people showed-up to hear Sen.
