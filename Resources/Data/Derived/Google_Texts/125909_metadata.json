So far, 73 employees have participated and volunteered more than 230 hours during recent clean-up efforts.\n\n\u201cThe Oklahoma Department of Transportation is thrilled to have Cherokee Nation Businesses as a partner in our Adopt-A-Highway program,\u201d said Melody Johnson, ODOT state beautification coordinator. \u201cIt\u2019s a free and easy way for groups to help beautify their communities, and CNB has shown it\u2019s committed to doing just that. We truly appreciate CNB and its employees for making a concerted effort to take part in clean-up events year-round and for making the pledge to keep Oklahoma beautiful.\u201d\n\nCherokee Nation Entertainment employees pick up trash along highways near Cherokee Casino locations throughout northeastern Oklahoma every year. In their effort to beautify local communities, Cherokee Casino employees have additional clean-up days scheduled throughout the year.\n\nThe annual projects are coordinated through the company\u2019s Community Impact Team, which helps promote volunteerism and community engagement for all employees.
