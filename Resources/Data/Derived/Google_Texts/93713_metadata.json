We do know that Bezos decided to let him to seek investors elsewhere: \u201cWe regret to announce that Ezra Klein, Melissa Bell and Dylan Matthews are leaving The Post for a new venture.\u201d Information about this \u201cnew venture\u201d is pretty scarce, but it allegedly involves a foray into \u201cexplanatory journalism.\u201d\n\nAny informed reader familiar with Klein\u2019s work will have difficulty suppressing a chuckle at the close juxtaposition of his name and the word \u201cexplanatory.\u201d Klein, you will recall, is the \u201cwonk\u201d who went on television after the GOP regained its majority in the House to discuss the disputes erupting between Republicans and Democrats concerning limits on federal power. The cause of this discord, he explained, was the verbiage of the Constitution: \u201cThe text is confusing because it was written more than 100 years ago.\u201d\n\nKlein is evidently under the impression that the document in question was written during the McKinley administration. But his cluelessness isn\u2019t limited to the Constitution. Klein is profoundly ignorant in his ostensible areas of expertise \u2014 health care and economic policy. As recently as three weeks ago, apparently unaware that countless studies have shown Medicaid coverage to be worse for one\u2019s health than no coverage at all, he described Obamacare\u2019s expansion of that failed program as a \u201chuge win.\u201d\n\nBut it probably wasn\u2019t Klein\u2019s historical illiteracy, or even his general ignorance concerning the policy areas in which he poses as a wonk, that rendered Bezos reluctant to finance his delusions of grandeur. It is much more likely that Bezos is turned off by Klein\u2019s fundamental dishonesty. Klein\u2019s brand of journalism goes well beyond mere bias. He misrepresents the views of interviewees, colludes with other \u201creporters\u201d to spin or bury ideologically inconvenient stories, and even creates fictitious sources.\n\nOne of Klein\u2019s worst misrepresentations was committed in an attempt to defend former CMS head Donald Berwick, a proponent of government-imposed health care rationing. In a post titled, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Don Berwick,\u201d Klein insinuated that GOP Rep. Paul Ryan agrees with Berwick: \u201cThe question, as Paul Ryan told me, isn\u2019t whether we ration, but who rations, and how.\u201d In reality, Ryan spoke out firmly against government rationing in the interview, and Klein deliberately distorted his words.\n\nBut Klein didn\u2019t want to be a lone voice lying in the wilderness. Thus, he created the now infamous JournoList, a listserv that he and other MSM types used to coordinate their misrepresentations of the news. As Tucker Carlson put it in the Daily Caller, \u201cAgain and again, we discovered members of JournoList working to coordinate talking points on behalf of Democratic politicians.\u201d Klein denied this, but immediately took the listserv down and still refuses to give anyone access to any related files.\n\nThat the Post didn\u2019t fire Klein after the JournoList scandal is a scandal in itself, but he remained and continued his crimes against journalism. In 2011, he appears to have created a fictitious \u201cconservative legal scholar\u201d who allegedly advised him that the Supreme Court would never condescend to hear Florida v. HHS. Jennifer Rubin all but called Klein a liar at the time: \u201cUnlike every law professor and advocate whom I have talked to in the last two years on this case, Ezra\u2019s [unnamed] gal or guy says the court won\u2019t bite.\u201d\n\nIt is unlikely that Klein\u2019s dubious ethics and intellectual limitations have been lost on Bezos, who just bought the Washington Post last summer. This may explain why, as Politico reports, \u201cThe Post\u2019s new owner, and Katharine Weymouth, its publisher, never even offered an alternative figure, sources familiar with the negotiations said.\u201d Nonetheless, many in the media establishment seem to have concluded that Bezos has shot himself in the foot by not showering cash on his resident \u201cwunderkind.\u201d\n\nBut Bezos is no dummy. He didn\u2019t earn enough money to buy one of the country\u2019s most respected publications by making dumb decisions. Interestingly, on the same day that Klein\u2019s departure was confirmed, the Post also announced a partnership with The Volokh Conspiracy. Eugene Volokh and his co-conspirators have been \u201clawblogging\u201d since Klein was in high school, and enjoy a vast national readership. All of which suggests that, rather than committing a blunder, Bezos has traded up.\n\nEzra Klein\u2019s primary gift seems to be a talent for working the Beltway cocktail circuit. Presumably, he will use that skill to get his new venture bankrolled. But there\u2019s a big difference between finding investors and making an independent operation successful. In business, dumb people go broke and dishonest people go to jail. It is not a world that is kind to lightweights.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d4a\"", "article_summary": "But Klein didn\u2019t want to be a lone voice lying in the wilderness.\nThat the Post didn\u2019t fire Klein after the JournoList scandal is a scandal in itself, but he remained and continued his crimes against journalism.\nEzra Klein\u2019s primary gift seems to be a talent for working the Beltway cocktail circuit.\nInterestingly, on the same day that Klein\u2019s departure was confirmed, the Post also announced a partnership with The Volokh Conspiracy.\nKlein is profoundly ignorant in his ostensible areas of expertise \u2014 health care and economic policy."}
