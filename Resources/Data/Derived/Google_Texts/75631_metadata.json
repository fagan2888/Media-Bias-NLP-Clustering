(The NFL disputes the claims.) The NFL was underwriting a $16 million, seven-year study at Boston University that looked at the relationship between football and brain disease; on the news release announcing the study, the university only listed the National Institutes of Health as paying for the study.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Congress has held hearings on head trauma. A 2009 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee saw the NFL\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, take the hot seat\u2014and led to some policy changes in the league. Energy and Commerce held sports-safety hearings in March 2014. But the problems haven\u2019t gone away. Maybe this time, with a box-office boost, there\u2019s enough public attention to see more real change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s not the first time the issue of head trauma has wound up on Capitol Hill.
