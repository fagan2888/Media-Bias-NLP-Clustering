The team earned first place for both of their performances, in open dance and open poms, and won the JV Grand Champion trophy for best junior varsity team overall.\n\nThe other suburban team to win a Grand Champion trophy was St. Charles North High School, which was best overall among large schools. They also won first place in the open pom category.\n\nOther teams that won their categories, by division, were:\n\nDivision 3A: Wheaton-Warrenville High School, first place in poms; South Elgin High School, first place in lyrical.\n\nDivision 2A: Larkin High School, first place in open dance and lyrical; Montini Catholic High School, first place in poms and open poms; Batavia High School, first in open poms.\n\nJunior Varsity: Aurora Central Catholic High School, first in hip-hop.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The northwest suburbs were well represented among the winners at the Team Dance Illinois Championships Sunday in Peoria.
