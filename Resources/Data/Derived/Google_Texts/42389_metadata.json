The visit comes a day prior to the Memorial Day holiday, which remembers those who have died in service to our country.\n\nAt Bagram Airfield, the president spoke to around 3,000 troops, thanking them for their service and promising a \u201cresponsible end\u201d to the war in Afghanistan by the close of this year. The war began over a decade ago, and has claimed the lives of 2,184 U.S. Military service members, as of May 23, 4014, according to a report from Defense.gov.\n\n\u201cI thank you as your commander in chief because you inspire me,\u201d President Obama said, according to the New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m here to say thank you. And I\u2019m here to say how proud I am of you.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama would not be meeting with outgoing Afghanistan president, Hamid Karzai during the trip. A presidential election is scheduled for June 14 of this year, and Obama has said he\u2019ll work with either of the candidates in the future.\n\n\u201cOnce Afghanistan has sworn in its new president, I\u2019m hopeful we will sign a bilateral security agreement that lets us move forward,\u201d Obama said, the Times reported. \u201cAnd with that bilateral security agreement, assuming it is signed, we can plan for a limited military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A day before Memorial Day the President told troops he would like to end war by the close of this year", "title": "Obama makes surprise visit to Afghanistan, vows \u201ca responsible end\u201d to the war", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A day before Memorial Day the President told troops he would like to end war by the close of this year", "title": "Obama makes surprise visit to Afghanistan, vows \u201ca responsible end\u201d to the war", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/obama_makes_surprise_visit_to_afghanistan_vows_a_responsible_end_to_the_war/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/obama-afghanistan.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A day before Memorial Day the President told troops he would like to end war by the close of this year", "title": "Obama makes surprise visit to Afghanistan, vows \u201ca responsible end\u201d to the war", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/obama-afghanistan.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Afghanistan, Afghanistan War, Memorial Day, Military, President Obama, veterans, War", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb307\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Afghanistan, Afghanistan War, Memorial Day, Military, President Obama, veterans, War, News, Politics NewsPresident Obama made a surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan today, according to the Associated Press.\n\u201cI thank you as your commander in chief because you inspire me,\u201d President Obama said, according to the New York Times.\nAnd I\u2019m here to say how proud I am of you.\u201dPresident Obama would not be meeting with outgoing Afghanistan president, Hamid Karzai during the trip.\nThe visit comes a day prior to the Memorial Day holiday, which remembers those who have died in service to our country.\n\u201cOnce Afghanistan has sworn in its new president, I\u2019m hopeful we will sign a bilateral security agreement that lets us move forward,\u201d Obama said, the Times reported."}
