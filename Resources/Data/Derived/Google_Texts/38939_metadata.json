However, according to one long-time student of political movements and leadership, the Trump \u201cmovement\u201d may not be worthy of the name.\n\nAnd the criticism isn\u2019t coming from some leftist ideologue who instinctively backs away from Trump because he is energizing elements of the far right. It\u2019s coming from former eight-term Oklahoma Congressman Mickey Edwards, a founding trustee of the conservative Heritage Foundation and former national chairman of the American Conservative Union.\n\nRelated: Is This Why Trump Has Such a Huge Lead in the Polls?\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call this a movement,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cMovements usually have a particular aim, a central direction. This is just an appeal to people who are disgruntled.\u201d\n\nEdwards, who now directs the Rodel Fellowship in Public Leadership program at the Aspen Institute in Washington, said that unlike the tea party movement, which roiled the electorate in the years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Move On, which backs liberal causes, Trump\u2019s followers seem to have little in the way of common, articulated goals.\n\n(And no, \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d is not a real statement of a goal.)\n\n\u201cThis is not like the tea party or Move On where you have a common complaint and a vague idea of what you want to do,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s followers have what he called a \u201cvery disparate\u201d batch of complaints that seem to stem mainly from the fact that they \u201cfeel the ground shifting under them,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned about people taking their jobs, that people don\u2019t look like they used to. He\u2019s a good focal point.\u201d\n\nRelated: Oy Vey! Trump Stumbles Before Jewish Political Group\n\nAlmost nothing Trump says \u201chas any merit,\u201d Edwards said, noting that he feeds his audiences a heavy diet of demonstrable falsehoods and exaggerated claims about the country\u2019s decline.\n\nThe result is that Trump creates a shared sense of victimhood among his followers, which primes them to lash out when he points them at a target.\n\nLast week, for example, Trump took to social media with a celebratory tweet about the declining share price of the Macy\u2019s department store chain. Trump and Macy\u2019s have a complicated history. The chain sold his line of men\u2019s clothing and accessories for many years, but stopped doing so over the summer after Trump\u2019s public comments denigrating immigrants from Mexico as rapists and murderers.\n\nRelated: Trump May Be Losing the Media. He Also Might Not Need It Anymore\n\n\u201cGood news,\u201d Trump noted gleefully. \u201cDisloyal Macy\u2019s stock is in a total free fall. Don\u2019t shop there for Christmas!\u201d\n\nGood news, disloyal Macy's stock is in a total free fall. Don't shop there for Christmas! Posted by Donald J. Trump on Friday, December 4, 2015\n\nConsider for a moment how problematic this is. The leading candidate for a major party\u2019s presidential nomination is on the record cheering about the declining fortunes of a U.S. company \u2013 one that, with more than 166,000 workers, happens to be among the top 50 employers in the country.\n\nNot only that, but Trump is doing it out of anger that Macy\u2019s was \u201cdisloyal.\u201d Not disloyal to the country, mind you. Not to its customers. Disloyal to him.\n\nTrump goes further, urging his millions of followers to make things worse for the retail giant by not shopping there at Christmas. Imagine this kind of thing coming not from a billionaire former reality television star\u2019s social media account, but from the White House.\n\nOf course, the post was immediately shared on Facebook and Twitter by thousands of (mostly supportive) Trump followers who pledged never to shop at the chain again.\n\nRelated: GOP Memo Shows Party\u2019s Fear of Trump\n\nWhy would people happily pledge to try to damage a business that employs thousands of their fellow citizens over its refusal to continue stocking overpriced neckties from a billionaire\u2019s vanity fashion line?\n\nIt\u2019s that sort of question that troubles Edwards.\n\nWhat stands out to me about this election has nothing to do with the candidates, it has to do with the electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ought to be sobering to realize the number of people who buy in to what Trump\u2019s saying. The number of people who cheer when he tells lies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump is now, more and more frequently, being described as the leader of a political movement.
