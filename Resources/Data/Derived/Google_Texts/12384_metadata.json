Charles Massengale, 71, suffers from dementia, diabetes and high blood pressure and needs constant care (Photo by Heidi de Marco/KHN).\n\nBorn just a year apart, Oliver Massengale and his brother Charles grew up together.\n\nNow in a two-story home in Compton, they are growing old together. But Charles Massengale, 71, can do little on his own.\n\nThe former tree trimmer has severe brain damage from a 30-foot fall, as well as dementia, diabetes and high blood pressure. Six years ago, Oliver took over as his brother\u2019s full-time caregiver, paid about $10 an hour by the state.\n\nIt was not a job he was trained to do.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a clue,\u201d said Oliver, a retired grounds manager at a college.\n\nHe constantly worried \u2014 about giving Charles the wrong medication, about him getting bedsores. And he had no idea how easily his brother could fall over. One day, he was cooking and Charles was on a stool at the kitchen counter.\n\n\u201cI heard BAM,\u201d he said. \u201cI turned around and he was on the kitchen floor.\u201d\n\nNo overall training is required for the more than 400,000 caregivers in California\u2019s $7.3 billion In-Home Supportive Services Program for low-income elderly and disabled residents. Without instruction even in CPR or first aid, these caregivers can quickly become overwhelmed and their sick or disabled clients can get hurt, according to interviews with caregivers, advocates and elder abuse experts.\n\nThe lack of training is \u201cof enormous concern,\u201d said Gary Passmore, a vice president of the Congress of California Seniors, an advocacy organization. \u201cWe are dealing with a lot of frail, elderly people.\u201d\n\nThe need for in-home caregivers is rising as the elderly and disabled population grows. The demand for personal aides \u2014 most of whom work in the home \u2014 is expected to increase by 37 percent over the next decade, requiring about 1.3 million new positions, according to research published last year by the New York-based Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, an advocacy group that also provides training.\n\nThe federal government is trying to meet that need by stepping up efforts to expand and train the workforce. But for now, there are no federal training requirements for in-home caregivers. It\u2019s up to states to set them in Medicaid-funded programs like California\u2019s. As a result, training policies vary dramatically.\n\nIn California\u2019s IHSS program, clients are in charge of hiring, managing and training their own caregivers. The program stands out because of its sheer size \u2014 it is the nation\u2019s largest publicly funded home-care program \u2014 and because such a high percentage of caregivers are relatives directly employed by the clients, said Abby Marquand, director of policy research for the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a lot easier to ensure a minimum level of training if the person is employed through an agency,\u201d she said.\n\nIHSS was never intended to be a medical program. Unlike visiting nurses or home health aides, IHSS caregivers are not certified or licensed and are hired to do personal care and household tasks.\n\nBut more than a quarter of IHSS clients are 80 or older, and many have chronic health conditions or dementia. In these and other cases, caregivers can end up providing basic medical care \u2014 helping to administer insulin shots, manage other medication or dress wounds, for instance.\n\nWhen such \u201cparamedical\u201d services are needed, IHSS caregivers are required to get instruction and approval from a health care professional. But the state doesn\u2019t sponsor the training or pay caregivers more for getting it. Only 12 percent of clients have caregivers who have received it.\n\nEileen Carroll, deputy director of the California Department of Social Services, which oversees IHSS, said the program doesn\u2019t have a lot of training requirements because it was set up to give clients the choice of how they want their care delivered.\n\nFor caregivers who want it, the state offers comprehensive voluntary training information online, she said.\n\nCarroll said many people are fully able to direct their own care and supervise their caregivers, but some aren\u2019t. \u201cOur task is how to work harder to support those who have greater need,\u201d she said.\n\nOliver Massengale, for example, can\u2019t depend on his brother to tell him what he wants or needs \u2014 Charles no longer talks much. \u201cBecause of the nature of the injuries and his different ailments, he could never train,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cHe can\u2019t even take care of himself.\u201d\n\nEvery day Oliver sits inches from Charles, checking his blood pressure and blood sugar and coaching him step-by-step on how to inject insulin into his own arm.\n\n\u201cHold the back of that needle up,\u201d he told Charles on a recent day. \u201cPut it in right there. Now pump the medicine in. Good, good.\u201d\n\nWhen he heard about a training class in Los Angeles, Oliver said he jumped at the chance.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d had this class in advance, it would have made it a lot easier,\u201d he said.\n\nA sensitive matter\n\nWhether or not to require training for those who care for California\u2019s 490,000 low-income elderly and disabled home-care clients is a sensitive political \u2014 and personal \u2014 issue.\n\nInstruction is a positive thing, Carroll said, \u201cbut you have a very strong adult disabled community in this program who ... oppose any mandatory training.\u201d\n\nMany disability rights advocates say a training mandate would make it more difficult for IHSS consumers to find caregivers, chip away at clients\u2019 autonomy and drain resources from the program.\n\n\u201cThe idea of choice is really paramount,\u201d said Deborah Doctor, legislative advocate at Disability Rights California.\n\nRelatives, who make up nearly three-quarters of paid IHSS caregivers, often say they know what is best for their loved ones.\n\n\u201cA mother who has been taking care of a child for 20 or 30 or 40 years doesn\u2019t need mandatory training on how to take care of that person,\u201d Doctor said.\n\nA union that represents caregivers, however, sees advantages to a minimum level of training. SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West proposed a statewide initiative last year that would have required 75 hours of instruction but didn\u2019t get enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot. SEIU plans to try again in 2016.\n\nRequiring training would \u201csave lives,\u201d said Loretta Jackson, who serves on the union\u2019s executive board and is an IHSS caregiver in Sacramento. It would also reduce the risk of injuries to caregivers, she added.\n\nJackson cares for her sister, who was left partially paralyzed by a stroke 15 years ago. When Jackson first started, she had to call paramedics every few weeks because her sister would fall. Once, Jackson said, her sister took too many pills and started shaking violently.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI started panicking.\u201d\n\nGovernment grants\n\nIn the meantime, the federal government is putting money into pilot training efforts in various states.\n\nThrough the Affordable Care Act, it has awarded about $15 million in grants to California and five other states to recruit and train qualified caregivers for the elderly and disabled populations. Classes started in 2011 in cities throughout the state, including San Francisco, Anaheim and Walnut.\n\nThe class Massengale attended is part of a separate federal grant of nearly $12 million given to the California Long-Term Care Education Center in Los Angeles. The center is training about 6,000 IHSS caregivers in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Contra Costa counties.\n\nAn early evaluation of the program by UC San Francisco researchers shows that clients with trained providers are less likely to go to the emergency room or be admitted to a hospital than those with untrained providers.\n\nAt a recent session in Compton, about two dozen caregivers gathered in a classroom at the public library, their binders of training materials spread out before them. The topic of the day was preventing bed sores and controlling infections.\n\nA trainer reminded members of the group to wash their hands frequently. \u201cIt is one of the most important things an individual can ever do to help control infection,\u201d she said. Oliver Massengale, who is in the class, said he is feeling a little bit more confident about keeping his brother safe. But being a caregiver for someone with so many health conditions is still scary to him.\n\n\u201cAs I come down those stairs,\u201d he said, \u201cI am saying a prayer and just hoping that everything is all right when I get to the bottom.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nData analyst Ronald Campbell contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Born just a year apart, Oliver Massengale and his brother Charles grew up together.
