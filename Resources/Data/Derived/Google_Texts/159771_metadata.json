GOP leaders say the cuts are critical in order to avert long-term deficits and spur economic growth. Democrats and President Obama, on the other hand, call the proposed cuts an assault on lower- and middle-income Americans that would undercut the recovery.\n\n\u201cIn 2013,\u201d says the Brookings study, \u201cbig cities continued to exhibit greater income disparities between rich and poor households than the rest of the country. Across the 50 largest cities, households in the 95th percentile of income earned 11.6 times as much as households at the 20th percentile.\u201d That\u2019s a much wider margin than 9.3, the national average ratio.\n\nThe report added, \u201cThis difference reflects the fact that in big cities the rich have higher incomes, and the poor lower incomes, than their counterparts nationally. From 2012 to 2013, the inequality ratio widened in both cities and the nation overall, as incomes at the top grew somewhat faster than incomes at the bottom. Notably, incomes grew faster for both the rich and poor in cities than they did elsewhere.\u201d\n\nWhat the report does not acknowledge is that young millennials are streaming into big cities in search of jobs and a compatible cultural experience. They are on the very low side of the earning scale. Additionally, the American Community Survey includes illegal immigrants who also cluster in big cities.\n\nThe Brookings study updates a 2014 analysis that examined levels of income inequality in 50 major cities. It also focused on trends between 2012 and 2013, the most recent data available from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nRelated: GOP Looks at Medicaid and Food Stamps for Overhaul\n\nSeveral cities, including Seattle, Cleveland, Jacksonville (FL), Louisville, San Jose, Dallas and Portland witnessed dramatic growth in the incomes of their highest-earning households between 2012 and 2013. Seattle topped the list with 15 percent growth in income among those households, equivalent to a $36,000 increase.\n\nJacksonville, somewhat ironically, also led the list of cities that showed the greatest growth in the 20th percentile income level \u2013 followed by San Francisco, Oklahoma City, Kansas, Missouri, and Oakland. The estimated rate of income growth for rich households in San Francisco topped 18 percent, equal to a $66,000 increase.\n\nBerube is a senior fellow and deputy director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Programs.
