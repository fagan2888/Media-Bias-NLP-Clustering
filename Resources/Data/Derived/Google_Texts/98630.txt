This November could decide the future of ObamaCare, while Colorado will determine whether to go with single-payer healthcare.

Colorado is an initiative state, which means that with enough signatures on a ballot petition voters can put most anything they want on the ballot. A proposal being put forth in November would amend the state constitution to create a new healthcare authority called ColoradoCare – a statewide health cooperative guaranteeing health coverage for every family filing taxes in Colorado.

Supporters of ColoradoCare have been quoted as saying "it is going to make a huge difference in people's lives" – to "this shows you the power and strength of when people come together. Some critics, meanwhile, say this creates a "Communist health system," while others believe it ranks among the worst ideas ever in government.

"It is a terrible idea," says Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Institute at Colorado-based Independence Institute. "It's worse than ObamaCare because ObamaCare at least leaves the private sector to provide some competition."

According to Gorman, ColoradoCare gets its hands on a stream of tax money in perpetuity.

"It's going to raise the state income tax to the highest in the nation," says Gorman. "Another thing it does that's very bad is that it's in the initiative that it's going to control the amount of health spending; it's going to control the rate of growth."

While some people might think that's a good thing, Gorman argues that giving a government entity total control on how much individuals spend on healthcare could mean people and treatments being denied.
