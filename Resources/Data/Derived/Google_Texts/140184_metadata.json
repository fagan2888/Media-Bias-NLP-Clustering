This disease used to be called \u201cbreak-bone fever\u201d because it sometimes causes severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there may be 50\u2013100 million dengue infections worldwide every year. However, new research from the University of Oxford and the Wellcome Trust, using cartographic approaches, estimate there to be 390 million dengue infections per year worldwide.\n\nThere are three types of dengue fever in order of less severe to most: the typical uncomplicated dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHS) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).\n\nThere is not a vaccine for dengue fever. There is no treatment for dengue, just treat the symptoms.\n\nFor more infectious disease news and information, visit and \u201clike\u201d the Infectious Disease News Facebook page and the Outbreak News This Week Radio Show page.\n\nNeed editorial assistance in preparing journal articles, dissertations, thesis, grant applications, and reports?
