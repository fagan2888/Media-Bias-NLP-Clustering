Our Government is Hopelessly Corrupt, Dangerously Stupid, Or Both

Government bureaucrats have been paying out billions in tax credits to illegal aliens, according to the Washington Times.

The federal government’s decision to pay out billions of dollars in tax credits to illegal immigrants likely was made by midlevel bureaucrats and has never received full congressional scrutiny, according to a study that the Center for Immigration Studies is releasing Monday. The report, written by CIS fellow David North, says the Internal Revenue Service doled out $4.2 billion in what is known as the “additional child tax credit” in 2010 to those using an individual taxpayer identification number, or ITIN, which is usually a signal of an illegal immigrant.

The IRS doesn't even check, because it claims the law doesn't allow it to.

Investigators identified one address in Atlanta where 23,994 ITIN-related tax refunds were sent — including 8,393 refunds deposited to a single bank account. Mr. North said those were pretty good indications of fraud. He said the IRS should also look for cases where an ITIN filer goes from claiming no dependents to claiming four or five dependents the next year.
