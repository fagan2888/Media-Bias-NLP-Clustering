Janitorial staff did not face a pay cut \u2014 and Capitol Hill administrative officials even issued a statement saying the president\u2019s remarks were \u2018not true.\u2019 Then the White House tried to argue that janitors at least faced a loss of overtime. That was not correct either. The episode was emblematic of the administration\u2019s sequester rhetoric.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, in another scandal that has plagued the administration for most of 2013, the Post slapped down the president\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe day after Benghazi happened, I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama did refer to an \u2018act of terror\u2019 in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi attack, but in vague terms, wrapped in a patriotic fervor,\u201d the Post wrote. \u201cHe never affirmatively stated that the American ambassador died because of an \u2018act of terror.\u2019 Then, over a period of two weeks, given three opportunities in interviews to affirmatively agree that the Benghazi attack was a terrorist attack, the president obfuscated or ducked the question. So this is a case of taking revisionist history too far for political reasons.\u201d\n\nThe Post also nailed Republicans, calling out Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) whose committee is investigating the administration\u2019s handling of security at the U.S. compound in Benghazi. Issa charged that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denied security for Libyan personnel with her signature on a cable.\n\n\u201cThe issue became a political flash point after four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, were killed at two U.S. compounds in Benghazi,\u201d the Post said. \u201cBut the claim that Clinton signed the cable was absurd, as every cable, even the most mundane, bears the secretary\u2019s \u2018signature,\u2019 because it is automatically added by the communications center. There is no evidence Clinton was even aware of the request.\u201d\n\nYou can see the entire list of Pinocchios at The Washington Post.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama netted three of the 10 \u201cbiggest Pinocchios of 2013\u201d as judged by The Washington Post's Fact Checker, including the assertion that \u201cIf you like your health care, you can keep it.\u201d\u00a0The other misleading statements from the president were over the Benghazi terrorist attack and the sequester.", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/12/16/washington-post-releases-10-biggest-pinocchios-of-the-year-guess-how-many-belong-to-obama/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/600x4054.jpg", "title": "Washington Post Releases 10 \u2018Biggest Pinocchios\u2019 of the Year\u2026Guess How Many Belong to Obama", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "washington, post, releases, list, top, pinocchio, lies, 2013, obama, takes, three, out, 10", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, obamacare, politics, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 10694, "gplus-count": 32, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/726042", "categories": "barack-obama,obamacare,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 171, "description": "President Barack Obama netted three of the 10 \u201cbiggest Pinocchios of 2013\u201d as judged by The Washington Post's Fact Checker, including the assertion that \u201cIf you like your health care, you can keep it.\u201d\u00a0The other misleading statements from the president were over the Benghazi terrorist attack and the sequester.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 15, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "President Barack Obama netted three of the 10 \u201cbiggest Pinocchios of 2013\u201d as judged by The Washington Post's Fact Checker, including the assertion that \u201cIf you like your health care, you can keep it.\u201d\u00a0The other misleading statements from the president were over the Benghazi terrorist attack and the sequester.", "title": "Washington Post Releases 10 \u2018Biggest Pinocchios\u2019 of the Year\u2026Guess How Many Belong to Obama", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/12/16/washington-post-releases-10-biggest-pinocchios-of-the-year-guess-how-many-belong-to-obama/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/600x4054.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 405}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2013-12-16T11:23:01+00:00", "twitter-count": 397}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb962\"", "article_summary": "The Post listed the health care assertion first among all the other statements deemed as false, giving it four Pinocchios, the highest ranking under the system.\nThere is no evidence Clinton was even aware of the request.\u201dYou can see the entire list of Pinocchios at The Washington Post.\n\u201cThis memorable promise by President Obama backfired on him when the Affordable Care Act went into effect and millions of Americans started receiving cancellation notices,\u201d the Post said of the keeping your insurance pledge.\n\u201cThe issue became a political flash point after four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, were killed at two U.S. compounds in Benghazi,\u201d the Post said.\nIssa charged that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denied security for Libyan personnel with her signature on a cable."}
