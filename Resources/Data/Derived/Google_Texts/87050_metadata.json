It passed in the state Senate with a 23-15 vote with every Democrat but one supporting it over the unanimous objections of GOP senators.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBut the state Assembly may not echo the Senate\u2019s endorsement, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The Health Committee, which is next to face the bill this week, is comprised of 19 members, 13 of whom are Democrats who are usually united\u2013but six Democrats, including five Latinos, may balk at voting for the bill.\n\nInterestingly, many of the Democrats on the fence typically support leftist positions; Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), supported gay marriage; Assemblyman Sebastian Ridley-Thomas (D-Los Angeles) has strongly supported Obamacare; and Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles) has supported giving illegal immigrants driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nRoger Hernandez (D-West Covina), Freddie Rodriguez (D-Pomona) and Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles) may also vote against SB 128.\n\nRidley-Thomas told the Los Angeles Times that SB 129 makes him uncomfortable, adding, \u201cMedicine is organized to promote wellness, not death.\u201d\n\nHernandez said to the Pasadena Star-News, \u201cThere are people who are concerned for patients \u2014 worried that big business may want to guide people in that direction to save the high expenditures that are often related to the high-priced stays in hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church strongly opposes SB 128, which may be a factor in the decision of the five recalcitrant Latinos. Los Angeles Archbishop Jose H. Gomez wrote, \u201cThe compassion that doctor-assisted suicide offers is hollow. Helping someone to die \u2014 even if that person asks for that help \u2014 is still killing. And killing is not compassion. It is killing\u2026.Killing the people we find too difficult, too burdensome or too expensive to care for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aid-in-Dying Bill May Fail Due to SoCal Democrat Latinos", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Aid-in-Dying Bill May Fail Due to SoCal Democrat Latinos", "title": "Aid-in-Dying Bill May Fail Due to SoCal Democrat Latinos - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-10.52.25-AM.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/07/07/aid-in-dying-bill-may-fail-due-to-socal-democrat-latinos/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Aid-in-Dying Bill May Fail Due to SoCal Democrat Latinos", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-10.52.25-AM.png", "title": "Aid-in-Dying Bill May Fail Due to SoCal Democrat Latinos - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "aid-in-dying, Brittany Maynard, democrats, latinos, SB 128, State Assembly,Breitbart California, Medicine,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "State Assembly", "published_time": "2015-07-07T12:45:26-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "After the California Medical Association stopped opposing SB 128 in May, the bill\u2019s passage seemed assured.\nIt passed in the state Senate with a 23-15 vote with every Democrat but one supporting it over the unanimous objections of GOP senators.\nRoger Hernandez (D-West Covina), Freddie Rodriguez (D-Pomona) and Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles) may also vote against SB 128.\nInterestingly, many of the Democrats on the fence typically support leftist positions; Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), supported gay marriage; Assemblyman Sebastian Ridley-Thomas (D-Los Angeles) has strongly supported Obamacare; and Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles) has supported giving illegal immigrants driver\u2019s licenses.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut the state Assembly may not echo the Senate\u2019s endorsement, according to the San Jose Mercury News."}
