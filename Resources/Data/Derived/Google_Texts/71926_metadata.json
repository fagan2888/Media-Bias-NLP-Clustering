YouTube abounds with videos of the cult\u2019s celebrity devotees and zomboid inquisitors. And the group\u2019s nutty particulars \u2014the mad founder; the \u201cbillion year\u201d membership contracts; the evil Xenu, galactic bad boy of 75,000,000 years ago\u2014are a source of continuing amusement. But Scientology remains a faintly sinister organization. Fattened with cash by a dubious IRS decision that awarded it tax-free status in 1993, it is a church whose chief sacrament is litigation, and it has been as savage in its attacks on critics as it is relentless in its harassment of apostates.\n\nNone of this will be news to longtime Scientology observers. But Alex Gibney\u2019s new documentary, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, helpfully assembles a lot of it in one place, and the film will likely pop some eyes among those only casually acquainted with the church\u2019s bizarre workings.\n\nThe picture is based on a 2013 book by Lawrence Wright, which grew out of a New Yorker profile of the writer and director Paul Haggis (Crash), a bitterly disaffected former Scientologist who bailed out of the faith in 2009, after 34 years as a true believer. Haggis\u2014who broke with the church over its hostility toward homosexuality (he has two gay daughters)\u2014is joined here by Wright himself, and by a number of other dropouts, among them former Scientology executives, rank-and-file members (including Jason Beghe, star of the TV series Chicago P.D.), and a very talkative PR woman named Sylvia \u201cSpanky\u201d Taylor, once employed at Scientology\u2019s Hollywood Celebrity Center as a handler for John Travolta.\n\nThe Oscar-winning Gibney (Taxi to the Dark Side) smoothly blends his talking heads with little-seen footage of wacky Scientology gatherings (one of them a 42nd-birthday party for Tom Cruise at which the star breaks into a hip-shaking reprise of his \u201cOld Time Rock and Roll\u201d number from Risky Business). There are also vintage interviews with the late L. Ron Hubbard, the charismatic fabulist who created Scientology (mainly as a tax dodge, it seems). Hubbard\u2019s background as a pulp science-fiction writer was instrumental in the invention of this new theology, so heavily concerned with outer space and past lives (Hubbard is said to have believed he was once a Phoenician prince). As Wright says, \u201cScientology really is a journey into the mind of L. Ron Hubbard.\u201d\n\nIn touring the usual checkpoints of Scientology takedowns, we naturally see the E-meters\u2014primitive lie detectors\u2014that gauge initiates\u2019 responses to questions like \u201cWhat are you most afraid of?\u201d and \u201cDo you have a secret you\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll find out?\u201d The purposes to which such intimate information could be put is an issue that hovers over the film\u2019s sections on Cruise and Travolta. (Similar dirt-digging has long been suspected in the IRS\u2019 sudden reversal of its decades-long denial of tax-exemption for the church\u2014a turnabout that has enabled Scientology to hire fleets of top lawyers to pursue its innumerable lawsuits, and to build a worldwide real-estate portfolio worth a reported $3-billion.)\n\nLetters from Hubbard\u2019s second wife, Sara Hollister, are quoted in voiceover (\u201cI felt he was\u2026hoodwinking people\u201d), and there are disturbing tales from the Sea Org, Scientology\u2019s quasi-naval auxiliary, and the Rehabilitation Project Force, a sort of prison camp for wayward members. We also see current Scientology leader David Miscavige, with his clenched grin and lasery eyes, presiding over a rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on a neo-Nuremberg stage set that might have been designed by Albert Speer. (It\u2019s too bad the film had no room to include the church\u2019s decade-long legal onslaught against TIME magazine, which in a 1991 cover story titled \u201cThe Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\u201d called the church \u201ca hugely profitable global racket.\u201d (Scientology\u2019s charges were eventually dismissed.)\n\nThe church denies virtually everything that\u2019s written about it. But while it has claimed to have 8,000,000 members, the real number, according to Wright, is closer to 50,000. As they move up the \u201cBridge\u201d of Scientological enlightenment, these aspirants are charged ever-increasing amounts of money for their next infusion of knowledge. And what do they get for this near-endless outlay? Haggis found out, because he finally achieved the ultimate enlightenment in a document, written in L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s own hand, which laid out the whole belief system. Haggis, who says he had previously never read anything critical of Scientology, was staggered by what he read there\u2014the interstellar overlord, the enslaved aliens, the body thetans and whatnot. He recalls shaking his head in wonder and saying, \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d And then he was gone.\n\n(Going Clear opens in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco this weekend. It debuts on HBO on March 29.)\n\nThe Wrecking Crew\n\nThe Wrecking Crew is a rare labor of loving commitment. It\u2019s an evocative documentary about a group of Los Angeles session musicians who in the 1960s and \u201970s played on a dizzying array of records by acts ranging from the Beach Boys and the Mamas & the Papas to Frank Sinatra and Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole. Also the Mothers of Invention, the Byrds, and Simon & Garfunkel. Also Barbra Streisand. They were a shifting group of maybe 20 musicians, but they were so in-demand, and played so many sessions together, that the key players became a great band. \u201cThey were so tight,\u201d says Micky Dolenz, whose own group, the Monkees, benefitted greatly from Wrecking Crew backup.\n\nDirector Denny Tedesco began shooting this film in 1996, the year his father, Wrecking Crew guitarist Tommy Tedesco, was diagnosed with cancer. He quickly reunited his dad with a number of old colleagues, among them bassist Carol Kaye (who had played guitar on Ritchie Valens\u2019 1958 hit \u201cLa Bamba\u201d) and the mighty drummer Hal Blaine (whose indelible stomp opens the Ronettes\u2019 \u201cBe My Baby\u201d). Tedesco filmed them all sitting around a table telling stories about the old days, and then, after his father\u2019s death the following year, spent the next decade scrounging for money to finish his picture, which required licensing for more than 120 music cues. We can be thankful that he found it.\n\nThe Wrecking Crew evolved out of Phil Spector\u2019s \"Wall of Sound\" sessions at Gold Star Studios in the early \u201960s. Many of the musicians were New York players, drawn west by the easy living and abundant studio work. (\u201cI was makin\u2019 millions of dollars,\u201d says Blaine.) It was a magical time, nicely summed up by songwriter Jimmy Webb: \u201cThe perfumed air, the night-blooming jasmine, the sound of the Beach Boys wafting from house to house\u2026how dreamy it all was.\u201d\n\nBeach Boys leader Brian Wilson, who worshipped Spector\u2019s records, started booking Phil\u2019s musicians to play his own sessions. \u201cThey were the ones with all the spirit and all the know-how,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially for rock & roll.\u201d You can hear the Crew players starting to weigh in on singles like \u201cFun, Fun, Fun\u201d and \u201cI Get Around,\u201d then growing more numerous on tracks like \u201cCalifornia Girls,\u201d and finally\u2014when Wilson decided to remain in the studio while the Beach Boys went out on the road\u2014taking over almost completely for \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d (a three-month recording project) and the epochal Pet Sounds album. (The Beach Boys\u2019 incomparable vocals of course remained an indispensable element of all their records.)\n\nTedesco makes astute use of old photos and, to a lesser extent, studio footage to accompany reminiscences by such Crew members as guitarist Al Casey and keyboardists Leon Russell and Don Randi, and reflections by such scene veterans as Herb Alpert, Frank Zappa, Dick Clark, and onetime backup singer Cher. Among the many tangy recollections of how things worked back in those studio days is one provided by Byrds leader Roger McGuinn, who describes showing up in the studio to record \u201cMr. Tambourine Man\u201d and finding himself the only Byrd on hand\u2014some Wrecking Crew guys handled everything else. McGuinn says they were able to lay down two tracks that day, in one three-hour session. Later on, he adds, when all of the Byrds went into a studio to record \u201cTurn! Turn! Turn!\u201d it required 77 takes.\n\nThe Wrecking Crew was a secret weapon that remained secret for years. Dick Clark says, \u201cI had no idea certain people didn\u2019t play on their own records until the Monkees came along.\u201d As for the record companies that commissioned these hits, \u201cAll they wanted was the product. Who created it? That was incidental.\u201d\n\nNot anymore.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Strange tales from the church of Xenu, and the secret weapon of \u201960s rock.", "title": "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and The Wrecking Crew", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/03/13/going-clear-scientology-and-the-prison-o", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14262084143607.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Strange tales from the church of Xenu, and the secret weapon of \u201960s rock.", "title": "<em>Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief</em> and <em>The Wrecking Crew</em>", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14262084143607.jpg", "creator": "@kurt_loder", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-13T13:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/kurt-loder"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "The Wrecking CrewThe Wrecking Crew is a rare labor of loving commitment.\nThe Wrecking Crew evolved out of Phil Spector\u2019s \"Wall of Sound\" sessions at Gold Star Studios in the early \u201960s.\n\u201cThey were so tight,\u201d says Micky Dolenz, whose own group, the Monkees, benefitted greatly from Wrecking Crew backup.\nDirector Denny Tedesco began shooting this film in 1996, the year his father, Wrecking Crew guitarist Tommy Tedesco, was diagnosed with cancer.\nTambourine Man\u201d and finding himself the only Byrd on hand\u2014some Wrecking Crew guys handled everything else."}
