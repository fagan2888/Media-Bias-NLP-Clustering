A TCU official then accused Vincent of \u201cinfliction of bodily or emotional harm,\u201d instructed him to write a letter explaining how he should be punished, and ultimately suspended him.\n\nVincent\u2019s sentence extends until graduation. He is allowed to attend classes in the fall, but may not participate in extracurricular activities. He must serve 60 hours of community service and take an \u201cIssues in Diversity\u201d course. He is forbidden from living on campus.\n\nWhat did Vincent do? He tweeted some unkind remarks about Baltimore residents and Muslims. Specifically, he referred to the \u201choodrat criminals in Baltimore\u201d and told someone to \u201cchill the fuck out you islamic shit head.\u201d A Tumblr user named Kelsey, who does not attend TCU, posted screenshots of his comments and implored others to report him to TCU\u2019s Campus Life department. A number of Tumblr users, including Kelsey herself, did so.\n\nLater, Kelsey reported that TCU Associate Dean of Campus Life Glory Z. Robinson had written her back and promised to \u201caddress this situation.\u201d\n\nThe very next day, on April 29, 2015, Robinson sent Vincent a letter accusing him of violating the student code. He was accused of \u201cinfliction of bodily or emotional harm\u201d and \u201cdisorderly conduct.\u201d He was told to write a letter of apology and propose possible sanctions for himself. He complied.\n\nAfter receiving his apology, Robinson notified Vincent that she had found him guilty, in part based on his own \u201cwritten statements.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education has taken issue with virtually all aspects of TCU\u2019s handling of the case. Ari Cohn, an attorney and program officer at FIRE, noted that although TCU is a private institution\u2014and thus not bound to follow the First Amendment\u2014the university has made a promise to respect its students\u2019 free speech rights. An empty promise, evidently:\n\n\u201cIf the TCU administration is willing to punish its students every time they offend someone on the Internet, TCU students should be very afraid,\u201d said Cohn. \u201cThat TCU would sacrifice its students\u2019 free speech and due process rights to appease a social media mob betrays where its priorities lie\u2014with its public relations department, not its students\u2019 fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that as far as FIRE can tell, none of the people who complained about Vincent\u2019s comments were actually TCU students. But even if they had been, it\u2019s grossly inappropriate for administrators to pretend that the use of crass language on the internet is equivalent to disorderly conduct.\n\nEqually galling is Robinson\u2019s complete lack of respect for due process. It looks like she not only suspended him without a hearing, she entrapped him by demanding that he apologize.\n\nFIRE has vowed to use \u201call resources at our disposal\u201d if TCU does not immediately drop Vincent\u2019s punishment.\n\nI should add that I personally find Vincent\u2019s remarks distasteful. But speech is sometimes nasty\u2014and even nasty speech can serve a productive role in dialogue on college campuses. Challenging Vincent\u2019s views of Muslims could in fact be a useful exercise for all. But formally punishing him is an act of pure censorship that puts everyone\u2019s rights in danger.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "An administrator treated his apology as a confession.
