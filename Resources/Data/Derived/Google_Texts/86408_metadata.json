The Fox host asked whether it makes more sense to chip away at Obamacare through the courts rather than directly attack the law, as Cruz has repeatedly done.\n\n\u201cI think today it is the essence of pragmatism to acknowledge this isn\u2019t working,\u201d he responded. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting millions of Americans. We need to start over.\u201d\n\nCruz also asserted that the Republican Party\u2019s bright prospects in November are due to his tough stand against Obamacare last fall \u2014 not the pussyfooting of some of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cI think the result politically where we are, in terms of the national elections, is in many ways a result of millions of Americans who rose up last fall and said Obamacare is a train wreck, it\u2019s a disaster, it is hurting millions of Americans,\u201d he declared. \u201cI think that elevated the national debate. And as a consequence President Obama has plummeted in the polls. Obamacare has plummeted in the polls.\u201d\n\nBut Cavuto still wouldn\u2019t let up, noting that most Republicans \u201clike your message. They agree with your message. They just think that you\u2019re a sort of \u2018burn-the-house-down\u2019 messenger, and you do more damage to the party\u2019s prospects with that fiery talk than just dialing it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s interesting Neil,\u201d Cruz replied. \u201cI think the reaction in Washington DC is the polar opposite to the reaction outside of Washington. You\u2019re right, in Washington DC there are a lot of career politicians in both parties that don\u2019t want change, that are invested in the status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest frustration that people across the country have is that our elected officials in both parties aren\u2019t listening to us,\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cYou hear that from the man and woman on the street. You hear that from Republicans, from Democrats, from independents, from libertarians: They\u2019re not listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so, are there folks in Washington who are dismayed that I\u2019m doing my level best to fight for free market principles and the Constitution? Yes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut at the end of the day \u2014 you know, it\u2019s interesting, you mentioned fiery rhetoric. You\u2019re not hearing any rhetoric from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we need to listen to the people who elected us and solve the grave fiscal and economic problems we have,\u201d the senator concluded.\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
