Scott. \u201cBetter Living Through Criticism\u201d is as much about self-doubt and ambivalence as it is about a critic\u2019s certainty, but it manages to be thrilling and grimly funny at times as well. Built around six chapters and four dialogues, the book considers film criticism \u2013 Scott\u2019s specialty \u2013 as well as music, books, painting, and personal history.\n\nScott is one of the best and most respected critics in the press today, but it didn\u2019t keep him from being attacked by Samuel L. Jackson after a tough review of \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron.\u201d \u201c # Avengers fans,NY Times critic AO Scott needs a new job! Let\u2019s help him find one! One he can ACTUALLY do!\u201d tweeted Jackson.\n\nJackson\u2019s criticism of his performance aside, Scott remains an idealist about culture. \u201cTime travel is impossible,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut you can go anywhere, to any period in history, in the pages of a book or sitting in front of a screen, and acquire a more intimate, richer sense of what I found there than you would through classroom study or organized travel.\u201d\n\nWe spoke to Scott from New York. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nYou begin and end the book with Q&A sections: Are those to show that criticism is about paradox and self-doubt as much as anything?\n\nYeah \u2013 there are a couple more in the middle, too. It\u2019s partly to suggest that criticism is an unfinished conversation and is always about argument and dispute and the impossibility of a last word. It\u2019s a conceit I borrowed from Oscar Wilde\u2026 And it\u2019s a way of getting antithetical ideas out there at the same time. Without having to go, \u201cOn the one hand, on the other hand.\u201d\n\nAnd I found it was a way to open up and lighten the discussion a bit. Some of those chapters get fairly dense and abstract. It seemed like that a slightly more informal, almost tongue-in-cheek, way of writing could leaven that.\n\nWhy are critics so often portrayed as failed artists or snobs? When did they get reputations as killjoys?\n\nI set out to find that, and I never found the origins. There was an amazing passage I found in Aristotle\u2019s \u201cPoetics\u201d \u2013 I don\u2019t even know who the critics were he was talking about. But you can go all the way back to the ancient Greeks.\n\nKilljoys\u2026 I came to think that had less to do with the personalities of critics as with the suspicion of criticism. So I think that these critics \u2013 Addison DeWitt [from \u201cAll About Eve\u201d] or Anton Ego [from \u201cRatatouille\u201d] \u2013 are monsters of ego. So it\u2019s about the discomfort people feel about judgment, about the expression of strong opinions, about the not-niceness of being honest about things. It seems much better to seem supportive, to be affirmative, to be generous.\n\nThere\u2019s a feeling artists work so hard on these things and critics come along and trash them. Of course just as often, critics come along and celebrate them. And support them, and do the hard work of understanding them. But we all feel vulnerable to judgment. And scapegoating critics is a way we express that vulnerability. And reading my book\u2019s reviews, I\u2019m seeing that from the other side.\n\nSpeaking of judgment: Did Samuel Jackson\u2019s attack on you for your review of \u201cThe Avengers\u201d sequel \u2013 tweeting that you should be fired \u2014 take you by surprise? That was a little strange, wasn\u2019t it?\n\nIn a way, of course, people do say that. But most are too polite or diplomatic to call it out.\n\nAnd it was startling to have a movie star of Samuel Jackson\u2019s fame, and of his caliber, to do that. He didn\u2019t Tweet at me \u2013 I just saw all the \u201cAvengers\u201d fan taking up the cause, and showing up in my timeline about what an idiot I was.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon speaks to A.O.
