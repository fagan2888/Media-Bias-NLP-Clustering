That's added to the \"Current Amount Due for Benefits\" of $322.26, for a total monthly premium of $345.40 for one person.\n\nTaxes have been part of health plan costs for decades. Economic theory says business taxes are often borne by consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nBut insurers haven't typically published taxes on their invoices, says Mark Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University.\n\n\"One thing that bothers me is attributing any amount specifically to the 'Affordable Care Act,' \" he said via email. \"There are also state premium taxes, and normal corporate and sales taxes, none of which are itemized the same way.\"\n\nHe also questioned whether Alabama Blue Cross would have been able to calculate the amount so precisely.\n\nObamacare backers say the taxes are critical to the health law, which stands to bring insurers billions in new premium revenue. They point out that federal subsidies will help many consumers pay not just the taxes but big portions of the premiums.\n\nAlabama BlueCross accounted for these ACA taxes in the amounts shown on individual subscriber bills, said spokeswoman Koko Mackin:\n\nAlabama BlueCross could end up losing some of that backstop money permanently if its medical claims turn out to be lower than expected. But it might also get some back if costs rise past projections, Hall said.\n\nThe ACA's risk-adjustment fee is a \"zero-sum program\" spread across the industry, he said. \"The government doesn't keep the fee. It's just a pass-through, from some insurers to other insurers.\" It's unlikely Alabama BlueCross knows yet what its risk-adjustment costs will be in the end, he said.\n\nAnother backstop fee, a temporary, $63 per head annual reinsurance fee, is projected to lower average premiums for individual subscribers by as much as 5 percent or 10 percent, Hall said. That's because all insurance plans pay the fee while the $10 billion it generates next year will be used to subsidize only the smaller individual insurance market", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Taxes have been part of health plan costs for decades, but they're not usually itemized on customers' bills.
