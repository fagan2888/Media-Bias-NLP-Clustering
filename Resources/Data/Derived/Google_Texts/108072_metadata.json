Thus our Community-Organizer-in-Chief pontificates endlessly about income inequality, to justify his determination to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d our nation, so that \u201ceveryone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.\u201d\n\nThose would be the same rules that let the IRS target conservatives, the VA make veterans wait months for treatment, and the EPA violate every standard of scientific integrity \u2013 with no repercussions. It\u2019s clearly not corporations or most citizens who don\u2019t play by the rules. It\u2019s Obama bureaucrats, supporters and sycophants, who manipulate government powers to their financial and political advantage.\n\nAs to \u201cfairness,\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s politically-loaded definition is designed to inspire more class and racial warfare, especially among those who angrily assert that they are being abused by Big Oil, too-big-to-fail banks, callous healthcare insurers and other large corporations.\n\nIt\u2019s also intended to distract from massive failures of so many liberal programs, such as Great Society welfare programs that have spent some $22 trillion to date and devastated black families and communities \u2013 and the Affordable Care Act, which has ensured that millions don\u2019t get to keep their doctors but will get to pay another 20 percent in average premium increases for 2016, plus still higher deductibles.\n\nBut big-money donors, Hollywood actors and environmentalists increasingly call the shots on \u201cfairness\u201d issues in the energy and environmental policy arena. With the president calling climate change \u201cthe worst threat to future generations,\u201d and more than 21,000 new regulations imposed since he took office, it\u2019s clear that the 1 Percenters take priority over the 99 Percenters. Electric vehicles are a prime example.\n\nAt a starting price of $33,170 for a 2016 Chevy Volt to more than $101,000 for an electric Tesla Roadster (the cheapest model), these so-called \u201cgreen\u201d cars are far beyond the reach of most American families. In fact, most workers have less money today than 40 years ago: average American wages have fallen from $53,294 in 1973 to $50,383 in 2014, using constant 2014 numbers.\n\nAnd yet, all levels of government have instigated numerous rules that favor electric and hybrid vehicles at the expense of American families, who continue to see costs rise for nearly every essential commodity, thanks to regulations, special tax treatments and executive actions. Only gasoline, diesel fuel and natural gas prices have fallen \u2013 thanks to the fracking revolution that has unleashed US oil and gas production.\n\nElectric and hybrid car buyers get substantial government subsidies, including tax credits of $2,500 to $7,500 (depending on the car\u2019s battery size). Electric utilities in several states also provide a special rate for plug-in vehicles, to reduce the cost of charging electric and hybrid cars. Some states even offer credits for the purchase of charging equipment. And it\u2019s largely justified by global warming horror stories.\n\nMany insurance companies, including Farmers, also support plug-in vehicle purchases via discounted auto insurance policies for electric and hybrid cars in Maryland and other states. Several states also offer free parking and free electric charging at government-operated, taxpayer-funded charging stations.\n\nCalifornia also provides rebates to people who buy or lease green vehicles or buy specialized charging equipment to install in their homes. Sony Pictures Entertainment offers a $5,000 incentive to its wealthy Hollywood employees who purchase electric or hybrid cars.\n\nIn several jurisdictions, green car drivers can also avoid traffic morasses that the rest of us must endure. Special stickers give them access to HOV lanes (High Occupancy Vehicles) that drivers of gasoline-powered vehicles cannot enter without one or more passengers in the car.\n\nIn the District of Columbia, green car owners pay less on registration fees and get an exemption from the excise tax on their original certificate of title. Montana and several other states offer substantial tax credits and other benefits for electric car conversions. New Jersey gives a 10 percent discount on off-peak tolls for the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. Warren, Rhode Island gives residents with plug-in cars an excise tax exemption up to $100.\n\nWho pays for all of these benefits (and many more that I haven\u2019t listed)? We all do. Who benefits? Actor Leonardo DiCaprio for one \u2013 and others who share his lavish 0.01-percent lifestyle, while proudly driving their Teslas and flouting their sensitivity to ecological and climate \u201ccrises.\u201d\n\nThese wealthy motorists also contribute less to transportation infrastructure. Drivers of gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles pay a user fee each time they fill up: 18.4 cents per gallon in federal taxes for gasoline and 24.4 cents a gallon for diesel, to help pay for bridge and road construction and repairs. Electric and hybrid vehicle owners use the same roads and bridges \u2013 but pay zero to minimal fuel taxes.\n\nGeorgia, Washington and a few other states assess user fees on electric and hybrid vehicles to cover road projects, but politically connected green drivers strongly oppose them. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe repealed Virginia\u2019s $64-a-year tax after he was elected.\n\nAccording to a recent Experian Automotive study, owners of battery-powered cars are more than twice as wealthy as average Americans. They also tend to be richer and younger than those who buy hybrids. Of those who purchased electric cars in 2013, 21 percent had annual incomes of $175,000 or more.\n\nNot surprisingly, seven of the top ten cities for green car shoppers are in California. This year\u2019s top seller (a measly 17,000 sold through September) is the Tesla S, with an MSRP starting at $106,200. (The ten most popular \u201cregular folks\u201d vehicles sold 295,000 to 527,000 units apiece in 2014.)\n\nOf course, the hefty sticker price does not include the multiple freebies Tesla owners receive: subsidies, rebates, tax forgiveness, and the other benefits that average Americans pay for but don\u2019t enjoy. In the meantime, the Obama Administration continues inflicting financial pain on poor, minority and working class families through regulations and executive orders that raise costs and stop job creation in its tracks.\n\nThe worst of the lot is the new ground-level ozone standard, which has been called the most costly regulation in U.S. history. This rule alone threatens to destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs, curtail funding for highway improvements in national parks and other \u201cnonattainment areas,\u201d and prevent the expansion of businesses unless other similar businesses close down.\n\nThe deceptively named Clean Power Plan will sharply raise electricity costs for average ratepayers, while doing nothing to clean our air. New rules governing methane emissions will likely impair drilling and put upward pressure on oil and gas prices \u2013 the one bright spot that is helping working-class Americans save about $100 a month via lower fuel costs. The Obama EPA and Interior Department are also doing all they can to make more US onshore and offshore energy supplies off limits, wage war on all fossil fuels, and lock the United States into a punitive new climate treaty.\n\nIt is a litany of rules that only elitists with plenty of disposable income could love.\n\nThat is not fairness. It is an intentional way to enrich and empower the wealthy, while stealing from everyone else, by pushing through policies that penalize blue-collar workers and families but do little to improve health or environmental quality. What the president calls \u201cfair\u201d is legalized or dictatorial theft, perpetrated on the poor, to get Tom Steyer and Terry McAuliffe to raise more campaign funds for members of the president\u2019s party.\n\nOf course, President Obama isn\u2019t the only one who uses the word \u201cfair\u201d in political remarks. In her first major speech on the economy, Hillary Clinton called for more lib-style \u201cgrowth and fairness,\u201d saying it would be \u201cmy mission from the first day I\u2019m president to the last.\u201d We can hardly wait.\n\nThis kind of crony-corporatist \u201ccompassion\u201d has become the hallmark of environmentalism and climate change politics.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Big-money donors, Hollywood actors and environmentalists increasingly call the shots on \u201cfairness\u201d issues in the energy and environmental policy arena.", "title": "Government-style \u201cfairness\u201d for the 1% - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/white-house-blue-sky.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/246349/government-style-fairness-1/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-11-09T14:17:36+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Big-money donors, Hollywood actors and environmentalists increasingly call the shots on \u201cfairness\u201d issues in the energy and environmental policy arena.", "title": "Government-style \u201cfairness\u201d for the 1% - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/white-house-blue-sky.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Big-money donors, Hollywood actors and environmentalists increasingly call the shots on \u201cfairness\u201d issues in the energy and environmental policy arena."}, "article_summary": "But big-money donors, Hollywood actors and environmentalists increasingly call the shots on \u201cfairness\u201d issues in the energy and environmental policy arena.\nCalifornia also provides rebates to people who buy or lease green vehicles or buy specialized charging equipment to install in their homes.\nOf those who purchased electric cars in 2013, 21 percent had annual incomes of $175,000 or more.\nSony Pictures Entertainment offers a $5,000 incentive to its wealthy Hollywood employees who purchase electric or hybrid cars.\nElectric vehicles are a prime example."}
