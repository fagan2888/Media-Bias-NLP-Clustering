Bottom-line cost differences between the old and new plans are the main driver of these decisions \u2014 and in some cases small employers are finding that a new Obamacare policy is a better deal financially.\n\nThe ACA made sweeping changes to health plans starting Jan. 1, 2014, but in November 2013 President Barack Obama announced that small employers and individuals could keep their old plans if insurers agreed to renew them.\n\n\n\nInsurers in New Jersey didn\u2019t continue offering their old individual policies, most of which were \u201cbasic and essential\u201d plans that were in substantial noncompliance with the ACA.\n\n\n\nHowever, the option to keep the old plans was available in the small group market. Depending on their insurance carriers, many small employers with fewer than 50 workers were able to keep their old, pre-ACA plan into 2014.\n\n\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state\u2019s largest small group insurer, kept the old policies alive through an \u201cearly renewal\u201d option. Small groups whose old plans were set to come up for renewal in 2014 were given the option of renewing them early, before Dec. 1, 2013 \u2014 and thus keep them for another 12 months.\n\n\n\nNow, Horizon is offering to renew for another year old plans that come due in the fourth quarter of 2014. Horizon told NJBIZ that this option is available to approximately 13,450 small groups whose plans are up for renewal during the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\n\n\nLast year, UnitedHealthcare also allowed its small group clients keep their old plans, and is now renewing them for another year. Unlike Horizon, which will only renew old plans that come due in the fourth quarter, UnitedHealthcare is renewing old plans that come due at any point in 2014.\n\n\n\nInsurance brokers are now working with small employers covered by Horizon and UnitedHealthcare, and analyzing their options to see if it makes sense to stick with the old plans, or to switch over the new ACA plans.\n\n\n\nWilliam Corson, vice president of group benefits at AEPG Wealth Strategies in Warren, said the cost differential between the old and new plans varies widely from one employer group to another. \u201cI\u2019ll see one client and the (new ACA policy) is 40 percent higher, and then I\u2019ll go to a different client a half-hour later and the new ACA policy is less than what they are currently paying.\u201d\n\n\n\nSean Keegan, senior groups account manager at AEPG, agreed: \u201cI looked at one group and the old plan rate was 20 percent higher,\u201d but the premiums were flat if he switched the client to a new ACA plan. \u201cAnd then the next group I pull off the pile, it\u2019s the exact opposite.\u201d He said that, in one case, \u201cThe new ACA plan was a much better price\u201d than the old plan.\n\nClick here to sign up for NJBIZ's email news blasts\n\n\n\nAmeriHealth New Jersey did early renewals last year, but is not renewing old plans for a second year. Both Aetna and Cigna opted not to renew the old plans, but instead moved to the new ACA plans.\n\n\n\nMike Munoz, senior vice president of sales and marketing, AmeriHealth New Jersey, told NJBIZ: \"In December 2013, we offered small groups an early renewal option to maintain their current policies for this year in order to ensure a smooth transition. We now are focused on migrating all of our subscribers to ACA-compliant plans to assure adherence and allow members access to the enhanced benefits available through the ACA-compliant plans. Our systems are ready for this transition.\"\n\n\n\nAmeriHealth said about 450 groups took advantage of the early renewal option.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Cigna spokesman Mark Slitt said: \u201cIn 2013, we had already migrated our New Jersey small group and individual customers to ACA-compliant plans before we received regulatory guidance about retaining non-ACA-compliant plans. That was a small number of customers, and as far as I can tell, we did not receive any customer requests to keep the non-compliant plans.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 2014 ACA plans require pediatric dental coverage and have different deductibles and other features, but in New Jersey they aren\u2019t significantly different from the old plans, which are already subject to certain ACA rules as well as New Jersey\u2019s health insurance mandates, which in some cases go beyond federal law.\n\n\n\nFor example, all plans, both old and new, must offer preventive care without copays and let parents keep their children on their policy until age 26.\n\n\n\nBut a major change with the new ACA plans involves how the insurance carrier quotes the premiums to the small employer. In the past, the insurer would give the employer a \u201cblended\u201d rate. For example, every single individual in the group and every family in the group would have the same premium. Under Obamacare, every individual in the group gets a separate premium, primarily depending on age; family coverage varies by the ages of the parents and the ages and number of their children.\n\n\n\nKeegan said for one of his small group clients, an employee with a spouse and three children paid $1,000 a month under the old plan, which increased to $1,800 a month under the new ACA plan.\n\n\n\nInsurance brokers said some employers are coping with the new rating structure by averaging the premiums to avoid wide swings in premiums from one worker to another.\n\n\n\nInsurance broker David Oscar of Altigro said it\u2019s not necessarily a good deal to stick with an old plan: \u201cIt all translates to dollars and cents. If the dollars and cents are not attractive, what is the point?\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of his clients is a law firm that pays $29,000 a month in premiums. If the firm sticks with the old plan, that will rise to $33,000 a month. Oscar said he will recommend that this client save money by switching to a new ACA plan, at $27,000 a month.\n\n\n\nAnother client had a choice between an old plan with a $3,000 deductible and a new ACA plan with a $6,000 deductible. Oscar said the premium for the old plan is $30 a month more than the ACA plan, but it\u2019s worth paying a slightly higher premium to get a plan with a far lower deducible.\n\n\n\nSteven Paragone, employee benefits specialist at Northeastern Benefit Services in Princeton, said whether to stick with the old plan or move to a new one \u201cis a case-by-case, client-by-client needs analysis.\u201d And, he said, in addition to cost, benefit designs are a big factor. \u201cWe are looking at the overall plan design, and what the employer is trying to do with their benefit plan to attract and retain quality employees. Price is a major driver of the decision, but that is certainly not the only consideration.\u201d\n\n\n\nChristine Stearns, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the transition to the ACA has been difficult for many small employers. \u201cSo any continued relief from the (insurance) carriers to ease the move into the post-ACA world for these small employer groups is helpful for many of them.\u201d\n\n\n\nRight now, carriers are renewing old policies into 2015 \u2014 and they could continue even longer.\n\nIn March the federal government announced a two year-extension of this \u201ctransitional\u201d option, saying the old plans could be renewed until Oct. 1, 2016 \u2014 and thus remain in force through 2017.\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nNew name at No. 1 in NJBIZ Top 100 privately held companies\n\nMeadowlands lawmakers call for action on North Jersey casinos\n\nFacing imminent casino closings, Atlantic City officials stress transformation", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Thousands of small New Jersey employers are now deciding whether to keep their old, pre-Obamacare health plans for another year, or make the switch to new plans that conform to the Affordable Care Ac", "title": "Small employers face a dollars-and-sense decision: renew pre-Obamacare health plans, or shift to ACA-compliant ones | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140827/NJBIZ01/140829810/small-employers-face-a-dollarsandsense-decision-renew-preobamacare-health-plans-or-shift-to-acacompliant-ones", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140827/NJBIZ01/140829810/AR/0/AR-140829810.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Thousands of small New Jersey employers are now deciding whether to keep their old, pre-Obamacare health plans for another year, or make the switch to new plans that conform to the Affordable Care Ac", "title": "Small employers face a dollars-and-sense decision: renew pre-Obamacare health plans, or shift to ACA-compliant ones | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140827/NJBIZ01/140829810/AR/0/AR-140829810.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Thousands of small New Jersey employers are now deciding whether to keep their old, pre-Obamacare health plans for another year, or make the switch to new plans that conform to the Affordable Care Act.
