Rick Scott, who announced the state\u2019s unemployment figures from the DS Services plant in Lakeland, said the Tampa metro area is No. 1 in Florida for current job openings in September with 49,695. The metro area was also first in the state in demand for high-wage, high-skill science, technology, engineering and math occupations, with 14,750 openings in September.\n\nThe Tampa metro area added 28,000 jobs in the past 12 months, Scott said, calling the figure \u201cgreat news.\u201d The industries with the largest gain in jobs over the year were leisure and hospitality with 12.900 new jobs and education and health services with 8,600 new jobs, the highest in the state for that industry, state figures show.\n\nPinellas County continues to stay just ahead of Hillsborough, with a 4.7 percent jobless rate in September, compared to 5 percent in August and 5.6 percent in September 2014. Pasco\u2019s rate continues to drop at 5.6 percent last month, compared to 5.9 percent in August and 6.5 percent in September 2014.\n\nHernando and Polk counties, while both showing slight progress, continue to struggle with unemployment. Hernando had a 6.5 percent jobless rate in September and Polk had 6.1 percent, down from 7.7 percent in Hernando from a year ago and down in Polk from 7.3 percent in September 2014.\n\nScott said the state\u2019s unemployment rate of 5.2 percent in September is the lowest in seven years. The state\u2019s rate in August was 5.4 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by 0.6 percent in the last 12 months. The Lakeland home and beverage delivery company where Scott made the announcement recently opened a new call center with plans to hire 400.\n\n\u201cOverall, my impression was that this is a very positive [jobs] report,\u201d said Mekael Teshome, Florida economist for The PNC Financial Services Group. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with a series of reports we\u2019ve been getting now for most of this year that Florida\u2019s economy is at cruising speed. Our major drivers are consumer spending, we\u2019ve got a lot more construction and housing and we have in-migration, which you can\u2019t pick up from this report, but it makes for a very solid foundation for growth.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s unemployment rate remained higher than the national rate of 5.1 percent in September, according to the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nNationwide, the number of people unemployed for less than five weeks increased by 268,000 to 2.4 million in September, partially offsetting an August decline. The number of long-term unemployed (27 weeks or more) stayed about the same as it was in August, at 2.1 million, nationally.\n\nThe state created 8,700 private-sector jobs in September and a total of 941,000 since December 2010, according to the governor. Scott said many of the unemployed found jobs through CareerSource Tampa Bay and the state\u2019s other 23 regional workforce boards.\n\nThe number of people employed just part time \u2014 and not by choice \u2014 declined by 447,000 to 6 million nationally in September, according to the Department of Labor. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut or they were unable to find full time employment.\n\nThe state of Florida does not break out the number of people involuntarily working part time in its monthly jobs reports.\n\nTeshome said he has seen a trend toward hiring more part-time employees for years, probably at least partly a result of the Great Recession. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new. If you go back years, well before the Affordable Care Act, the share of part-time jobs increased over time.\u201d\n\nDespite that, Teshome said PNC conducted a survey of small to mid-size businesses, which it published two weeks ago. The survey found that entrepreneurs in Florida are \u201cfairly optimistic and reflect a willingness to hire workers and boost pay. That\u2019s consistent with the favorable momentum we are seeing in Florida\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nyhammett@tampatrib.com\n\nTwitter: @Yvette_Hammett\n\n(813) 259-7127", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 17 Oct 2015 07:14:42 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 The job market just keeps getting better in the Tampa Bay area.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The job market just keeps getting better in the Tampa Bay area.", "title": "Job market keeps improving in Tampa Bay area", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/business/job-market-keeps-improving-in-tampa-bay-area-20151017/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20151017/ARTICLE/151019353/AR/0/AR-151019353.jpg", "height": 2667}, "updated_time": "2015-10-17T07:14:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The job market just keeps getting better in the Tampa Bay area.", "title": "Job market keeps improving in Tampa Bay area", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20151017/ARTICLE/151019353/AR/0/AR-151019353.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-10-17T07:14:42Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-10-17T07:14:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TAMPA \u2014 The job market just keeps getting better in the Tampa Bay area.\nRick Scott, who announced the state\u2019s unemployment figures from the DS Services plant in Lakeland, said the Tampa metro area is No.\nScott said the state\u2019s unemployment rate of 5.2 percent in September is the lowest in seven years.\nThe unemployment rate for the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area dropped almost a full percentage point in September, compared to a year ago, and Hillsborough County\u2019s rate was even lower.\nThe metro area was also first in the state in demand for high-wage, high-skill science, technology, engineering and math occupations, with 14,750 openings in September."}
