In boxing parlance, they\u2019re called \u201cphone booth\u201d fights. Two guys trading haymakers in the center of the ring.\n\nIt earned Alvarado a dangerous reputation as an entertaining all-or-nothing fighter living on the edge.\n\nBut then, in March, he turned that tag around. Alvarado went from brawler to boxer and out-punched Brandon Rios to win the World Boxing Organization junior welterweight title.\n\nOn Saturday night, Alvarado returns to the ring with his reputation again on the line. He will go against powerful Russian slugger Ruslan Provodnikov at the FirstBank Center in Broomfield to defend his title. The fight, Alvarado\u2019s first championship defense and first hometown fight since 2011, airs on HBO.\n\nIt\u2019s a matchup that has boxing fans drooling over the potential for action. Can Alvarado, seemingly a slugger at heart, again be a technical whiz and keep Provodnikov away? Or will the fight evolve into an all-out brawl?\n\n\u201cThe good news for Alvarado is he\u2019s a very good boxer,\u201d said HBO analyst Max Kellerman, who will call color commentary. \u201cProvodnikov\u2019s challenge is \u2026 can he force matters into a brawl and change the fight even when Alvarado doesn\u2019t want to slug?\u201d\n\nBetween them, Alvarado (34-1, 23 knockouts) and Provodnikov (22-2, 15 KOs) have each knocked out nearly 70 percent of their opponents. But both are coming off decisions \u2014 Alvarado won unanimously over Rios at 140 pounds, and Provodnikov lost a tough bout against Tim Bradley at 147 pounds.\n\n\u201cProvodnikov\u2019s quality as a tough guy is outstanding,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cAlvarado should slug only when he has to. But even then, Alvarado is a bad dude. \u2026 He might be able to slug with Provodnikov \u2014 and there will be moments of slugging.\u201d\n\nAgainst Rios, Alvarado got tricky. Coming out of clinches, he switched to a southpaw stance, and he jabbed going forward and back. It was a tactic meant to frustrate and confuse Rios, who prefers fighting within breathing distance.\n\nProvodnikov also wants to lure Alvarado into the phone booth. In the run up to the fight, he seemed intent on goading Alvarado into trading big blows.\n\n\u201cMike Alvarado, he\u2019s a brawler like I am,\u201d Provodnikov said. \u201cI have to fight him in a brawl. I have to be much more coldblooded and break him down.\u201d\n\nBut Alvarado will have a decided size advantage \u2014 he\u2019s 3 inches taller with a a 3\u00bd-inch reach advantage. Alvarado knows it\u2019s on him to keep the danger of Provodnikov\u2019s knockout power away.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to fight how he knows how. That\u2019s who he is,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cHe\u2019s dangerous. It only takes one shot. I could be kicking his butt every minute of the fight right up to the last round, but if he gets one shot in, then he can get the fight.\u201d\n\nProvodnikov said he developed a game plan with his trainer, Freddie Roach, at the Wild Card Gym in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI know what to expect from Alvarado. Freddie told me, \u2018You\u2019re better than him. And you\u2019re going to be world champion,'\u201d Provodnikov said.\n\nAlvarado faced an added challenge Friday when he stepped on the scales one pound too heavy at an official weigh-in. He eventually returned, nearly two hours later, to weigh in just under the limit at 139.8 pounds, same as Provodnikov.\n\n\u201cThis fight has \u2018war\u2019 written all over it, and there\u2019s a good chance that this fight will turn into that,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cI have a good game plan and I know how I\u2019m going to box to win this fight. But you never know.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nTale of the Tape\n\nMike Alvarado will have a decided size advantage against heavy-hitting Ruslan Provodnikov in their World Boxing Organization junior welterweight (140 pounds) championship bout.\n\nMIKE ALVARADO CATEGORY RUSLAN PROVODNIKOV 34-1 Record 22-2 33 Age 29 Thornton Hometown Beryozovo, Russia 5-feet-9 Height 5-feet-6 69\u00bd inches Reach 66 inches 65.7% KO pct. 62.5% W, Brandon Rios, 12UD Last fight L, Tim Bradley, 12UD \u201cMile High\u201d Nickname \u201cSiberian Rocky\u201d\n\nFight night\n\nSaturday at FirstBank Center, Broomfield\n\nHBO broadcast, 7:45 p.m.\n\nUndercards, 5:45 p.m.\n\nMain event: 9 p.m., WBO Junior Welterweight Championship\n\nMike Alvarado (34-1, 23 KOs) vs. Ruslan Provodnikov (22-2, 15 KOs)\n\nTop undercard: Juan Diaz (37-4), vs. Juan Santiago (14-10-1), lightweights", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike Alvarado vs. Ruslan Provodnikov title fight worth the weight", "title": "Mike Alvarado vs. Ruslan Provodnikov title fight worth the weight", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/18/mike-alvarado-vs-ruslan-provodnikov-title-fight-worth-the-weight/", "image": {"width": 411, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131018__20131019_B1_SP19BOXALVARDOp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131018__20131019_B1_SP19BOXALVARDOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-18T23:32:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T13:39:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca540\"", "article_summary": "He will go against powerful Russian slugger Ruslan Provodnikov at the FirstBank Center in Broomfield to defend his title.\nMIKE ALVARADO CATEGORY RUSLAN PROVODNIKOV 34-1 Record 22-2 33 Age 29 Thornton Hometown Beryozovo, Russia 5-feet-9 Height 5-feet-6 69\u00bd inches Reach 66 inches 65.7% KO pct.\nAlvarado went from brawler to boxer and out-punched Brandon Rios to win the World Boxing Organization junior welterweight title.\n\u2026 He might be able to slug with Provodnikov \u2014 and there will be moments of slugging.\u201dAgainst Rios, Alvarado got tricky.\n\u201cMike Alvarado, he\u2019s a brawler like I am,\u201d Provodnikov said."}
