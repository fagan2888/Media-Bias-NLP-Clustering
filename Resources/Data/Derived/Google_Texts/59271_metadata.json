Men, older adults with cancer or respiratory diseases, and African-Americans were all more likely to require further acute care, according to the study. Patients who had a high number of prior hospitalizations and comorbid conditions, and received care at for-profit facilities, also correlated with a need for more acute care.\n\nIt is difficult to determine how many of these ER visits and readmissions nursing homes can prevent, according to Toles. Hospitals now emphasize the post-discharge transition to avoid readmission penalties and Toles said he hopes this data will encourage similar scrutiny for discharges from nursing homes.\n\n\"The role of nursing homes in communities has changed,\" Toles said in a statement. \"These facilities are increasingly dedicated to transitioning older adults from the hospital back to their own homes. Short-term use of nursing facilities has grown tremendously over the past 10 years and we have to examine interventions that will improve that transition.\"\n\nHigh readmissions are also problematic in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs); more than 10 percent of Medicare recipients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge from IRFs, a recent study found. For some conditions, such as debility, the readmission rate was as high as 18.8 percent, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospital 30-day readmission rates vary after inpatient rehabilitation\n\nReport: Tech vital to survival for post-acute care facilities", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals or emergency departments readmit a large proportion of Medicare beneficiaries within\u00a030 days\u00a0of discharge from\u00a0nursing homes,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new study published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals or emergency departments readmit a large proportion of Medicare beneficiaries within\u00a030 days\u00a0of discharge from\u00a0nursing homes,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new study published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.", "title": "Nursing homes have high readmission rates", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/nursing-homes-have-high-readmission-rates/2014-02-19", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "30-day readmissions,acute care,nursing homes,Patient Care & Outcomes,Skilled Nursing Facilities", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "It is difficult to determine how many of these ER visits and readmissions nursing homes can prevent, according to Toles.\nHospitals now emphasize the post-discharge transition to avoid readmission penalties and Toles said he hopes this data will encourage similar scrutiny for discharges from nursing homes.\n\"The role of nursing homes in communities has changed,\" Toles said in a statement.\nShort-term use of nursing facilities has grown tremendously over the past 10 years and we have to examine interventions that will improve that transition.\"\nTo learn more:- read the study abstract- here's the statementRelated Articles:Hospital 30-day readmission rates vary after inpatient rehabilitationReport: Tech vital to survival for post-acute care facilities"}
