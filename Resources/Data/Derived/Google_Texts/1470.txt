An innovative gender-education program for students at risk of expulsion is teaching a new perspective.

Sitting on a desk at the front of a nondescript portable classroom, Kate Cooper starts off with a bang.

‘‘What is sex?’’ she fires out.

‘‘Male, female or other,’’ calls a tall boy in the first row.

‘‘Excellent,’’ Ms Cooper says, continuing her rapid-fire recap of the previous lesson. ‘‘And what’s it determined by?’’

‘‘Body parts,’’ says the boy immediately.

‘‘And what is gender?’’

‘‘How you’ve been brought up to be a girl or a boy,’’ says another voice.

‘‘And what’s the ‘C’ word I’ve been using a lot to talk about that?’’

‘‘Conditioned,’’ responds the tall boy again.

‘‘Yes!’’ answers Ms Cooper, beaming.

It’s another pivotal moment in the gender-education program at the Southern Teaching Unit, a small school in Moorabbin in Melbourne’s south.

Here, students who have been expelled or are at risk of expulsion come to gain life skills that can help them succeed back in mainstream school.

For their two terms at the Southern Teaching Unit, the students study numeracy, literacy and physical education, as well as health, which now consists of a newly-written respectful relationships curriculum that runs over 12 weeks - sessions of 90 minutes a day, for four days a week.

And this morning, for these teens, the penny has dropped. Gender is constructed.

This is one of many such programs, developed by the family violence sector and education leaders, that aim to set people on a course to better gender relations in life. The message is that gender, unlike body parts, is a product of the culture in which it operates and of the messages that this culture gives out about how men and women should act.

By targeting schoolchildren organisers hope to reduce the leading preventable contributor to death, disability and illness in Victorian women - domestic violence. The approach is grounded in evidence that the more gender equitable a society, the less prevalent is domestic violence.

The curriculum being taught at Moorabbin was put together by the STU teachers in conjunction with Debbie Ollis, a senior lecturer at Deakin University who developed the program for the Department of Education.

Kate Cooper, who has worked at the Southern Teaching Unit for almost a decade, says the program started taking shape five years ago when teachers saw how some students were behaving.

‘‘We noticed at recess, lunchtime and in class discussion, boys were dominating girls and being quite aggressive, and girls were using their sexuality to get boys to do things for them,’’ Ms Cooper says.

They also noticed language. ‘‘Boys would call their mums ‘bitch’ and ‘ho’ and were saying things like, ‘Get me that, bitch!’ ’’

They noticed that many boys were using pornography as sex education and girls talked about being pressured into doing things they’d seen in porn. Several disclosed they had been sexually abused or raped.

The teachers realised traditional sex education wasn’t dealing with issues confronting students.

Dr Ollis, who has been working in the field for more than two decades, says her curriculum does not simply teach students about explicit sexism, but helps them understand gender more broadly as something that restricts both women and men.

It is about getting students to recognise powerful cultural messages telling them how men and women are supposed to behave, she says. In particular, it is about getting them to see the power imbalance within those messages - with men being taught to be dominant and women submissive - and encouraging students themselves to challenge those stereotypes.

Since the subject’s introduction at the Southern Teaching Unit, Ms Cooper says, teachers have witnessed a turnaround in student behaviour.

‘‘At recess, I’ve heard them pick each other up and say, ‘Don’t talk to her like that’ or ‘Don’t say that! That’s sexist!’ ’’ Parents are ‘‘blown away’’ by the results, she adds. ‘‘They are really amazed at language the kids are using and what they’re pointing out while watching TV.’’

The school’s teachers are also seeing changes. ‘‘Our kids become more inclusive and less judgmental. They are a tighter group after the program and we get rid of a lot of bullying that happens.’’

Ms Cooper thinks such programs should be mandatory. Teachers from the Southern Teaching Unit have travelled around Melbourne with Dr Ollis to deliver shortened training to a handful of mainstream schools.



The material involves concepts that may not have been spoken about before - oral sex, pleasure, pornography, sexual abuse - and some schools find it challenging.

But, she says, the experience of students is the same in every class they’ve visited: students are watching pornography, using sexist language and exhibiting the kind of behaviour that these programs target.

Dr Ollis says for respectful relationships training to tackle violence against women, the government needs to back it, make it part of the schools’ curriculum and offer the necessary funding.

For their final class exercise of the day, the students watch a slide show of advertisements, including one from a five-metre high billboard on Chapel Street, South Yarra, recently promoting American Apparel’s new store. It’s of a woman with her legs wide apart with the accompanying text ‘Now Open’.

‘‘These ads are incredible!’’ one student protests to his friend.

At the end of class the students are asked to reflect. A blond-haired boy calls out excitedly. ‘‘I just noticed in Manga cartoons the men come in different sizes and the women are all the same size. Now I see that’s sexist and it kind of ruined it for me.’’

Next to him, his friend raises his hand: ‘‘I was playing Grand Theft Auto and now I see that the violence in it is really confronting.’’

Ms Cooper asks the group another question. ‘‘What’s it called when they make it look like it’s normal to have that sort of violence in real life?’’

‘‘Normalise,’’ the tall boy shoots back.

Dr Ollis’ program is also being trialed at two mainstream schools, and she expects it to be available online to others later this year.
