Step aside, David Attenborough.

The Internet wanted Snoop Dogg as nature commentator, and now it's happening.

The dream began when his "Plizzanet Earth" videos went viral. Jimmy Kimmel featured the "Planet Earth" parodies on his late-night show, and fans loved watching the rapper-actor narrate animal scenes and give his (sometimes profane) thoughts on the natural world.

More than 60,000 people signed a petition to "Get Snoop Dogg to Narrate Whole Season of Planet Earth."

Instead, the rapper has launched "Planet Snoop" on his "Merry Jane" YouTube channel, and while we warn you that it contains some mature language, it's also Snoop doing what Snoop does best.

The first episode features an "epic battle" between a squirrel and a snake [Warning: Video contains explicit language] in which Snoop notes, "This squirrel is hard. What gang he from?"

Who wants to nominate Snoop to moderate the presidential debates next?
