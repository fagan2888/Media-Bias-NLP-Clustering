Gary Palmer, R-Ala., said during the afternoon session.\n\nThe Conservative Policy Summit, an annual event organized by Heritage Action for America, convened Feb. 3 at the Capitol Hill headquarters of The Heritage Foundation.\n\nTwo panel discussions in the afternoon moderated by Tim Chapman, Heritage Action\u2018s chief operating officer, produced some blunt talk and red meat from Republican legislators. Here\u2019s a little of what five of them had to say:\n\nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla.: The American people \u201chave lost their voice and they feel like no matter who they elect, when [candidates] get to the Senate especially, nothing changes,\u201d Lankford said, because of \u201cprocess issues\u201d that limit debate. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the argument if it actually gets to the floor and we actually debate it,\u201d he said during the first panel, \u201cPerspectives from the House and Senate.\u201d\n\nRep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.: \u201cWe left thousands of unwritten rules to the \u2018fourth branch\u2019 of government to let the bureaucracies \u2026 make these rules, and look at the mess we have today.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.: \u201cI would argue that we\u2019ve got to have some behavioral changes [in Congress]. I think our leadership is committed to do [it]. We\u2019ll have more of a semblance of regular order this year, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d And \u201ceven before the more recent behavioral issues we\u2019ve had in the Senate over the past decade, we were ceding far too much authority\u201d to the White House, he added.\n\nRep. Keith Rothfus, R-Pa.: \u201cMoving into the future, the conservative movement should reaffirm the foundational principles that serve to check the concentration of power in the hands of the elite here in Washington, D.C.\u201d Conservatives must \u201cwin the debate of ideas this year,\u201d Rothfus said during the second panel, \u201cState of the Conservative Movement.\u201d\n\nRep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala.: \u201cWe need to show what we\u2019re for, we need to take on the hard things, we need to give people a vision for how we\u2019ll get our country back on track, be honest about what it\u2019s going to cost, [and] we need to let them know what they can expect from us. \u2026 People will respond to and support courage; they know it when they see it.\u201d\n\nTo sample speeches and panel discussions from the Conservative Policy Summit, go here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe need to show what we're for, we need to take on the hard things, we need to give people a vision, \" one congressman said.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe need to show what we're for, we need to take on the hard things, we need to give people a vision, \" one congressman said.", "title": "5 Things Said by 5 Lawmakers at Conservative Policy Summit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160203_HAFAPanel_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-14T02:39:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Q9BZx6"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe need to show what we're for, we need to take on the hard things, we need to give people a vision, \" one congressman said.", "title": "5 Things Said by 5 Lawmakers at Conservative Policy Summit", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160203_HAFAPanel_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "congress", "published_time": "2016-02-12T19:08:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-14T02:39:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016, Conservative Policy Summit, Congress, House, Senate, Article I Project, Heritage Action for America, debate, legislators"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers speaking at the recent Conservative Policy Summit in Washington shared hopeful visions of what could be accomplished if Americans embrace conservative reforms.\nThe Conservative Policy Summit, an annual event organized by Heritage Action for America, convened Feb. 3 at the Capitol Hill headquarters of The Heritage Foundation.\n\u2026 People will respond to and support courage; they know it when they see it.\u201dTo sample speeches and panel discussions from the Conservative Policy Summit, go here.\nThe public will be won over by real solutions, \u201cnot talking points,\u201d Rep.
