They found 28 percent of journalists call themselves Democrats, while just 7 percent call themselves Republicans \u2014 though both numbers are down from the 1970s. Those identifying as independent have grown.\n\nAmong Washington correspondents, the ones who dominate national political coverage, it\u2019s even more skewed, said Tim Groseclose, author of \u201cLeft Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind.\u201d More than 90 percent of D.C. journalists vote Democratic, with an even higher number giving to Democrats or liberal-leaning political action committees, the author said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in the DNA of liberals that makes them want to go into jobs like the arts, journalism and academia more so than conservatives,\u201d Mr. Groseclose said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re just trying to maximize profits by offering an alternative point of view, it\u2019s hard to find conservative reporters. So it\u2019s natural the media is more liberal.\u201d\n\nThe bias factor has become front-page news after last month\u2019s GOP presidential debate, which aired on CNBC, and which has drawn consistently bad reviews for how the moderators handled the questioning.\n\nJohn Harwood, a CNBC and New York Times reporter who has written pieces on why Republicans are bad for the economy, asked front-runner Donald Trump if his run \u201cwas a comic book version of a presidential campaign.\u201d Mr. Harwood later demanded that former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, say whether he believed Mr. Trump had \u201cthe moral authority\u201d to be president. Mr. Huckabee didn\u2019t take the bait.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have the ultimate super PAC \u2014 it is called the mainstream media,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the candidates on the stage, said to strong applause from the partisan Republican audience.\n\nThe debate was so widely panned that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus suspended future debates with NBC, and officials from different GOP campaigns are negotiating new restrictions on future affairs \u2014 to kick in after Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nThat debate, airing on Fox Business Network, will have a slimmed-down field compared to the previous three debates. Just eight candidates polled well enough to make the main stage, with Mr. Huckabee and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie relegated to the undercard. Meanwhile, two candidates who were in the previous undercard debates have been ousted \u2014 South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former New York Gov. George Pataki.\n\nFox Business Network anchors Maria Bartiromo and Neil Cavuto will moderate the main debate, along with Wall Street Journal editor in chief Gerard Baker.\n\nEvening out?\n\nDavid D\u2019Alessio, a communications sciences professor at the University of Connecticut at Stamford, said there is bias in the press, but his research shows it evens out.\n\n\u201cIf you stop to think about media as larger than just reporters and owners they\u2019re business entities and their job is to make money. If you look at where people\u2019s opinions are, they are in the middle, so that\u2019s where a lot of reporting goes because that\u2019s where the eyeballs go,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. D\u2019Alessio argues that for every liberal news network like MSNBC, there\u2019s a Fox News counterpoint because the market creates that opening. For The Huffington Post online, there\u2019s the Drudge Report online, and for The New York Times there\u2019s the New York Post.\n\nBut overall, he says, the mainstream media tend to be more neutral in their tone despite an individual reporter\u2019s ideological preferences, because they want to appeal to both conservative and liberal viewers alike \u2014 because that\u2019s where the greatest market is for making money. People only perceive the mainstream media as being biased because of their own biases.\n\n\u201cIf a person is ideological, the more closely they\u2019re going to zero in on things they disagree with,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alessio said.\n\nHe conducted an experiment where he gave the same newspaper article to both Republicans and Democrats and told them to circle the bias. Republicans circled the liberal viewpoint in the story whereas the Democrats circled the conservative representation.\n\n\u201cBut both sides were represented,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to take a step back and evaluate [that] just because I don\u2019t agree with what someone says in the newspaper doesn\u2019t mean the newspaper is lying about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Groseclose, an economics professor at George Mason University, said his research does find a tilt even in what he classifies as mainstream press, including publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post and the major broadcast networks \u2014 but excluding Fox News and others that have an obvious ideological bent.\n\nBut it\u2019s not as much as some conservatives decry.\n\nIn his study Mr. Groseclose measured the mainstream press on a 0-to-100 point scale, with 100 being the most liberal, like a speech from Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and 50 being centrist. The media tended to come in at 60 \u2014 still not neutral, but not so slanted as some conservatives claim.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that bias matters.\n\nPeople\u2019s voting patterns are influenced by which kind of media they follow, according to a study done by Alan Gerber, a political science professor at Yale University. Mr. Gerber offered people in the Washington metropolitan area a free subscription to either The Washington Post or The Washington Times for several weeks ahead of a gubernatorial election. The Post, by his estimation and work done before, slanted as much to the left as The Times did to the right.\n\nIn a survey he conducted after the election, Mr. Gerber found those who were given a free subscription of The Post were 8 percentage points more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mere 7 percent of journalists identify as Republicans, and when they do give money to political campaigns they usually donate to Democrats, lending evidence to Republican presidential candidates' claims that they are facing a hostile audience when they deal with the press.", "Author": "Kelly Riddell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A mere 7 percent of journalists identify as Republicans, and when they do give money to political campaigns they usually donate to Democrats, lending evidence to Republican presidential candidates\u2019 claims that they are facing a hostile audience when they deal with the press.", "title": "Republicans\u2019 media bias claims boosted by scarcity of right-leaning journalists", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/08/118_2015_gop-2016-debate-4-108201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/08/118_2015_gop-2016-debate-4-108201.jpg", "title": "Republicans\u2019 media bias claims boosted by scarcity of right-lean", "description": "A mere 7 percent of journalists identify as Republicans, and when they do give money to political campaigns they usually donate to Democrats, lending evidence to Republican presidential candidates' cl", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Politics, Washington"}, "article_summary": "For The Huffington Post online, there\u2019s the Drudge Report online, and for The New York Times there\u2019s the New York Post.\nPeople only perceive the mainstream media as being biased because of their own biases.\nMr. Gerber offered people in the Washington metropolitan area a free subscription to either The Washington Post or The Washington Times for several weeks ahead of a gubernatorial election.\nHe conducted an experiment where he gave the same newspaper article to both Republicans and Democrats and told them to circle the bias.\nThey found 28 percent of journalists call themselves Democrats, while just 7 percent call themselves Republicans \u2014 though both numbers are down from the 1970s."}
