And millionaires, it turns out, are becoming just as global. According to a new study from global real estate consultant Knight Frank with Fragomen, the immigration specialist for the wealthy, more millionaires than ever are looking for homes in other countries.\n\nTheir overseas interests range from pied-a-terres and beach homes to a place where they can house their children while they attend school overseas. A growing number are also looking for primary residences to move their families entirely and obtain new citizenship.\n\nRelated: The 25 Most Addictive Foods in the World\n\nSo where are millionaires moving from and going to to?
