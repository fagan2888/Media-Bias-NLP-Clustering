BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — NBC says it’s weighing bringing back Maya Rudolph’s variety show.

In May, the actress-comedian starred in “The Maya Rudolph Show,” a special that combined comedy and music.

NBC executives told a TV critics’ meeting Sunday that they’re in discussions with the actress-comedian about what the program would look like if it returned.

Rudolph has a very loyal following from her “Saturday Night Live” days and the network was encouraged by audience response to the special, NBC Entertainment Robert Greenblatt said.

NBC is searching for a format that would put Rudolph on the air on a regular or occasional basis.

Rudolph, whose film credits include “Bridesmaids,” has said she would love to do a weekly series.
