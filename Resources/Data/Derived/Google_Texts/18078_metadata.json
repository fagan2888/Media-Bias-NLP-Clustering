In addressing a question about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Chomsky assessed the political landscape: \"Today\u2019s Democrats are what used to be called moderate Republicans. The Republicans have just drifted off the spectrum. They\u2019re so committed to extreme wealth and power that they cannot get votes ... So what has happened is that they\u2019ve mobilized sectors of the population that have been around for a long time. ... Trump may be comic relief, but it\u2019s not that different from the mainstream, which I think is more important.\"\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: After his talk, Professor Chomsky read and answered questions from the audience. This is one of those questions.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \"What do you think about the antics of Donald Trump, in tangent to your earlier idea about American exceptionalism?\"\n\nWell, actually, I think we should recognize that the other candidates are not that different. I mean, if you take a look at\u2014just take a look at their views. You know, they tell you their views, and they\u2019re astonishing. So just to keep to Iran, a couple of weeks ago, the two front-runners\u2014they\u2019re not the front-runners any longer\u2014were Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. And they differed on Iran. Walker said we have to bomb Iran; when he gets elected, they\u2019re going to bomb Iran immediately, the day he\u2019s elected. Bush was a little\u2014you know, he\u2019s more serious: He said he\u2019s going to wait 'til the first Cabinet meeting, and then they'll bomb Iran. I mean, this is just off the spectrum of not only international opinion, but even relative sanity.\n\nThis is\u2014I think Ornstein and Mann are correct: It\u2019s a radical insurgency; it\u2019s not a political party. You can tell that even by the votes. I mean, any issue of any complexity is going to have some diversity of opinion. But when you get a unanimous vote to kill the Iranian deal or the Affordable Care Act or whatever the next thing may be, you know you\u2019re not dealing with a political party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Trump may be comic relief, but the other candidates are not that different.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "\"Trump may be comic relief, but the other candidates are not that different.\"", "title": "WATCH: Noam Chomsky Flattens Trump in Four Minutes Flat", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/watch-noam-chomsky-flattens-trump-four-minutes-flat", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/chomsky2.png", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "WATCH: Noam Chomsky Flattens Trump in Four Minutes Flat"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-23T13:52:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ea4\"", "article_summary": "In addressing a question about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Chomsky assessed the political landscape: \"Today\u2019s Democrats are what used to be called moderate Republicans.\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \"What do you think about the antics of Donald Trump, in tangent to your earlier idea about American exceptionalism?\"\nBush was a little\u2014you know, he\u2019s more serious: He said he\u2019s going to wait 'til the first Cabinet meeting, and then they'll bomb Iran.\nWalker said we have to bomb Iran; when he gets elected, they\u2019re going to bomb Iran immediately, the day he\u2019s elected.\nNoam Chomsky weighed in on U.S. presidential politics in a speech Saturday at The New School in New York."}
