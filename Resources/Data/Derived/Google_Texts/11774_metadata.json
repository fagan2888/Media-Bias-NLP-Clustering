The findings trail a bill recently introduced in the California Legislature that calls for healthcare coverage for all Californians regardless of their immigration status.\n\nUp to 125,000 young immigrants are estimated to be Medi-Cal (the state\u2019s Medicaid program) eligible under state policy, according to a new report, Realizing the Dream for Californians Eligible for DACA: Demographics and Health Coverage released by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, the UCSF Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies, and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, provides temporary work authorization and relief from deportation for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. In California policy, unlike that of most other states, low-income individuals granted Deferred Action are eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cThis state policy could significantly improve health coverage rates among these young immigrants, increase access to the care they need, and reduce the burden on safety net providers,\u201d says Laurel Lucia, a policy analyst with the UC Berkeley Labor Center. \u201cHowever, immigrant youth may still face barriers to enrolling because they lack information on the program or fear deportation for themselves or family members.\u201d\n\nOut of the 300,000 undocumented Californians estimated to be eligible the DACA program, approximately 150,000 have applied and been granted Deferred Action. Despite being considered \u201clawfully present\u201d by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DACA youth are not eligible for federally-subsidized health programs, such as Medicaid or the new programs created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBig Need\n\nA high need for coverage exists, according the UCLA Labor Center\u2019s Undocumented and Uninsured: Immigrant Youth and the Struggle to Access Health Care in California, the first statewide study about and by immigrant youth on health care access. Researchers surveyed 550 immigrant youth throughout the state, including DACA-eligible and undocumented youth.\n\nThe UCLA Labor Center researchers found that 69 percent of immigrant youth did not have health insurance, while half delayed getting the medical care they felt they needed in the past year. Nearly all (96 percent) of those delaying care cited cost or lack of insurance as reasons.\n\n\u201cWithout health care, immigrant youth and their families must rely on Band-Aid solutions,\u201d says Imelda Plascencia, one of the report authors.\n\n\u201cThey wait for hours at free clinics for partial care or find ways to pool resources with friends and family,\u201d says Plascencia, who also is undocumented. \u201cWhenever they interact with the formal medical system, the fear of deportation is present. These experiences are inhumane.\u201d\n\nWhile some uninsured Californians eligible for the DACA program will enroll in Medi-Cal or receive job-based coverage through expanded employment opportunities, others will remain uninsured because they lack job-based coverage, are ineligible for Medi-Cal due to income, or have not been approved for DACA, according to the Realizing the Dream study by three UC campuses. They will comprise a fraction of the one million undocumented Californians predicted to remain uninsured this year under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPossible Solution\n\nProposed legislation (California Senate Bill 1005) would address this coverage gap for young immigrants and their families by expanding healthcare coverage to all Californians regardless of immigration status.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is leading where the federal government is failing to act,\u201d said Senator Ricardo Lara (D- Huntington Park/Long Beach), author of SB 1005, the Health for All Act. \u201cThis research underscores the strides we\u2019ve made in providing Medi-Cal coverage to our young immigrant youth who are vital to the future success of our state and economy. But our work is unfinished until access to care is available for the remaining uninsured, regardless of status.\u201d\n\nThe study by the three UC campuses was funded by the Blue Shield of California Foundation and the UCLA Labor Center study was funded by The California Endowment.\n\nRead the reports: Realizing the Dream for Californians Eligible for DACA: Demographics and Health Coverage and Undocumented and Uninsured: Immigrant Youth and the Struggle to Access Health Care in California.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Berkeley News", "description": "Up to 125,000 young immigrants are estimated to be eligible for Medi-Cal (the state\u2019s Medicaid program) under state policy, according to research by health and labor experts at UC Berkeley, UCLA an\u2026", "title": "Study finds 125,000 immigrant youth with \u201cDeferred Action\u201d may be eligible for Medi-Cal", "url": "http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/02/25/study-finds-125000-immigrant-youth-with-deferred-action-may-be-eligible-for-medi-cal-2/", "image": {"width": 410, "identifier": "http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/HealthCare-Hispanic-410.jpg", "height": 275}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T20:58:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9ed\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWithout health care, immigrant youth and their families must rely on Band-Aid solutions,\u201d says Imelda Plascencia, one of the report authors.\nResearchers surveyed 550 immigrant youth throughout the state, including DACA-eligible and undocumented youth.\nBig NeedA high need for coverage exists, according the UCLA Labor Center\u2019s Undocumented and Uninsured: Immigrant Youth and the Struggle to Access Health Care in California, the first statewide study about and by immigrant youth on health care access.\nRead the reports: Realizing the Dream for Californians Eligible for DACA: Demographics and Health Coverage and Undocumented and Uninsured: Immigrant Youth and the Struggle to Access Health Care in California.\nIn California policy, unlike that of most other states, low-income individuals granted Deferred Action are eligible for Medi-Cal."}
