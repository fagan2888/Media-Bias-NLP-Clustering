I\u2019m here to tell you that they are.\u201d\n\nShe cited Hispanics\u2019 \u201centrepreneurial spirit\u201d \u2014 they start businesses at two times the rate of average American \u2013 and support for school choice as some of the conservative values already in place.\n\nAbout 75 percent of voting Hispanics voted for President Barack Obama in the last election, but they also have dropped their support for him at the fastest rate, she said.\n\n\u201cThis year alone there has been a 25 percent drop in Hispanic support for Obama. That is the fastest drop of any other demographic. I think it\u2019s because Obama\u2019s governing and policies are hurting Hispanics,\u201d Campos-Duffy said.\n\n\u201cThere are 2.5 million more Hispanics living in poverty now than there were when Obama was first elected. Our unemployment is up; our family incomes are down. Hispanics actually really dislike Obamacare in higher numbers than the general population,\u201d she continued. \u201cContrary to what you see on the news, I think conservatives have a real opportunity here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Rachel Campos-Duffy speaks at the Young America\u2019s Foundation\u2019s National High School Leadership Conference.
