It\u2019s very innovative.\u201d\n\nThe new position is an indirect result of the Affordable Care Act, Providence officials said.\n\nTo keep their nonprofit status, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children\u2019s Hospital and Holy Family Hospital must conduct community health needs assessments every three years and adopt strategies for addressing those needs.\n\nAs more Eastern Washington residents are insured through the Affordable Care Act, the hospitals anticipate that the level of charity care will decrease. That will leave more money for Providence to invest in identified needs in the community and preventive care, said Dr. Jeff Collins, the organization\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nIn 2014, Providence spent about $22 million on free and discounted care for Eastern Washington patients in need, according to organization reports.\n\nMcCullough \u2013 a veteran in the public health field \u2013 is the right person to help the hospitals determine how they can best invest some of the savings to make a difference at a community level, Collins said.\n\nMcCullough will start work as Providence\u2019s new medical director for community health and epidemiology in late February. The job also comes with some duties related to infectious disease control.\n\nIn his new role, McCullough said he\u2019ll continue to work closely with colleagues at the health district and other community partners, such as the Empire Health Foundation.\n\nMcCullough\u2019s last day with the health district is Feb. 16. He\u2019ll continue to serve as interim health officer, taking care of duties that must be overseen by a medical doctor, until his replacement is hired. Other oversight duties will be temporarily assumed by Torney Smith, the health district\u2019s administrator.\n\nMcCullough, 56, joined the health district in 2009, assuming both medical and managerial duties as the district\u2019s chief medical officer. He earned about $178,000 last year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty lucky to find someone like Dr. McCullough, who can wear both hats,\u201d said Kevin Freeman, chairman of the health district\u2019s 12-member board.\n\nAs the board starts meeting to discuss qualifications for McCullough\u2019s replacement, they\u2019ll discuss whether the job should be split into medical and managerial positions, which is a path other public health districts have taken, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at other models in Washington to see if that works for a health district of our size, with the services we provide,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nMcCullough is widely respected for returning \u201cstability and direction\u201d to the district, Freeman said. Before he was hired, the health district\u2019s top position was vacant for 2 1/2 years following the controversial firing of Dr. Kim Thorburn in 2006.\n\nDuring his tenure, McCullough said he\u2019s proudest of steering the health district through a rocky financial period, and the district\u2019s work in revealing health disparities among various segments of Spokane County\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve weathered the storm of the economic recession fairly well as a health district, and come out stronger as an agency,\u201d McCullough said.\n\nWhile McCullough has been at the helm, the health district\u2019s employee base shrank from about 230 employees to 185, later rebounding to 220. The district\u2019s $21 million budget is made up of federal, state and local dollars, including fees collected for regulatory services.\n\nThe district works on a wide array of public health issues, such as inspecting restaurants, sending nurses to visit first-time, low-income mothers and employing epidemiologists to track infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nBut the district no longer operates a public health clinic, which used to provide vaccinations and health screenings for refugees. Vaccinations are now widely available at doctor\u2019s offices and drugstores, and other clinics have picked up the refugee health screenings, McCullough said. The shift mirrors national trends in public health, with more focus on disease prevention and health risk management and policy, he said.\n\nAlong those lines, a 2012 health district report explored how education, income, race and place of residence influence the health of Spokane County residents. The report helped draw attention to inequities in the health of local residents, McCullough said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Joel McCullough\u2019s new job at Providence Health Care is an indirect result of the Affordable Care Act, with some focus on public health a requirement for hospitals to keep their nonprofit status and with money that hospitals used to use on charity care available for other purposes.", "og": {"site_name": "Spokesman.com", "description": "Dr. Joel McCullough\u2019s new job at Providence Health Care is an indirect result of the Affordable Care Act, with some focus on public health a requirement for hospitals to keep their nonprofit status and with money that hospitals used to use on charity care available for other purposes.", "title": "Health district chief\u2019s move to Providence an indirect result of Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/jan/19/health-district-chiefs-move-to-providence-an-indir/", "image": "https://media.spokesman.com/img/logos/sr200.png", "updated_time": "2016-01-19T20:50:06.140941", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.spokesman.com/photos/2016/01/19/METHADONE_3.JPG_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6", "site": "@SpokesmanReview", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 316254480466}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "googlebot": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "In his new job at Providence Health Care, Dr. Joel McCullough will draw on his background in public health to help local hospitals step up their game on community health.\nAlong those lines, a 2012 health district report explored how education, income, race and place of residence influence the health of Spokane County residents.\nThe shift mirrors national trends in public health, with more focus on disease prevention and health risk management and policy, he said.\nIt\u2019s very innovative.\u201dThe new position is an indirect result of the Affordable Care Act, Providence officials said.\nBut the district no longer operates a public health clinic, which used to provide vaccinations and health screenings for refugees."}
