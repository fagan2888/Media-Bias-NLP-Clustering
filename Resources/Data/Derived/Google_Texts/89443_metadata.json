And then, for many on K Street, there\u2019s another key part of the job: pulling out your checkbook. Federal lobbyists are often campaign contributors, too \u2014 sometimes offering, sometimes responding to not-so-subtle requests.\n\nAnd the sums can be large. In fact, the 25 lobbyists who have given the most to political campaigns in the first half of the 2014 cycle have combined to give a total of $1.85 million. Whether they give strategically or out of partisan passion depends on the donor, but there\u2019s little doubt that their generosity can play a role in wedging doors open in congressional office buildings. Or, as sixth-ranking lobbyist-donor Ben Barnes put it, \u201cI think anyone could be sanctimonious and say they\u2019re donating for the love of their country, but how you make a living has something to do with it.\u201d Barnes, whose clients include Texas A&M University, Texas Gulf Energy and Huntsman Corp., has long been a fixture of Democratic politics in Texas, and is a top bundler for congressional campaigns. So far in this cycle, he has given out about $79,000.\n\n\n\nLobbyists rank 13th among all interest groups in contributions so far in the 2014 campaigns, a jump from 22nd at the end of the 2012 cycle. Individual lobbyists contributed far more than lobbying firms\u2019 PACs \u2014 22 times as much.\n\nAnd as in 2012, the big-giving lobbyists prefer writing their checks to candidates or committees, rather than sending them funds into a larger pool \u2014 for instance, a super PAC. Only four lobbyists on our list contributed to super PACs. Tonio Burgos, the director of his own lobbying firm, contributed $25,000 to the liberal House Majority PAC, though even absent his super PAC donation Burgos would have earned a spot in the top 25.\n\nOverall, super PACs have received a pitiful 2 percent of lobbyists\u2019 donations so far, a dip from their 7 percent share in 2012.\n\n\n\nAn array of clients \u2014 unions excepted\n\nAmong our top 25 contributors, 24 work for a lobbying or law firm or for a consulting group. Their major clients include household names like General Electric, Caterpillar and Microsoft.\n\nFifteen of our top 25 represent firms in the insurance industry, while 14 count pharmaceutical firms among their clients. Altogether the top lobbyist-donors are associated with 65 different industries in 12 sectors. Labor is the only industry not represented by even one of the the top 25.\n\nTogether this band of lobbyists represented 481 discrete clients in 2013, about 19 clients per lobbyist.\n\nThe exception? Nicholas Calio, a former aide to President George W. Bush, who lobbies in-house at Airlines for America, a trade association that spent nearly $8.5 million lobbying in 2013.\n\nThe technology sector is well represented by this coalition. General Electric, Microsoft, Intuit Inc. and Blackberry each number four clients among the group. Seven lobbyists of our top 25 represent Blue Cross/Blue Shield, while five represent the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group of power companies.\n\nKenneth Kies is the top lobbyist-donor so far this time around, having given close to $140,000. Together with his wife, he\u2019s given nearly $200,000 to candidates and committees in the 2014 cycle, putting them 22nd among all donors. Kies, who years ago worked for two tax committees in Congress, is now with the lobbying firm Federal Policy Group, where his clients include the American Bankers Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Microsoft.\n\nParty matters, again\n\nThere are deep partisan divisions among the top 25. Sixteen of them gave exclusively to one party or the other: Five donated solely to Republicans, 11 gave only to Democrats. Some who work at the same firm were diametrically opposed in their giving patterns: Capitol Counsel LLC\u2018s Sharon Finley funneled all of her contributions to Democrats, while 100 percent of her partner Jeffrey Walter\u2018s donations went to the GOP.\n\nThe nine who divided their donations showed strong party preferences too, though. Even the two most even-handed donors contributed $4 to one party for every $1 they gave the other. James D. Massie donated $44,000 to Democrats and $11,000 to Republicans; David E. Franasiak donated $51,000 to Republicans and $12,600 to Democrats.\n\nIn D.C., genuine friendships often overlap with relationships built on mutual favors. Add the fact that many well-paid lobbyists once worked in congressional and agency offices where they still know people and it can be especially hard to tease out the motivations behind any single donation.\n\n\u201cIf I only donated for the good of my firm or business I wouldn\u2019t have donated to candidates that I knew had no chance. But I knew it was important for them to have a voice,\u201d one lobbyist on the list told OpenSecrets Blog. His belief that a Democratic majority is better for the country \u201canimates my giving,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother lobbyist on the list was more pragmatic. He favors the pro-business stance of Republicans and hopes they take control of the Senate and then the White House. At the same time, \u201cthis is politics, and you have to participate in the system,\u201d he acknowledged in an interview.\n\nLobbyists prefer incumbents, bolster embattled Democrats\n\nFederally registered lobbyists have spread $18 million in contributions among over 100 candidates and members of Congress so far in the 2014 cycle, with donations tilting to the right: $7.4 million has gone to Democrats, $8.35 million to Republicans. Super PACs received a very small share, only about $71,000.\n\nAbout 93 percent of lobbyists\u2019 total spending has gone to incumbents, and much of it has gravitated to just a few veteran lawmakers in the leadership. While lobbyists aim for access, they love stability, not eager to have to forge new relationships every election cycle.\n\nTop Recipients of Lobbyist-Donors, 2014 cycle\n\n(totals do not include money raised for 2013 special elections)\n\nFollow Emily: @emilyakopp Correction, March 12: In the original version of this story, Sen.
