As the agency transitions from a fee-for-service model to a managed care approach, the new technology initiatives should help them improve business operations and adopt and use national standards in order to simplify the business of health care.\n\n\u201cOur processes have traditionally been mostly manual,\u201d said Phil Heinrich, chief, DHCS Office of HIPAA Compliance. \u201cThese three initiatives will help us transition to a more automated approach.\u201d\n\nThe first initiative involves coordinated care. California\u2019s Coordinated Care Initiative will integrate the medical, social, and mental health services provided to some of the state\u2019s most vulnerable patients \u2013 dual eligible individuals enrolled in both Medi-Cal and Medicare. This new DHCS program will collect encounters, which are the no-pay records of services received by patients under their managed care plan, in industry-standard formats. By collecting this information, DHCS can better coordinate care. The system is currently being piloted in five counties.\n\nThe second initiative seeks to change the way DHCS manages encounters. Working closely with DHCS\u2019 new Encounter Data Quality Unit will allow the department to provide timely and detailed feedback to managed care plans about the quality, timeliness, and completeness of their encounter data. For the first time, all Medi-Cal health plans will send their data directly to DHCS in industry-standard formats. The new system will be one of the country\u2019s most advanced encounter data systems and will ultimately improve DHCS\u2019 ability to tie payments to the population served by each managed care plan. The initiative was spurred by the need to accommodate ICD-10, the new coding standard that goes into effect in October 2015.\n\nThe final initiative, the Capitation Management System (CAPMAN), provides an industry-standard person-level receipt to managed care plans. Since going into production in July 2011, CAPMAN has supported a 50 percent increase in Medi-Cal managed care, from 4.5 million members in July 2011 to 6.8 million in February 2014. For the first six months of the current fiscal year, CAPMAN calculated and communicated payments to managed care plans in excess of $10 billion.\n\nHeinrich said several other changes have been made to keep up with DHCS needs related to plan payment, including the Healthy Families Program transition, the regional expansion of managed care to 28 rural counties, a California Children\u2019s Services pilot program, Hospital Quality Assurance Fees, and increased primary care physician payments as well as several other changes related to the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHeinrich added that the three new technology initiatives were developed using a team approach with state staff and relatively small contracted staff.\n\n\u201cOur manual processes required a great deal of human resources before,\u201d he said. \u201cAutomating will make us more efficient. Together these three IT systems will provide the cornerstone for the future of Medi-Cal managed care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "As the agency transitions from a fee-for-service model to a managed care approach, the new technology initiatives should help them improve business operations, and adopt and use national standards.", "pubDate": "2014-06-12", "og": {"title": "California"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8330\"", "article_summary": "Together these three IT systems will provide the cornerstone for the future of Medi-Cal managed care.\u201d\nDHCS contracts with managed care organizations to provide comprehensive medical services to nearly seven million Medi-Cal members.\nFor the first time, all Medi-Cal health plans will send their data directly to DHCS in industry-standard formats.\nFor the first six months of the current fiscal year, CAPMAN calculated and communicated payments to managed care plans in excess of $10 billion.\nCalifornia\u2019s Coordinated Care Initiative will integrate the medical, social, and mental health services provided to some of the state\u2019s most vulnerable patients \u2013 dual eligible individuals enrolled in both Medi-Cal and Medicare."}
