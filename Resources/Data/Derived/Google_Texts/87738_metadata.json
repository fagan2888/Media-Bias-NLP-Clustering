We know now that many rockers don\u2019t like it. Less discussed so far is the trouble jazz and classical musicians \u2014 and their fans \u2014 have with music streaming, which is being hailed as the \u201csavior\u201d of the music business.\n\nBut between low royalties, opaque payout rates, declining record sales and suspicion that the major labels have cut deals with the streamers that leave musicians out of the equation, anger from the music business\u2019s artier edges is slowing growing. It\u2019s further proof of the lie of the \u201clong tail.\u201d The shift to digital is also helping to isolate these already marginalized genres: It has a decisive effect on what listeners can find, and on whether or not an artist can earn a living from his work. (Music streaming, in all genres, is up 42 percent for the first half of this year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, against the first half of 2013. Over the same period, CD sales fell 19.6 percent, and downloads, the industry\u2019s previous savior, were down 11.6 percent.)\n\nOnly a very few classical artists have been outspoken on the issue so far: San-Francisco-based Zoe Keating \u2014 a tech-savvy, DIY, Amanda Palmer of the cello \u2014 has blown the whistle on the tiny amounts the streaming services pay musicians. Though she\u2019s exactly the kind of artist who should be cashing in on streaming, since she releases her own music, tours relentlessly, and has developed a strong following since her days with rock band Rasputina, only 8 percent of her last year\u2019s earnings from recorded music came from streaming. The iTunes store, which pays out in small amounts since most purchases are for 99 cent songs, paid her about six times what she earned from streaming. (More than 400,000 Spotify streams earned her $1,764; almost 2 million YouTube views generated $1,248.)\n\nFor jazz and classical players without Keating\u2019s entrepreneurial energy or larger cult following, the numbers are even bleaker. \u201cIt feels awful,\u201d says Christina Courtin, a Julliard-trained violinist who plays in classical groups and has put out albums on the Nonesuch and Hundred Pockets labels. \u201cI don\u2019t count on that as a way to make money \u2014 I don\u2019t see how it makes sense for a musician. It\u2019s pretty dark \u2014 no one\u2019s selling as much as they were even five years ago.\u201d\n\nSome artists remember a very different world. \u201cI used to sell CDs of my music,\u201d says Richard Danielpour, a celebrated American composer who has written an opera with Toni Morrison and once had an exclusive recording contract with Sony Classical. \u201cAnd now we get nothing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just streaming, but the larger digital era that\u2019s burying record stores, radio and recordings \u2013 and it\u2019s hitting jazz and classical musicians especially hard. For some young musicians launching their careers, the \u201cexposure\u201d they get on Pandora or YouTube brings them employment or a fan base somewhere down the line. But many wait in vain. And like their counterparts in the pop world, musicians typically cannot opt out of streaming and the rest of the new world.\n\n\u201cOne of the big reasons musicians kept control of their publishing was for the possibility that at least we would be paid when those songs were played in media outlets,\u201d says jazz pianist Jason Moran, currently the jazz advisor for the Kennedy Center. \u201cBack in the day, Fats Waller, and tons of other artists were robbed of their publishing. This is the new version of it, but on a much more wider scale.\u201d\n\n*\n\nIn some ways, the trouble in these genres resembles the problems experienced by any non-superstar musicians. Royalties on steaming services, for instance, are notoriously low. \u201cAll of my colleagues \u2014 composers and arrangers \u2014 are seeing huge cuts in their earnings,\u201d says Paul Chihara, a veteran composer who until recently headed UCLA\u2019s film-music program. \u201cIn effect, we\u2019re not getting royalties. It\u2019s almost amusing some of the royalty checks I get.\u201d One of the last checks he got was for $29. \u201cAnd it bounced.\u201d\n\nThe pain is especially acute for indie musicians. While some jazz and classical labels are owned by one of the three majors \u2014 Blue Note and Deutsche Grammophon, for example, are now part of the Universal Music Group \u2014 the vast majority of musicians record for independent labels. And the indies have been largely left out of the sweet deals struck with the streamers. Most of those deals are opaque; the informed speculation says that these arrangement are not good for musicians, especially those not on the few remaining majors.\n\n\u201cMusicians in niche categories need to be fearful of the agreements that labels are signing with streaming services,\u201d says music historian Ted Gioia, who has also recorded as a jazz pianist. Some of these deals, he suspects, allow the steamers to pay nothing at all to some artists, including most who record jazz and classical music. \u201cThe record labels could make a case that they don\u2019t need to share royalties with artists whose sales don\u2019t cross a certain threshold. If you\u2019re Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber, you have no problem. But otherwise, you would get no royalties. The nature of these deals are that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\u201d\n\nLabels that own substantial back catalog \u2014 old Pink Floyd and Eagles albums, and earlier music that no longer require royalty payments to musicians \u2014 have likely cut much better deals than labels that primarily put out new music, especially those in non-pop genres. Says Gioia: \u201cI suspect we\u2019d find agreements where the labels say, [to the streamers], \u2018You can have our whole catalog for $5 million, plus you pay us a fraction of a penny for any song that streams more than a million times.\u2019\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theorist to think this way: The major labels have a number of weaselly little tricks like this one, sometimes called a \u201cdigital breakage,\u201d in which musicians get nothing.\n\nMoran compares the appearance of Spotify on the scene to the arrival of Wal-Mart to an American small-town: The new model undercuts the existing ones, and helps put smaller, independent stores out of business.\n\nIndie labels are equally vulnerable. Pi Recordings is a jazz label that puts out recordings by the cream of the avant-garde, including Henry Threadgill, Marc Ribot and Rudresh Mahanthappa. It\u2019s been described as one of the rare success stories in a dark time. But Yulun Wang, who co-runs the label, is not sure how they can stand up against the streaming onslaught.\n\n\u201cYou have the guy who buys 20 jazz records a year \u2014 $300 a year,\u201d Wang says. \u201cHe might buy one or two of our albums. If I convert that guy to Spotify \u2013 he\u2019s now getting all-you-can-eat for $120. And the proportion that comes to me is literally pennies. That\u2019s when it over. That\u2019s will force labels like ours to either change the way we do things significantly.\u201d\n\nThe digital enthusiasts say that labels need to \u201cadjust\u201d to the new world \u2013 by taking a piece of musicians\u2019 touring, or cutting \u201c360 deals\u201d in which they get part of every strand of an artist\u2019s revenue stream. But for jazz artists, touring outside New York and a few other cities does not yield much. \u201cIf I take 15 percent of someone making $30,000, it\u2019s just less money in their pocket.\u201d At a certain point, the artist can no longer pay the rent. \u201cThat\u2019s when it\u2019s game over.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More musicians are taking aim at the rates paid by Spotify and Pandora, and warning whole genres are in danger", "author": "Scott Timberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "More musicians are taking aim at the rates paid by Spotify and Pandora, and warning whole genres are in danger", "title": "It\u2019s not just David Byrne and Radiohead: Spotify, Pandora and how streaming music kills jazz and classical", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/its_not_just_david_byrne_and_radiohead_spotify_pandora_and_how_streaming_music_kills_jazz_and_classical/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/byrne_yorke.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More musicians are taking aim at the rates paid by Spotify and Pandora, and warning whole genres are in danger", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/byrne_yorke.jpg", "title": "It\u2019s not just David Byrne and Radiohead: Spotify, Pandora and how streaming music kills jazz and classical", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "It\u2019s not just David Byrne and Radiohead: Spotify, Pandora and how streaming music kills jazz and classical", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Art in Crisis, Beats Music, classical music, Editor's Picks, iTunes, Jazz, John Coltrane, Marc Ribot, Miles Davis, Music, Pandora, Spotify, Ted Gioia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0556\"", "article_summary": "Less discussed so far is the trouble jazz and classical musicians \u2014 and their fans \u2014 have with music streaming, which is being hailed as the \u201csavior\u201d of the music business.\n(Music streaming, in all genres, is up 42 percent for the first half of this year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, against the first half of 2013.\nBut for jazz artists, touring outside New York and a few other cities does not yield much.\nSome of these deals, he suspects, allow the steamers to pay nothing at all to some artists, including most who record jazz and classical music.\nFor jazz and classical players without Keating\u2019s entrepreneurial energy or larger cult following, the numbers are even bleaker."}
