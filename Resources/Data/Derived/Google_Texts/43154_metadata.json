(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nI did not understand the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act that was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, so I analyzed it based on my paralegal knowledge from Brookdale Community College.\n\nA subsection of the act on tax credits included the phrase \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d Clearly, the act allowed insurance exchanges to be established by either the states or the federal government. However, the plaintiffs argued that this phrase meant only exchanges \u201cestablished by the State\u201d qualified for tax credits.\n\nTherefore, they argued, insurance exchanges established by the federal government would not qualify for tax credits. They did not care that millions of people who participated in the federal exchanges in 34 states would lose their subsidies and insurance coverage.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy said the plaintiffs\u2019 argument had a \u201cserious constitutional problem\u201d regarding states\u2019 rights.\n\nHere is my final summary and conclusion:\n\n1. The act allows the states and the federal government to establish exchanges.\n\n2. The states do not have to set up their own exchange; they can rely on federal exchanges instead.\n\n3. However, if the states do use federal exchanges, Congress will say \u201cGotcha!\u201d\n\n4. This is because a hidden section of the act says only states can establish exchanges.\n\n5. This is not logical. Why would the federal government give to the states with one hand, and take this away with the other?\n\n6. Where are the states\u2019 rights regarding the exchanges?\n\n7. Accordingly, I believe the Supreme Court will: (a) do what is legally right, and (b) avoid disruption to millions of people by rejecting the challenge.\n\nAndrew Rosenthal\n\nManalapan\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1bfiqXr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Where are the states\u2019 rights regarding the exchanges?", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Where are the states\u2019 rights regarding the exchanges?", "title": "LETTER: Supreme Court will reject challenge to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/18/letter-supreme-court-will-reject-challenge-obamacare/24957305/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Where are the states\u2019 rights regarding the exchanges?", "title": "LETTER: Supreme Court will reject challenge to Obamacare", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/03/18/B9316589643Z.1_20150318110401_000_GMEA77N3J.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb33\"", "article_summary": "Accordingly, I believe the Supreme Court will: (a) do what is legally right, and (b) avoid disruption to millions of people by rejecting the challenge.\nThe latest challenge to The Affordable Care Act was argued before the Supreme Court.\nTherefore, they argued, insurance exchanges established by the federal government would not qualify for tax credits.\n(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)I did not understand the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act that was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, so I analyzed it based on my paralegal knowledge from Brookdale Community College.\nThe states do not have to set up their own exchange; they can rely on federal exchanges instead."}
