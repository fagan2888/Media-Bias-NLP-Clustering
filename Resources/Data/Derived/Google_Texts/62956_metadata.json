No wonder the Obama administration has been trying to kill them off. This year, it might finally succeed.\n\nHSA plans have become increasingly popular as companies and individuals realize their benefits. Instead of paying high premiums for low deductibles, HSAs offer high-deductible, low-premium plans that let people put money aside tax-free for out-of-pocket expenses. Any money left over is theirs to keep.\n\nDemocrats have long hated HSAs, mainly because they entrust consumers to make decisions about their own health care and finances, but Republicans managed to get them authorized starting in 2005. In the past seven years, enrollment has climbed 18% a year on average. Today, there are almost 20 million enrollees who have more than $24 billion in their HSA accounts. Even the number crunchers in the Health and Human Services Department admit that these \u201cconsumer-directed\u201d health plans are helping to hold down costs.\n\nConservatives worried that Democrats would use ObamaCare to kill off HSAs by writing rules for what constitutes a \u201cqualified health plan\u201d in such a way that HSAs \u2014 which have to comply with their own set of rules \u2014 couldn\u2019t possibly meet.\n\nIn the first year, that didn\u2019t happen. In fact, Merrill Matthews, a longtime HSA supporter, said the \u201cqualified health plan\u201d rules issued by the administration in early 2013 were \u201cgreat news\u201d and that HSA plans could end up being the favorite option in ObamaCare exchanges.\n\nNow it appears as though the administration has succeeded in quietly killing off HSAs, at least in the individual market.\n\nAs HSA expert Roy Ramthun explained in a National Review article, the Obama administration\u2019s new set of rules on March 8 detailing what constitutes a \u201cqualified health plan\u201d in an ObamaCare exchange will make it \u201cimpossible to offer HSA-qualified plans in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ramthun, the rules require deductibles and out-of-pocket limits that conflict with requirements for an HSA plan. And the plans now have to cover services below the deductible that HSAs aren\u2019t allowed to pay for.\n\nNow, Ramthun says, \u201cit is only a matter of time before HSA-qualified plans completely disappear.\u201d\n\nIf Ramthun is right, then Republicans must not let this happen without a fight. HSAs are popular, they are delivering as promised (unlike ObamaCare), and they are a model of free-market health reform. The Obama administration must not be allowed to kill them off in the dark of night.\n\nRELATED:\n\nTime To Liberate Health Savings Accounts\n\nObamaCare\u2019s Not-So-Secret Plan To Force Everyone Into HMOs\n\nHere\u2019s A Health Reform That, Unlike ObamaCare, Is Actually Working\n\nFollow IBD Editorials on Twitter: @IBDeditorials.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Reform: Health Savings Accounts are a proven free-market health-reform idea.
