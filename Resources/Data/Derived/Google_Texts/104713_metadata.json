For instance, no full-time obstetrician practices in Baker County and pregnant residents of the county must travel to Jacksonville, Orange Park or Gainesville to deliver their children, said Kerry Dunlavey, administrator of the Florida Department of Health in Baker County.\n\nAs the number of new doctors being educated and trained failed to keep pace in recent years with the growth and aging of the population, alarms have been sounded.\n\n\u201cFlorida Physician Workforce Analysis: Forecasting Supply and Demand,\u201d a study commissioned by the Teaching Hospital Council of Florida and the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, echoed warnings that the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) has been making for a decade.\n\nThe AAMC currently predicts a shortage of 46,000 to 90,000 physicians nationally in 2025. A decade ago it issued a call to increase medical school enrollment by 30 percent, a goal the group now says should achieved within the next five years.\n\nThe shortage is fueled by the lack of residencies (a hospital-based period of training following medical school graduation that must be completed to become a licensed physician), the aging of the baby boom generation, greater access to medical care for growing numbers of people under Obamacare and the fact that many physicians are retiring.\n\nWhile medical school admissions have expanded and some states, including Florida, made efforts to increase the number of residencies, there aren\u2019t enough residency openings to accommodate all medical school graduates.\n\nFlorida, for instance, will graduate about 100 more students from medical school this year than can be accommodated by available residencies in the state. Florida ranks 42nd with 19 physicians in training per 100,000 population, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. By comparison, New York has 82 medical residents and Massachusetts 84 per 100,000 population.\n\nDOCTORS OPT OUT EARLIER\n\nGrowing anecdotal evidence indicates physicians are beginning to retire earlier than in the past. In Florida 62 percent of physicians are 50 or older and 13.4 percent (about 5,900) plan to retire in the next five years, according to the Florida Department of Health\u2019s 2014 Physician Work Force Annual Report.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of those stories out there, which would suggest that there is going to be a flight of physicians over the age of 55 earlier than they would have expected from the workforce,\u201d said Atul Grover, chief public policy officer for the AAMC. \u201c\u2026 It is certainly going to be a different environment and for older physicians it may be generational, that they don\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201d\n\nCoble said unhappiness with government involvement in medicine, difficult dealings with insurance companies, and the demise of the individual practice, large numbers of which have been bought by hospitals and other corporate entities, led to \u201ca feeling of discontent, almost of oppression\u201d among many physicians.\n\nJack Drewninany, 64, a Jacksonville hand surgeon, made his feelings about the changes affecting his profession clear in his book \u201cThe Death of the Physician: How Power and Money Have Destroyed Our Medical Care,\u201d published in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not attractive to be a doctor anymore,\u201d Drewninany said. \u201cVery few physicians I know have recommended their kids go into medicine. You are being told today how to practice medicine. It\u2019s a controlled industry, which is not going in a good direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cBurnout is a significant problem for physicians across the country,\u201d said Gianrico Farrugia, chief executive officer of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville. \u201c\u2026 You need people who are very enthusiastic about their profession. But the amount of administrative work per patient has grown substantially. Most physicians go into medical school in a highly idealistic state. Physicians don\u2019t get into the business to do paperwork.\u201d\n\nThe pressure created by ongoing innovation is also a factor, he said.\n\n\u201cThe pace of change has become so rapid that it is difficult to keep up,\u201d Farrugia said.\n\nYOUNGER DOCTORS LESS DRIVEN\n\nMeanwhile younger doctors seem to have made the conscious decision to be less driven than the older generation. Physicians under the age of 35 in 1980 worked more than five hours more a week then their most recent counterparts, the AAMC reports.\n\n\u201cThis generation is probably not going to work as many hours as prior generations,\u201d Grover said, even though most of them are saddled with more debt than previous generations.\n\n\u201cThey are making quality-of-life decisions which my generation would have never considered,\u201d said Mayo\u2019s CEO Farrugia.\n\nIt\u2019s not just doctors under 30 who make those kinds of decisions.\n\nFrom 1999-2011, Jacksonville internist Louis Akra had a flourishing primary-care practice, treating as many as 5,000 patients. Treating that volume left him feeling not only overworked but frustrated that he wasn\u2019t able to devote the time he wanted to each patient.\n\n\u201cI was burning the candle at both ends,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t enjoying the practice of medicine. I was missing personal time with my patients. I wanted a more personal relationship, and that was becoming more and more difficult because of the volume of patients.\u201d\n\nSo in September 2011, Akra opened Akra Professional Services, a concierge practice. The patients he treats pay an annual fee of $1,800. For that they get as much time and attention as they desire and have round-the-clock access via email, text or phone call. He gets to practice medicine the way he wants while treating less than 10 percent of former patient load.\n\nIn addition to predicting an overall shortfall of 7,000 physicians in Florida in 2025, the Florida Physician Workforce Analysis: Forecasting Supply and Demand looked at which specialty areas of practice are likely to experience shortages and which will experience abundance by 2025. The largest shortages forecast are in psychiatry (55 percent), general surgery (50 percent), rheumatology (43 percent), thoracic surgery (38 percent), hematology/oncology (36 percent) and pulmonology/critical care (32 percent). Specialities forecast to have an abundance in Florida in 2025 are geriatric medicine (33 percent), pediatrics (26), dermatology (23 percent), emergency medicine (22) and plastic surgery (18 percent).\n\nACCESS TO DOCTORS DIMINISHES\n\nEven in areas like Jacksonville that seem to have plenty of doctors, shortages will manifest themselves in wait times for appointments, particularly with specialists, Grover said.\n\n\u201cThere is the demand issue of convenience where I\u2019m not going to be able to see a physician as quickly as I may want or need to,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Certainly, we\u2019re already seeing it in mental health, psychiatry, we\u2019re seeing it in neurology because of the growth in things like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s, we\u2019re seeing it in oncology because of the growth in cancer rates.\u201d\n\nA 2014 survey of wait times for five specialties in 15 cities by Merritt Hawkins found Boston had the highest average wait time at 45 days. Dallas had the lowest average wait time of 10.2 days.\n\nThe other big problem for people in certain rural areas, like Baker County, is that wait times are compounded by travel time.\n\n\u201cWe could really use some specialists,\u201d said Dunlavey, mentioning dermatology and orthopedics as specialities hard to find in her county.\n\nOne potential answer to that problem is telemedicine \u2014 the delivery of health care using telecommunications technologies such as video-conferencing.\n\nTelemedicine may well represent the future of medicine, says Sarvam P. TerKonda, who is the Mayo Clinic\u2019s medical director for connected care in Florida. Someday, he said, physicians will see more of their patients via telemedicine than in person. But that future isn\u2019t here yet.\n\nNo two states are alike in how telemedicine, also called telehealth, is defined and reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance, according to the National Telehealth Policy Resource Center.\n\n\u201cRules still have to be worked out\u201d about how and where a physician can treat a patient using a remote digital connection, TerKonda said.\n\nMany states, including Florida, require that a physician must make a face-to-face meeting with a patient before the physician can prescribe medicine for that patient, although a physician can recommend medication from a remote location if another physician is in face-to-face contact with the patient.\n\nTELEMEDICINE AN OPTION\n\nThat\u2019s what happens with the Mayo Clinic\u2019s stroke telemedicine program, which allows Mayo neurologist Kevin M. Barrett to assess patients who may be undergoing strokes at five hospitals in Florida and Georgia. Using wireless technology, Barrett can examine patients to determine if they are suffering ischemic strokes. Those strokes are caused by blood clots that can be dissolved using a tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) if it is administered in a timely fashion.\n\nEventually, TerKonda said, there will need to be an interstate compact like the one that exists among the states to agree to honor driver\u2019s licenses issued by other states. That way a physician licensed in one state could remotely treat a patient in a different state that has agreed to honor the physician\u2019s license. Such an agreement is not imminent, TerKonda said.\n\nOnce barriers are removed, telemedicine should \u201creduce travel time, increase access and reduce the cost\u201d of medical treatment, TerKonda said. \u201cIt is going to change the entirety of patient care.\u201d\n\nBut what it won\u2019t do is relieve physician shortages, he said. Telemedicine may save time for patients. But the physician will need the same amount of time with the patient regardless of whether the patient is in the room with the physician or at a remote location.\n\nAnother possible solution to the physician shortage is the increased training of physician assistants and nurse practitioners, people who don\u2019t have medical degrees but do have advanced training in the treatment of illness and injury. But the degree of independence these practitioners can exercise varies from state to state, with Florida still requiring them to work under the supervision of a physician.\n\nOne approach to solving physician shortages that has been used is allowing foreign-trained physicians to practice in the U.S. It\u2019s a solution Coble doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stealing them from countries which have their own desperate needs for quality health care,\u201d he said.\n\nCharlie Patton: (904) 359-4413\n\nTom Corwin of The Augusta Chronicle contributed to this story", "article_metadata": {"description": "A report released last spring, which predicted that in 2025 Florida would experience a shortage of about 7,000 physicians, should not have come as a surprise.\u201cThere have always been [physician] shortages created by changing science, which keeps leading to increasingly specialized areas of practice,\u201d said Yank Coble, a Jacksonville endocrinologist and a former president of the American Medical Association.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "A report released last spring predicted that in 2025 there will be a shortage of about 7,000 physicians in the state of Florida.", "title": "Florida, like nation, faces a shortage of physicians over next decade", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/news/health-and-fitness/2015-11-14/story/florida-nation-faces-shortage-physicians-over-next-decade", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/doctorfla_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Health and Fitness, News", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"msm-image150": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense150x111/doctorfla_1.jpg", "msm-image319": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense319x185/doctorfla_1.jpg", "articleid": 665572, "publishtime": "2015-11-15T03:13:03Z", "msm-image320": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense320/doctorfla_1.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Florida ranks 42nd with 19 physicians in training per 100,000 population, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\u201cIt is going to change the entirety of patient care.\u201dBut what it won\u2019t do is relieve physician shortages, he said.\nOne approach to solving physician shortages that has been used is allowing foreign-trained physicians to practice in the U.S. It\u2019s a solution Coble doesn\u2019t like.\n\u201cFlorida Physician Workforce Analysis: Forecasting Supply and Demand,\u201d a study commissioned by the Teaching Hospital Council of Florida and the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, echoed warnings that the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) has been making for a decade.\nA report released last spring, which predicted that in 2025 Florida would experience a shortage of about 7,000 physicians, should not have come as a surprise."}
