Ormandy has been criticized within the cybersecurity industry for his practice of disclosing vulnerabilities publicly rather than informing the company first and giving them time to fix the flaw.\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Pawel Kopczynski\n\nPhoto: (Twitter)\n\nOrmandy, who has previously cracked anti-virus software from Sophos and ESET, called this flaw \u201ca remote, zero interaction SYSTEM exploit, in default config. So, about as bad as it gets.\u201d However, according to the researcher himself, Kaspersky Lab has already begun to roll out a patch for the flaw to its users around the world.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nKaspersky Lab is one of the best known cybersecurity companies in the world, founded by Eugene Kaspersky back in 1997. It has been responsible for uncovering some of the most high-profile cyberespionage campaigns in recent years, including Flame as well as revealing the operation of the highly-sophisticated Equation Team earlier this year. In August, Kaspersky Lab denied claims from two former employees that it seeded fake malware signatures to competitors\u2019 anti-virus products so they would label benign files as malicious.\n\nFireEye\n\nOf potentially more concern are the FireEye vulnerabilities, which were revealed by Kristian Erik Hermansen on Twitter. Los Angeles-based researcher Hermansen claims he has discovered at least four flaws within FireEye\u2019s core security product -- revealing details of one and offering the other three for sale to the highest bidder.\n\nHermansen posted details of how to trigger the remote file disclosure vulnerability as well as details of a file that is used to keep track of every registered user that has access to a particular system.\n\nFireEye, a well known security company, has been called in to help investigate major cybersecurity breaches in recent times, including attacks on JPMorgan Chase & Co., Anthem Inc, Target Corporation and Sony Corp.\n\nThe one vulnerability that Hermansen did disclose was one that he has been \u201csitting on for more than 18 months with no fix from those security \u201cexperts\u201d at FireEye.\u201d He added that he was \u201cpretty sure Mendicant staff coded this and other bugs into the products,\u201d referring to the security company that FireEye bought at the end of 2013 for $1 billion in stock and cash.\n\nTrust\n\nThe vulnerability allows those exploiting it to gain remote access to files while the three other exploits Hermansen claims to have discovered would allow users to bypass logins, along with two command injection vulnerabilities one of which is unauthorized and one authorized.\n\nHermansen published details about the remote file disclosure vulnerability on Pastebin and Exploit-DB saying: \u201cFireEye appliance, unauthorised remote root file system access. Oh cool, web server runs as root! Now that\u2019s excellent security from a security vendor :) Why would you trust these people to have this device on your network?\u201d\n\nThere is no indication if Hermansen has sold the three other vulnerabilities yet, having posted his ad on Twitter on Sept. 2 though at least one person responded saying they are interested in acquiring one of the vulnerabilities.\n\nFireEye told International Business Times in an email that it had \"learned of four potential security issues in our products from Kristian Hermansen\u2019s public disclosure of them being available for purchase.\" The company added that while it appreciates the efforts of security researchers in pointing out security flaws, it has a \"documented policy for researchers to responsibly disclose and inform us of potential security issue\" and encourages \"responsible disclosure.\"\n\nHermann most recently came to prominence when he posted a video on YouTube revealing a vulnerability in the Obamacare website \"Covered California,\" which allowed him to take over another person\u2019s account and change their information. After a month of not getting a response from the website, Hermann decided the only way to get its attention was to publish the video, which was quickly removed from YouTube after complaints by the healthcare provider.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kaspersky, fireeye, hacked, anti-virus, tavis ormandy, zero-day, vulnerabilities, kristian erik hermansen, for sale, remote file disclosure,", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The security credentials of two of the world's biggest cybersecurity companies -- Kaspersky and FireEye -- have been questioned by researchers.", "title": "Kaspersky And FireEye Security Products Cracked By Researchers", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/kaspersky-fireeye-security-products-cracked-researchers-2085291", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/03/06/cybersecurity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The security credentials of two of the world's biggest cybersecurity companies -- Kaspersky and FireEye -- have been questioned by researchers.", "title": "Kaspersky And FireEye Security Products Cracked By Researchers", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/kaspersky-fireeye-security-products-cracked-researchers-2085291", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/03/06/cybersecurity.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/03/06/cybersecurity.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Technology", "published_time": "2015-09-07T06:13:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-08T08:07:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The security credentials of two of the world's biggest cybersecurity companies -- Kaspersky and FireEye -- have been questioned by researchers."}, "article_summary": "FireEyeOf potentially more concern are the FireEye vulnerabilities, which were revealed by Kristian Erik Hermansen on Twitter.\nTavis Ormandy, a security researcher at Google, made public the fact he had cracked Kaspersky\u2019s anti-virus product before revealing the details to the Russian company.\nThe company added that while it appreciates the efforts of security researchers in pointing out security flaws, it has a \"documented policy for researchers to responsibly disclose and inform us of potential security issue\" and encourages \"responsible disclosure.\"\nHermansen published details about the remote file disclosure vulnerability on Pastebin and Exploit-DB saying: \u201cFireEye appliance, unauthorised remote root file system access.\nFireEye, a well known security company, has been called in to help investigate major cybersecurity breaches in recent times, including attacks on JPMorgan Chase & Co., Anthem Inc, Target Corporation and Sony Corp."}
