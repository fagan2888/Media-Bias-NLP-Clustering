Demaryius Thomas stood before the press and admitted he wanted to break the NFL\u2019s single-season receiving yards record.\n\n2K. That\u2019s roughly what it would take to supplant Detroit\u2019s Calvin Johnson, who holds the mark with 1,964 yards in 2012.\n\nWhy2K? Why does it matter? Thomas seeks greatness, wants to be measured among the all-time best. What appears as self-serving serves the exact opposite goal. His relentless desire for excellence makes his team better. Sift through his words, and clarity emerges. Of course, he wants to reach new heights. No superstar signs a monstrous contract and declares mediocrity as his obsession. In admitting his goal publicly, Thomas turned the mirror back on himself, a move that will ultimately benefit the Broncos.\n\n\u201cI watched some games that I played, and there were some where I took a play or two off and missed a couple of blocks,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think that if I do those little things, it will make everybody around me better and make me a better player. That\u2019s my main focus right now.\u201d\n\nFear ripples through secondaries with those words. Or should. Thomas turns into a running back after the catch, races past and through undersized defenders. With a new contract and a louder voice in leadership, he brings more confidence into confrontation this season.\n\nIt takes little imagination to believe Thomas will be better. But will he produce bigger numbers? Thomas\u2019 assertion \u2014 the mental edge needed from stars \u2014 got me to thinking. What is realistic for Thomas in a Gary Kubiak offense?\n\nFirst, Thomas has to grow comfortable with the route tree, the adjusted audible language. He will be playing catch-up after missing offseason workouts, though summer practices with Baltimore Ravens receiver Marlon Brown should accelerate his learning curve.\n\nThomas has shown he can thrive in any offense with any quarterback. And Kubiak, with a trait learned from Mike Shanahan, excels at creating mismatches. Examining history, it appears unlikely Thomas will reach 2,000 yards. But it doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t have a similar or greater impact.\n\nIn Kubiak\u2019s 20 seasons as an offensive coordinator or head coach, seven receivers have led the team in receptions and six in receiving yards. Houston\u2019s Andre Johnson established bests in both categories with 115 receptions in 2008 and 1,598 yards in 2012.\n\nThe average season for Kubiak\u2019s leading receiver over two decades: 87 catches, 1,186 yards. Shorten it to the last nine years \u2014 eight as the boss in Houston and last season as Baltimore\u2019s offensive coordinator \u2014 it looks like this: 92 catches, 1,233 yards.\n\nThomas will get his numbers. Even if they don\u2019t break records.\n\nHe has a good problem: someone to share the spotlight. Emmanuel Sanders experienced a starbust season last year. He and Thomas combined for the most receiving yards (3,023) and tied for the most receptions (212) by an offensive tandem in 2014.\n\nThe only reason Thomas won\u2019t break Johnson\u2019s mark is because Sanders also will be open. It provides Kubiak his best one-two receiver punch since Ed McCaffrey (101 catches) and Rod Smith (100).\n\nPut Thomas through the shredder, computing Kubiak\u2019s scheme with Thomas and Johnson\u2019s best seasons, and I predict Thomas\u2019 2015 season: 105 catches, 1,537 yards and 11 touchdowns. It would match him with Marvin Harrison as the only receiver in NFL history with four consecutive seasons of at least 1,400 yards and 10 scores.\n\n2K is an admirable goal. If his production results in a third Super Bowl, it will have longer staying power, reflecting his importance to the team and a franchise\u2019s legacy.\n\nTroy E.
