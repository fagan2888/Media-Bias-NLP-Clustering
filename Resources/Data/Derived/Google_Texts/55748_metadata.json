Everything else would require so much state money, that, quite frankly, we don\u2019t have, for this project.\u201d\n\nIf lawmakers adopt Medicaid expansion, an option under Obamacare, the shift would be significant. The agency projects $7.2 billion in spending for new enrollees through the next decade and Idaho would likely only cover $194 million of that.\n\nThe transfer would ease costs for counties and the state, who regularly spending many millions on indigent care through the catastrophic health care fund.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s plan isn\u2019t traditional Medicaid expansion, but a modified outline that would place some new enrollees in managed care to cut costs and encourage providers to focus on outcomes, rather than simply getting paid.\n\nThe proposal would also subsidize private insurance plan purchases through the Obamamcare exchange for other new enrollees.\n\nShould Idaho lawmakers choose not to expand, county and state taxpayers will cover the spending anyway, Armstrong said.\n\nThe plan would increase Idaho\u2019s dependence on federal dollars for survival. The Gem State is already on the upward path of federal reliance, with lawmakers using $2.35 billion in federal dollars in 2014 spending plans. That\u2019s up from 2003\u2019s $1.35 billion.\n\nThe proposal, approved by Gov. Butch Otter\u2019s hand-picked Medicaid work group last year, would add 103,000 enrollees to government health care at a time when more Idahoans use welfare programs than ever.\n\nDHW reported weeks ago that more than 332,338 residents relied on the state and federal government for help with food, child care and Medicaid coverage in fiscal year 2014, a 69 percent increase from fiscal year 2006.\n\nIn 2006, only 13.8 percent of the state\u2019s 1.46 million residents relied on welfare programs. In 2014? It was 20.2 percent of Idaho\u2019s 1.61 million residents.\n\nYet, officials remain confident they can expand this program and find ways to encourage Idahoans to take control of their own care.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s Medicaid package includes very modest co-payments, which enrollees can work off by forming healthy habits. Though the co-payments are low, as little as $1, Armstrong said they still carry heft.\n\n\u201cTo them, they\u2019re meaningful,\u201d Armstrong. \u201cWe would enforce them. We want to make sure they use their health accounts to cover it.\u201d\n\nImportantly, Armstrong said through expansion, the state could recapture taxes Idahoans pay under Obamacare. The director said one consultant suggested Idahoans pay between $20 million and $50 million in Obamacare taxes annually.\n\nUsing the upper estimate, then, projects Idahoans will pay $500 million for Obamacare through the decade, while receiving $7.2 billion in federal spending in the same time frame.\n\nThat inequity would add to Idaho\u2019s welfare state status. A recent report revealed for every dollar Idaho taxpayers put into the federal pot, they get $1.40 back.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s plan also contains an opt-out clause, a provision to allow Idaho to leave expansion if conditions change after three years. That, Armstrong explained, was a direct request from Otter.\n\n\u201cYes, we have the opt out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be bloody awful.\u201d\n\nCritics disagree if the state could rip cheap or free medical coverage from 100,000 Idahoans.\n\n\u201cSome legal experts say that Medicaid expansion is like the Hotel California \u2014 you can check in, but you can never check out,\u201d warned Foundation for Government Accountability Senior Fellow Christie Herrera.\n\nShe added that the federal government holds the power to revoke all Medicaid dollars if the state drops new Medicaid participants. Herrera also suggested Idaho lawmakers view federal promises with great skepticism.\n\n\u201cExpansion supporters will point to letters written by the federal government, promising that will not be the case,\u201d she said. \u201cBut letters do not supercede what\u2019s in federal statute \u2014 so there could be big lawsuits ahead for states who expand Medicaid and attempt to roll it back a few years later.\u201d\n\nWayne Hoffman, president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, knocked the state agency for not being completely forthright about expansion\u2019s potential impacts on Idaho taxpayers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted by the level of distortion and misdirection being employed by the Department of Health and Welfare to secure expansion Obamacare,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the sales pitch. I am surprised and offended the agency isn\u2019t honest about the impacts, costs and downsides associated with this plan.\u201d\n\nHoffman noted the agency\u2019s first Powerpoint slide billed Armstrong\u2019s plan as \u201cAn alternative to Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no word if legislators will adopt expansion this year. In his State of the State address delivered just weeks ago, Otter only asked lawmakers to explore the plan.\n\nOtter hasn\u2019t fully endorsed his work group\u2019s proposal, but said he liked pieces that encourage personal responsibility and accountability.\n\nNote: The Idaho Freedom Foundation publishes IdahoReporter.com.
