Banks in this category will be on the hook for fines equal to 50 percent of the problematic U.S. assets they declare. Third and fourth categories have been set up for banks with no issues to declare, while the first category is made up of about a dozen Swiss banks that have already been under DOJ investigation.\n\nA Corner Bank spokeswoman confirmed the report, but declined further comment.\n\nThe DOJ program is highly controversial in Switzerland, because it has compelled a large number of the roughly 300 lenders here essentially to participate in high-stakes gambling. On the one hand, a bank that steps forward to come clean may have the necessary cash on hand to deal with resulting fines and move on. On the other hand, if a bank has had relatively little to do with undeclared U.S. accounts, the idea of avoiding the program entirely may be appealing. After all, the DOJ\u2019s resources are limited, and perhaps it won\u2019t be able to muster the energy to hunt down every last little bank here. Perhaps.\n\nIn the interview published Thursday in Handelszeitung, Corner Bank CEO Paolo Cornaro complained that the DOJ program makes no distinction between a Swiss bank that went out and actively sought undeclared U.S. money, and a bank that accommodated a client who may have a U.S. passport (among others) and also may have some undisclosed tax issues. At this point, the CEO said, Corner Bank just wants to \u201cfinish this chapter and finally look forward again.\u201d\n\nSwiss banks must report to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or Finma, by Monday about whether or not they\u2019ll participate in the DOJ program, and if so which category they intend to apply under. Both Finma and the DOJ have made clear that Swiss banks should think long and hard about their options, and consider the example of banks here such as UBS, Wegelin and Bank Frey, which have either paid heavy fines for aiding tax evasion or folded under the pressure of the U.S. crackdown.\n\nThe deadline for handing related information over to the DOJ under the program comes at the end of this year.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Now we know the identity of at least one Swiss bank that may participate in a U.S. Department of Justice program designed to punish lenders here for aiding tax evasion.", "title": "As Dreaded U.S. Deadline Approaches, One Swiss Bank Ponders its Fate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/05/autas-dreaded-u-s-deadline-approaches-one-swiss-bank-ponders-its-fateo-draft/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "As Dreaded U.S. Deadline Approaches, One Swiss Bank Ponders its Fate", "description": "Now we know the identity of at least one Swiss bank that may participate in a U.S. Department of Justice program designed to punish lenders here for aiding tax evasion.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "John Letzing", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Now we know the identity of at least one Swiss bank that may participate in a U.S. Department of Justice program designed to punish lenders here for aiding tax evasion.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-05T11:24:55-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/05/autas-dreaded-u-s-deadline-approaches-one-swiss-bank-ponders-its-fateo-draft/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-12821", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Now we know the identity of at least one Swiss bank that may participate in a U.S. Department of Justice program designed to punish lenders here for aiding tax evasion.", "title": "As Dreaded U.S. Deadline Approaches, One Swiss Bank Ponders its Fate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/05/autas-dreaded-u-s-deadline-approaches-one-swiss-bank-ponders-its-fateo-draft/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-12821", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-05T11:27:08-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc9c\"", "article_summary": "A Corner Bank spokeswoman confirmed the report, but declined further comment.\nThe deadline for handing related information over to the DOJ under the program comes at the end of this year.\nZURICH\u2013Now we know the identity of at least one Swiss bank that may participate in a U.S. Department of Justice program designed to punish lenders here for aiding tax evasion.\nThe DOJ program is highly controversial in Switzerland, because it has compelled a large number of the roughly 300 lenders here essentially to participate in high-stakes gambling.\nBanks in this category will be on the hook for fines equal to 50 percent of the problematic U.S. assets they declare."}
