Still, the stings aren\u2019t known to send the average non-allergic to the emergency room, but that\u2019s just what\u2019s happened to a Florida father, his son, and their dog. The trio was repeatedly stung and is currently receiving medical treatment, with the father, David Alvarez, in the intensive care unit.\n\nA summer walk through the woods turned into an excerpt from a horror movie when Alvarez, his son Jordan,7, and their family dog, Shia, stepped on a hornet\u2019s nest, WKMG in Orland reported. \u201cTwo people just came out of the woods, covered in bees, yelling for help. And they're saying they can't breathe. They have multiple, multiple stings,\u201d a passerby told the 911 dispatcher, the NY Daily News reported.\n\nIn an extreme act of courage, Jordan led his father, who is allergic to hornet stings, out of the woods and onto the main road, the Daily News reported. It was here that thankfully an experienced beekeeper, Jim Kunze, was among those to have heard the pair\u2019s cries for help. His quick thinking and expertise could have meant the difference between life and death for the father, son, and dog. \"They will be lucky to survive this. They were attacked that viciously,\" Kunze told WKMG.\n\nDonning his protective suit, Kunze put young Jordan in his car as he removed and killed the militant wasps until emergency medics arrived. \"It was pretty bad. It was chicken pox times five, at least,\" said Kunze, explaining the vicious attack to WKMG. It is reported by the news affiliation that both Alvarez and his son received over 300 bee stings.\n\nThe family has released a photo of 7-year-old Jordan's injuries.

WKMG reported that he is heavily sedated after having developed pneumonia and a blood clot. Alvarez is also reported to be breathing with the assistance of a breathing tube. Shia, the family\u2019s 4-year-old Shiba Inu is receiving medical treatment at a local veterinarian clinic. After the attack, she was found wandering around, swollen, with one eye shut, and her tongue hanging out. \u201cIf we would've waited another day, or few more hours, she would've died because he was having liver failure,\u201d Maggie Ramia, Alverez\u2019s aunt told WKMG in regards to the pooch\u2019s condition.\n\nIn order to ensure that the hidden nest would no longer wreak havoc on unsuspecting walkers, Kunze and another beekeeper will make sure it\u2019s completely removed before the end of the week.\n\nWasps and bees aren\u2019t normally aggressive and only sting in self-defense, such as defending the nest that Alvarez and his son had accidentally stepped on. When an individual receives multiple bee stings, the high amount of venom can cause a toxic reaction, inducing symptoms such as nausea, headache, vertigo, fainting, convulsion, and fever. The USDA reported that the average person can safely tolerate 10 bee stings per pound of body weight. This would translate as to more than 1,100 stings in the average adult. Most deaths from multiple bee stings have been in the elderly or individuals with cardiopulmonary problems.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hornet, attack, sends, father, and, son, er, son, recovering, father, continues, require", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Florida man, his 7-year-old son, and their family dog are lucky to be alive after a vicious hornet attack last week.", "title": "Hornet Attack Sends Father, Son, And Family Dog To The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hornet-attack-sends-father-and-son-er-son-recovering-father-continues-require-assistance-breathing", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/hornet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Florida man, his 7-year-old son, and their family dog are lucky to be alive after a vicious hornet attack last week.", "title": "Hornet Attack Sends Father, Son, And Family Dog To The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hornet-attack-sends-father-and-son-er-son-recovering-father-continues-require-assistance-breathing", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/hornet.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/hornet.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-25T14:01:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T14:01:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Florida man, his 7-year-old son, and their family dog are lucky to be alive after a vicious hornet attack last week."}, "article_summary": "His quick thinking and expertise could have meant the difference between life and death for the father, son, and dog.\nThey have multiple, multiple stings,\u201d a passerby told the 911 dispatcher, the NY Daily News reported.\nMost deaths from multiple bee stings have been in the elderly or individuals with cardiopulmonary problems.\nWhen an individual receives multiple bee stings, the high amount of venom can cause a toxic reaction, inducing symptoms such as nausea, headache, vertigo, fainting, convulsion, and fever.\nWKMG reported that he is heavily sedated after having developed pneumonia and a blood clot."}
