As the healthcare industry focuses more on improving patient experience and outcomes while reducing costs, technologies such as home monitoring contribute toward improved quality of life. Instead of having to wait for the next appointment, this real-time data daily monitoring helps us connect with patients, track their health status, alert us to a problem and intervene earlier before it becomes full blown.\"\n\n[See also: Patient care coordination programs prevent readmissions, according to JAMA study.]\n\nThat's exactly right, according to Brian Rosenfeld, MD, vice president and chief medical officer for telehealth, Philips Healthcare. Partners HealthCare at Home is a marquee client among hundreds of Philips\u2019 clients who are turning to monitoring patients at home post discharge in order to reduce hospital readmissions.\n\n\"If you really want to cut down the cost of healthcare, hospital admissions is the single biggest cost bucket,\" Rosenfeld told Healthcare IT News.\n\nAs he sees it, the Affordable Care Act, introduced a \"new world order\" to healthcare that has spurred many hospitals to follow their patients home, so to speak.\n\n\"That has been one of the major drivers of the Affordable Care Act, which is, 'It can't be business as usual, guys,'\" Rosenfeld said. \"You can\u2019t have this siloed care, where we're paying you for taking care of people in the hospital; we\u2019re paying someone else to take care of patients out of the hospital. You two don\u2019t really interact. You don\u2019t coordinate your care.\n\n\"And, because of that, patients regularly fall into the black hole of medicine, where you\u2019re discharged and there's no follow-up until they go and see their PCP, which can be five, 10, 20, 30 days following discharge. And, during that time, a lot of them have gotten readmitted. So, what this is saying is: You have to coordinate your care. And the sooner you do it, the better you\u2019re going to be from a financial standpoint.\"\n\n[See also: Bigger readmissions fines hit hospitals.]\n\nThe new world order that Rosenfeld talks about is helping to drive the market for remote patient monitoring as is the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nThe U.S. market for remote patient monitoring, valued at $104.5 million in 2012, is forecast to reach $296.5 million by 2019, a compound annual growth rate of 16 percent, according to a report GBI Research released last April.\n\nPartners HealthCare at Home has already demonstrated positive results with telemonitoring through its chronic cardiac care program. Since 2006, PHH has served 1,200 heart failure patients through this program and found a 50 percent reduction in readmission rates for enrolled patients, with an estimated savings of $10 million in healthcare costs.\n\nIn taking stock of the power of patient monitoring last year, Joseph Kvedar, MD, who founded and serves as director of the Center for Connected Health, a division of Partners HealthCare, wrote in his blog that in the early days of experimenting with remote monitoring, he thought of it as providing a rich data stream of vital signs for doctors and nurses, who could then make just-in-time decisions.\n\n\"But the biggest insight that I've gained in my 18+ years of working in connected health came when some of our earliest patients on that same telemonitoring program began to significantly improve their self-care,\" he wrote. \"We noticed that they used their daily monitoring results (weight, blood pressure, heart rate) as a numeric yardstick for their progress, enabling them to better understand the basic pathophysiology of congestive heart failure. They began to realize that salt intake leads to fluid retention and if your heart is weak, a buildup of fluid in the lungs can be quite dangerous. As a result, they started being much more fastidious about salt and fluid balance.\"\n\nPartners HealthCare at Home selected Philips as its telemonitoring partner based on its proven track record in implementing Philips\u2019 other home-based innovative clinical programs \u2013 Lifeline and Medication Dispensing \u2013 for PHH patients. These services transform the way care is delivered by creating the shortest path to the best care, from hospital to the home, Rosenfeld said.\n\nThe first 200 home monitors were installed in patient homes in less than two weeks. Partners employed its own network of installers as a key asset in establishing monitoring services in patients\u2019 homes and providing the training needed to ensure both clinical and patient adoption.\n\n\"Telehealth is so much more than a monitoring technology or a patient engagement app,\" Rosenfeld said. It\u2019s about \"addressing the needs of our aging population by improving the way health systems help patients and their loved ones maintain their health.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "With an eye on reducing hospital readmissions and boosting patient care coordination, Partners HealthCare at Home, a division of Partner's HealthCare in Boston, is rolling out new remote monitoring technology.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "With an eye on reducing hospital readmissions and boosting patient care coordination, Partners HealthCare at Home, a division of Partner's HealthCare in Boston, is rolling out new remote monitoring technology.", "title": "Partners keeps tabs on patients at home", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/partners-keeps-tabs-patients-home", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/seniors_and_health_it.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-13T10:08:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/partners-keeps-tabs-patients-home", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/seniors_and_health_it.jpg"}, "description": "With an eye on reducing hospital readmissions and boosting patient care coordination, Partners HealthCare at Home, a division of Partner's HealthCare in Boston, is rolling out new remote monitoring technology.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Partners keeps tabs on patients at home"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-11T06:58:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-13T10:08:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With an eye on reducing hospital readmissions and boosting patient care coordination, Partners HealthCare at Home, a division Partner's HealthCare in Boston, is rolling out new telemonitoring technology.\nMonitoring patients at home makes it possible for the nursing staff of Partners HealthCare At Home to track vital signs and intervene earlier with medical attention when it\u2019s needed.\nPartners HealthCare at Home is a marquee client among hundreds of Philips\u2019 clients who are turning to monitoring patients at home post discharge in order to reduce hospital readmissions.\n\"Remote patient monitoring does more than improve care coordination,\" Sue Beausoliel, RN, vice president of operations at Partners HealthCare at Home, said in a press statement.\nPartners HealthCare at Home has already demonstrated positive results with telemonitoring through its chronic cardiac care program."}
