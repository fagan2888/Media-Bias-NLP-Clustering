Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is weighing a 2016 run for president on the Republican side, hinted that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s early moves ahead of his own possible White House run aren’t what he thought they would be.

“I didn’t think I was going to be back up here again because frankly, I thought Jeb was just going to suck all the air out of the room, and it just hasn’t happened,” Mr. Kasich told a group of business leaders in New Hampshire Thursday.

“No hit on Jeb. No hit on you, Jeb!” Mr. Kasich quickly clarified, according to NH1, though he also said that he was “not going to have Bush money; Wells Fargo doesn’t have Bush money.”

Mr. Kasich, who is also a former congressman, said that if he runs for president, he’s “not doing this to write a book or get a television show or anything else.”

“Either you win or you don’t do it. And I’m optimistic it’s moving in the right direction, but we still have a ways to go,” he said.
