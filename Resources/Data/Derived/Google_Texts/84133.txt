ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota forward Zach Parise missed the Wild’s game Saturday night against Tampa Bay, and is considered week to week with a sprained MCL in his right knee.

Parise, who leads Minnesota and is tied for eighth in the NHL with seven goals, was injured during the first period on Thursday against Nashville when he was hit by Predators forward James Neal.

Battling for the puck near the right wall in the offensive zone, Parise went awkwardly into the boards when Neal hit him from behind, possibly knee-to-knee. No penalty was called and Neal isn’t facing any discipline from the league.

Parise has led the Wild to three straight playoff appearances after signing a 13-year, $98 million contract as a free agent in 2012. He’s led the team in goals in two of the past three seasons, scoring 80 goals in 188 games.

Parise’s 33 goals last season were the fourth-highest in franchise history.

Wild general manager Chuck Fletcher was glad the injury wasn’t worse.

“I think it’s great news,” Fletcher said. “Hopefully he’ll be back as soon as possible. But all things considered, in terms of knee injuries, it was the best case possible.”

Minnesota was also without defenseman Nate Prosser, who is considered day to day with a back injury. Prosser was injured after taking a crosscheck to the back against Nashville.

“We’re fortunate there,” Fletcher said. “He’s sore, but hopefully it won’t be too long.”

The Wild recalled forward Cristoph Bertschy from Iowa of the American Hockey League. Bertschy was set to make his NHL debut against the Lightning.
