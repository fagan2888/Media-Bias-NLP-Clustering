Now more of them are getting insurance, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily give them easy access into the healthcare system.\n\n\u201cThere is a need as we increase an individuals\u2019 ability to get into the system, to have more providers to serve individuals,\u201d says Gary Edwards, Executive Director for the Salt Lake County Health Department. He says the need for high quality, low cost care in West Valley outpaces available resources. And there are low-income Utahns who remain uninsured. \u201cIn Utah, we\u2019re still wrestling with the Medicaid expansion idea and proposals, and so there are still a fair number in communities throughout Utah without that insurance access.\u201d\n\nThe new clinic is located in the Salt Lake County Ellis Shipp Public Health Center. It\u2019s operated with federal funds by Community Health Centers, Inc. and provides a \u201cmedical home\u201d for over 2,800 patients. Services include screenings, immunizations, prenatal care, well child visits, and referrals to specialty services.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "Health officials are cutting the ribbon Wednesday on a new clinic in West Valley City intended to provide a medical home for those who are uninsured or", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuer.org/post/new-health-clinic-opens-west-valley-city-meet-growing-need", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuer/files/styles/medium/public/201512/wvc.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Health officials are cutting the ribbon Wednesday on a new clinic in West Valley City intended to provide a medical home for those who are uninsured or", "title": "New Health Clinic Opens in West Valley City to Meet Growing Need"}, "story_id": 459131781, "twitter": {"site": "@KUERNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KUERNews"}, "author": "Andrea Smardon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "New Health Clinic Opens in West Valley City to Meet Growing Need"}, "nid": 71402, "datePublished": "2015-12-09", "keywords": "uninsured, health insurance, Community Health Centers, West Valley City, Salt Lake County Health Department", "wordCount": 213, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Before the federal Affordable Care Act, one in five people in West Valley City did not have health insurance.\nHealth officials are cutting the ribbon Wednesday on a new clinic in West Valley City intended to provide a medical home for those who are uninsured or underserved.\nHe says the need for high quality, low cost care in West Valley outpaces available resources.\nIt\u2019s operated with federal funds by Community Health Centers, Inc. and provides a \u201cmedical home\u201d for over 2,800 patients.\nServices include screenings, immunizations, prenatal care, well child visits, and referrals to specialty services."}
