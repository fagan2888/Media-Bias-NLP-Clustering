Rockford (WIFR) -- A Stateline group believes there is too much corruption at the federal level when it comes to money in the political system, which is why they’re trying to stop it.

Local volunteers with the non-partisan corruption fighting group Represent.Us Rockford will have a non-binding advisory question on the April 7th ballot for all Winnebago County voters.

The question is a highly abbreviated version of the reform plan known as the American Anti-Corruption Act. The resolution placing this question on the April 7th ballot passed 15-3 at the December 23rd Winnebago County Board meeting. A similar resolution also recently passed at the DeKalb County Board meeting. Members of the local Represent.Us group are seeking to raise awareness about the corrupting influence of money on the political system.

"We're trying to gage support for implementation of this plan at the federal level. We're not necessarily making any comment on anything going on in Winnebago County. We do believe there that are principles involved in the Anti-Corruption Act that me be applicable to lower levels of government, but what we're primarily trying to focus on is the corrupting influence of money in politics at the federal level."

Elizabeth Lindquist, who is with Represent.Us Rockford went onto say, “What goes on in Washington now is a battle between the special interests and billionaires on the left and the special interests and billionaires on the right. The will of the average American is barely considered. We want to decrease the influence of all that money so our representatives can represent us instead of just their campaign funders.”

The group has support from local businesses like Kate's Pie Shop and Record Store, where they meet every 2nd Saturday of the month at noon.
