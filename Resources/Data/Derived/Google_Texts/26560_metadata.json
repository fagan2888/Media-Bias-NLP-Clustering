English? No you don't need to speak that. It's racism to even require it.\n\nNow let's have illegal alien amnesty, whose advocates promise that the illegals will be forced to learn to speak English (nope), pay their taxes (receive Earned Income Credits) and contribute to the economy (ObamaCare, disability, Section 8).\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a federal agency tasked with enforcing workplace discrimination laws, is suing a private American business for firing a group of Hispanic and Asian employees over their inability to speak English at work, claiming that the English-language requirement in a U.S. business constitutes \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d Judicial Watch reported Tuesday that the government is accusing Wisconsin Plastics, Inc. of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on \u201cnational origin.\u201d The government argues this includes the \u201clinguistic characteristics of a national origin group.\u201d\n\nThat argument is so wrong it could have only come from Obama. No one is discriminating them because they speak another language. The problem is that they don't speak English.\n\nCan the EEOC argue with a straight face that not knowing English is the characteristic of a national origin group? Why not.\n\nAccording to a news release from the EEOC, Chicago Regional Attorney John C. Hendrickson said the Green Bay-based company\u2019s English requirement is based on \u201csuperficial\u201d reasoning. \"Our experience at the EEOC has been that so-called 'English only' rules and requirements of English fluency are often employed to make what is really discrimination appear acceptable. But superficial appearances are not fooling anyone,\u201d Hendrickson said in the release. \u201cWhen speaking English fluently is not, in fact, required for the safe and effective performance of a job, nor for the successful operation of the employer\u2019s business, requiring employees to be fluent in English usually constitutes employment discrimination on the basis of national origin \u2014 and thus violates federal law.\u201d\n\nSpeaking English fluently is always required at any job. If you can't communicate with an employee, then the employee can't properly be instructed and will have problems interacting with customers or other employees making for an inefficient and unfriendly workplace.\n\nSerious language warning. And nothing a white comedian could get away with today.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The English-language requirement in a U.S. business constitutes \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The English-language requirement in a U.S. business constitutes \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d", "title": "Obama Claims Requiring Employees to Speak English is Illegal Discrimination", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/235638/obama-claims-requiring-employees-speak-english-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:54-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/235638/obama-claims-requiring-employees-speak-english-daniel-greenfield", "description": "The English-language requirement in a U.S. business constitutes \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Claims Requiring Employees to Speak English is Illegal Discrimination"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-04T05:24:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bbf\"", "article_summary": "The problem is that they don't speak English.\nNow let's have illegal alien amnesty, whose advocates promise that the illegals will be forced to learn to speak English (nope), pay their taxes (receive Earned Income Credits) and contribute to the economy (ObamaCare, disability, Section 8).\nCan the EEOC argue with a straight face that not knowing English is the characteristic of a national origin group?\nAccording to a news release from the EEOC, Chicago Regional Attorney John C.
