BMW is recalling 91,800 Mini Coopers to fix a defect that may prevent the air bag on the front passenger side of the cars from deploying in a crash.



The problem affects the 2005 to 2008 models of the Mini Cooper and Cooper S. BMW says the air bag may not work properly because of a flam that might prevent the vehicles' mat detection system from sensing a passenger sitting in the front seat.



BMW told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it has been notified of one minor injury linked to the defect.



To repair the problem, BMW will replace the detection mat in the affected models for free. The recall will begin May 1.
