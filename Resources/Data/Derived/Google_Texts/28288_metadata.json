The system is changing,\u201d Emanuel writes in an op-ed on New Republic. \u201cAs a result, insurance companies as they are now will be going away. Indeed, they are already evolving. For the next few years insurance companies will both continue to provide services to employers and, increasingly, compete against each other in the health insurance exchanges.\u201d\n\nDue to Obamacare, \u201cnew actors will force insurance companies to evolve or become extinct,\u201d he continues. Instead, new groups called \u201caccountable care organizations\u201d (ACOs) must start competing directly in the health care exchanges for exclusive contracts with employers.\n\nThe ACOs will have \u201cstandardized, guideline-driven care plans for most major conditions and procedures to increase efficiency,\u201d says Emanuel, the brother of Obama\u2019s former chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\n\u201cThey will have figured out how to harness their electronic medical records to better identify patients who will become sick and how to intervene early as well as how to care for the well-identified chronically ill so as to reduce costs,\u201d he notes.\n\nMore from the New Republic op-ed:\n\nThe key skill these ACOs and hospital systems lack\u2014the skill insurance companies specialize in\u2014is the actuarial capacity to predict and manage financial risk. But over the next decade this is something they will develop\u2014or purchase. After all, actuarial science is not rocket science, even if it involves a lot of mathematical equations. And with that skill, ACOs and hospital systems will become integrated delivery systems like Kaiser or Group Health of Puget Sound. Then they will cut out the insurance company middle man\u2014and keep the insurance company profits for themselves. Therefore, increasingly these ACOs and hospital systems will transform themselves into integrated delivery systems, entering insurance exchanges and negotiating with employers, in direct competition with insurance companies.\n\nAs the ACOs become more established, Emanuel claims contracts between the health systems and employers will become more common, thus \u201ccutting out the insurance companies.\u201d\n\nOnce the health systems \u201cmake the jump to offering coverage in the exchanges, the health insurance companies will only have a few options if they want to survive, according to Emanuel.\n\n\u201cFirst, they can refuse to change, in which case they will eventually go out of business,\u201d he writes. \u201cSecond, they can shift their business to focus on offering services they have expertise in, particularly analytics, actuarial modeling, risk management, and other management services.\u201d\n\nFinally, the \u201cthird evolutionary path is that health insurance companies may transform themselves into integrated delivery systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo be prepared to kiss your insurance company good-bye forever,\u201d Emanuel concludes.\n\nRead the entire article here.\n\n\u2013\n\nProgramming note: Is this the end of health insurance as we know it?
