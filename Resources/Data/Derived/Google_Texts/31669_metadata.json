Growth in adjusted admissions will continue to well outpace growth in admissions, with the differential dependent upon the amount of the outpatient market hospital companies can capture. During the period 2008-2015, the performance gap between growth in volumes of admissions and adjusted admissions averaged 200 basis points annually. Capital investment in more acute service lines should help to stabilize the slow erosion in admissions, but a shift to outpatient services and the stiff competition among healthcare providers to capture that market share will continue.\n\nPressure on hospital admissions as a result of regulatory reforms like Medicare payment penalties for readmissions should normalize eventually, but it has proved difficult to call a bottom. For example, hospital providers in rural markets have been reporting headwinds related to drops in short-stay admissions for several years. One possible explanation for this trend is that process and productivity enhancements and technological innovation are working to keep more patients out of the hospital, which is good news for patients and payors.\n\nThe report provides a summary of the quarterly operating performance and credit metrics of companies in the for-profit hospital sector, including detailed debt and organizational structure charts.
