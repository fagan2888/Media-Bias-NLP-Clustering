It imposes nearly $5 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years to eliminate the deficit, repeals the Affordable Care Act, and gives future seniors the option of choosing a private voucher system rather than traditional Medicare.\n\nIt passed 228-199, without a single Democratic vote. The House added significant hikes in defense spending, some reflecting requests from President Barack Obama, but without paying for it with other spending reductions, as some GOP conservatives had requested.\n\nThe budget won the support of all five Louisiana Republicans -- House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Jefferson, and Reps. Charles Boustany of Lafayette, John Fleming of Minden; Ralph Abraham of Alto and Garret Graves of Baton Rouge. The delegation's only Democrat, Rep. Cedric Richmond of New Orleans, voted no.\n\n\"The House Republican Budget lays out a bold vision for America that not only balances in less than ten years through economic growth and fiscal responsibility, but also strengthens and secures Medicare for seniors and pays down our nation's $18 trillion in debt,\" Scalise said.\n\nA solid GOP vote for the bill, including support from such fiscal conservatives as John Fleming, was an important achievement for Scalise, the GOP's chief vote generator, after some well publicized defeats.\n\nDemocrats said the budget does plenty for the wealthy, but little for the middle class and is full of accounting gimmicks.\n\n\"Congressional Republicans have been quick to pay lip service to wanting to help working families -- but this budget means that Americans who are working harder than ever will be getting even less,\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \"It does nothing to boost the paychecks of working Americans and makes it harder to buy a home. Students will see deep education cuts and college will be less affordable. And this budget takes away the tools that allow people to climb the ladder of opportunity. It also makes it harder to have a secure retirement.\"\n\nThe administration issued a memo that said the GOP budget, if adopted, would require 279,000 Louisiana families to lose some $257 million in tax breaks from the earned income tax credit, take away health coverage for 186,000 Louisiana residents who have newly signed up for coverage or re-enrolled in 2015 through Affordable Care Act Marketplaces and eliminate the health law's closing of the donut hole for Medicare recipient's prescription coverage. That means 73,300 Louisiana seniors and people with disabilities would pay higher costs for prescription drugs, the White House said.\n\nScalise disputed the notion that low income Louisiana residents would suffer, saying for example, that the GOP's plan to block grant Medicaid funding would lead state officials to develop a program that better serves the health care needs of the poor for less money.\n\nHe said the budget rejects a proposal from President Obama to repeal a provision in the 2006 energy legislation, sponsored by former Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., that authorizes revenue sharing, starting in 2017, for off-shore drilling in gulf states, including Louisiana. The gulf states could take in as much as $500 million a year.\n\n\"Our state fought hard for our fair share of the revenue generated from energy produced off of our coast,\" Scalise said.\n\nBoustany said a key for him was getting more money for the Defense Department.\n\n\"The United States' continuing withdrawal from global engagement under the Obama Administration has created new and dangerous threats worldwide, like an emboldened Vladimir Putin and the Islamic State,\" Boustany said. \"Now is not the time to cut bait and run by slashing defense funding when we need it most.\"\n\nGraves, the freshman Republican from Baton Rouge, said the Republican budget \"puts us on a path to balance -- unlike the president's budget, which never balances -- despite raising trillions of dollars in new taxes and fees.\"\n\nA similar budget is now being debated in the Senate. Budgets are advisory, and it will take legislation, subject to President Obama's veto, to get bills matching the budget's priorities into law -- including repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Scalise said that the repeal bill will be part of what is known as reconciliation bill, which won't require the normal 60 votes in the Senate to pass, leaving minority Democrats unable to stop it. But any bill with repeal of the Affordable Care Act will be vetoed by the president and it's doubtful Republican opponents have the two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate to override a veto.\n\nThe White House was quick Wednesday night to denounce the GOP budget.\n\n\"Budgets are about priorities,\" said Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \"This evening the House Republicans made clear that once again their priority is to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires and return our economy to the same top-down economics that has failed the American people before. House Republicans voted in favor of locking in draconian sequestration cuts to investments in the middle class like education, job training and manufacturing. House Republicans also failed to responsibly fund our national security, opting instead for budget gimmicks.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, barack obama, br-business, br-frontpage, br-homepage, br-news, br-politics, business, cedric richmond, charles boustany, garret graves, health care law, homepage, john fleming, news, politics, ralph abraham, steve scalise", "title": "GOP-led House passes budget that slashes spending, repeals Obamacare and moves to balanced budget in 10 years", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The GOP-led House passed a budget&nbsp;Wednesday night (March 25) that reflects their members' priorities.
