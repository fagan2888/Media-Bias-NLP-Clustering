JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP are advising Conmed. Piper Jaffray & Co. (NYSE: PJC) and Wiggin & Dana LLP are SurgiQuest’s advisers. SurgiQuest founder Kurt Azarbarzin will join Conmed as chief technology officer of advanced surgical business.

Other recent medical technology deals include 3M Co.'s (NYSE: MMM) completing its acquisition of Polypore International Inc.’s (NYSE: PPO) separations media business and Boston Scientific's (NYSE: BSX) picking up CeloNova Biosciences' interventional radiology portfolio.

Conmed is funding the acquisition with cash and debt.
