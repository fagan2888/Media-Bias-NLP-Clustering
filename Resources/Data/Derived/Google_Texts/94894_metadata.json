Minton Jr is seen in a 2013 file photo. (Photo: John Sommers II/Special to the C)\n\nThe state's chief justice unleashed pointed criticism of Circuit Court Judge Olu Stevens in a Friday ruling, but he denied a motion to remove the judge from all criminal cases while referring the case to a state disciplinary body.\n\nChief Justice John D. Minton Jr. wrote that Stevens \"appears to flout the directives of the Code of Judicial Conduct, creating a social-media firestorm calculated to aggrandize himself by exploiting the deep-seated and widespread distrust of the criminal-justice system by minority communities.\"\n\nIn the 13-page ruling, Minton said that Stevens did not \"comply with the letter or spirit\" of a Dec. 4 mediation agreement with Jefferson Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine when he wrote on Facebook that his opponents have tried to remove him from the bench and silence him on important matters of race in judicial selection.\n\nThose posts \"give a clear indication that he intends to continue violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, ...\" Minton wrote.\n\n\"Rather than provide leadership on an important issue worthy of wide discussion, deliberation and action,\" Minton wrote, \"Judge Stevens has detracted from the conversation by choosing instead to malign the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and mischaracterize his motives in pursuing his constitutional right to seek clarification on an issue of law before the Supreme Court on behalf of the commonwealth.\"\n\nWhile he had many cutting remarks for Stevens and largely agreed with Wine's assessment of the situation, Minton concluded it is beyond his power to remove the judge from all criminal cases.\n\n\u201cA disqualification of this magnitude would effectively remove Judge Stevens from his criminal docket for the foreseeable future and render him unable to fulfill the constitutional duties of a circuit judge,\u201d Minton wrote.\n\nThe chief justice said he referred the case to the state's Judicial Conduct Commission \u2013 the only body with state constitutional power to discipline a sitting Kentucky judge.\n\nAddressing the matter before the commission gives Stevens due process rights, allowing Stevens to defend himself against charges, have an attorney, examine witnesses and produce evidence, Minton said.\n\nStevens did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nWine issued a statement and said, \"Justice Minton recognized that Judge Stevens 'ensuing public discourse appears to flout the directives of the Code of Judicial Conduct, creating a social-media firestorm calculated to aggrandize himself by exploiting the deep-seated and widespread distrust of the criminal-justice system by minority communities.' \"\n\nThe controversy stems from a November 2014 ruling in which Stevens dismissed a panel of 41 prospective jurors \u2013 at the request of a defense attorney on behalf of an African-American defendant \u2013 when the lone black person was struck at random, leaving an all-white jury.\n\nStevens maintained on Facebook that he dismissed the jury panel because it was a \"substantial departure from the racial make-up of the average jury panel.\"\n\nWine then asked the state Supreme Court to decide if a judge has the power to do so when there isn't evidence of discrimination by the prosecution in jury selection. That case is still pending before the high court, and as Minton notes, has nothing to do with Friday's ruling.\n\nStevens, in turn, denounced Wine on Facebook, saying he was a racist who supported \u201call white juries\u201d because of his question to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Nov. 18, Wine responded by seeking the judge\u2019s removal from all criminal cases, citing bias toward his office and his prosecutors.\n\nChief Justice Minton ordered the two into mediation, which resulted in an agreement that Wine would withdraw his motion and both wouldn't use social media to discuss their differences.\n\nCiting Stevens' post-mediation social media posts, Wine renewed his motion to Minton on Monday, arguing Stevens breached the agreement.\n\nOne such Facebook post, purportedly signed by Stevens, does not identify Wine or his office by name but says the concern over the judge's \u201cmethod of communication\u201d was \u201cpurposely\u201d misplaced to distract from his message of advocating for diverse juries in the county.\n\nIt is not immediately clear if Stevens will resume his normal daily docket next week.\n\nMinton's complaint to the Judicial Conduct Commission will set in motion a preliminary investigation that could lead to formal proceedings, state law outlines.\n\nReporter Matthew Glowicki can be reached at 502-582-4989 or mglowicki@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1YqGgku", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Chief justice won't pull Judge Olu Stevens from cases, but he referred the matter to the state's disciplinary board.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Chief justice won't pull Judge Olu Stevens from cases, but he referred the matter to the state's disciplinary board.", "title": "Minton refers Stevens to board for possible sanctions", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/12/18/minton-denies-motion-pull-stevens-cases/77573512/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chief justice won't pull Judge Olu Stevens from cases, but he referred the matter to the state's disciplinary board.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2dcf46d308f9e18817a3c89f9fb7ea9c509eed01/c=370-0-2631-2261&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/23/Louisville/Louisville/635838735649204097-Minton.jpg", "title": "John D.
