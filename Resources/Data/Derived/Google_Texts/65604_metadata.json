It almost feels like a freedom. Is it really gone?\"\n\nCooper Barnes, 5, right, talks to Sheila Osebold as she has her head shaved by Shear NV stylist Shauna Payne during the St. Baldrick's event on Saturday, March 8, 2014 at the Thompson School District administration building to raise money for cancer research.\n\nOsebold raised the most of the 22 people who volunteered to get their hair shorn, collecting $1,762, closely followed by Barnes' $1,590. The shavees raised $10,073 by the conclusion of the three-hour event, with shaving done by Shear NV Salon stylists.\n\nLast year, the event generated $16,160, and in 2012, $10,500.\n\n\"When a child has cancer, it has a huge impact on the family and the community,\" said Mike Jones, assistant superintendent of human resources and school support for the district and the emcee of the event. \"When we can help out like this, it's an awesome thing to do.\"\n\nEighteen-year-old Nick Spickard had never gone bald before until his friends, Alex Eichler and Tyler Pechin, asked him to join in the fund-raiser, which they participated in the year before.\n\n\"It's just a good thing to do,\" said Spickard, a 12th-grader at Berthoud High School, about raising $550.\n\nGreeley resident Kate Parker came to the event to get her head shaved and raise money in an education setting, because she is studying to be a special education teacher.\n\n\"I feel strongly about kids. I don't want to see my future kids struggling with cancer,\" Parker said.\n\nJust after she got her head shaved, Parker kept trying to move her bangs out of her face, she said.\n\n\"It's whatever,\" Parker said. \"It's just hair. It grows back.\"\n\nNicole Kreiling, an intensive learning center teacher at Ponderosa Elementary School, had hair long enough to donate, saying as it got cut off, \"This is really happening? ... It'll be a shock to my students.\"\n\nAfterwards, Kreiling, who raised $650, said she was doing the right thing.\n\n\"You just do what you can,\" she said. \"It's just hair.\"\n\nDoug Jepson of Fort Collins told the attendees of the event about how his son, Jake, an eighth-grader at Lucile Erwin Middle School, was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma in January 2013 and underwent chemotherapy and surgery to remove a tumor on his leg.\n\n\"As we got done with Jake's chemo, it did show us what we are made of,\" Jepson said. \"Cancer, especially childhood cancer, is not a once-in-awhile thing, it's an all-the-time thing.\"\n\nJepson thanked the shavees for their donations.\n\n\"What you've done today helped Jake, because it's an all-the-time thing,\" Jepson said. \"Even if it's just hair, it meant a lot to our family.\"\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Shelley Widhalm at 970-669-5050 or swidhalm@reporter-herald.com.
