The Common Core State Standards Initiative, as it\u2019s officially called, is an effort to establish consistent educational standards across the entire United States. And as is the case with any major aspect of the general education reform movement, it has inspired great controversy.\n\nOn the left, Common Core is derided as yet another manifestation of the education reform movement\u2019s obsessive rationalization and data fetishism. Chicago Teachers Union president Karen Lewis, for example, recently came out against the new standards, describing them as \u201can overreach of federal power into personal privacy as well as into state educational autonomy\u201d that \u201celiminates creativity in the classroom and impedes collaboration.\u201d\n\nAnd on the right? Well, the antipathy is often no less pronounced, but as a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center shows, the criticisms leveled against the Common Core by right-wing extremists tend to be, in a word, crazy. Often, they\u2019re far less about the standards themselves than a generalized hatred for secularism and public education, one that has roots stretching all the way back to the 1950s and is most pronounced among religious Southern conservatives who worry Big Brother is trying to turn their progeny liberal.\n\nEarlier this week, Salon talked about the new report, and the far right\u2019s assault on Common Core, with SPLC\u2019s Teaching Tolerance director, Maureen Costello. Following is a transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhat made you want to study the anti-Common Core movement on the right?\n\nWe wanted to shed some light on the nature of the debate, because you can\u2019t pick up a newspaper these days (if in fact you pick up newspapers) or open your online news source without seeing some kind of headline about the Common Core. I\u2019ve been in education for over 30 years and it\u2019s really only been recently that you\u2019ve had educational topics in the national headlines. That\u2019s a little bit unusual.\n\nWhat also came to our attention was that [Common Core] evokes a very lively debate about real issues, and issues about whether the standards are appropriate at all grade levels; whether they are being implemented too quickly; whether, in fact, there should be more time for implementation before there\u2019s any kind of testing done; and what \u2026 those tests should look like; and should teacher evaluations be linked to the standards or, rather, linked to the tests? Are we troubled by the role of big money \u2014 Gates Foundation money, other foundations\u2019 money \u2014 in developing these standards? Those are legitimate debate questions.\n\nBut what we began to notice was some spectacularly bizarre allegations being made about the standards, and that a lot of the so-called debate, particularly coming from the right \u2026 saw this as \u201cbig government\u201d taking over and \u2026 talked about \u201cindoctrination camps\u201d in the same ways that some folks from the right talk about FEMA camps. There\u2019s this notion that \u2026 data was going to be collected on individuals and that they would be tracked for the rest of their lives because of the Common Core \u2026\n\nSo we started looking more at the stuff that was coming out of the right, and what we saw was that Common Core was just the latest and best weapon [against public schools], and that there was a real pattern over the last 30 or 40 years of withdrawal from the public school system in reaction to desegregation, to school prayer decisions on the Supreme Court, to the rise of sex education \u2026 There\u2019s been a series of topics associated with making education more secular and reflecting a more multicultural and diverse society that has steadily pushed the right wing to further withdraw from the public school system.\n\nSo we wanted to see if the dots connected. Were the same people who were making absurd comments about the Common Core also previously the same people who were saying there shouldn\u2019t be public schools, or public schools should bring God back or whatever? We found there\u2019s an enormous amount of overlap.\n\nWho are some of the leaders of the right-wing anti-Common Core movement?\n\nThe most familiar one is Glenn Beck \u2026 I saw that he has a new book out against the Common Core. So he certainly is one of the more prominent ones.\n\nThen you \u2026 have the American Principles Project, which is providing a lot of the intellectual backbone and organizing force against it. You have the Heartland Institute, which is based in Chicago. There\u2019s to some degree the Heritage Foundation, and the American Enterprise Institute \u2026 But you also have groups like Freedom Works; so there\u2019s those very, very conservative groups. And then if we get a little more extreme, you\u2019ve got groups like the John Birch Society that have come out against it; you have some Tea Party groups certainly that have; [and Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s] Eagle Forum. And in the states where there are local chapters of Eagle Forum, they\u2019re usually very dedicated to defeating the Common Core as well \u2026\n\n[I]t\u2019s hard to put your finger on one single group that\u2019s leading it, except all the arguments start to look the same after a while. And in any state where there\u2019s been, what appears to be a grass-roots movement \u2014 states like Utah or Arkansas or Indiana, which was the first \u2014 there\u2019s, like, 25 [anti-Common Core] groups. They\u2019re usually like \u201cMothers Against Common Core,\u201d or the state version of the Eagle Forum or something like that. But many of them are going to the same places for their information.\n\nIs Common Core an issue that these people cared about before Obama became president?\n\nI don\u2019t think so; but that\u2019s not to say that they haven\u2019t cared about schools \u2026 [W]e\u2019ve got statements from people like Jerry Falwell that call for an end to secular public schooling that go back to the 1970s \u2026 You also have to recognize that this is the population \u2026 that is most likely to home-school. In the South, this is the population that has been more likely to take their kids out of public schools, especially if those public schools are overwhelmingly African-American.\n\nSo there\u2019s already been a kind of concerted attack-by-withdrawal on the public school system [from the right]. And, certainly, if you look at some of the rallies and photos from the rallies against Common Core, it\u2019s not just school-age parents; it\u2019s older people who \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t have a stake, certainly we all should have a stake in our schools \u2014 but you get the feeling [that] this is a reaction to something that is not just \u201cmy child\u2019s schooling\u201d but this belief that they\u2019re losing the America they knew. That definitely precedes Obama.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The serious debate we should be having is being drowned out by right-wing nonsense, education expert tells Salon", "title": "Wingnuts\u2019 Common Core insanity: Newest, craziest attack on public schools yet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The serious debate we should be having is being drowned out by right-wing nonsense, education expert tells Salon", "title": "Wingnuts\u2019 Common Core insanity: Newest, craziest attack on public schools yet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/16/wingnuts_common_core_insanity_newest_craziest_attack_on_public_schools_yet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/glenn_beck.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The serious debate we should be having is being drowned out by right-wing nonsense, education expert tells Salon", "title": "Wingnuts\u2019 Common Core insanity: Newest, craziest attack on public schools yet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/glenn_beck.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Common Core, Diane Ravitch, Editor's Picks, Glenn Beck, Jeb Bush, Louis C.K., Maureen Costello, Mike Huckabee, Phyllis Schlafly, Rand Paul, Southern Poverty Law Center, The Common Core", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the South, this is the population that has been more likely to take their kids out of public schools, especially if those public schools are overwhelmingly African-American.\nTopics: Common Core, Diane Ravitch, Editor's Picks, Glenn Beck, Jeb Bush, Louis C.K., Maureen Costello, Mike Huckabee, Phyllis Schlafly, Rand Paul, Southern Poverty Law Center, The Common Core, News, Politics NewsComedian Louis C.K.\nWere the same people who were making absurd comments about the Common Core also previously the same people who were saying there shouldn\u2019t be public schools, or public schools should bring God back or whatever?\nThe most familiar one is Glenn Beck \u2026 I saw that he has a new book out against the Common Core.\nand public intellectual Diane Ravitch may be the most prominent critics of the Common Core, but they\u2019re hardly alone."}
