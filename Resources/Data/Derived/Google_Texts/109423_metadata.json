If they lose the legal battle, they have three options: \u2022 Sign a so-called \u201caccommodation\u201d form certifying they morally object to the coverage. This would enable the federal government to work with third parties to provide that coverage \u2014 a plan the dioceses argue would make them \u201ccomplicit\u201d actors against their beliefs. \u2022 Provide health plans without contraceptive coverage and pay $100 per beneficiary per day. In the Pittsburgh Diocese, which has 108 employees, the fee would amount to $10,800 per day, or $3.942 million a year. \u2022 Drop all health plans and pay $2,000 per employee per year after the first 30 employees.

Brandt of the Diocese of Greensburg, which is pursuing its own case against the federal health care mandate, said the so-called accommodation would \u201crequire the Catholic Church to be complicit in paying for contraceptive services, abortifacient drugs and sterilization procedures that are morally unacceptable under the tenants of our faith.\u201d\n\nSeparately, attorneys planned to file Friday a request for a similar reprieve for Geneva College, a private university in Beaver Falls affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church.\n\n\u201cWe're cautiously optimistic that Justice Alito will grant one to us as well,\u201d said Gregory Baylor of Alliance Defending Freedom, the Washington-based law firm representing Geneva College.\n\nThe religious groups will have until July to petition the Supreme Court to take up the case and issue a final ruling.\n\nNatasha Lindstrom is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Natasha Lindstrom", "description": "Two Western Pennsylvania dioceses won a minor legal victory over their refusal to notify insurers they will not provide coverage for birth control as mandated ...", "pubdate": "2015-04-17 09:15:00", "author": "Natasha Lindstrom", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "Two Western Pennsylvania dioceses won a minor legal victory over their refusal to notify insurers they will not provide coverage for birth control as mandated ...", "title": "Justice halts religious groups' birth control opt-out role", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-16 13:01:55.455", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/8192110-74/court-justice-religious", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two Western Pennsylvania dioceses won a minor legal victory over their refusal to notify insurers they will not provide coverage for birth control as mandated ...", "title": "Justice halts religious groups' birth control opt-out role", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "creator": "@triblive", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-17 09:15:00", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/8192110-74/court-justice-religious", "sailthru.title": "Justice halts religious groups' birth control opt-out role", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Pittsburgh Allegheny", "headline": "Justice halts religious groups' birth control opt-out role", "keywords": "court, coverage, dioceses, pittsburgh, accommodation", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2015-04-17 09:15:00", "subcategory": "Allegheny", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2015-04-17 09:15:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-16 13:01:55.455", "tag": "court, coverage, dioceses, pittsburgh, accommodation", "subsection": "Allegheny", "title": "Justice halts religious groups' birth control opt-out role", "author": "Natasha Lindstrom"}, "docauthor": "Natasha Lindstrom", "sailthru.description": "Two Western Pennsylvania dioceses won a minor legal victory over their refusal to notify insurers they will not provide coverage for birth control as mandated ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd274e\"", "article_summary": "Justice halts religious groups' birth control opt-out rolePotential penalties The dioceses of Pittsburgh, Greensburg and Erie and Geneva College, like many religious groups nationwide, are fighting the Affordable Care Act's mandate related to contraceptive or abortion-related coverage.\nIn the Pittsburgh Diocese, which has 108 employees, the fee would amount to $10,800 per day, or $3.942 million a year.\n\u2022 Drop all health plans and pay $2,000 per employee per year after the first 30 employees.\nBishop David Zubik of the Pittsburgh Diocese said the earlier 3rd U.S.\n\u2022 Provide health plans without contraceptive coverage and pay $100 per beneficiary per day."}
