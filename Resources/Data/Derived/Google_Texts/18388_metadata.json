Researchers are now testing a new way of doing biopsies.\n\nIt\u2019s called the liquid biopsy. Right now it\u2019s showing promise in detecting cancer DNA in a patient\u2019s blood.\n\nIn a traditional biopsy, a surgeon cuts out a piece of a patient\u2019s tumor, which can be invasive.\n\nThe hope is that the simple blood test can be as effective in screening for cancer. It could enable doctors to quickly determine if treatment is working and if it is, to continue monitoring in case the cancer develops resistance.\n\nDr. Jose Baselga, physician-in-chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said, \u201cThis could change forever the way we follow up not only response to treatments but also the emergence of resistance, and down the line could even be used for really early diagnosis.\u201d\n\nWhile early results are encouraging, researchers say the blood test needs to to be studied further. So far, there have only been small studies on certain cancers, including lung, colon and blood cancer.\n\nInformation from: Science Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blood test with the potential to find cancer.
