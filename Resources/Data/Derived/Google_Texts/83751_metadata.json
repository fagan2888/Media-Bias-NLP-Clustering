If the test results in the biopsy or removal of a growth, it is no longer a \u201cscreening\u201d test and patients can be charged co-insurance and/or a co-pay.\n\nThe Maine Colorectal Cancer Control Program provides no-cost screening services for residents who do not have health insurance and connects them with the resources they need to prevent, detect, and survive colon cancer. Eligibility guidelines include age, income, insurance status, and health history. If you think you, a family member or friend might be eligible to receive services through this program, call the Colon Screening Hotline at 1-877-320-6800.\n\nDebbie\u2019s story\n\nThat afternoon I got an email from a woman who ended up paying around $2000 for a colonoscopy she thought was a preventive test. Her insurance company said it wasn\u2019t and that she would be responsible for out-of-pocket costs. She thought it was important for people to hear what happened to her so they wouldn\u2019t find out the hard way, like she did.\n\nDebbie has ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects as many as 700,000 people in the United States. Because ulcerative colitis increases the risk of developing colon cancer, Debbie has to have a colonoscopy every two years. She\u2019s covered by her husband\u2019s health insurance and says that when she first started having colonoscopies, she never saw a bill.\n\nThat changed in 2010 when her husband got a new job and new health insurance. Debbie turned 50 that year \u2014 it\u2019s recommended that people get their first colonoscopy at age 50 and Debbie assumed hers would be considered preventive. \u201cI had called the insurance company,\u201d she explains, \u201cand was told I was fine for my preventive colonoscopy. I never thought ulcerative colitis would be an issue. I ended up paying $1500 toward the deductible and then 30% of the bill up to a certain amount. I didn\u2019t try to appeal because I was so upset and so angry that it caused a flare-up of my colitis. I was like, \u2018I cannot deal with this!'\u201d\n\nPreventive vs. diagnostic colonoscopy\n\nI asked Linda Riddell, a fellow Bangor Daily News blogger who covers health insurance issues about Debbie\u2019s predicament. She wrote this response on her Health Unsurance Blog:\n\n\u201cYou are bringing out a fine-print detail about the difference between preventive and diagnostic tests. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance has to cover preventive tests \u2013 including the colonoscopy for people age 50 to age 75 \u2013 without charging a co-pay. A test is \u201cpreventive\u201d if the patient has no symptoms of disease. The very same test can be \u201cdiagnostic\u201d if the patient has symptoms, or in your case, risk of disease.\n\nInsurers are not required to cover preventive (or \u201cscreening\u201d) colonoscopies more frequently than the United States Preventive Task Force recommends. Their guidelines suggest every 10 years for colonoscopies. So, while ulcerative colitis patients may need colonoscopies more frequently, the insurer does not have to cover it with no co-pay.\n\nYou can press the issue with the insurer, by appealing when they deny the claim or charge you the co-pay. Another thing that Health Reform requires is a three-level appeal process, with independent people reviewing your claim and your argument. See HHS\u2019s step-by-step process for appeals. It\u2019s possible that the review process could lead to better coverage of your tests.\u201d\n\nFour years later\n\nDebbie hasn\u2019t had another colonoscopy since 2010. She says she simply couldn\u2019t afford one. Her deductible is now $2500, but she\u2019s afraid to put off the test any longer, so is scheduled to have one in June. Getting Linda\u2019s information/link about how to go through the appeals process was helpful, because that\u2019s exactly what she plans to do this time.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t have another flare-up,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll probably try to put it through the appeals process and see what happens. I will try to do that if I can keep my wits about me. It\u2019s just such a process. Why is the person with a healthy intestine allowed to have this procedure with no cost to them, but the minute you\u2019re diagnosed with something, it\u2019s a whole different ballgame? We\u2019re the ones they should be allowing. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nDebbie says she\u2019ll let us know what happens \u2014 with her colonoscopy and with her appeal.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Catching Health", "description": "Two weeks ago on the\u00a0WCSH6 Morning Report,\u00a0I talked about the importance of early detection of colorectal cancer and shared some information about insurance coverage for screening tests: The\u00a0Affordable Care Act\u00a0requires that all private health plans cover colorectal cancer screening tests as a preventive service without any out-of-pocket costs to patients, even if polyps are detected \u2026", "title": "Insurance coverage for a colonoscopy: Be sure to read the fine print - Catching Health", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/135/files/2014/01/Irritable-bowel.jpg?strip=all", "url": "http://catchinghealth.bangordailynews.com/2014/03/24/im-not-your-mother-but/insurance-coverage-for-a-colonoscopy-be-sure-to-read-the-fine-print/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/135/files/2014/01/Irritable-bowel.jpg?strip=all", "creator": "@CatchingHealth", "description": "Two weeks ago on the\u00a0WCSH6 Morning Report,\u00a0I talked about the importance of early detection of colorectal cancer and shared some information about insurance coverage for screening tests: The\u00a0Affordable Care Act\u00a0requires that all private health plans cover colorectal cancer screening tests as a preventive service without any out-of-pocket costs to patients, even if polyps are detected [\u2026]", "card": "summary", "title": "Insurance coverage for a colonoscopy: Be sure to read the fine print - Catching Health"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 5800548, "app_id": 169032116512887}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "135.3857"}}, "article": {"section": "I'm Not Your Mother, But", "tag": "ulcerative colitis", "published_time": "2014-03-24T12:02:12+00:00", "author": "CatchingHealthwithDianeAtwood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8808\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI had called the insurance company,\u201d she explains, \u201cand was told I was fine for my preventive colonoscopy.\nShe\u2019s covered by her husband\u2019s health insurance and says that when she first started having colonoscopies, she never saw a bill.\nFor people on Medicare, the deductible will be waived for colorectal cancer screening tests even when polyps are detected and removed.\nDebbie has ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects as many as 700,000 people in the United States.\nThat changed in 2010 when her husband got a new job and new health insurance."}
