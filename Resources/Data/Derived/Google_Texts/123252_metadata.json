(REUTERS/Mike Segar)\n\n4207736\n\nThe Obama administration is trying to revamp HealthCare.gov yet again, but while the consumer-facing portions of the site will get an update, the back-end construction is running behind schedule again.\n\nThe federal government is hoping to get the website working for customers in time for the next open enrollment period, which has been delayed a month until Nov. 15, hoping to avoid another breakdown akin to the Obamacare exchange\u2019s initial launch last fall.

Contractors are most worried about this part of the revamp.\n\n\u201cMy opinion, no way they can do that before the next open enrollment,\u201d one senior official at a government contractor told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cTune and tweak? Yes. Replace? No way.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance industry officials told the WSJ that coverage renewals \u2014 a different and, hopefully, simpler process than signing up for coverage for the first time \u2014 are a particular concern for health plans. It\u2019s one of the few HealthCare.gov functions that wasn\u2019t attempted in the website\u2019s disastrous debut.\n\nBut while new contractors and a team of top Silicon Valley executives is tackling much of HealthCare.gov\u2019s makeover, the time limits for the website\u2019s back-end operations are pressing. The Obama administration gave up on constructing the portion of the website which consumers don\u2019t see during Obamacare\u2019s first open enrollment period and workers are already behind the delayed-schedule for getting it up and running.\n\nBack-end operations include communications between the federal government and insurance companies participating in the exchange, for one. Communicating correct and complete enrollment information between CMS, insurers and state governments has continued to be a struggle.

The income verification system, which would have sorted out discrepancies before doling out subsidies, was delayed last July and still hasn\u2019t been built.\n\nThe automatic function for paying subsidies to insurance companies has also been delayed. After federal officials failed to complete the payment system before the October HealthCare.gov launch, they scheduled its launch for mid-March; now the administration hopes to have it functional in 2015.\n\nApart from the HealthCare.gov individual exchange, the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP exchange, was fully delayed last year, and the Obama administration plans to launch Nov. 15. Many state-run SHOP exchanges are requesting an additional year\u2019s delay from the Obama administration.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "The Obama administration is trying to revamp HealthCare.gov yet again, but while the consumer-facing portions of the site will get an update, the back-end", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration is trying to revamp HealthCare.gov yet again, but while the consumer-facing portions of the site will get an update, the back-end construction is running behind schedule again", "title": "HealthCare.gov Getting A Makeover While Back-End Construction Is Behind", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/06/healthcare-gov-getting-a-makeover-while-back-end-construction-is-behind/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-05T212347Z_1_CBREA241NFQ00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1445292463933.jpg", "height": 513}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'My opinion, no way they can do that before the next open enrollment'", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/06/healthcare-gov-getting-a-makeover-while-back-end-construction-is-behind/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-05T212347Z_1_CBREA241NFQ00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1445292463933.jpg"}, "title": "HealthCare.gov Getting A Makeover While Back-End Construction Is Behind Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-06 13:32:18", "sailthru.title": "HealthCare.gov Getting A Makeover While Back-End Construction Is Behind", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "healthcare.gov,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "healthcare-gov,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration is trying to revamp HealthCare.gov yet again, but while the consumer-facing portions of the site will get an update, the back-end construction is running behind schedule again", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-05T212347Z_1_CBREA241NFQ00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1445292463933.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0443\"", "article_summary": "(REUTERS/Mike Segar)4207736The Obama administration is trying to revamp HealthCare.gov yet again, but while the consumer-facing portions of the site will get an update, the back-end construction is running behind schedule again.\nMany state-run SHOP exchanges are requesting an additional year\u2019s delay from the Obama administration.\nA man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this October 2, 2013 photo illustration.\nAfter federal officials failed to complete the payment system before the October HealthCare.gov launch, they scheduled its launch for mid-March; now the administration hopes to have it functional in 2015.\nApart from the HealthCare.gov individual exchange, the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP exchange, was fully delayed last year, and the Obama administration plans to launch Nov. 15."}
