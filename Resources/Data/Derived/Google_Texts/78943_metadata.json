The audacious bin Laden raid in Pakistan had been a success but also preying on his mind was the failed 1980 Delta Force operation to rescue American hostages in Tehran. Sandstorms and mechanical troubles led the mission to be abandoned and eight American troops were killed when two aircraft collided. The debacle cast a shadow over Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency.\n\nHowever, it also seems worth noting that the eventual timing of the mission may have made for a nice July 4th weekend announcement for Obama had the mission succeeded. Instead, Obama played golf on July 5th, as well as an additional six times in the month he is said to have spent agonizing over his decision, the delay of which may have cost journalist Foley his life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to a new Sunday Times report by Toby Harden,", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "According to a new Sunday Times report by Toby Harden,", "title": "Report: Obama Delayed James Foley Rescue a Month, Fretting over His Image and Golfing - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-golf-cart-laugh-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/blog/2014/08/24/obama-fretted-over-his-image-and-golfed-while-foley-languished-for-a-month/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to a new Sunday Times report by Toby Harden,", "title": "Report: Obama Delayed James Foley Rescue a Month, Fretting over His Image and Golfing - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Barack-and-Michelle/obama-golf-cart-laugh-ap.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Pakistan, Syria,The Conversation,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "The Conversation", "tag": "Syria", "published_time": "2014-08-24T11:44:00-07:00", "categories": "The Conversation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaff2\"", "article_summary": "Sandstorms and mechanical troubles led the mission to be abandoned and eight American troops were killed when two aircraft collided.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFor President Barack Obama the decision to send in the Night Stalkers was an agonising one.\nHowever, it also seems worth noting that the eventual timing of the mission may have made for a nice July 4th weekend announcement for Obama had the mission succeeded.\nInstead, Obama played golf on July 5th, as well as an additional six times in the month he is said to have spent agonizing over his decision, the delay of which may have cost journalist Foley his life.\nThe audacious bin Laden raid in Pakistan had been a success but also preying on his mind was the failed 1980 Delta Force operation to rescue American hostages in Tehran."}
