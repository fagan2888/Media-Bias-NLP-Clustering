What do you do with your 3D printed scraps and junk? When an object doesn\u2019t print correctly or when an object just simply is not wanted or needed any longer, where do they eventually end up? Most likely they get tossed in a the trashcan, and end up in a landfill for the next 500 years before the earth reclaims them. That filament that you paid $40/roll for becomes wasted money.\n\nOne 15-year-old boy, named Grayson Galisky, has taken it upon himself to make 3D printing more ecologically friendly, and affordable.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to create a recycling program to recycle 3D printer waste back into usable filament,\u201d Galisky explains. \u201cFilament is in a sense, 3D printer \u2018ink\u2019 or what a 3D printer uses to print with. Every day 3D printers around the world have failed prints, and this plastic is thrown away. What if I could change that? I realized through Kickstarter this could be more than just a goal, it could be real.\u201d\n\nGalisky plans on launching a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for his projet sometime within the next month or so. His project will not only recycle old \u201ctrash\u201d prints, but he will also create some very unique looking \u2018multicolor 3D priner filament\u2019.\n\nGalisky has a 3D printer in his home, as well as access to 3D printing at his high school. After learning about and using this technology for close to a year, he realized that something needed to be done. \u201cThe idea of recycling struck me when I saw a Kickstarter about machines that could create filament, and I wondered if I could recycle failed prints from my school\u2019s 3D printer,\u201d he explained.\n\nIf his Kickstarter campaign is successful, Galisky plans on opening a filament recycling store, where he will provide several recycling services, including the following options to customers:\n\nOption 1: Allows people to donate their scrap plastic.\n\nOption 2: Allows people to send their scrap plastic in, and for every 2kg sent in, they will be sent 1kg of recycled filament free of charge.\n\nOption 3: Allows people to send in their scrap plastic in exchange for having it ground up and returned to them.\n\nGalisky guarantees that the returned filament will be useable in all FDM 3D printers, and plans to make his pricing opions as low as possible for those simply looking to purchase his recycled filament, including his multicolored options.\n\nThe Kickstarter goal will be set at $4,999, and backers will be rewarded with things ranging from a personalized thank you card, to large quantities of recycled multicolor or solid color filament.\n\nWhat do you think? Will you be contributing to Galisky\u2019s Kickstarter campaign?
