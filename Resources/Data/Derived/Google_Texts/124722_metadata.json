Cuomo has tamed the Medicaid beast.\n\nSucceeding where many predecessors crashed and burned, Cuomo has brought spending on the $50-plus-billion health plan for the poor and disabled down to consistently manageable levels \u2014 without touching benefits or trashing the quality of care.\n\nHe pulled that off even as the program added 1.5 million enrollees under Obamacare. He also did it with none of the epic battles against hospitals and health-care unions that paralyzed the Legislature under past governors.\n\nBy contrast, Cuomo\u2019s budget for Medicaid \u2014 the second-costliest line item on Albany\u2019s plate, after school aid \u2014 sailed to approval last week with hardly a word of debate, let alone protest.\n\nAs veterans of the Medicaid wars of the \u201980s, \u201990s, and 2000s could tell you, this is a very big deal.\n\n\u201cI personally think that of this governor\u2019s greatest accomplishments . . . certainly health care has got to be right up there at the top or darn near the top,\u201d said Kenneth Raske of the Greater New York Hospital Association.\n\nFew things the state does are more important. Medicaid provides basic health coverage for almost one out of every four New Yorkers \u2014 including not only families on welfare, but also the working poor, the mentally ill, the drug-addicted, the developmentally disabled and the elderly in need of long-term care.\n\nIt\u2019s also a major source of revenue for many of the hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, doctors and other providers that all New Yorkers depend on.\n\nYet for decades , Medicaid costs were perennially spiraling at two or three times the inflation rate. Governors were constantly demanding cuts. Industry lobbyists \u2014 Raske chief among them \u2014 would warn of devastating consequences for vulnerable patients. The Legislature would approve half-measures and temporary fixes. And the cycle would repeat.\n\nCuomo managed to turn things around in his very first year, 2011 \u2014 with a solution that, contrary to his usual hard-charging style, relied mostly on collaboration rather than confrontation.\n\nFaced with a $10 billion deficit, he started by calling for capping annual growth of the program based on the medical inflation rate. The brain-dead \u201cinflation factors\u201d written into law, which automatically increased fees whether the state could afford it or not, were wiped from the books.\n\nBut instead of dictating how the program would cut costs, Cuomo invited Raske and other industry representatives to do the job for him as members of a Medicaid Redesign Team.\n\nThe offer came with a warning: If the team failed to find enough savings, the health commissioner would be endowed with \u201csuperpowers\u201d to cut as he saw fit.\n\nThe industry and the Legislature accepted the plan \u2014 and Cuomo\u2019s gamble paid off. The panel came up with reforms that met or beat the savings target that first year, and every year since.\n\nThe chief strategy has been to move as much of Medicaid as possible into managed care \u2014 including formerly exempt groups, such as nursing home patients and the mentally ill, and benefits that were formerly carved out, such as prescription drugs and home health aides.\n\nThe managed care plans have not only squeezed millions in waste and fraud out of the system, but also a lot of the politics. Providers who think they\u2019re being short-changed used to run to the Legislature with their complaints. Now, they haggle with HMO administrators.\n\nOther reforms smartly spent money to save money \u2014 such as a program that provides supported housing to certainly chronically ill patients, stabilizing their health to help them avoid costly hospital stays.\n\nLest anyone suspect the savings are the result of smoke-and-mirrors accounting, Controller Tom DiNapoli \u2014 no big Cuomo fan \u2014 recently certified the results as real. His auditors found that Medicaid\u2019s annual spending increases from 2010 to 2013 averaged just 1.7% \u2014 down from 5.3% for the previous decade.\n\nThat translates into billions in savings \u2014 enabling Cuomo keep overall state spending in check, avoid tax hikes and make new investments, such as Mayor de Blasio\u2019s universal pre-K. It also gave Washington confidence to approve $8 billion in extra Medicaid funding.\n\nThe job is not finished. New York still spends more on Medicaid than California and Texas combined. But Cuomo has put the program on a healthier and more sustainable track.\n\nCuomo rarely includes the Medicaid turnaround on his list of accomplishments, perhaps because it lacks the high drama of other victories. He should. Sometimes the biggest successes are also the quietest.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Bill Hammond", "twitter": {"description": "Five years into his term as New York\u2019s chief executive, it\u2019s time to give credit where credit is due: Gov.", "title": "Bill Hammond: Cuomo\u2019s quiet Medicaid miracle", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-hammond-cuomo-quiet-medicaid-miracle-article-1.2176873", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176872.1428448099!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hammond8e-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "andrew cuomo, medicaid, new york medicaid,", "parsely-author": "Bill Hammond", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "andrew cuomo, medicaid, new york medicaid,", "nydn_tags": "andrew cuomo", "news_keywords": "andrew cuomo, medicaid, new york medicaid,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-hammond-cuomo-quiet-medicaid-miracle-article-1.2176873", "parsely-title": "Bill Hammond: Cuomo\u2019s quiet Medicaid miracle", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-08T05:00:51-0400", "sailthru.title": "Bill Hammond: Cuomo\u2019s quiet Medicaid miracle", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-08T09:00:51", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176872.1428448099!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hammond8e-1-web.jpg", "description": "Five years into his term as New York\u2019s chief executive, it\u2019s time to give credit where credit is due: Gov.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Five years into his term as New York\u2019s chief executive, it\u2019s time to give credit where credit is due: Gov.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Five years into his term as New York\u2019s chief executive, it\u2019s time to give credit where credit is due: Gov.", "title": "Bill Hammond: Cuomo\u2019s quiet Medicaid miracle", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-hammond-cuomo-quiet-medicaid-miracle-article-1.2176873", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176872.1428448099!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hammond8e-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "andrew cuomo", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Bill Hammond", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2176872.1428448099!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hammond8e-1-web.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4153\"", "article_summary": "Cuomo rarely includes the Medicaid turnaround on his list of accomplishments, perhaps because it lacks the high drama of other victories.\nAs veterans of the Medicaid wars of the \u201980s, \u201990s, and 2000s could tell you, this is a very big deal.\nBy contrast, Cuomo\u2019s budget for Medicaid \u2014 the second-costliest line item on Albany\u2019s plate, after school aid \u2014 sailed to approval last week with hardly a word of debate, let alone protest.\nThat translates into billions in savings \u2014 enabling Cuomo keep overall state spending in check, avoid tax hikes and make new investments, such as Mayor de Blasio\u2019s universal pre-K.\nYet for decades , Medicaid costs were perennially spiraling at two or three times the inflation rate."}
