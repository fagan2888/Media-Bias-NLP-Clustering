Though older generations have always complained about youngsters being in trouble, this animus towards Millennials seems rather unique, especially because, well, Millennials are rather unique.\n\nThey are the first generation to grow up in the digital era, and technology has advanced at breakneck speeds during their lifetimes. Older Millennials were just children when the internet was in its infancy, and have grown up with it, from AOL to Myspace to Facebook and the iPhone. It is the first generation that cannot imagine a time when there was no internet or GPS or cell phones to assist you in everyday life. (Certain Seinfeld episodes may even confuse younger Millennials, as they revolve around characters trying to find each other without cell phones or any other digital technologies.) The Millennial generation is also the generation that received those much-lamented participation trophies, and has apparently been so coddled by their parents and teachers and guidance counselors that they simply are \u201cnot ready for the real world,\u201d which involves rejection and tough breaks.\n\nWith all that hate, it\u2019s easy to forget sometimes that the Millennial generation is also the one that faces staggering levels of debt, a bleak job market (even when one does get a college degree, which has become ever more important), and the overall prospect of having a less prosperous future than one\u2019s parents. While today\u2019s 18 to 34 year olds are the best-educated generation in American history \u2014 22.3 percent with a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 they also have lower median earnings (inflation adjusted) than 18 to 34 year olds did in 1980, when just 15.7 percent had a bachelor\u2019s degree. Furthermore, becoming the best-educated generation has made Millennials the most indebted generation. Back in 1993, while the oldest Millennials were busy playing Sega Genesis, the average debt per borrower in the graduating class was under $10,000; by 2015, that number had more than tripled to about $35,000 \u2014 earning the class of 2015 the honor of being the most indebted ever.\n\nEven worse, choosing to avoid higher education and all the debt that comes with it makes one\u2019s future prospects that much worse. The unemployment rate for high school graduates aged 25 to 32, for example, is about three times that of those with bachelor degrees. The rate of high school graduates living in poverty is likewise high, at 21.8 percent, compared to 5.8 percent for those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more.\n\nA lot of the aforementioned Millennial critics tend to be particularly critical of political correctness in higher education. But political correctness is hardly the biggest problem in academia. Over the past few decades, higher education has been almost completely corporatized. As retired Adjunct Professor Joseph A. Domino puts it in The Huffington Post, there has been a \u201cWalmartization\u201d of our colleges and universities.\n\nIn plain English, college has gone from being a place where young adults go to learn how to think critically and question things \u2014 including authority \u2014 to a place where young adults go to find careers and monetary success (which explains why \u201cbusiness\u201d is the #1 degree). In the process, universities seem to have shifted their focus towards everything but education in the hopes of attracting students from wealthy backgrounds. Sports arenas, food courts, athletic facilities, and an army of bureaucratic administrators to go along with it. \u201cThese amenities are extremely expensive and contribute to the escalating cost of college,\u201d said former Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, in a recent interview with U.S. News & World Report. \u201cMoreover, they have very little or anything to do with the education of most young people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, salaries for top administrators increased by 39 percent from 2000 to 2010, while full-time professors saw their salaries grow by just 19 percent. And between 1978 and 2014, administrative positions rose by 369 percent, while full-time tenure and tenure-track appointments increased by just 23 percent. In a recent survey done by the Chronicle of Higher Education, it was found that 32 private university presidents earned $1 million or more in 2013, while many professors had unlivable wages. It\u2019s not just our fast-food workers who struggle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The newest generation of adults are demonized by older generations, all the while suffering our brave new world", "title": "Millennials have gotten royally screwed: That\u2019s why they\u2019re voting for Bernie Sanders", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The newest generation of adults are demonized by older generations, all the while suffering our brave new world", "title": "Millennials have gotten royally screwed: That\u2019s why they\u2019re voting for Bernie Sanders", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/21/millennials_have_gotten_royally_screwed_thats_why_theyre_voting_for_bernie_sanders/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/bernie_sanders23.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The newest generation of adults are demonized by older generations, all the while suffering our brave new world", "title": "Millennials have gotten royally screwed: That\u2019s why they\u2019re voting for Bernie Sanders", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/bernie_sanders23.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Conor Lynch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Elections 2016, millennials, The Democratic Primary, the economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Even worse, choosing to avoid higher education and all the debt that comes with it makes one\u2019s future prospects that much worse.\nOver the past few decades, higher education has been almost completely corporatized.\nA lot of the aforementioned Millennial critics tend to be particularly critical of political correctness in higher education.\nThough older generations have always complained about youngsters being in trouble, this animus towards Millennials seems rather unique, especially because, well, Millennials are rather unique.\nFurthermore, becoming the best-educated generation has made Millennials the most indebted generation."}
