A Business Guide to What’s Next in Healthcare

Medicine is changing, and the way doctors provide care has to transform immediately or the insurance industry will dictate how everything is done in the very near future, if it hasn’t already,” predicts Kathleen Kozak, an internal medicine physician at Straub Clinic and Hospital and the host of The Body Show on Hawaii Public Radio.

Kozak will emcee the “Healthcare Summit 2016: The Future of Health in the Workplace” on March 31.

“Attendees will learn about the latest technology at the various medical centers and where it’s headed,” she explains, “the latest guidelines for the Affordable Care Act and how this will change what tests doctors order and which ones insurance will cover, and whether employee wellness programs actually work.”

The Chamber of Commerce Hawaii is organizing the event because healthcare is a key issue for its members, says Sherry Menor-McNamara, president and CEO of COCH. “We felt … it was important for our members to understand the current and future role of ACA, as well as the future of health in the workplace.”

“The rules keep changing,” says Dianne Winter Brookins, director of the law firm Alston Hunt Floyd and Ing, one of the summit’s sponsors. “It’s rare for so many high-level people to be together, and it will be a great opportunity to learn and ask questions of some prominent people in the healthcare system.”
