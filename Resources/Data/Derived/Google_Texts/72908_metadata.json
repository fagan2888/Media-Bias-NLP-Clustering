Afzal compared it to a prism that works in reverse. Whereas a prism takes light and fractures it into beams of different colors, a fiber laser merges several beams into one.\n\nMoreover, Lockheed Martin has developed a way to adjust a laser weapon\u2019s output by adding modules, allowing it to be tailored for missions or threats.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\nThe company is under contract to deliver a 60-kilowatt fiber laser to the Pentagon next year. \u201cThe Army has the option to add more modules and increase power from 60kW to 120kW as a result of the laser\u2019s modularity,\u201d the company said in a press release.\n\n\u201cBecause the laser is so electrically efficient, the laser weapon will be smaller than previous technologies,\u201d said Afzal.\n\nThose efficiency gains could make it suitable for jets. The company faces competition from rival General Atomics, which has already delivered a 150-kilowatt solid-state laser to the Pentagon for testing and is looking into mounting one on the company\u2019s Predator C drone.\n\nThe Air Force has recently become more bold in its predictions that a laser could be airborne by 2020. For instance, the Missile Defense Agency recently announced that they wererevamping the Airborne Laser Program that was shuttered in 2012. The goal is to fly an airborne laser demonstrator in 2021.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks you have a tendency to talk about high-powered microwaves and lasers and it\u2019s kind of science fiction,\u201d Air Combat Command leader Gen. Herbert Carlisle, the leader of Air Combat Command, said at the recent Air Force Association Air and Space Conference. \u201cBut this is a reality. \u2026 I believe that we will have a directed energy capability in a pod that can be mounted on a fighter aircraft very soon.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pentagon Turns to F-22 Raptor to Counter Russia in Europe\n\nAfzal cautioned that an F-35 laser was currently mostly a topic of interest and discussion within the company.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re looking at the concepts. How would a system even go into the F-35? And we\u2019re also looking into the utility and doing models and calculations to see the utility,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Air Force officials have hinted that they\u2019re interested in putting a laser on the jet, although other have noted that such a weapon would primarily be intended to protect a plane from enemy aircraft \u2014 something the F-35\u2019s stealth features are already supposed to do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly talking to the Air Force about their plans, their roadmap, for developing laser weapons for F-35 and other platforms. We would want to do that in partnership with the Air Force,\u201d said Iain Mckinnie, business development lead for Laser Sensors and Systems, Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Defense One.\n\nRead more from Defense One:\n\nMeet the Man Reinventing CIA for the Big Data Era\n\nU.S. Commander in Afghanistan: Now Is Not the Time to Leave\n\nNew Pentagon Equipment Is No Longer Pushing the Envelope", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lockheed Martin\u2019s new modular fiber lasers now\u00a0convert fully 40 percent of inpu", "title": "What\u2019s Next for the F-35: Laser Weapons", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/07/What-s-Next-F-35-Lasers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/07/What-s-Next-F-35-Lasers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Lockheed Martin\u2019s new modular fiber lasers now\u00a0convert fully 40 percent of inpu", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re certainly talking to the Air Force about their plans, their roadmap, for developing laser weapons for F-35 and other platforms.\n\u201cBecause the laser is so electrically efficient, the laser weapon will be smaller than previous technologies,\u201d said Afzal.\nUnlike solid-state bulk lasers that rely on crystal components, or powerful but unstable chemical lasers, fiber lasers generate their beams inside fiber optics, making the device more flexible and efficient.\nMoreover, Lockheed Martin has developed a way to adjust a laser weapon\u2019s output by adding modules, allowing it to be tailored for missions or threats.\nWhereas a prism takes light and fractures it into beams of different colors, a fiber laser merges several beams into one."}
