Accenture later assisted with the small-business exchange options and states that switched to using the federal marketplace.\n\nSEE ALSO: It cost Dems the 2014 elections, but Sebelius has few Obamacare regrets\n\n\u201cOur work in all of these areas will continue under the new contract, as we continuously enhance the capability supporting citizens, issuers and CMS \u2014 focused on simplifying and streamlining the customer experience,\u201d said Matt Tait, a senior managing director in charge of Accenture\u2019s role in the exchange project.\n\nA CMS spokesman said the contract went through an open and competitive selection process and is structured in a way that rewards performance.\n\n\u201cAccenture has been an essential member of our team as we focused on delivering a positive consumer experience through HealthCare.gov,\u201d CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in the company\u2019s new release. \u201cWe are pleased that Accenture will continue to support HealthCare.gov, as we work together to help millions of Americans sign up for quality, affordable health insurance.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Obamacare enrollment on federal exchange reaches nearly 6.4M\n\nThe deal signals a long-term commitment by the administration to the company, which said it \u201cmobilized\u201d 500 people in six weeks to enhance HealthCare.gov at the start of the year, when the administration needed to salvage its first-ever enrollment period.\n\nHealthCare.gov had crashed due to software and capacity issues upon its launch in October of last year, and CGI Federal and other vendors that worked on the project told Congress that the administration seemed to have assembled a flawed puzzle from the intact pieces they provided.\n\nThe administration pushed back with criticism of its own and decided not to stick with CGI \u2014 it\u2019s contract was set to run out in February \u2014 and bring on Accenture.\n\nHealthCare.gov\u2019s technological turnaround resulted in enough sign-ups for the White House to declare victory in the first major test of the contentious law.\n\nThe ordeal took its toll on public perception of the law, however, and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius resigned after enrollment closed in April, making way for current Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n\nMonday\u2019s contract announcement comes midway through the health care law\u2019s second enrollment period. So far, sign-ups have not been hampered by the type of glitches that affected the first sign-up season.\n\nAdministration officials have reported that 6.4 million new and returning customers had selected coverage for 2015 on the federal portal, which serves 37 states, as of Dec. 19. The tally puts the administration well on its way to its own target of 9.1 million customers, although its projection is far short of congressional budget estimates that projected 13 million enrollees for 2015.\n\nThe 6.4 million figure is expected to spike significantly when the administration this week releases enrollment figures that include sign-ups among the exchanges runs by 13 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn announcing the new contract, Accenture boasted that its efforts had helped to create \u201ca successful launch\u201d of the current enrollment season, which ends Feb. 15.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate CMS\u2018 recognition of our hard work and solid results we delivered over the last year to improve HealthCare.gov,\u201d said David Moskovitz, chief executive of Accenture Federal Services.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration has awarded Accenture &mdash; the technology company that swooped in to help revive HealthCare.gov at the start of this year &mdash; a five-year, $563 million contract to continue its work on the federal Obamacare exchange, the company said Monday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration has awarded Accenture \u2014 the technology company that swooped in to help revive HealthCare.gov at the start of this year \u2014 a five-year, $563 million contract to continue its work on the federal Obamacare exchange, the company said Monday.", "title": "Accenture wins $563M contract to run HealthCare.gov", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/29/accenture-wins-563m-contract-to-run-healthcaregov/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/19/9e916a3887ac31205d0f6a706700e54a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/19/9e916a3887ac31205d0f6a706700e54a.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration has awarded Accenture &mdash; the technology company that swooped in to help revive HealthCare.gov at the start of this year &mdash; a five-year, $563 million contract to cont", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Accenture wins $563M contract to run HealthCare.gov"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Politics, Accenture, Barack Obama, Medicaid Services"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8b7\"", "article_summary": "In announcing the new contract, Accenture boasted that its efforts had helped to create \u201ca successful launch\u201d of the current enrollment season, which ends Feb. 15.\n\u201cWe appreciate CMS\u2018 recognition of our hard work and solid results we delivered over the last year to improve HealthCare.gov,\u201d said David Moskovitz, chief executive of Accenture Federal Services.\nReeling from a disastrous rollout of the federal website, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in January dropped a key contractor on the project, CGI Federal, and selected Accenture Federal Services to rehabilitate and build out the portal.\n\u201cAccenture has been an essential member of our team as we focused on delivering a positive consumer experience through HealthCare.gov,\u201d CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in the company\u2019s new release.\nThe administration pushed back with criticism of its own and decided not to stick with CGI \u2014 it\u2019s contract was set to run out in February \u2014 and bring on Accenture."}
