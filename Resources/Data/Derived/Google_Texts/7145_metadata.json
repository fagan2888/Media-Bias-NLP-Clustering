I have been traveling through the Deep South and especially Mississippi for years. As many have said before me, \"You cannot understand American history without understanding the South\", and through my many visits I feel I have at least begun to understand what the South was and is.\n\n\n\nWhen I first told my Northern liberal friends that my wife and I were going to Mississippi for vacation, I got more than the usual quizzical stares. \"You shouldn't do that\", they said. I was going into the maw of the beast and my visits legitimized an eternally racist, ignorant, and backward society. I was, in other words, a traitor.\n\nMy wife was told to remove the cotton plant from her desk at the office because it was racist and oppressive, a reminder of the chains of slavery.\n\nPhotographs of meticulously restored antebellum houses were off-limits. How could I have stayed in those symbols of a brutal Southern past?\n\nThe more I stayed in those wonderful houses, of course, the more I learned.\n\nIn one, I read the plantation logs and journals of the original owner. What I had read in Time on the Cross (the economics of slavery) became real, immediate, and instructional. I could see what this particular slave owner had spent on his slaves (food, shelter, clothes, health care, etc.) and what was his return.\n\nAlong the way I stopped in eateries, antique stores, gas stations, police stations, and fire houses. People were always willing to talk, and old folk went on and on about the way it was. I didn't bring up civil rights, nor did they, and as a result I heard about the regular, ordinary life of small Southern towns.\n\nSoutherners themselves say that they have an inferiority complex and are very welcoming to Northerners who seem to take a genuine, non-judgmental interest in their lives and their history.\n\nOn more than one occasion, I would be asked by a curious passers-by in out-of-the way places in Mississippi, \"What on earth are you doing here?\". In other words, why would a Northerner, of all people, voluntarily visit the South. Northerners, when hearing of my sojourns in Mississippi were no different and would always ask, \"Do you have family there?\" - the only possible reason for visiting such a benighted place.\n\nAfter these many years and a lot of Southern history (if you haven't already, I would suggest Eric Foner's work on Reconstruction, the best of the lot [JF note: Yes, I have, and agree]), I have begun to understand Southern resentment, conservative politics, and the cultural distinctness of the region.\n\nNot only is Mississippi on the bottom of the all socio-economic indicators, is is the most fundamentalist of any state. Dismissal of evolution and acceptance of the Bible as the literal word of God are common.\n\nConservative politics are easier to understand if observed through this lens.\n\nI return to Columbus every year for at least two months, and I am now on the board of the fledgling Tennessee Williams Foundation. [JF note: Williams was born in downtown Columbus, and his birth house is now a museum.] I have taught literature at Mississippi University for Women, helped produce the yearly performances of Williams by the Tennessee Williams Tribute, and write for a local paper.\n\nMost importantly I have made many friends - many I would never have met back home. I keep intending to write the stories of many of my local heroes who despite everything - poverty, prison, backwoods upbringing - keep working and working hard. Their refusal to take 'government handouts' is not political, but personal.\n\nI have been looking for [Mississippi] success stories for years and maybe with Severstal, Yokahama, the Air Force Base, the W, Eastern Mississippi Community College, and Tennessee Williams there is at least some hope for a better future. I have seen too many Mississippi towns die a sorry death, and I want Columbus to thrive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The regional differences, and similarities, in the long struggle to come to terms with racial injustice in the United States.", "author": "James Fallows", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The regional differences, and similarities, in the long struggle to come to terms with racial injustice in the United States.", "title": "Reparations, from Minnesota to Mississippi", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/06/DuluthLynch/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/reparations-from-minnesota-to-mississippi/373340/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb539\"", "article_summary": "I have been looking for [Mississippi] success stories for years and maybe with Severstal, Yokahama, the Air Force Base, the W, Eastern Mississippi Community College, and Tennessee Williams there is at least some hope for a better future.\nI have taught literature at Mississippi University for Women, helped produce the yearly performances of Williams by the Tennessee Williams Tribute, and write for a local paper.\nRonald Parlato, who now lives in DC, writes:I've been reading your articles about Columbus and the Golden Triangle of Mississippi with great interest.\nI have been traveling through the Deep South and especially Mississippi for years.\nI have seen too many Mississippi towns die a sorry death, and I want Columbus to thrive."}
