Miscavige, \u201cstar\u201d of Going Clear, was her boss. She got her start in the Dallas org, but left in 1987, after which she got tangled up in litigation with Scientology.\n\nHere, from 1992, is an affidavit she gave in Dallas County in which she detailed some of what she saw during her time there. An excerpt:\n\nTo my certain knowledge, David Miscavige conceived, planned and ordered the implementation of the basic strategic and tactical actions of the church against those whom he considered to be causing legal or public relations conflicts against any church or against his personal and absolute control of Scientology. He also ordered the allocation of and made available funding for the financing of these actions, which included the declaring of those whom he considered to be his \u201cenemies\u2019 as Suppressive Persons, the implementation of the policies known as \u201cFair Game\u201d against these persons once so declared, the infiltration of private and governmental environments which he deemed hostile to his absolute control over Scientology, the organization of vigilante groups within the organizations of Scientology to be used against those individuals whom he deemed to be his enemies.\n\nWord is she and her husband Richard settled their own litigation with the organization, recanted their disparaging testimony and opened a private-detective agency here. We\u2019re looking for her. Maybe she\u2019ll find us?\n\nOriginal post at 5:55 a.m. March 28: Sunday at 7 p.m. Dallas time HBO will air Academy Award-winning director Alex Gibney\u2019s Going Clear, his Scientology documentary based on the book by Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Famer Lawrence Wright, who\u2019s chief among the talking heads talking the longest and loudest in the film. Maybe you\u2019ve read the book; really, you should. Or maybe you played along last year, when it was our summer-reading selection. Or, maybe, everything you know about Scientology comes from Tom Cruise. Or perhaps you just drove by the old Celebrity Centre in East Dallas that one time.\n\nChris Vognar and I reviewed Going Clear for this week\u2019s \u201cReel Genius\u201d video chitchat, which you\u2019ll find below. (And here, just because, is the Scientologists\u2019 review.) By way of prep, I was curious: How deep are Scientology\u2019s roots in Dallas? Pretty, pretty, pretty deep, turns out. They date all the way back to Scientology\u2019s genesis.\n\nAccording to The Dallas Morning News\u2018 archives, the first references to Scientology appeared in this newspaper on April 14, 1956: \u201cNew Church to Form Organization in Dallas.\u201d The timing\u2019s certainly right. That was the year L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought was published. It\u2019s also the year Scientology was granted tax-exempt status and first considered a religion by the Internal Revenue Service. (Going Clear, the book and movie, are determined to get that status tossed.)\n\nAt the time members met at the downtown Dallas YMCA. And in short order, Scientology was deemed nothing more than the practice of \u201cquacks,\u201d per the Dallas Better Business Bureau; read the 1963 story below about Dianetics and other \u201cmenaces.\u201d In 1969 \u2014 or, just four years after Lawrence Wright graduated from Woodrow \u2014 this paper even ran a highly critical series about Scientology. Even now it feels remarkably of-the-moment, explaining the E-meters and auditors at the heart of Wright and Gibney\u2019s tale about a \u201creligion\u201d that turns its true believers\u2019 confessions into the stuff of blackmail. And it too was built upon accounts offered by former members \u2014 the so-called \u201csquirrels.\u201d\n\nHere, from January 19, 1969, the fall-out from that investigation.\n\nDallas Morning News on January 19, 1969\n\nFor the rest, dig in below.\n\nLater, in the 1970s, it operated out of the Mission of the Southwest Personal Expansion Center at 4303 N. Central Expressway (currently the law offices of Randall B. Isenberg!). In 2000 it moved into that circa-1940s mansion at Buckner Boulevard and Dixie Lane. I thought they\u2019d been there longer. But, no, just five years. The house burned down in 2013. Surely, the work of an angry LRH.\n\nThen it was off to Irving, where at-the-time Mayor Herb Gears welcomed David Miscavige and the Scientologists to \u201cthe heart of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex\u201d with open arms, as you\u2019ll see in a video that looks like an excerpt from Going Clear.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick (and official) audit of the facility:\n\nWright\u2019s a fascinating subject himself, as evidenced by our 2003 profile of the author and his family. His dad Don Wright \u201ccreated Beautiful Dallas, led efforts to dredge White Rock Lake and was deeply involved in efforts to beautify roadsides with wildflowers,\u201d for instance, per Bill Marvel\u2019s story about the author. He told his own story in his second tome: In the New World: Growing Up in America, 1964-1984, which was recently reissued and remains the best book ever written about growing up in Dallas following the assassination of John Kennedy in Dealey Plaza. It merits its own documentary.\n\nBefore you see the Going Clear Sunday, or watch our video, you might also want to read some excerpts from Going Clear. Here\u2019s one we ran last year; here\u2019s another from Random House. A little taste will get you hooked.\n\nNow, then, to the review:\n\nAnd some light reading from The Dallas Morning News\u2018 Wayback Machine:\n\nDallas Morning News Scientology", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzL3N0cmFuZ2UtY3VsdC1jYXVzaW5nLWNvbmNlcm4tc2NpZW50b2xvZ3ktY2FtZS10by1kYWxsYXMtaW4tMTk1Ni10aGVuLXRoZS1xdWVzdGlvbnMuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 1 p.m. March 30: Over the weekend, a reader emailed with one more significant Dallas connection to Scientology: Vicki Aznaran.
