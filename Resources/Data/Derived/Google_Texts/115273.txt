A hostage situation Thursday night ended peacefully but not before the suspect in the case became violent.

Police were notified of the hostage situation by one of the victims being held at gunpoint. Clarke Co. Sheriff Todd Kemp says a male and female were held against their will for more than two hours. The male hostage escaped while the woman was trying to do the same.

“As he was leaving, shots were fired at him and his vehicle,” Kemp says.

Sheriff Kemp says the woman was dragged back into the house. Mississippi Highway Patrol SWAT team was called in.

“While we were staging at the church, we heard approximately 17 shots,” Kemp says.

After about five hours they made entry into the home and took Verbie Watkins into custody. The woman was nowhere to be found.

“She was nowhere nearby. We did wood searches, we searched around ponds, thinking the worst at that point,” Kemp says.

Kemp says that wasn’t the case. She also escaped sometime during the standoff. The woman was found around 2 a.m. near the home she was held hostage in. Kemp says the woman and Watkins knew each other.

“This individual was using this lady as a crutch. Whether it be prescription drugs or finances,” Kemp says.

According to Sheriff Kemp, 23-year-old Watkins has had several run-ins with law enforcement around Clarke County, Meridian and even made a terroristic threat in Georgia. Kemp says an argument over prescription pills might have led to the incident.

Watkins is charged with two counts of kidnapping and one count of aggravated domestic violence after that incident last night in the southern part of the county.
