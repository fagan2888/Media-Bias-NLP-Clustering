Former Vice President Dick Cheney has once again emerged to warn Americans that ours is a very scary world, one that demands “a strong leader” who won’t hesitate to waterboard terrorism suspects and perhaps invade a few countries to make a point about American might.

Sitting down with neoconservative pundit William Kristol for a nearly two-hour interview, Cheney discussed at length what the sycophantic Kristol called his “distinguished,” “exemplary,” and “model” career. Most notable was Cheney’s brazen defense of the Bush administration’s post-9/11 national security policies, for which he asserted “I don’t think we have any apologies to make.”

Employing the Bush White House’s Orwellian phrase of choice to describe torture, the former vice president hailed “enhanced interrogation techniques” as key to the administration’s anti-terrorism efforts.

“[W]hat are you gonna do?” Cheney asked. “Just say ‘please, please, pretty please, tell us what you know’? That’s not gonna work.”

“So we developed a series of techniques. … Waterboarding was part of that process,” Cheney recalled.

Kristol, you’ll be shocked to learn, didn’t ask Cheney about the role U.S. torture and detention policies played as recruitment tools for terrorists.

Asked to reflect on the current national security landscape, Cheney hardly minced words. In a not-so-thinly veiled jab at longtime antagonist Rand Paul, Cheney said, “You’ve got to be a fool to believe an isolationist strategy is the way to go.”

Then came a good measure of quintessential Cheney fear-mongering.

“We’ve got no choice but to be involved in [the Middle East],” Cheney said. “And if we’re not actively involved there, some very bad things are gonna happen.”
