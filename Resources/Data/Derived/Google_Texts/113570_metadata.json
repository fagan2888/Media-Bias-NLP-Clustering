She is the only person from Texas selected for the honor.\n\nCortez, 49, is being recognized for advocating for children\u2019s and families\u2019 health care needs. She has long promoted public awareness of Medicaid and the state\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. She also planned and promoted large-scale health insurance enrollment events in San Antonio for the past three open enrollment seasons since the Affordable Care Act took full effect in 2012.\n\nShe will attend the White House event with her husband and two children, who are 11 and 8 years old. This will be her first trip to Washington, D.C.\n\nCortez thought someone was playing a joke when she was first alerted of the honor.\n\n\u201cReally, I\u2019m in awe,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cI\u2019m really surprised and very honored. But it\u2019s bittersweet for me ... It\u2019s very hard to accept this recognition because I don\u2019t do this work alone.\u201d\n\nCortez has served as one of the key leaders in the EnrollSA coalition, a group of local hospital systems, health clinics, nonprofit agencies, school districts and elected officials working to boost health insurance enrollment under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe has worked for more than 17 years for CentroMed, one of San Antonio\u2019s \u201csafety net\u201d health care centers that provides low-cost services to uninsured residents. The nonprofit runs 23 clinics in San Antonio, Somerset and New Braunfels and serves all patients, regardless of their ability to pay. CentroMed focuses on comprehensive primary care services and charges \u201csliding scale\u201d fees based on patients\u2019 income levels.\n\nCortez was nominated for the honor by two of her colleagues in EnrollSA \u2014 Joe Ibarra, Enroll America\u2019s deputy state director for Texas, and Andrea Guajardo, Christus Santa Rosa Health System\u2019s director of community health.\n\nIbarra said Cortez has previously worked with other community coalitions focused on access to health coverage, citing her past work in raising families\u2019 awareness of Medicaid and CHIP.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very much a service leader,\u201d Ibarra said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ask folks to do anything that she wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nCentroMed CEO Ernesto G\u00f3mez said he\u2019s not surprised Cortez\u2019s work is drawing national recognition. Cortez and her staff frequently worked until 11 p.m. or midnight during open enrollment periods to get people signed up for health coverage, he recalled.\n\n\u201cOften federal officials have made contact with her to get a read of how enrollment activities are going here in San Antonio,\u201d G\u00f3mez said. \u201cShe and her staff have just really done a stellar job.\u201d\n\nCortez supervises 14 CentroMed employees year round, G\u00f3mez said. During open enrollment periods, when some temporary employees join the nonprofit to assist with the crush of signups, she leads up to 30 workers at times, he added.\n\nAn estimated 297,742 Bexar County residents don\u2019t have health insurance, according to data the U.S. Census Bureau released in September from its 2014 American Community Survey One-Year Estimates. Statewide, the number was estimated to reach more than 5 million people \u2014 roughly 19 percent of the population, according to that census data.\n\nEnroll SA is now in the process of updating Bexar County\u2019s uninsured rate, but that number was not available Monday, Ibarra said.\n\npohare@express-news.net\n\nYour browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.
