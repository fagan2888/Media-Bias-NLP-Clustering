It\u2019s been elevated in importance while raising new questions about its role in international affairs.\n\nFor years, Turkey has been at a crossroads. It\u2019s a member of NATO and has flirted with the European Union for years (it recently revived its ascension strategy into the union). However, each time Ankara, a city literally divided between Europe and Asia, appeared to be ready to move toward a closer relationship with the European continent, Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- the former prime minster, current president, and dominant force in Turkish politics for years -- moves the country back toward secular Islam.\n\nRelated: The New Price Tag for the U.S. War Against ISIS\n\nFor instance, in 2013, violent protests erupted in Turkish squares over Erdogan\u2019s plans to ban alcohol, kissing in public, and adultery. He cracked down on the arts, and openly declared his desire to \u201craise a religious youth.\u201d\n\nErdogan uses religious language to crack down on what he perceives as out-of-control secularism among Turkish intellectuals and youth. However, these crackdowns have done little to hurt his popularity; he was elected president this year, and formally took office late last month.\n\nHis importance as a world leader has come into sharp focus with the ISIS crisis in Iraq. Perhaps no other country has more at stake than Turkey. It shares a border with northern Iraq and Syria, and is currently the site of a worsening refugee crisis. Iraq also serves as a buffer from Iran\u2019s Shiites. Nearly 100 percent of Turks are Muslims, and 72 percent are Sunni, according to the CIA.\n\nUntil recently, circumstances have not permitted Turkey to join the coalition fighting ISIS, as the group was holding 49 Turkish hostages. Now that the hostages have been released, the world is waiting to see what skin Turkey would put into the game.\n\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)\n\nSo far, Erdogan has remained silent. However, Kamran Bokhari, vice president of Middle Eastern and South Asian affairs at STRATFOR Global Intelligence, said in a recent interview that he believes Turkey would assist in the fight.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he tried to do some military operation working with the Kurds in Iraq,\u201d Bokhari said. \u201cHe\u2019s known to be this maverick. He\u2019s known to surprise people. He\u2019s working against a perception of reality that Turkey is all talk and no action.\u201d\n\nOfficially the Turks are never going to fight ISIS publicly, added Joshua W. Walker, an expert on Turkey and director of global program at the consultancy APCOForum. \u201cIt\u2019s suicide for any Turkish government to equip and train Iraqi troops. It\u2019s impossible to guarantee that they wouldn\u2019t be used against the Turks in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnofficially they are absolutely working together,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSpecial forces are in northern Iraq to determine what their next steps are. I know for a fact they are doing these things.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama's Use of ISIL, Not ISIS, Tells Another Story\n\nCounter to Russia\n\nBokhari added that the Turks also had energy interests in the Middle East. Right now, Russia supplies 58 percent of Turkish natural gas, making Moscow its largest supplies.\n\n\u201cTurkey needs to diversify its energy resources. It\u2019s too dependent on Russia,\u201d Bokhari said. \u201cIraq is one such area in which Turkey can have energy investment. That\u2019s why its been so focused on \u2026 exploring Kurdish oil without upsetting Baghdad.\u201d\n\nBokhari added that the ISIS crisis also gives Erdogan an opportunity to emerge as a regional leader.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much opening in the Caucuses and the European Union that\u2019s attractive anymore. And his heart is with the Middle East,\u201d Bokhari said. Erdogan \u201cwants to be seen as the leader of the Middle East. In Iraq, there are threats, but there\u2019s a lot of opportunity.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Crises in Russia and Iraq have propelled Turkey to the center stage of international affairs.", "title": "Why Turkey is the Key to Solving ISIS and Russia", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/Why-Turkey-Key-Solving-ISIS-and-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02172012_Turkey_workhrs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/Why-Turkey-Key-Solving-ISIS-and-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02172012_Turkey_workhrs.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Crises in Russia and Iraq have propelled Turkey to the center stage of international affairs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ab4\"", "article_summary": "Until recently, circumstances have not permitted Turkey to join the coalition fighting ISIS, as the group was holding 49 Turkish hostages.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he tried to do some military operation working with the Kurds in Iraq,\u201d Bokhari said.\nHis importance as a world leader has come into sharp focus with the ISIS crisis in Iraq.\nNow that the hostages have been released, the world is waiting to see what skin Turkey would put into the game.\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)So far, Erdogan has remained silent."}
