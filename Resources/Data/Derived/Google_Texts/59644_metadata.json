The nearest point in Iran is around 1,000 km from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\n\n\"The reason we designed our missiles with a range of 2000 km is to be able to hit our enemy the Zionist regime from a safe distance,\" Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA agency.\n\nIsraeli officials had no immediate response to the Iranian launches, which come as Israel hosts U.S. Vice President Joe Biden for talks on regional issues. Last week, the allies concluded a joint missile defense drill in Israel.\n\nSANCTIONS THREAT\n\nThe U.S. State Department said it would raise Tuesday's tests at the U.N. Security Council. The speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives also said lawmakers would push for more unilateral sanctions.\n\nTwo months ago, Washington imposed sanctions against businesses and individuals linked to Iran's missile program over a test of the medium-range Emad missile carried out in October 2015.\n\n\"The missiles fired today are the results of sanctions. The sanctions helped Iran develop its missile program,\" Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy commander of the IRGC, was quoted as saying by Fars.\n\nThe IRGC, a powerful force that reports directly to the supreme leader, is deeply suspicious of the United States and its allies. It maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East.\n\nWashington fears those missiles could be used to carry a nuclear warhead at some point in the future, even after Iran implemented a nuclear deal with world powers in January that imposes strict limits and checks on its disputed nuclear program.\n\nIran's missile program is subject to U.N. Security Council resolution 2231 that calls on the Islamic Republic not to develop missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Iran says its missiles are solely a conventional deterrent.\n\nWashington said Tuesday's missile tests would not violate the Iran nuclear deal itself, under which Tehran has won relief from economic sanctions. That deal was also endorsed in resolution 2231.\n\n(Reporting by Sam Wilkin and Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Additional reporting by Dan Williams in Jerusalem; Editing by Michael Perry and Hugh Lawson)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) test-fired two ball", "title": "Iran tests more missiles, 'capable of reaching Israel'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/09/Iran-continues-missile-tests-two-more-launches", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-test-fires-missiles_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/09/Iran-continues-missile-tests-two-more-launches", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-test-fires-missiles_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) test-fired two ball", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Washington said Tuesday's missile tests would not violate the Iran nuclear deal itself, under which Tehran has won relief from economic sanctions.\nIran's missile program is subject to U.N.
