The vast majority of employers have not yet implemented a strategy to comply with new reporting requirements under the federal health care reform law that took effect earlier this year, according to a survey released Monday.

Only 10% of 480 employers surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. and Equifax Inc. indicated that they already have an in-house or outsourced solution in place to track benefits eligibility of their full-time employees and submit annual reports to the Internal Revenue Service to document their group plans' compliance with the Affordable Care Act.

The first reports are due in early 2016, but employers' reports must contain month-by-month data for each employee.

Sixteen percent of employers polled said they have not yet even considered a solution for the reporting requirements or do not know what kinds of solutions to consider, according to the PwC survey. That group was made up primarily of small employers with fewer than 1,000 full-time employees.

Overall, 74% of employers indicated they are in the process of evaluating an in-house solution or are considering or have committed to an outsourced solution.

Among employers considering or planning to outsource the reporting, large employers, or firms with 5,000 or more full-time employees, were most likely to select services provided by a dedicated health care law compliance provider, while small and midsize companies were more likely to select a payroll provider.
