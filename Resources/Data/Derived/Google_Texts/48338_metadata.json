But the humanities factor prominently into the equation. Elements from the humanities \u2014 visual arts, empathy, storytelling \u2014 provide engagement to innovation. This video series explores how the humanities are not fading but evolving. STEM is the engine of the future, but the humanities are the oil.\n\nJustin Kan, Partner at Y Combinator\n\nYou cannot throw a rock in Silicon Valley without hitting a tech giant. The area is home to Google, Yahoo, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Facebook. But such success is not a product of STEM alone. Justin Kan, partner at Y Combinator and co-founder of Justin.tv and Twitch, elaborates on how the humanities serve the entrepreneurial landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nCamille Seaman, Extreme Photographer\n\nScientific jargon and vapid data sets often drive discussions about climate change. As a result, many fail to grasp the magnitude of the situation. Camille Seaman, extreme photographer and Stanford Knight Fellow, shares her stunning visuals and her experiences photographing the polar regions and chasing storms. Through multimedia, she infuses emotion and inspiration into environmental issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Kelley, Founder of the Stanford d.school\n\nInnovation is powerful when it helps solve significant problems for people. In order to identify those problems, one must exercise empathy. David Kelley, founder of the Stanford d.school and founder of the design firm IDEO, believes STEM relies upon \u2014 not diminishes \u2014 the humanities. He discusses design thinking, a process that integrates human behavior into design.\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Bailenson, Director of Stanford\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab\n\nVirtual reality is a computer-simulated environment that engages all of the senses and allows people to experience worlds real and imagined. While much of the research conducted in Stanford\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab is of the quantitative variety, qualitative elements play key roles. Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, explains how virtual reality draws from science fiction and why it may become an art space in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicholas Jenkins, Director of Stanford\u2019s CS+X Initiative\n\nComputer science is an essential component of the digital age. And when it comes to design, privacy and human interaction with computers, computer science works alongside the humanities. Starting in fall 2014, Stanford will offer a joint major in computer science and history, philosophy, language or music. Nicholas Jenkins, associate professor of English and director of Stanford\u2019s CS+X initiative, speaks about the advantages of fusing the two worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents emphasize sustainability through art and humor\n\nSustainability is important, but it isn\u2019t always engaging \u2014 especially for teens. At Palo Alto High School, four beginning photography students teamed up to write a script, act out scenes and produce an entertaining \u2014 yet educational \u2014 video on energy conservation. From catching a teacher eating in front of an open refrigerator to probing a coach who forgot to cover the swimming pool, the group devised humorous situations to deliver serious messages.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Students are identified by first name only in compliance with Palo Alto Unified School District\u2019s media policy.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Ben Custer,Benjamin Custer,climate change,design,empathy,engineering,humanities,innovation,math,mathematics,science,Silicon Valley,stanford,Stanford CS+X Initiative,Stanford d.school,STEM,storytelling,Technology,Twitch,Virtual Reality,visual arts,Y Combinator,Culture & Features,Education,Politics & Gov,Features,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia", "description": "This video series explores how the humanities are not fading but evolving.
