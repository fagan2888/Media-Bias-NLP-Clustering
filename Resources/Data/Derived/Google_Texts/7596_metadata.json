Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) give a 21-hour speech against Obamacare on the Senate floor. (Charles Dharapak/AP)\n\nIn 2013, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he had a plan to do something that seemed impossible. He could force President Obama to strip the funding from the landmark health-care law that had come to bear his name \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 by threatening to shut down the government.\n\nTo some other conservatives, there was a problem with Cruz\u2019s plan.\n\nIt still seemed impossible.\n\nTo succeed, Cruz needed a novel way to outmaneuver the Democrat-led Senate and then pressure Obama to undercut his signature domestic policy achievement.\n\nBut Cruz didn\u2019t have one. Instead, his critics said, he offered only a fanciful theory that if the GOP flirted hard enough with a shutdown, Democratic lawmakers and the White House might lose heart and surrender.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, (R-Texas), said on the Senate floor Tuesday he would stand against the president\u2019s health care law \u201cuntil I\u2019m no longer able to stand.\u201d (The Washington Post)\n\nGrover Norquist, the influential anti-tax activist, likened Cruz\u2019s strategy to a plotline in the satirical animated show \u201cSouth Park,\u201d in which a group of gnomes comes up with a brilliant plan to become rich.\n\n\u201cStep 1 is: Steal all the underwear in South Park. Step 2 is: Mumumumbumbumbum,\u201d Nor\u00adquist said, making a nonsense sound. \u201cAnd Step 3 is: Make a million dollars. And this [plan] reminded me of that episode.\u201d\n\nJosh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said it was \u201clike a toddler\u2019s version of legislating.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s gambit didn\u2019t work. Neither Senate Democrats nor Obama gave an inch on their cherished law. Instead, the government shut down for 16 days, and Republicans in Congress were blamed for it \u2014 including by other Republicans, who said they had distracted attention from the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov website.\n\nToday, the drama that surrounded the shutdown \u2014 including Cruz\u2019s 21-hour Senate speech, in which he read \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d to his daughters via the C-SPAN feed \u2014 is the defining moment of a Senate tenure that has helped make Cruz the favorite Republican presidential candidate for many conservatives.\n\nTo those supporters, the shutdown signaled the depth of Cruz\u2019s commitment to rein in government.\n\nBut for many Republicans in Congress, this was the episode that soured them on Cruz. Many suspect that he always knew his plan would fail but went ahead with it anyway \u2014 expecting that he would personally benefit from the exposure, even if his party lost a damaging fight.\n\n\u201cHe knew that. He knew it. He knew it,\u201d former senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the shutdown. It wasn\u2019t about the Affordable Care Act. It was about launching Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail this year, none of Cruz\u2019s fellow senators have endorsed him for president. And some GOP rivals have used the shutdown to criticize him.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida who was a vocal supporter of Cruz during the shutdown, now uses it to call Cruz ineffective: \u201cI\u2019m the only one running that\u2019s actually ever scored a victory against Obamacare,\u201d Rubio says. He is referring to a bill that undercut a government program to bail out failing insurers. Rubio didn\u2019t actually play a very substantial role in its passage. But it passed.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a former presidential candidate and a longtime Cruz nemesis who is now backing former Florida governor Jeb Bush, cites the shutdown saga as proof that Cruz is shameless.\n\n\u201cWhat he did was stood up for Ted and threw the Republican Party under the bus,\u201d Graham has said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Cruz often talks about Obamacare, telling audiences that he will \u201crepeal every word\u201d of the health-care law if he is elected president. But he refers to the 2013 battle infrequently. And he rarely utters the word \u201cshutdown.\u201d\n\nRick Tyler, a spokesman for Cruz\u2019s campaign, said the senator doesn\u2019t often say the word because shutting down the government was never his goal.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t pursue a government shutdown strategy. That\u2019s not even sane,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThat would be a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasn\u2019t what he did. He led the fight to defund Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBut even in Cruz\u2019s telling of the story, his plan to defund Obamacare was based on a misreading of how other key players would react when he threatened a shutdown.\n\nHe says he thought Obama and top Democrats would be cowed. He says he thought Senate Republican leaders would be willing \u2014 at least in public \u2014 to take the risk.\n\nIn both cases, he was wrong.\n\n\u201cThe reason it didn\u2019t work is because Ted Cruz was the only candidate, the only senator, who campaigned on defunding Obamacare and followed through on his campaign promise. Nobody else did,\u201d Tyler said, arguing that others said: \u201c \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have the votes. We\u2019ll just give up.\u2019 That\u2019s not leadership; that\u2019s capitulation and appeasement and surrender.\u201d\n\nIf there was a blunder in Cruz\u2019s plans, Tyler said, \u201cthe miscalculation was that when his colleagues campaigned on defeating Obamacare, he thought they meant it.\u201d\n\nThe fullest explanation of that time, written from Cruz\u2019s perspective, came in his 2015 book, \u201cA Time for Truth.\u201d\n\nIn it, Cruz begins the chapter about his own fight with a story from 160 years ago. Just before the Civil War, he writes, a Wisconsin abolitionist was punished for breaking the law to help a former slave escape to Canada. But later, Cruz says, the man was pardoned and vindicated.\n\n\u201cHe was an American hero,\u201d Cruz writes.\n\nIn the next paragraph, Cruz jumps from slavery to Obamacare, and from that American hero to himself.\n\n\u201cIn Washington, pundits repeatedly intone that we had no plan, no strategy, and no hope of success,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cI\u2019ve got many personal faults, but, as a former Supreme Court litigator, failing to plan is not one of them.\u201d\n\n\u2018It was the last gasp to stop it\u2019\n\nIt was not Cruz\u2019s idea, originally.\n\nIn 2013, conservative activists were looking for a new tactic to defeat the health-care law, which had survived a Supreme Court challenge, before its first insurance exchanges opened Oct. 1. Republicans had tried passing standalone bills to repeal it, but the Senate killed them. The new plan was to use a bill that the Senate was obligated to pass \u2014 a spending bill to keep the government funded. They would pass a bill that paid for everything, except Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt was the last chance. It was the last gasp to stop it,\u201d said Brent Bozell, chairman of the conservative group ForAmerica. \u201cDid I think it was going to work? We knew it was going to be tough. Anything is possible. But we knew it was going to be tough.\u201d\n\nCruz joined the \u201cdefund\u201d effort early on and became its leading spokesman and an important legislative leader.\n\n\u201cThe president is never going to sign a bill that defunds Obamacare,\u201d CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley told him on Aug. 25, 2013, with a shutdown a little more than a month away.\n\n\u201cYou know, you may be convinced to that,\u201d Cruz replied.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not convinced to that?\u201d Crowley asked.\n\n\u201cI am not at all,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nIn theory, his plan worked like this:\n\nFirst, the House would pass a bill to defund the health-care law.\n\nThen came the Senate. Republicans had 46 seats there \u2014 not enough to pass a bill but enough to block one. So they\u2019d block a vote on any Democratic version of the spending bill. In the meantime, Cruz would use lobbying and public pressure to swing wobbly Democrats over to his side.\n\nEventually, Obamacare opponents would have the 60 Senate votes they needed to pass Cruz\u2019s bill and send it to the president.\n\nAt that point, according to Cruz\u2019s plan, Obama might start to respond as he did during the debt-ceiling showdown two years earlier. In those negotiations, the threat of a government default was so scary that the White House and legislative leaders agreed to a series of drastic cuts known as the sequester.\n\nChip Roy, Cruz\u2019s chief of staff at the time, described the debt talks as a \u201cmodel\u201d for Cruz\u2019s strategy.\n\n\u201cWe could get some pound of flesh out of the president and [then-Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat was always the endgame.\u201d\n\nBut other Republicans believed that Cruz\u2019s plan was too farfetched to work.\n\nFor one thing, Cruz would need to flip more than a dozen Democratic votes to get his idea passed by the Senate. And he\u2019d need seven more Democrats to override a presidential veto. If Cruz couldn\u2019t get them, ever, then Republican leaders were reluctant to gridlock the Senate and wait for the impossible to happen.\n\n\u201cVirtually everybody understood the absurdity of the tactic,\u201d said Holmes, the former McConnell aide. \u201cLook, we all support the idea of defunding Obamacare. But saying we were going to defund Obamacare\u201d with 46 votes \u201cin the Senate or shut the government down is absurd.\u201d\n\nBut in the summer and fall of 2013, Cruz and conservative activist groups pressed on, pressuring other Republicans to go along with the plan. They tended to reduce the complex calculations of the fight \u2014 60-vote thresholds, worries about presidential vetoes \u2014 into a test of Republican fortitude.\n\n\u201cHow do we win the fight to defund Obamacare?\u201d Cruz shouted at a rally in Dallas in the summer of 2013, part of a 10-city tour. \u201cDon\u2019t blink.\u201d\n\nWhere the plan \u2018went awry\u2019\n\nStep 1 worked, as Cruz wanted. The GOP-led House \u2014 pushed by conservatives who were coordinating with Cruz \u2014 passed a bill to cut off the health-care law\u2019s money.\n\nNow it was time for the Senate.\n\n\u201cKind of like Evel Knievel crossing the Grand Canyon,\u201d said former congressman Steve Southerland II (R-Fla.), who voted for Cruz\u2019s plan in the House. That was a joke: Knievel, the 1970s motorcycle daredevil, always boasted that he could jump the Grand Canyon. But he never actually did.\n\nIndeed, here is \u201cwhere the plan went awry,\u201d Cruz says in his book.\n\n\u201cWhat we did not anticipate was that . . . the GOP leadership team would decide to publicly, directly and aggressively lead the fight against the House Republicans and in favor of Obamacare,\u201d he writes.\n\nSenate Republicans did not gridlock their chamber, and several criticized Cruz for making them the villains.\n\nThe Democrats who ran the Senate were able to reject the House bill easily. Cruz never seems to have made a concerted effort to lobby red-state Senate Democrats, whom he described as the last key element of his plan to win over the Senate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever remember hearing from Senator Cruz or his people,\u201d said former senator Mark Pryor (Ark.), who was perhaps the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Democrat at the time. He would lose his reelection bid to a Republican by 17 points. But he says he never felt pressure. \u201cThere was zero temptation for Democrats to shut down the government or defund Obamacare. No one on the Democratic side was interested in that at all.\u201d\n\nAs the days ticked down to the shutdown, Cruz was criticized even by House conservatives, who thought he needed to do more to make his plan work. He gathered with top aides in a small office near the Capitol dome. He read to them from Psalm 40, recalled Roy, his former chief of staff.\n\nThe reading is a plea for deliverance from someone overcome by problems: \u201cFor troubles without number surround me. My sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.\u201d\n\nCruz then went to the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cI intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz\u2019s speech was, at its heart, a meditation on impossibility. He cited cases in which things that seemed impossible \u2014 the Continental Army\u2019s fight against the British, the British fight against the Nazis, the mountain climbed by the Little Engine That Could \u2014 were difficult but possible.\n\nHis battle, Cruz said, was similar. \u201cI think I can. I think I can. No, you can\u2019t. No, you can\u2019t. We can\u2019t win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop Obamacare. It cannot be done. It is impossible.\u201d\n\nBut, it turned out, he couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn his book, he blamed Obama\u2019s refusal to compromise on the president\u2019s confidence in how the friendly media would tell the story.\n\n\u201cHe knew his media lap dogs would report that it was Republicans who were refusing to compromise,\u201d Cruz wrote.\n\nFinally, on the 16th day of the shutdown, the Senate and the House voted to fund the health-care law, ending the standoff without any of the victories Cruz wanted. Cruz and his allies blamed Senate Republicans, saying they had splintered without ever testing Obama\u2019s resolve.\n\n\u201cWith respect to Obama, it\u2019s the road not taken. We don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t accept the premise that we miscalculated on Obama in the slightest,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThe Republican leadership literally cowered in the corner, afraid of the word \u2018shutdown.\u2019 \u201d\n\nToday, the sting from the standoff lingers among Cruz\u2019s congressional colleagues.\n\n\u201cHow can I say this nicely? He was still critical of those of us who pointed out the obvious shortcomings of his tactic, and he called us capitulators,\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said. \u201cThat\u2019s not real leadership. That\u2019s lemming leadership. It\u2019s lemming leadership, is what it is.\u201d\n\nEven so, while the shutdown earned Cruz enemies in Washington, his success thus far in the presidential race shows that it gave him credibility with the conservative base. When he was campaigning in Des Moines in the closing days before his victory in the Iowa caucuses this month, one of the men who introduced him uttered the S-word that Cruz avoids.\n\n\u201cWhen Ted Cruz shut down the government,\u201d said Michael Berry, a conservative talk-radio host and Cruz ally.\n\nThe crowd roared.\n\nSean Sullivan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The senator\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d strategy to defund the health-care law earned him fans as well as enemies.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The senator\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d strategy to defund the health-care law earned him fans as well as enemies.", "title": "For Ted Cruz, the 2013 shutdown was a defining moment", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-cruzs-plan-to-defund-obamacare-failed--and-what-it-achieved/2016/02/16/4e2ce116-c6cb-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/14/Style/Images/Budget_Battle_Cruz-062a6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katiezez"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-cruzs-plan-to-defund-obamacare-failed--and-what-it-achieved/2016/02/16/4e2ce116-c6cb-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "4e2ce116-c6cb-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen Ted Cruz shut down the government,\u201d said Michael Berry, a conservative talk-radio host and Cruz ally.\n(Charles Dharapak/AP)In 2013, freshman Sen.
