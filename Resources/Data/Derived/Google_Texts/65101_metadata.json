Technical denials and revenue recoupments occur if providers fail to meet ADRs in a timely fashion\u2014or submit incomplete information. Missing documentation also leads to lost claims, and heightened risk for additional compliance reviews and audits down the road.\n\nRegardless of the provider\u2019s technical capabilities, from rural paper-based practices to huge hospitals wielding state-of-the-art electronic health records, ADRs make their powerful presence known.\n\nADR Impact is Widespread\n\nFor provider personnel involved with the ADR process, it\u2019s all about understanding documentation requirements and executing three main points:\n\nDetermine the role of health information management and other departments in filling ADRs. Ascertain what specific documentation is required for each request. Compile a list of practical pointers on compiling documentation to avoid technical denials and mitigate future risk.\n\nThe influence of ADRs can be felt through almost every department in a practice or hospital. Those who directly handle ADRs include HIM (health information management) directors, HIM staff, EHR managers, and RAC (recovery audit contractor) coordinators. Many more positions and teams also deal peripherally with ADR-related fallout.\n\nIn addition, there are always multiple sources of information to manage. Information that needs to be seamlessly meshed within the patient record may come from the radiology department, operating rooms, rehab facilities or units, pharmacies, and other providers of services. These are just a few possible sources of ADR documentation.\n\nCross-platform and stand-alone information systems add to the frustration associated with gathering a complete set of ADR documentation. Often, an intermediary \u201csolution\u201d must be employed to serve as a universal translator, so communication can be achieved among myriad components that may not speak the same language.\n\nOne effective strategy is to build specific lists of practical pointers on compiling documentation based on each type of ADR. A thorough review of records prior to submitting to auditors is the best practice to ensure all information is included, and to mitigate risk of technical denial due to missing documentation. Here are four specific documentation items to consider for inclusion in ADR packets:\n\nDiagnostic test results supporting medical decisions (admission, procedures, therapy)\n\nDocumentation that previous treatment options were considered and attempted\n\nPhysician orders with appropriate signatures\n\nCertification statements\n\nIf providers hope to bolster defenses against the ADR onslaught, they must know what auditors are looking for now and what they are likely to seek in the future.\n\nKnow What Auditors Want\n\nClaims are usually placed into the \u201cinsufficient documentation\u201d category for three reasons:\n\nMedical documentation submitted is inadequate to support payment for the services billed.\n\nEvidence that allowed services were actually provided, were provided at the level billed, and/or were medically necessary is missing.\n\nA specific documentation element that is required as a condition of payment is missing, such as a physician signature on an order, or a form that is required to be completed in its entirety.\n\nRemember: All requests are not the same. It\u2019s important to know your auditors and what they are auditing. Creating checklists for high-volume/high-dollar services is imperative. To that end, use the following items to help develop your lists:\n\nLCD/NCD requirements\u2014Know the LCD (local coverage determination) and NCD (national coverage determination). Be sure to review annually for changes on high-volume procedures.\n\nCERT (comprehensive error rate testing) tips guidelines.\n\nMedicare billing manuals.\n\nRecovery auditor websites.\n\nMissing or insufficient documentation for ADRs is one of the top three reasons for denial. It\u2019s an issue that must be understood and addressed effectively across every provider organization.\n\nCosts of Missing Documentation\n\nLet\u2019s face the facts: Medicare auditors are after all improper payments from all providers. There\u2019s no magic wand for providers to combat this, aside from proactive preparedness and knowledge to minimize mistakes and maximize reimbursement. Here are some facts and costs worth noting:\n\nMedicare Modernization Act and Affordable Care Act have components to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse to preserve the Medicare Trust Fund.\n\nThough some auditors may focus more on hospitals, the reviews can lead to physician provider reviews.\n\nIf the inpatient procedure was deemed medically unnecessary, then the corresponding Part B claims may also be deemed medically unnecessary.\n\nCERT program cites insufficient documentation for high-percentage of errors.\n\nMedicare fee for services estimates 12.7 percent of claims valued at $45.8 billion in improper payments for fiscal year 2014.\n\nMoreover, when it comes to CERTs, insufficient documentation continues to have a large impact on error rates for Medicare on a national level. The health information provided must demonstrate the medical necessity of the services, support the services billed, and be legible and in proper order\u2014all according to Medicare guidelines.\n\nROI Rules More Complex, Impact ADR fulfillment\n\nThe ADR issue is exacerbated by the fact that rules and regulations regarding release of information (ROI) have grown increasingly complicated over the past several years. This is in part due to the numerous forms included in medical records\u2014from EHRs, archive systems, and paper records, or a combination of these.\n\nIt is imperative that all involved directors, managers, and staff members be able to comprehend and execute four basic ADR concepts. To wit, they should:\n\nUnderstand the impact of missed submission of health information.\n\nResearch tips on how to determine what needs to be included for a request.\n\nTroubleshoot missing information.\n\nUnderstand how to create a checklist of information sources for different audit types.\n\nAt the end of the day, effectively processing ADRs is all about properly identifying missing documents, streamlining the research of missing information, and making certain the health information that is submitted supports the patient record. These are the keys to getting, and remaining, ahead of the ADR curve.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDawn Crump, MA, SSBB, CHC, has been in the healthcare compliance industry for more than 18 years and joined HealthPort in 2013 as vice president of audit management solutions.
