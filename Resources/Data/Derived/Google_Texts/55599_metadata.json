John Kasich as having the \u201cworst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat.\u201d\n\nThe rating is based on data about Ohio\u2019s general revenue fund spending, but the nonpartisan group that published the data warned that the figures for Ohio were skewed, for state comparison purposes, due to accounting methods employed by the state for Medicaid expenditures.\n\nThe attack is particularly significant given that Kasich has made balancing the federal budget a central part of his campaign. Kasich, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee, has described himself as \u201cone of the chief architects\u201d of a successful effort to balance the budget in 1997 for the first time in decades.\n\nAs several candidates vie for the Republican establishment vote, the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise came out with an ad in the New England area attacking Kasich\u2019s record. The ad, called \u201cQuiz,\u201d claims Kasich \u201ceven had the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat.\u201d That line also was in a Right to Rise ad that ran in Iowa asking viewers to compare the records of the three governors running for president if you \u201ccan\u2019t stomach Trump or Cruz.\u201d\n\nThose ads, as well as one on the Bush campaign website, all cite a report from the libertarian Cato Institute, which gave Kasich an overall \u201cD\u201drating in its 2014 \u201cFiscal Policy Report Card on America\u2019s Governors.\u201d\n\nThe Cato report praised Kasich for enacting numerous tax cuts but said his \u201cscore was dragged down by his spending increases.\u201d Indeed, Cato ranked Kasich dead last among governors on spending, based on large growth in general revenue fund spending in FY 2014, which was adjusted for population increases and inflation. (Interestingly, in 2006 Cato gave then Florida Gov. Jeb Bush a \u201cC\u201d grade, praising his tax cuts but noting that \u201c[w]hat has finally caused his grade to drop to a C this term was explosive growth in state spending.\u201d)\n\nCato particularly criticized Kasich\u2019s push for Medicaid expansion made possible by the Affordable Care Act. Kasich has said he opposes the Affordable Care Act, but he supports the Medicaid expansion, which took effect Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nCato based its spending conclusions on data from a state expenditure report by the nonpartisan National Association of State Budget Officers. But that report carries a significant footnote for the data from Ohio.\n\nThe footnote, found on page 14, states that unlike most other states, Ohio\u2019s accounting practices are such that most of the federal reimbursements for Medicaid expenditures are put into the general revenue fund. Other states list such federal reimbursements separately as federal expenditures. As a result, the footnote states, \u201cThis will tend to make Ohio\u2019s GRF expenditures look higher and conversely make Ohio\u2019s federal expenditures look lower relative to most other states that don\u2019t follow this practice.\u201d\n\nThe Kasich campaign argues that it makes more sense to look at all-funds spending, which includes state and federal (and other) spending. By that measure, Kasich\u2019s record on spending is middle-of-the-pack \u2014 increases of about 2 percent a year. Those are the figures Kasich cited in an Aug. 2 interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d when he dismissed the Cato report and claimed, \u201cour budget overall is growing by about 2 percent or 3 percent.\u201d When he says overall, he\u2019s talking about the all-funds budget.\n\nKasich\u2019s interview sparked a blog response from Nicole Kaeding, coauthor of the Cato report who now works for the pro-business Tax Foundation.\n\n\u201cBy using the all-funds number, Kasich is trying to use federal spending to mask the quick increase in general fund spending,\u201d Kaeding wrote. \u201cFederal spending \u2014 besides Medicaid \u2014 is not increasing in Ohio that quickly. Kasich has little control over federal spending, but he is using it to hide how much Ohio\u2019s state spending has grown during his tenure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOur data is correct, and so is his,\u201d Kaeding concluded. \u201cKasich seems to pick the dataset that shed the best light on him. Ohio spending has increased quickly when you look at the general fund.\u201d\n\nThere are pros and cons to looking exclusively at either the general fund or all-funds budget when it comes to evaluating Ohio\u2019s spending performance. And we won\u2019t wade into the political debate about which way is best. But it is misleading to call Kasich the worst on spending based on general revenue fund spending data from NASBO. That ignores NASBO\u2019s warning that an accounting peculiarity in Ohio regarding Medicaid expenditures makes its general fund look larger relative to other states that do their accounting differently.\n\nWe reached out to Chris Edwards of Cato, who was the other coauthor of the 2014 report card, and we asked him about NASBO\u2019s footnote on Ohio spending.\n\nHe noted that between FY 2012, Kasich\u2019s first year in office, and FY 2015, Ohio\u2019s general revenue fund grew 16.8 percent and all funds grew 12.4 percent. For all states over the same period, general revenue funds grew 13.1 percent and all funds grew 13.2 percent. (We checked and confirmed these numbers independently.) These figures \u2014 which are not adjusted for inflation or population fluctuations \u2014 back up the Kasich campaign\u2019s assertion that its all-funds spending was nearly in line with the national average over that period, even as its general fund appears to be well above the national average.\n\n\u201cSo I would say looking now that Kasich\u2019s spending increases over his first 3 years were roughly in line with the average for the 50 states,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nBut Edwards then pointed to GRF-only data for 2016 released by NASBO (all-funds data is not yet available). That data show Ohio\u2019s GRF \u201cleaps by 13 percent compared to the 50-state average of 4.1 percent for that one year.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true, but again, back to those pesky footnotes. On page 41, a footnote provides an important caution when it comes to comparing the general revenue fund for Ohio with other states in FY 2016.\n\nNASBO, Fall 2015: Medicaid expansion was not funded through the General Revenue Fund (GRF) in fiscal year 2015, but it is in fiscal 2016. This change is responsible for the majority of the fiscal 2016 growth. In addition, federal reimbursements for Medicaid expenditures funded from the GRF are deposited into the GRF. This will tend to make Ohio\u2019s GRF expenditures look higher relative to most states that don\u2019t follow this practice.\n\nWhile Ohio had been funding federal reimbursements for Medicaid through the GRF prior to the ACA Medicaid expansion, it didn\u2019t start funding those expansion funds specifically through the GRF until 2016.\n\nThat\u2019s largely the reason why Ohio appears to have larger general revenue fund increases in 2016 relative to other states \u2014 many of which have also opted to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at NASBO.\n\nThe general fund figure \u201cis definitely skewed for Ohio because of the way they do Medicaid,\u201d Sigritz said. \u201cIt they weren\u2019t a Medicaid expansion state, you wouldn\u2019t see anything. But they are, and that\u2019s mostly what\u2019s leading to a big jump right now.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it would be expected that as Medicaid funding increased \u2014 as it did in Ohio and 34 other states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Ohio\u2019s GRF would expand faster relative to other states based on the relatively unique way it does its accounting.\n\nNASBO referred us to Ohio\u2019s Department of Medicaid budget, which shows the GRF federal fund for Medicaid grew by nearly 29 percent from 2015 to 2016, while its GRF state Medicaid fund grew by only 1.2 percent. There was also a big drop in a separate federal fund group for Medicaid, outside the GRF, of 42 percent, showing that a shift had occurred in how Ohio categorized its Medicaid spending (see page 50 of the state\u2019s FY 2016-2017 budget).\n\nEdwards stood by the Cato rating, arguing that using the NASBO data is the fairest way to compare state spending.\n\n\u201cAs an economist trying to be fair, I\u2019ve almost always stuck with what NASBO reports,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve noticed many discrepancies between NASBO data and what state specific budget documents show. But I\u2019ve decided it is most fair to just use the NASBO-reported data. For one reason, state budget officers in the 50 states are the ones that provide the data to NASBO, and they know exactly what they are giving to NASBO. NASBO, to the extent it can, tries to get the states to report consistent data.\u201d\n\n\u201cKasich touts himself as a spending cutter, but it appears that he\u2019s no more fiscally frugal than the average of all Democratic and Republican governors,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cBesides, his unilateral decision to expand Medicaid is a clear decision in favor of budget expansion over fiscal retrenchment.\u201d\n\nFor the purposes of our fact-check, we would note that saying the spending increases over Kasich\u2019s first three years were \u201caverage\u201d is far different from the ads\u2019 claim that Kasich was worse on spending than any other governor, Republican or Democrat.\n\nCato is entitled to its opinion on the Medicaid expansion, of course. But its comparison of state spending is based on a report that warns that Ohio\u2019s general fund may appear larger than other states due to the way it accounts for Medicaid spending. And so it is misleading to conclude based on that data that Kasich has the \u201cworst rating\u201d on spending, as the ads claim.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But it is misleading to call Kasich the worst on spending based on general revenue fund spending data from NASBO.\n\u201cBy using the all-funds number, Kasich is trying to use federal spending to mask the quick increase in general fund spending,\u201d Kaeding wrote.\nAnd so it is misleading to conclude based on that data that Kasich has the \u201cworst rating\u201d on spending, as the ads claim.\nKasich has little control over federal spending, but he is using it to hide how much Ohio\u2019s state spending has grown during his tenure.\u201d\u201cOur data is correct, and so is his,\u201d Kaeding concluded.\nBut its comparison of state spending is based on a report that warns that Ohio\u2019s general fund may appear larger than other states due to the way it accounts for Medicaid spending."}
