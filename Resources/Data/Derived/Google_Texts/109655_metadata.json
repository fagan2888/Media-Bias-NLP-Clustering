The back-and-forth messaging Friday came at a time when Democrats are still seeking to calibrate how to handle the Obamacare issue on the campaign trail and Republicans are hammering away at every opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe map and opportunities have expanded dramatically in a year, in part because of the consequences of Obamacare,\u201d said Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, who chairs the party\u2019s Senate campaign arm. Moran said the GOP is eyeing up to 13 states in its bid to win control of the Senate; Republicans need to pick up a net of six seats to retake the chamber.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that Republicans support improving our health care system, but Obamacare creates so many problems it is not workable,\u201d Moran said.\n\n\u201cOn occasion, rare, but occasionally someone will tell us the benefits\u201d that Obamacare has brought them, Moran conceded. \u201cMy opinion would be: surely we can develop a healthcare plan that is not so damaging to so many people, their businesses and their families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats say the GOP's repeal strategy will backfire, but the GOP says it's Democrats who are running scared.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "GOP leaders are confident running against Obamacare will be a winning strategy in the midterm elections and believe the rocky rollout of the law, which turns four this weekend, gives them new opportunities to make inroads with voters", "title": "Republicans Double Down on Obamacare For 2014", "url": "http://time.com/33880/obamacare-2014-midterm-elections-democrats-republicans/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/time-080-gop-obamacare-2014-140321.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/time-080-gop-obamacare-2014-140321.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "GOP leaders are confident running against Obamacare will be a winning strategy in the midterm elections and believe the rocky rollout of the law, which turns four this weekend, gives them new opportunities to make inroads with voters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Republicans Double Down on Obamacare For 2014"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "obamacare, 2014, midterm elections, democrats, republicans, affordable care act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, 2014, midterm elections, democrats, republicans, affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27b8\"", "article_summary": "The battle lines of the coming midterm elections were drawn clearly and loudly on Friday, with Republicans and Democrats hammering each other on the same issue: Obamacare, which turns four this weekend.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that Republicans support improving our health care system, but Obamacare creates so many problems it is not workable,\u201d Moran said.\nAfter Democrats said they were betting the GOP\u2019s wholesale broadside against the health care reform law will backfire, Republicans fired back: We\u2019ll take that bet.\n\u201cOn occasion, rare, but occasionally someone will tell us the benefits\u201d that Obamacare has brought them, Moran conceded.\nMoran said the GOP is eyeing up to 13 states in its bid to win control of the Senate; Republicans need to pick up a net of six seats to retake the chamber."}
