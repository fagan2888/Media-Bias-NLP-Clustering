But while you can blame Slate for running this wrongheaded piece on \u201cending\u201d Gamergate, when it comes to suffering from the mental tic that is its undoing \u2014 the pathological need to find a \u201cmoderate\u201d position between any two warring sides \u2014 its author, David Auerbach, is hardly alone.\n\nSearching for a happy middle ground in spite of voluminous evidence that none exists is something we all do, from time to time. It\u2019s a sensible response for those who, like many of us, find disagreement psychologically difficult. And Auerbach\u2019s piece isn\u2019t an especially silly or poorly argued example of the phenomenon. But by humoring the impulse in the context of the ostensibly non-political Gamergate, Auerbach has shown why adhering to the cult of moderation isn\u2019t just something we do, but something we should stop.\n\nFirst, for the uninitiated (if there are any left): Gamergate is the word the culture has decided to use to describe an ongoing and decentralized Internet \u201cmovement\u201d that, depending on who you ask, is either actually about ethics in games journalism, or truly about driving women, LGBTQ people and minorities from the straight-white-male-dominated video game realm. The backstory is long and sordid and tedious, so rather than wade through all that detritus, I\u2019d recommend you read this great essay from Deadspin\u2019s Kyle Wagner, which rightly positions Gamergate as simply the latest iteration of America\u2019s never-ending culture war.\n\nThere\u2019s another word you can use to describe the \u201cculture war,\u201d however: politics. And maybe that\u2019s why Auerbach, who usually writes quite adeptly on issues that don\u2019t cross the line separating tech politics from mainstream politics, ends up making an argument that gives the folks supporting Gamergate (of whom, to be clear, he is no fan) too much credit. Once the Gamergate issue became folded into the larger culture war \u2014 once it became not about who did what but who is what: social justice warrior (SJWs) or gamer, feminist or troll \u2014 it became harder to resist the shoddy, moderation-is-magic thinking that so saturates our discourse on partisan politics.\n\nIf that shows us anything, though, it\u2019s the problems with the way we talk politics; not how the way we talk politics can bring Gamergate to its \u201cend.\u201d In fairness, Auerbach never frames his argument that way; you\u2019d have to be a fool to point to \u201cMeet the Press\u201d as a model of intelligent conflict resolution. Yet because Auerbach\u2019s piece is largely devoted to how opponents of Gamergate can peel off the group\u2019s so-called moderates, and how those fighting for a more inclusive games culture can reach them in a way that\u2019ll \u201cmake these idiots less useful\u201d to Gamergate\u2019s most destructive partisans, it ultimately recommends that opponents of those who promote death threats against women find common ground with those who prefer to hold on to the ethical journalism fallacy, cover their ears and look away.\n\nIf we keep in mind that Gamergate is the name we\u2019ve assigned to what is basically an ersatz social movement, which by its very nature can\u2019t be defeated in the same way as a candidate or a bill \u2014 i.e., by compromising, sacrificing and lining up allies to win an up-or-down vote \u2014 the reason to humor the Gamergate moderates becomes more elusive still. Auerbach initially seems cognizant of this, writing that one \u201cprobably can\u2019t kill Gamergate altogether, any more than you can kill misogyny.\u201d Before long, though, he\u2019s claiming that if Gamergate\u2019s enemies \u201creduce the number of active Gamergaters through a strategy of divide and conquer,\u201d they will chip away at the movement until it is \u201ctoo small and rancid to appear appealing or effective.\u201d For these moderates, apparently, promises of rape and murder aren\u2019t quite rancid enough.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A pundit's call to \"end\" the controversy shows how our fetish for moderation in politics can lead to an ugly place", "title": "Gamergate\u2019s infuriating myth: Why searching for common ground is a big mistake", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A pundit's call to \"end\" the controversy shows how our fetish for moderation in politics can lead to an ugly place", "title": "Gamergate\u2019s infuriating myth: Why searching for common ground is a big mistake", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/gamergates_infuriating_myth_why_searching_for_common_ground_is_a_big_mistake/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/video_gamer1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A pundit's call to \"end\" the controversy shows how our fetish for moderation in politics can lead to an ugly place", "title": "Gamergate\u2019s infuriating myth: Why searching for common ground is a big mistake", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/video_gamer1.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, dan auerbach, deadspin, Editor's Picks, ethics in games journalism, gamergate, kyle wagner, moderation, Slate, Video Games", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35d2\"", "article_summary": "Searching for a happy middle ground in spite of voluminous evidence that none exists is something we all do, from time to time.\nBut by humoring the impulse in the context of the ostensibly non-political Gamergate, Auerbach has shown why adhering to the cult of moderation isn\u2019t just something we do, but something we should stop.\nThere\u2019s another word you can use to describe the \u201cculture war,\u201d however: politics.\nIt\u2019s a sensible response for those who, like many of us, find disagreement psychologically difficult.\nAnd Auerbach\u2019s piece isn\u2019t an especially silly or poorly argued example of the phenomenon."}
