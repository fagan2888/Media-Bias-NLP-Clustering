Obamacare will be over. We'll replace it with something tremendous. \u2014 Brian Hardzinski (@brianhardzinski) September 26, 2015\n\nTrump played up his status as an outsider who is funding his own campaign without the assistance of lobbyists or Super PACs.\n\n\u201cWe have big difficulties. Our biggest difficulty is our politicians are all talk and no action,\" Trump said.. \"All talk no action. They keep working.\"\n\nTrump antagonized the media, who he said lies and distorts.\n\n\u201cThey are terrible people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNot all of them, but many of them.\u201d\n\nHe took umbrage with recent news stories which claimed only 700 or 800 people showed up to events, and asked the TV cameras at the fairgrounds to turn around and pan across the crowd of Trump supporters.\n\nDeclaring that illegal immigration is killing the country, Trump described his plan to build a wall at the Mexican border to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants and drugs.\n\n\u201cWe need a border, we need a wall, but I don\u2019t mean a wall where you go to Home Depot and you buy a ladder and you walk across,\u201d Trump said, before gesturing to the Bandshell behind him. \u201cThe kind that if you ever do get to the top, you don\u2019t get down.\u201d\n\nHe also discussed plans to change birthrate citizenship laws so that children born to foreign parents within the United States will not automatically gain U.S. citizenship. He added that most other countries do not have similar citizenship laws. Mexico, he said, has much tougher citizenship requirements.\n\n\u201cTo be a citizen of Mexico is almost impossible. I can\u2019t be a citizen because they don\u2019t like WASP\u2019s. They don\u2019t like White Anglo Saxon Protestants, I think. They don\u2019t want me,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump spent several minutes criticizing the Iran nuclear deal, and said he would have required the release of American hostages before negotiations began. He faulted Secretary of State John Kerry for not being tough with Iran.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the dumbest contracts I have ever seen of any kind,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis was done by extremely stupid people.\u201d\n\nTrump: I don't want people, other countries to know what I'm thinking. I want them to keep guessing. I have plans. \u2014 Brian Hardzinski (@brianhardzinski) September 26, 2015\n\nMarco Rubio was a common target. Trump repeatedly called Rubio a \u201clightweight,\u201d criticized the Florida Senator for his attendance record, and ridiculed Rubio for trailing in the polls in Florida. Rubio and Trump have been trading jabs following a Fox News interview where Trump struggled with questions about Hezbollah, Hamas and terrorist leaders. Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been criticizing Trump\u2019s knowledge of foreign affairs.\n\nJust left Oklahoma--- the most amazing crowd and people! What a night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2015\n\nTrump supporter Tony Timmons from Enid, Oklahoma came to the fair just to see the candidate.\n\n\u201cI would like to see a smaller government, moderated incentives for United States, and definitely border patrol,\u201d Timmons said. \u201cHe\u2019s a no-nonsense guy. He says what he\u2019s going to do and then he does it.\u201d\n\nTammi Babbit, from Oklahoma City, thinks Trump is bold and has business sense.\n\n\u201cI like the fact that he says what he means and he means what he says. He\u2019s forward,\u201d Babbit said.\n\nA group of demonstrators lined a section of streets outside the fair to protest Trump\u2019s event. Jessica Vazquez, from Oklahoma City, said their message is that Trump and hate are not welcome in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cWe need him to change his rhetoric and to stop using immigrants and Latinos as a scapegoat for the country\u2019s problems,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cWe know there are problems in the country, but blaming us is not going to solve them. We are not the root of the problem. He probably just needs to do a little more research.\u201d\n\nKGOU produces journalism in the public interest, essential to an informed electorate.
