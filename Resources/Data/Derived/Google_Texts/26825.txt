A Sand Springs woman was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs and child endangerment after police say she collided with two cars Friday afternoon while picking her son up from school.

Kristy Larie Terhune was arrested after she was in a traffic collision near 200 North Wilson, according to Sand Springs Police.

Witnesses told an investigating officer they had seen Terhune driving across lanes before she sideswiped a different car in the 1700 block of West Wekiwa then continued driving to North Wilson.

The officer interviewed the 36-year-old woman and said her speech was slow and lethargic.

When he asked her what caused her to collide with the other vehicle, Terhune reportedly said she had just picked up her son at school and may have been talking to him

Police asked Terhune if she was on any prescription drugs, and she said she took several prescriptions regularly including Flexeril, Xanax and Percocet, the arrest report states. The officer did field sobriety tests and said Terhune stumbled and swayed while performing them.

The driver of second car she had hit said they did not want to file an accident report because their car wasn't damaged. The driver of the car she had sideswiped showed up and handed police the driver side mirror off Terhune's vehicle which had been knocked off the car.

Terhune was booked on complaints of DUI drugs, first offense; child endangerment, and failure to carry insurance verification. She was released on bond.
