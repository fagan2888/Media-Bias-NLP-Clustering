PALM BEACH COUNTY EFFECTS

Within Palm Beach County, Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy’s District 18 and Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings’ District 23 would remain largely the same while many of the District 22 constituents now represented by Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, would become part of District 21, which is represented by Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton.

Deutch’s current District 21 generally includes voters west of Military Trail between Southern Boulevard and Clint Moore Road in Boca Raton, then west of Florida’s Turnpike from Clint Moore Road to the Broward County line. District 21 also includes portions of Broward County.

Frankel’s current District 22 includes coastal Broward County north of Fort Lauderdale and coastal Palm Beach County from the Broward County line to the northern end of the town of Palm Beach.

Under the maps released Wednesday, Frankel’s constituents north of Boca Raton would become part of District 21. Frankel’s home in West Palm Beach would become part of District 21, though House members are not required to live in the districts they represent.

When Broward County is included, the majority of the constituents Frankel now represents in District 22 would still be part of the new District 22. The majority of Deutch’s current District 21 constituents would still be part of the new District 21.
