Coasting is dangerous. I can\u2019t just play \u2018Bennie and the Jets\u2019 over and over again.\u201d\n\nBut John did play \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d during his concert at the university\u2019s 1,250-seat Bovard Auditorium, along with other hit classics including \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d and \u201cRocket Man.\u201d In introducing \u201cThe Greatest Discovery,\u201d he noted that the 1970 song had new meaning for him now that he\u2019s a father to sons Elijah, eight months, and Zachary, two, with spouse David Furnish.\n\nJohn also performed five of his new songs from \u201cThe Diving Board,\u201d which was produced by T-Bone Burnett, including \u201cHome Again,\u201d a song he said celebrates the feeling he has each time he walks through his back door after having been out on the road. The album, a return to John\u2019s piano-centric roots, is \u201cmature and reflective,\u201d said the singer, dressed in a sparkling black suit and hot pink socks. \u201cIt\u2019s a record by a 66-year-old man, not by a 26-year-old guy who made \u2018Rocket Man.\u2019 As you get older, you change. I haven\u2019t been on the radio, and rightly so, because it\u2019s other people\u2019s turn \u2013 but I\u2019m at an age where I can do what I want.\u201d\n\nHe may be changed, but John has still got it. Ushers passed out earplugs as concertgoers entered the venue, and three times the artist elicited standing ovations from the crowd. His voice roared, as strong as ever, and though he joked about not being able \u201cto beat the shit out of the piano\u201d in the way a guitarist could with a guitar, he did a pretty darn good job of it \u2013 even hopping on top of it during \u201cBennie.\u201d\n\n[youtube http://youtu.be/m-4ggMaSsNY]\n\nAbout 40 students from USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music were chosen to perform with John on stage, including string players, a harpist, and vocalist, and John was attentive and complimentary to them, at one point blowing them a kiss during his performance. He said, \u201cThere is an energy you have called youth that can change the world. I used to have it. I have energy now, but it\u2019s not like the energy you have in your 20s, and you\u2019re fearless and you go for broke.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, John shows all of us that courage is ageless, as he continues to put himself out there. \u201cI\u2019m not Lou Reed, I\u2019m not Neil Young, I\u2019m not Bob Dylan, but I\u2019m Elton, so I can still push things,\u201d he said. His undiminished passion is what makes his music so beautiful still.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Elton John, whose first solo studio album in seven years comes out today, told University of Southern California students treated to a free concert of his last week, \u201cYou have to keep trying and improving.
