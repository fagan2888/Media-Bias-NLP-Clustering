Colbert often mocked O\u2019Reilly and O\u2019Reilly rarely resisted the urge to fire back. Well, even though Colbert left The Colbert Report relieved he wouldn\u2019t have to watch O\u2019Reilly anymore, it\u2019s clear O\u2019Reilly\u2019s still keeping an eye on what Colbert is saying.\n\nO\u2019Reilly opened tonight\u2019s Factor by bemoaning the activist Supreme Court ruling in favor of Obamacare and gay marriage. O\u2019Reilly said on the latter, people deserve an \u201cequal shot to pursue happiness and prosperity,\u201d but no one should \u201cdemonize those who disagree.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when O\u2019Reilly brought up Colbert\u2019s video from last Friday celebrating the Supreme Court ruling and mocking Justice Antonin Scalia\u2018s dissent.\n\nO\u2019Reilly brought up how Colbert\u2019s going to be hosting The Late Show this fall opposite Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, and said, \u201cHe might want to think about alienating traditional Americans to the extent he has.
