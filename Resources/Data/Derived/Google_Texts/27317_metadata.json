And one would be hard pressed to identify a more destructive market failure than that which keeps one in three Americans \u2013- including tens of millions of full-time workers \u2013- living at or below the poverty line.\n\nAccording to economic theory, a free market transaction is one between two parties who both have perfect information about the state of the market \u2013 what others are paying for the same goods. Operating on a level playing field, free from explicit or implicit coercion, they each pursue their own interests, and in the end agree to a price that\u2019s no higher than what the market will bear.\n\nThat comes pretty close to describing salary negotiations between employers and highly skilled professionals, or unions representing large numbers of lower-wage workers. It bears little resemblance to a \u201cnegotiation\u201d between an individual who needs a low-wage job to survive and a huge company with teams of human resources experts and labor consultants.\n\n[O]ver ten million workers struggle beneath the poverty line, unable to afford the minimal costs of survival \u2013 for nutrition, housing and health care\u2026\n\nAs any introductory economics textbook will tell you, when a seller agrees to a price for his or her goods that\u2019s below what it costs to produce them, that\u2019s not a proper free market transaction. And yet, according to Census Bureau data, over ten million workers struggle beneath the poverty line , unable to afford the minimal costs of survival \u2013 for nutrition, housing and health care \u2013 and these people are selling their labor for less than it costs them to produce it.\n\nAs a result, taxpayers indirectly subsidize the profits of low-wage employers. Studies have found that workers at a single Wal-Mart receive as much as $900,000 in Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance, and that low-wage workers in the fast-food industry alone claim $7 billion per year in public benefits. It\u2019s remarkable that anyone who claims fealty to the free market would argue that this doesn\u2019t represent a market failure.\n\nThere are two obvious ways that the government could move to repair the failure in our market for low-wage labor. The first would be to remove the barriers to unionization that have gradually been put in place since the middle of the last century. According to recent surveys, 44 percent of non-union workers and 90 percent of union workers want to be represented by a union, but only around 11 percent of American workers \u2014 and just seven percent of the private sector workforce \u2014 is organized today.\n\nOr we can raise the minimum wage so that people who work full-time are guaranteed a livable wage without having to rely on the social safety net. Doing so would benefit not only those toiling at minimum wage jobs \u2013 as Benjamin Harris and Melissa Kearney of the Brooking Foundation point out, a minimum wage hike would have a \u201cripple effect\u201d on the entire lower-end of the labor market, increasing the incomes of about one third of the American workforce.\n\n(It would also increase consumer demand \u2014 people with lower incomes tend to spend any extra cash they get rather than banking it \u2014 creating a salutary circle of job creation and deficit reduction.)\n\nOpponents of minimum wage hikes argue that they\u2019re \u201cjob killers.\u201d Aside from the fact that the evidence doesn\u2019t support this claim \u2013 economist John Schmitt reviewed decades of empirical research on this question last year and concluded that raising the minimum has \u201cno discernible effect on employment\u201d \u2013- it\u2019s also inconsistent with free market theory. According to Econ 101 texts, if a firm can\u2019t turn a profit paying market prices for what it requires to produce its products \u2013 whether that\u2019s cement for construction or labor for flipping burgers \u2013- it should go out of business and be replaced by another firm with greater efficiency. This lies at the heart of what\u2019s known as \u201ccreative destruction\u201d \u2014 the process of building new enterprises on the ruins of older, less efficient ones \u2014 which is supposed to benefit the entire economy at the end of the day.\n\nAs a share of the overall economy, corporate profits are at an all-time high while wages \u2014 which have declined by seven percent over the past seven years after adjusting for inflation \u2013- are at an all-time low. This is a sign of a broken labor market, and raising the minimum wage would go a long way toward fixing it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In theory, everyone agrees that the government should step in to correct market failures.
