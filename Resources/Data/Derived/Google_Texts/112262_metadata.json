Wade Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion; had wanted the United States to expand, not end, the war in Vietnam; had supported apartheid, fought legislation forbidding discrimination against gays, spouted anti-Semitic rhetoric, and had voiced the opinion that the Anti-Christ walks among us as a Jewish male; had thought Chief Justice John Roberts not conservative enough, and, to top it off, showed de facto sympathy for al-Qaida by blaming Americans \u2013 especially gay and feminist Americans \u2013 for 9/11?\n\nWhat if this person had not even graduated from an accredited college himself? And what if he saw to it that at this university, a fairy-tale junk version of humankind\u2019s origins were favored in biology class over the one key fact \u2013 evolution through natural selection \u2014 on which all modern biology stands?\n\nIf you\u2019re a decent person, the answer would be no, of course.\n\nSuch a one, for those who haven\u2019t guessed, was Jerry Falwell, the Southern Baptist pastor and Moral Majority leader who constituted as malign an influence on America politics as ever existed, and whose considerable bulk crashed to the floor of his office one fine day back in 2007, never to rise again. (Moral Majority\u2019s aim: \u201cGet them saved, baptized and registered\u201d to vote.) The university in question is, of course, Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia. The \u201cmoderate,\u201d not-so-flagrantly pious Republican candidate-in-waiting Jeb Bush recently and publicly resurrected Falwell\u2019s ghost, praising his \u201clegacy\u201d and gushing over being able to visit his offspring, who now run the institution. A Roman Catholic himself, and so craving bona fides with Evangelical voters, Bush wallowed in this unction as he began the 2015 commencement address he delivered at Liberty on May 9. Though much of what he said amounted to the sanctimonious insipidities and saccharine, self-congratulatory platitudes Evangelicals habitually shower on one another, some of his words deserve scrutiny, for if Hillary falters, he may well end up in the White House come January 2017.\n\nDraped in what resembled monastic robes, Bush stood on the podium of Williams Stadium facing a crowd of 34,000, with \u201cLIBERTY UNIVERSITY \u2013 Training Champions for Christ since 1971\u201d emblazoned on the blue and white banner behind him. He reminded us that his father \u201cthought very highly\u201d of Jerry Falwell and \u201cknew him as a loyal friend.\u201d Former President George H. W. Bush was not as openly devout as his predecessor, the Falwell-enabler Ronald Reagan, yet he managed to offend rationalists all the same by opining that he wasn\u2019t sure \u201catheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.\u201d In view of this, and of his brother George\u2019s fulsome evangelical zealotry, that Jeb Bush should suffer from the malady of fervent faith seems understandable. In other words, it may not be an act, even if he was preaching to the \u201cwrong\u201d sect.\n\nFalwell, said Jeb Bush, \u201cturned his back on no one.\u201d Well, no one except gays, who, Falwell said, had to endure AIDS as \u201cGod\u2019s punishment,\u201d as does \u201cthe society that tolerates homosexuals.\u201d And at least for part of his too-long career, Falwell surely would also have turned his back on African-Americans. He boasted of having grown up in the \u201csegregated South,\u201d and believed that \u201cThe true Negro does not want integration. . . he realizes his potential is far better among his own race.\u201d\n\nBush informed his audience that theirs was \u201cthe greatest of all callings . . . to know, love, and serve the Lord, and it\u2019s yours by choice.\u201d Sticking to the straight and narrow while \u201cyoung and trying to live out the message of the Gospels\u201d was not easy, as \u201cThe world will never run short of competing offers.\u201d\n\nThey really should check out those \u201ccompeting offers.\u201d There are, surely, many highly intelligent students at Liberty; and now more than ever the world needs all the help it can get. What a pity that smart young people chose to waste their time, money, and brains parsing potentially unreliable translations of often violent, macabre fables composed before human beings knew they were primates, understood what caused illness, or had determined that the Earth revolved around the sun. What a shame that they should have passed four years learning the wrong answers to questions that trouble us all, questions of life\u2019s scope and purpose, of where we come from and what our place is in the cosmos. And what an outrage that in 21st century America, institutions such as Liberty can train classes of otherwise normal men and women in the art of toadying to a tyrant, and one who doesn\u2019t even exist. They have passed four years mastering the intricacies of a colossal sham, and they can\u2019t get those years back. What a waste.\n\nFor those who read the above words and wish to accuse me of being a \u201chater,\u201d let me say this: you\u2019re right. I hate that religion steals our funds \u2013 some $82.5 billion through tax exemptions in 2013 alone, for example \u2013 that we could have spent on our great needs, including rebuilding our infrastructure and bettering public education. I hate how its ignorant teachings about sex and reproduction cause unnecessary hardship, fostering underage pregnancies and the prevalence of STDs \u2013 all most problematic in the God-fearing red states. I loathe how it yearns for the world\u2019s demise, and even has 49 percent of Americans believing that climate change is just another inevitable sign of the End of Days.\n\nI\u2019m not the first to point these things out. Bush understood his audience would have already heard such words. \u201cHow strange, in our own time,\u201d he said, \u201cto hear Christianity spoken of as some sort of backward, oppressive force.\u201d Outside of Liberty, he added, \u201cit\u2019s a depressing fact that when some people think of Christianity and of Judeo-Christian values, they think of something static, narrow, and outdated.\u201d This \u201cunfair criticism\u201d could be taken \u201cas a further challenge to show in our lives the most dynamic, inclusive, and joyful message that ever came into the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfair criticism?\u201d Static is the essence of belief in the inerrancy of ancient texts; strictly mandating behaviors varying from the upbringing of children to the variety of sexual relations permitted is narrow; and outdated applies to addressing modern-day witch doctors for guidance on how to live. Apply such a \u201cstatic, narrow, and outdated\u201d approach to any other area of life and see how counterproductive it would be. Would you, say, entrust your health to a doctor who reassures you that he still follows instructions in the medical textbook he used while obtaining his M.D. three decades ago? Who avoids keeping abreast of developments in his specialty, and ignores the advice of his colleagues? Who insists on prescribing the treatments from centuries past? Unless you\u2019re a fan of lobotomies, leeches and bloodletting, no you would not.\n\n\u201cDynamic, inclusive, and joyful?\u201d We\u2019ve dispensed with \u201cdynamic\u201d above. \u201cInclusive\u201d denotes the polar opposite of what any of the three Abrahamic faiths has ever purported to be, with votaries of each doctrinally beholden to \u201crevelations\u201d declaring the singular salvific viability of their own particular cult. A cult doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201cinclusive\u201d if it ordains that anyone who accepts it qualifies for heaven; this excludes the inexorably expanding population of young rationalists, not to mention rival religionists. \u201cJoyful,\u201d if it is accurate at all, is contingent on the secular nature of our state today. When the religious ruled in Europe, things were somewhat less cheery, with the Church, among other things, tithing and taxing and amassing fortunes, deciding what was true and decent and permissible, impeding science and progress, and sending out sadists to disport themselves by methodically ripping off breasts, crushing skulls, and winding racks to snap apart bodies, joint by joint, as they coaxed confessions of \u201cheresy\u201d from innocents. That Christianity could now be called \u201cjoyful,\u201d thus, has everything to do with the wall of separation between church and state Jefferson built.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush is the latest GOP hopeful to cozy up to Liberty's evangelicals.
