Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Tenet Healthcare have come to a four-year deal that allows Carondelet Health Network and Abrazo Community Health Network to remain part of the local network in 2016, according to the local Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona.

Tenet Healthcare is the controlling entity for the two hospital systems.

Blue Cross Blue Shield Senior Vice President Jeff Stelnik said it took longer than anyone expected to reach an agreement, but did not give specific reasons for the delay.

The agreement is in effect for all lines of business including individual, group, federal employee program and Medicare Advantage.

"We are pleased it keeps reimbursement increases to market norm without jeopardizing the long-term affordability for our members," Stelnik said. "In the end, members can have peace of mind knowing they will continue to have the same in-network options to select from at a fair price."
