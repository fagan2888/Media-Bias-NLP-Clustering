It’s been a little over a year since Fitz and the Tantrums released its second album, “More Than Just a Dream,” but “we’re kind of at the halfway point” of the promotional cycle, lead singer Michael Fitzpatrick tells Billboard at the 2014 Governors Ball in New York.

Fitz and the Tantrums has already notched two No. 1s on Alternative Songs with "The Walker" and "Out of My League." As previously reported, the band is just the fourth act to take its first two Alternative Songs hits to No. 1 in the chart’s 25-year history.







“In about a month, we’re going to launch the third single, which is ‘Fools Gold,” Fitzpatrick says, noting that the band has toured nonstop behind "More Than Just a Dream."







“We’re really fortunate that we have a label in Atlantic Records that really believes in this album and sees four or five singles.”



Fitzpatrick says that with the band’s busy touring schedule, its members haven’t had a chance to start writing material for a third album.

“We always are trying to noodle around and start the seeds of ideas at sound checks,”the singer explains. “The way we approached it on this last record was when we’re done with the record cycle, we locked ourselves in a dungeon for months at a time and let our creative hats be the leader.”
