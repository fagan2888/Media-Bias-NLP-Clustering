Hackers may be using the comments section on WordPress sites to infiltrate servers.

Finnish security firm Klikki Oy uncovered the vulnerability in the popular WordPress platform, which Web developers use to build and host websites.

The flaw allows hackers to store malicious code in the comments section of a Web page. Then, when a logged-in administrator visits that page, the hacker could get into the server.

The defect could affect millions of heavily-trafficked pages. Nearly a quarter of the world’s 10 million most popular websites use WordPress.

“To prevent exploitation, administrators should disable comments,” the researchers at Klikki Oy said. “Do not approve any comments.”

WordPress told Forbes a fix was coming, but didn’t offer a specific timeline.

The ubiquity of WordPress has made it a popular target for hackers and security researchers alike. A recent update patched a number of vulnerabilities, including a similar comments section flaw that had been exposed for at least 14 months.

Another popular plugin that placed a “contact us” form on WordPress websites was found to be compromised last fall, allowing hackers to potentially download a site’s entire database.
