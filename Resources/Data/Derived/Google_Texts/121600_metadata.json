Andy Barr, R-Ky., yesterday challenged that claim during a hearing and told the story of of a small Kentucky company that was overwhelmed by related regulations.\n\nEx-Im Bank, an 80-year-old agency that provides taxpayer-backed loans to foreign companies and countries to buy U.S. products, has been at the center of contentious debate on Capitol Hill in recent weeks. Its charter expires Sept.30, and unless Congress acts, the bank will be closed to new business.\n\nFred Hochberg, Ex-Im\u2019s chairman, praised his institution for being a key partner for small businesses in his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re there when the private sector can\u2019t or won\u2019t,\u201d Hochberg told lawmakers.\n\nAccording to the agency\u2019s 2013 annual report, \u201cnearly 90 percent of Ex-Im\u2019s transitions directly benefited small businesses.\u201d Those firms, though, receive less than 20 percent of financing.\n\nDuring the hearing, Barr cited a small business in his district, Kentucky\u2019s sixth, that stopped working with Ex-Im because of its time-consuming, expensive, and burdensome regulations.\n\n\u2018No Difference in Sales\u2019\n\nLectroDryer, a manufacturer of liquid dryers, partnered with the bank for several years, according to agency records. The company benefited from $5.6 million in funds from Ex-Im from 2007 to 2013, and the agency said it supported $15.6 million in export sales during that time frame.\n\nLectroDryer\u2019s chief executive officer, John McPhearson, spoke with Barr\u2019s office Tuesday about his company\u2019s experience in working with Ex-Im. According to Barr, McPhearson said:\n\nWe reached the point where someone was working full time to make sure the reporting documents were filled out so we could continue to receive our line of credit. You simply can\u2019t take a company of only 70 employees and dedicate one entirely to filling out this kind of paperwork. If the Export-Import Bank went away, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference to me. \u2026 We have seen no difference in sales since we stopped working with Ex-Im Bank. The reason we stopped working with Ex-Im Bank was the cost and the complexity.\n\nSince 2001, LectroDryer has grown tremendously and expanded its business twice, according to local news reports. The company exports products to Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and South Korea, among others.\n\nBarr told fellow lawmakers Hochberg suggested his office reach out to the company as proof that Ex-Im helps companies grow from small businesses to international brands.\n\n\u2018Hope to Get It Right\u2019\n\nAfter hearing Barr\u2019s description of LectroDryer\u2019s experience, Hochberg said:\n\nWe\u2019re asked by this committee to do a better job of risk management, a better job of oversight, so I\u2019m trying to find a balance between supporting jobs and doing the job of oversight. I hope to get it right.\n\nIn addition to Barr, Republican lawmakers yesterday spoke out against Hochberg\u2019s contention that Ex-Im is a major supporter of small businesses nationwide.\n\n\u201cSo who benefits? Overwhelmingly \u2014 and indisputably \u2014 it\u2019s some of the largest, most politically connected corporations in the world, like Boeing, General Electric, Bechtel and Caterpillar,\u201d said Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who also pointed out more than half of Ex-Im\u2019s financing in 2013 went to \u201ca handful of Fortune 500 companies.\u201d\n\nThe bank follows the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s guidelines in defining a \u201csmall business.\u201d According to the SBA, a company in the manufacturing or wholesaling industries, which LectroDryer falls under, is considered a \u201csmall business\u201d if it employs between 500 and 1,500 employees.\n\nPickle Promotion\n\nHochberg has been known to woo crowds with stories of small businesses that hinged on Ex-Im\u2019s financial support. Diane Katz, a regulatory policy fellow at The Heritage Foundation, noted in a recent column the story of a company called Miss Jenny\u2019s Pickles. Katz wrote:\n\nHochberg often regales audiences with the story of how business owner Jenny Fulton was so inspired by a 2011 presentation he gave in Charlotte, N.C., that she ran to her car to retrieve a jar of pickles, thrust it into the hands of Hochberg\u2019s driver and instructed him make sure the bank president sampled some. So impressed was he with the product, evidently, that Ex-Im financing soon followed, and Miss Jenny\u2019s Pickles became a global sensation.\n\nBut, according to Katz, Miss Jenny\u2019s Pickles was a success long before Ex-Im\u2019s intervention. Fulton and co-owner Ashlee Furr secured shelf space in more than 600 U.S. stores, including Harris-Teeter, Whole Foods and Williams Sonoma. QVC also sold its products. In 2011, Miss Jenny\u2019s Pickles began exporting to 40 stores in China and had plans to expand to Mongolia and Canada.\n\nThe company, Katz said, first received $200,000 in credit insurance from the bank in 2013 and again in 2014. She concluded:\n\nThe bank\u2019s tale about Miss Jenny\u2019s Pickles makes for heart-tugging promotion. But Fulton and Furr, not Ex-Im, are the real architects of their success.\n\nCommittee\u2019s Call?\n\nThough lawmakers argue the merits of Ex-Im, Hensarling looks set on letting the agency\u2019s charter expire without any action by his committee to save it.\n\nFellow conservatives feared House leadership would bypass the Financial Services Committee and bring legislation to the floor, but Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said they would defer to Hensarling and his committee.\n\nThe Senate could act first in passing legislation extending Ex-Im\u2019s charter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
