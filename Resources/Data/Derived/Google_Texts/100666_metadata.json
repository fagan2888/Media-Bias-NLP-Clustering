That would cost more than it saves in the short term and not address the defense budget squeeze.\n\nThornberry and other defense hawks in the House and Senate are trying to lift defense budget caps that would keep 2016 defense spending at $523 billion.\n\nPresident Obama's own budget requests $561 billion for defense spending\n\nThornberry and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) say the defense budget should actually be at $577 billion \u2014 the level of spending intended before the defense caps kicked into place.\n\nThornberry also said Pentagon data on excess bases was outdated, and that the military needed to see how many of those were still unneeded before making any new decisions.\n\nThe Pentagon maintains there is at least 20 percent excess infrastructure, but Thornberry said that number is from before 2005.\n\n\"That's more than 10 years old,\" Thornberry said.\n\n\"I'm not sure our members are persuaded that we should embark upon another BRAC ... with so much uncertainty about what's happening in the world with what our force structure ought to be, and what bases, training ranges and so forth, are required to support that force structure,\" he continued.\n\n\"Once you give up a base or a training range, it's gone for good,\" said Thornberry. \"You're not going to get it back, and so you better be really careful that you know you'll never need it before you start giving things away.\"\n\nThornberry said the House Armed Services subcommittees would mark up their portions of the defense budget the week of April 20, and the full committee would mark up their budget the week of April 29.\n\nA full vote is tentatively scheduled to take place the week of May 13, he said.\n\n-- Updated at 4:41 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"I'm not sure we can afford another BRAC,\" Rep.
