After pleading guilty, he was subject to the federal law barring convicted felons from possessing firearms.\n\nHenderson said his weapons collection, which had been confiscated by the FBI, legally belonged to him and sought to sell them to a friend or transfer ownership to his wife. A lower court determined Henderson had \"unclean hands\" and was not allowed to profit from the sale, even though the weapons were not involved in a crime.\n\nKagan wrote Henderson could not \"place those guns in a secure trust for distribution to his children after his death. He could not sell them to someone halfway around the world. He could not even donate them to a law enforcement agency.\" If the guns were involved in a crime, then the felon would lose the ability to transfer or sell them, Kagan wrote.\n\n\"It's a hands-down victory for the little guy,\" Henderson's attorney, Daniel Ortiz, told The Wall Street Journal. \"In victimless crimes, it will allow people to better support their families and, in others, it will provide a way to better provide compensation to the victims themselves.\"\n\nAlso on Monday, the Supreme Court sided with two San Francisco police officers in the 2008 shooting of a mentally ill woman when she resisted being moved from a private room in a group home to a psychiatric facility. In siding with the police, the court ruled they were immune from claims they violated her Fourth Amendment rights when they entered the room. The court did not address the main issue in the case: whether the Americans with Disabilities Act applies in these kinds of confrontations.\n\nThe court also unanimously decided to tighten the rules for allowing federal prisoners to file lawsuits without paying filing fees and ruled that Maryland had violated the Constitution by collecting taxes for income earned in other states without giving a credit for taxes paid to those states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that felons may be able to transfer their legally owned guns to someone else rather than surrender them to the government.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that felons may be able to transfer their legally owned guns to someone else rather than surrender them to the government.", "title": "Supreme Court rules felons can sell, transfer guns", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/05/19/Supreme-Court-rules-felons-can-sell-transfer-guns/3291432041610/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3291432041610/2015/1/c05fcf640f18c290a4f05e8039d2bc87/v2.1/Supreme-Court-rules-felons-can-sell-transfer-guns.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3291432041610/2015/upi/c05fcf640f18c290a4f05e8039d2bc87/v2.1/Supreme-Court-rules-felons-can-sell-transfer-guns.jpg?lg=4", "description": "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that felons may be able to transfer their legally owned guns to someone else rather than surrender them to the government.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Supreme Court rules felons can sell, transfer guns"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Border Patrol, Elena Kagan, Marijuana, Supreme Court", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Border Patrol, Elena Kagan, Marijuana, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab29\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON, May 19 (UPI) -- The Supreme Court has ruled that convicted felons may be able to transfer their legally owned guns to someone else rather than surrender them to the government.\nIn siding with the police, the court ruled they were immune from claims they violated her Fourth Amendment rights when they entered the room.\nAfter pleading guilty, he was subject to the federal law barring convicted felons from possessing firearms.\nIf the guns were involved in a crime, then the felon would lose the ability to transfer or sell them, Kagan wrote.\nKagan wrote Henderson could not \"place those guns in a secure trust for distribution to his children after his death."}
