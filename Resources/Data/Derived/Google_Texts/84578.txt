LITTLE ROCK, AR -- One after another demonstrators were loaded onto city buses and taken away.



They were members of the group ADAPT who came to have their voices heard.



"You can expect more of this as we push harder and harder," said one demonstrator, a polio survivor, who traveled from Philadelphia to participate in the demonstration Little Rock.



Local members of ADAPT were joined by members from around the country, protesting at the headquarters of the Arkansas Healthcare Association at the Victory building in downtown.



They say the organization, which represents nursing homes, is lobbying to block the state from accepting a federal program providing funding so more of the disabled can get care at home.



The program is called the Community First Choice Option. It's part of the federal Affordable Care Act. States can decide whether or not to opt in.



"Give people the options they want to live out in the community and be a part of their community instead of being stuck away in a nursing home," said Brenda Stinebuck with ADAPT's Arkansas chapter.



In an act of civil disobedience, 36 protesters were arrested after refusing to follow police orders to leave the building.



"They were given the option to leave or be arrested and charged for criminal trespass," said Sgt. Cassandra Davis with the Little Rock Police Department.



After being loaded up on those city buses, demonstrators were taken to another location where they were issued trespassing citations and then released. Police say they were not taken to jail.



KARK 4 News tried getting in contact with the Arkansas Healthcare Association to get its take on the protest, but a phone call and email have not been returned .
