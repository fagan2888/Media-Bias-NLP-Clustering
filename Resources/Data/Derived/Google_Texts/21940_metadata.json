Ritch was convicted of Medicaid fraud, identity theft and operating an unlicensed health-care clinic, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

Ritch was arrested in June 2013 and accused of submitting about 800 false claims.\n\nIn Orange County, speech therapist Tiffany Campbell was arrested Friday for filing records for therapy she never rendered and led her employer to bill Medicaid for more than $8,000, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Parents of Campbell\u2019s patients, who ranged in age from 3 to 13, claimed she regularly canceled appointments. She could face up to $10,000 in fines or up to five years in prison.\n\nFinally, in Naples, sentencing has been delayed for the mother-and-son owners of Sunshine Pharmacy. Del Parrish and Patricia Parrish were scheduled to be sentenced today after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud for false billings to Medicaid, Medicare and Tricare, according to the Naples Daily News.
