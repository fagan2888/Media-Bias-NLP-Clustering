*In a nod to President Barack Obama surpassing his goal of 7 million Americans signing up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the April 14 issue of “The New Yorker” shows him forcing the victory down his haters’ throats.

The illustration shows Obama gleefully feeding medicine to a little boy – a.k.a. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky).
