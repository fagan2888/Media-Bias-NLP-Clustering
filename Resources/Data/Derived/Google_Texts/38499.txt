The North Carolina Department of Transportation’s Traveler Information Management System regularly sends traffic alerts through email and Twitter about any accidents or road work that may impact commuters. This week, the system sent an alert warning drivers that an accident had closed an exit ramp near Raleigh, but rather than leave it at that, the notice went on to blame the incident on “women drivers, rain, Obamacare.”

“Stay home,” the notice concluded.

And no, the system wasn’t hacked. The alert was sent out by a DOT employee who thinks petty sexism is hilarious.
