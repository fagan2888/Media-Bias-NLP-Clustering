Although DHS has the second largest motor vehicle fleet in the federal government costing about $534 million every year, auditors say the department has no system in place to ensure they\u2019re used effectively.\n\nRelated: Post Office Paid $287K for Trucks It Can\u2019t Find\n\nThe IG report said that 59 percent of the department\u2019s vehicles were driven less than 12,000 miles a year. Those vehicles are still sitting in DHS\u2019s inventory, despite federal protocol, which would require them to be disposed of or reassigned\n\nThe problem is each agency within the department manages its own fleet, and the department\u2019s central fleet manager doesn\u2019t have authority to manage each agency\u2019s separate fleets. \u201cFor these reasons, DHS cannot ensure its vehicle fleet composition is cost efficient, complies with departmental requirements, and has the correct number of motor vehicles to accomplish its mission,\u201d the IG said.\n\nAuditors also flagged DHS for failing to meet new standards put in place by the Obama administration requiring all newly purchased vehicles to be either electric, hybrid or alternatively fueled. The IG said just four percent of the department\u2019s new vehicles fit that category in 2012.\n\nRelated: DHS Winks at Workers Stealing Unearned Overtime\n\nThe IG recommended that the DHS create a streamlined system to report every agency\u2019s fleet within the department in order to create more oversight as well as increase the fleet manager\u2019s authority over all fleets. The agency says it will implement those recommendations next year, according to Government Executive.\n\nThis is just the latest report of lax oversight at DHS that has led to millions and sometimes billions of wasted tax dollars.\n\nEarlier this year, The Washington Post reported that the department\u2019s massive new headquarters in Washington, D.C., have spiraled over budget by $1.5 billion and are still far from being completed, due to severe management and oversight issues.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Federal auditors have also flagged the department multiple times for routine abuse of federal overtime money. A federal investigation last year found that DHS workers had claimed more than $8.7 million a year in unearned overtime pay, while their managers looked the other way.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid federal budget cuts, pay freezes and furloughs, the Department of Homeland Securi", "title": "Millions Wasted by DHS on Unused Vehicles", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/03/Millions-Wasted-DHS-Unused-Vehicles", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/03/Millions-Wasted-DHS-Unused-Vehicles", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Amid federal budget cuts, pay freezes and furloughs, the Department of Homeland Securi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4e25\"", "article_summary": "This is just the latest report of lax oversight at DHS that has led to millions and sometimes billions of wasted tax dollars.\nA new report by the DHS inspector general found that in 2012 the department spent between $35 million and $49 million on underused vehicles.\nRelated: Post Office Paid $287K for Trucks It Can\u2019t FindThe IG report said that 59 percent of the department\u2019s vehicles were driven less than 12,000 miles a year.\nAmid federal budget cuts, pay freezes and furloughs, the Department of Homeland Security spent tens of millions of dollars on agency vehicles that were hardly ever used.\nThe IG said just four percent of the department\u2019s new vehicles fit that category in 2012."}
