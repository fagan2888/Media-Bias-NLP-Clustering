Eighty percent of African-Americans lean Democrat, compared to 11 percent who lean Republican. Asians and Hispanics also were more likely to respond that they lean Democrat.\n\nPew also studied the leanings of each generation. Millennials are most likely to lean Democrat, and older Americans lean Republican.\n\nThe study concludes that Mormons, white evangelical Protestants and white southerners are among the groups that are the most reliably Republican, and African-Americans, Asians and those who don\u2019t identify with a particular religion are among the most reliably Democrat.\n\nThe study draws from information gathered in over 25,000 interviews conducted by Pew in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Which party do they lean towards?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Which party do they lean towards?", "title": "Number of Independents Increases", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/410indies.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FhXps8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Which party do they lean towards?", "title": "Number of Independents Increases", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/410indies.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2015-04-10T13:29:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Republicans Democrats, demographics, voters, race, religion, gender"}, "article_summary": "Millennials are most likely to lean Democrat, and older Americans lean Republican.\nForty-nine percent of whites responded that they lean Republican, 40 percent lean Democrat.\nEighty percent of African-Americans lean Democrat, compared to 11 percent who lean Republican.\nAsians and Hispanics also were more likely to respond that they lean Democrat.\nA new study provides insights into which demographics of the American public identify with each political party."}
