Even accounting for growth that\u2019s expected to drive the global population to 9.6 billion people by that year, ADI\u2019s projection suggests that the percentage of people with Alzheimer\u2019s will more than double from about 0.6 percent today to 1.4 percent in 2050, largely due to increasing life expectancy in developing countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a global epidemic and it is only getting worse,\u201d said Marc Wortmann, executive director of Alzheimer Disease International. \u201cIf we look into the future the numbers of elderly people will rise dramatically.\u201d\n\nGlobal life expectancy ballooned from a worldwide average of 47 years in the 1950s to 69 years between 2005 and 2010, according to the United Nations. By 2050, developing countries\u2019 life expectancy is projected to hover near the mid-70s \u2014 an approximate ten-year increase from the current average and a striking 30-year improvement from the 1950s.\n\nSince a person\u2019s risk for Alzheimer\u2019s increases steadily every ten years, it follows that Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia cases will concurrently surge in those nations:\n\nCREDIT: Alzheimer\u2019s Association\n\nNearly three-quarters of all Alzheimer\u2019s cases are expected to be in middle-income and developing nations by 2050.\n\nAs for the United States, where Alzheimer\u2019s is the sixth-leading cause of death and one in three seniors dies with some form of dementia, the Centers for Disease Control predicts that annual treatment costs for the disease could reach a staggering one trillion dollars per year by the middle of the 21st century. Treating Americans with Alzheimer\u2019s and other degenerative illnesses cost $200 billion in 2012, including $140 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nResearchers and medical professional emphasize that early detection and intervention is key to reducing Alzheimer\u2019s mortality rates.\n\n\u201cAn intervention to delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s by five years could halve the number of people who die with the disease, having a transformative impact on millions of people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Rebecca Wood, head of Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK. \u201cThis progress can only come through research and these figures are a timely reminder of the scale of the challenge ahead of the G8 dementia research summit.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, British scientists expressed hope that an experimental drug involving monthly injections could prevent the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s, and that a breakthrough in the drug therapy is possible within the next five years.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A projected surge in developing nations' life expectancy is expected to more than double the percentage of the world's population with Alzheimer's by 2050.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A projected surge in developing nations' life expectancy is expected to more than double the percentage of the world's population with Alzheimer's by 2050.", "title": "Driven By Developing Nations, Global Alzheimer\u2019s Cases Set To Triple By 2050", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/05/3025181/alzheimers-triple-2050/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_alzheimers-e1386259749654.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A projected surge in developing nations' life expectancy is expected to more than double the percentage of the world's population with Alzheimer's by 2050.", "title": "Driven By Developing Nations, Global Alzheimer\u2019s Cases Set To Triple By 2050", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_alzheimers-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_alzheimers-e1386259749654.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_alzheimers-e1386259749654.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-05T12:53:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde686\"", "article_summary": "Health Driven By Developing Nations, Global Alzheimer\u2019s Cases Set To Triple By 2050 CREDIT: ShutterstockOne week before the G8 dementia summit in London, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International (ADI) announced that the number of people with Alzheimer\u2019s worldwide will triple from 44 million today to 135 million by 2050.\nSince a person\u2019s risk for Alzheimer\u2019s increases steadily every ten years, it follows that Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia cases will concurrently surge in those nations:CREDIT: Alzheimer\u2019s AssociationNearly three-quarters of all Alzheimer\u2019s cases are expected to be in middle-income and developing nations by 2050.\nBy 2050, developing countries\u2019 life expectancy is projected to hover near the mid-70s \u2014 an approximate ten-year increase from the current average and a striking 30-year improvement from the 1950s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a global epidemic and it is only getting worse,\u201d said Marc Wortmann, executive director of Alzheimer Disease International.\n\u201cAn intervention to delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s by five years could halve the number of people who die with the disease, having a transformative impact on millions of people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Rebecca Wood, head of Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK."}
