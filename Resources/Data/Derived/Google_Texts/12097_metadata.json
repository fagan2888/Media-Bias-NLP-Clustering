Ryan, though, said holding the vote was critical to drawing distinctions for voters ahead of November\u2019s election, which all sides agree is Republicans\u2019 last best chance to undo the 2010 health law.\n\nSEE ALSO: Democrats tell GOP to disband Planned Parenthood \u2018witch hunt\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat we are proving today that is if we have a Republican president next year, we will repeal Obamacare and we will replace Obamacare,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\n\nArmed with twin majorities in Congress, the GOP used a fast-track process known as \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d to pass a filibuster-proof repeal bill in the Senate and gut the Affordable Care Act\u2019s unpopular mandates and taxes, while phasing out its core benefits.\n\nThe bill also would have defunded Planned Parenthood for one year, a response to undercover videos that showed organization officials negotiating the sale of fetal body parts. That infuriated Democrats, who pointed to a Texas grand jury\u2019s decision last week to indict the activists who launched the video sting.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ryan raises issue of visa waivers in first meeting with Obama\n\nMr. Obama vetoed the reconciliation package last month, and an override was never likely, but Republicans held the vote anyway.\n\nObamacare is stalling out in its third year, they argue, and constituents want to be shielded from unpopular mandates and coverage requirements that kicked people off bare-bones plans they liked.\n\n\u201cThe president is the only person standing in the way of what the American people want,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, Georgia Republican.\n\nNew and returning Obamacare customers had until Sunday to select 2016 coverage on Obamacare\u2019s Web-based exchanges. The administration declared victory even as it continued to tally its customer base, boasting they\u2019d beaten last year\u2019s enrollment total, and that enrollees were younger and healthier than in previous rounds. It also said HealthCare.gov is on solid footing after a notorious, glitch-filled start in 2013 tarnished the website\u2019s reputation.\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday said repeated efforts to undo Obamacare were \u201ccallous\u201d attempts to deny health care to 22 million Americans.\n\n\u201cHere we go again \u2014 and again and again. How fitting it is that here we are on Groundhog Day?\u201d Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Maryland Democrat, said, alluding to a 1993 film in which a weatherman relives the same day over and over again.\n\nMr. Van Hollen said Republican had \u201ca lot of gall\u201d for going after Planned Parenthood, just one week after the Texas grand jury came down hard on its foes.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has maintained it did nothing wrong, but Republican leaders have long said its abortion practice does not deserve taxpayer support.\n\nIn October, the House set up a select committee to investigate the organization and other abortion providers that harvest fetal tissue for research.\n\nFive pro-choice Democrats told Mr. Ryan to disband the taxpayer-funded probe Tuesday, dubbing it a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that\u2019s been fully discredited by 12 state-level investigations in the organization.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, backed by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Reps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois.\n\nLeading pro-life Republicans were unbowed by the demands, saying Planned Parenthood was caught red-handed in gruesome and potentially illegal activity.\n\n\u201cHave we lost our capacity to be shocked?\u201d said Rep. Chris Smith, New Jersey Republican.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Democrats sustained President Obama's veto of an Obamacare repeal Tuesday, defeating the GOP's deepest salvo yet against the controversial health law but delivering a rallying cry to conservative Republicans in a pivotal election year.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Democrats sustained President Obama\u2019s veto of an Obamacare repeal Tuesday, defeating the GOP\u2019s deepest salvo yet against the controversial health law but delivering a rallying cry to conservative Republicans in a pivotal election year.", "title": "Obamacare repeal vote by GOP stymied by Democrats", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/2/obamacare-repeal-vote-gop-stymied-democrats/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/21/van_hollen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/21/van_hollen.jpg", "title": "Obamacare repeal vote by GOP stymied by Democrats", "description": "House Democrats sustained President Obama's veto of an Obamacare repeal Tuesday, defeating the GOP's deepest salvo yet against the controversial health law but delivering a rallying cry to conservativ", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: Democrats tell GOP to disband Planned Parenthood \u2018witch hunt\u2019\u201cWhat we are proving today that is if we have a Republican president next year, we will repeal Obamacare and we will replace Obamacare,\u201d said Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\nLeading pro-life Republicans were unbowed by the demands, saying Planned Parenthood was caught red-handed in gruesome and potentially illegal activity.\nThe bill also would have defunded Planned Parenthood for one year, a response to undercover videos that showed organization officials negotiating the sale of fetal body parts.\nDemocrats on Tuesday said repeated efforts to undo Obamacare were \u201ccallous\u201d attempts to deny health care to 22 million Americans.\nHouse Democrats sustained President Obama\u2019s veto of an Obamacare repeal Tuesday, defeating the GOP\u2019s deepest salvo yet against the health care law but delivering a rallying cry to conservative Republicans in a pivotal election year."}
