The report found that 39 percent of people over age 65 battle at least one disability, and the most common hurdle they face is serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs.\n\nThe ranks of older, disabled adults could swell rapidly, the report cautioned, as the number of aging baby boomers increases. Such disabilities mean more Americans losing independence and relying on costly, long-term health services.\n\nWhich is why researchers are redoubling efforts to pinpoint the elders most likely to become disabled, and craft simple exercise programs to stem the downward slide.\n\nDr. Jonathan Bean, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a researcher at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network, is tracking about 350 older adults, including Selenkow, and has found that building core \u2014 also known as abdomen \u2014 strength, and leg speed are vital to keeping elders independent.\n\nMost programs, he said, tend to focus on leg strength and flexibility in knees and ankles. But a strong core and the ability to walk quickly can mean the difference between an elder being able to walk across the street before a traffic light changes, and being homebound, relying on someone else to run errands, he said.\n\nNow, Bean is working with researchers at Boston University to measure the effectiveness of a program that teaches elders exercises via an iPad.\n\nIt is designed to improve their mobility and assess their performance through videos and live online chats with therapists. The theory is that it will help seniors who have trouble getting to a physician\u2019s office stick with rehab longer while saving money \u2014 for the patient and the health care system.\n\n\u201cMedicine needs to look through a different lens in order to help people in the best way possible,\u201d Bean said.\n\nAnother study, the largest and longest-running trial of its kind, found that regular physical activity in older adults measurably reduced mobility problems compared with a program that offered health education and stretching.\n\nThe study included roughly 1,600 sedentary volunteers, age 70 to 89, who already had mobility problems. It was conducted in eight health centers across the country, including Tufts University, and followed the participants for nearly three years.\n\nElders in the activity group worked toward a goal of walking 2 1/2 hours weekly, in addition to 20 minutes daily improving balance, leg strength, and flexibility through exercises they were taught to do at home.\n\n\u201cMany of these people could not walk two, or three, or four minutes without stopping, but by the end, many could walk 20 to 30 minutes,\u201d said Roger Fielding, senior scientist and director of Tufts\u2019s Nutrition, Exercise Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory.\n\n\u201cThe thing older people fear the most is losing their independence,\u201d Fielding said. \u201cThis showed that a regular, structured program of physical activity could preserve independence, even in at-risk older adults.\u201d\n\nPostponing nursing home admissions by six months, for instance, could have a tremendous impact on health care costs, said Dr. Jack Guralnik, who spent 25 years studying disabilities at the National Institute on Aging.\n\n\u201cMany older people will have an event, a catastrophic hip fracture, or a stroke, and it\u2019s obvious how they became disabled,\u201d said Guralnik.\n\n\u201cBut many older people kind of drift downhill, and we don\u2019t really understand how they got there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t really intervene, until we understand it better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/03/active_seniors.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Most programs, he said, tend to focus on leg strength and flexibility in knees and ankles.\nIt is designed to improve their mobility and assess their performance through videos and live online chats with therapists.\nA December U.S. Census Bureau report suggests Selenkow is in the minority of older Americans.\nThe study included roughly 1,600 sedentary volunteers, age 70 to 89, who already had mobility problems.\nSuch disabilities mean more Americans losing independence and relying on costly, long-term health services."}
