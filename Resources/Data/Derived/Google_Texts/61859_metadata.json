As the law\u2019s designers intended, a small company could go onto the exchanges and compare the virtues of competing plans. It could then offer its employees a choice from among several policies, even from different carriers \u2014 a benefit few companies now use. It could enroll in those plans online, and if the business were small enough, it could get temporary tax credits to offset the cost.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace is still the most important provision in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses,\u201d said John Arensmeyer, chief executive of the liberal-leaning Small Business Majority in November, after the Obama administration announced that it would delay online enrollment in the 32 Small Business Health Options exchanges operated by the federal government until next October (the rest are operated by individual states and Washington, D.C.). Earlier in the year, the administration had restricted businesses to choosing just one exchange plan in 2014.\n\nWhile the travails of the federally run SHOP exchanges have been widely reported, many of the state-run exchanges \u2014 which together could serve about two-fifths of the nation\u2019s small businesses \u2014 have faced their own problems in attempting to field a small-business health insurance exchange.\n\nFive states have faced delays in implementing important elements of their exchanges. In California, which has by far the largest population of businesses with fewer than 50 employees, small businesses could not enroll in an insurance plan until Nov. 25. Prior to that, businesses could register online, but had to contact an insurance agent to get a rate quote.\n\nRoy Kennedy, a spokesman for Covered California, the state\u2019s exchange, said that the state pushed back SHOP\u2019s enrollment function in order to concentrate on deploying the insurance exchange for the individual market. \u201cWe felt comfortable doing this because SHOP is open year round and business owners could work through an agent to get a quote,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nFour other states \u2014 Idaho, Maryland, Mississippi, and Oregon \u2014 have yet to deploy a functioning SHOP exchange at all. A spokesperson for the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange said the small-business exchange will open next April; the other states have yet to announce start-up dates. A spokesperson for the Idaho exchange said the state had hoped to rely on the federal marketplace for the first year, but in its absence, as of last week, businesses can enroll in a SHOP plan through insurance agents and carriers. The state anticipates deploying its own fully functioning portal by next fall.\n\nIn Washington State, the SHOP exchange is only available to businesses in two rural counties in the state\u2019s southwest corner. This is because not enough insurance carriers were willing to participate in the exchange, at least at first, according to Bethany Frey, a spokesperson for the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. \u201cMany insurance carriers told us this was a resource issue as they needed to prioritize products for the individual market this first year,\u201d Ms. Frey said, adding that she expected to have a statewide network in 2015. \u201cOur system was fully prepared to offer coverage statewide. This wasn\u2019t a technology issue or delay.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, businesses in any state that want to offer health insurance to employees \u2014 and no company with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees is obliged to provide the coverage \u2014 can do so. They can either renew their existing policies or buy new policies that comply with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s various standards on the private market. And last week, the Obama administration made it easier for businesses in Washington state shut out from a SHOP insurance plan to use the tax credits in 2014. (The administration did not make any provisions for businesses in Maryland, Mississippi and Oregon, but Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is administering the federal exchanges, said, \u201cWe are examining ways that eligible small businesses in these states can take advantage of the tax credits next year, and those discussions are ongoing.\u201d)\n\nYet even in states where the roll out appears to have gone relatively smoothly, interest in the SHOP exchanges appears to be low. Lev Ginsburg, of the Business Council of New York, a trade association, said that he had not heard of many problems with implementing the state\u2019s exchange. But, he said, few businesses seem to be interested in using it, and those that do find the process laborious. \u201cThe time that brokers are spending with their clients has grown threefold or fourfold,\u201d Mr. Ginsburg said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the end result is any different \u2014 they\u2019re walking away with the product from the broker not from the SHOP, and they\u2019re walking away with the same product that they would have had anyway. They just have dozens and dozens of questions that they didn\u2019t have a year ago.\u201d New York has declined to release figures for how many businesses have enrolled in insurance through its SHOP exchange, or even registered an account, the first step toward obtaining coverage.\n\nAmong states that have released that information, the share of businesses eligible to participate in SHOP that have created accounts is often at about 2 percent or less. In New Mexico, where the figure for account creation is higher, at about 4 percent, only 44 businesses have enrolled for coverage beginning Jan. 1, said Debra Hammer, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange.\n\nIn Colorado, about 3,000 businesses have opened accounts on the SHOP exchange, said exchange spokeswoman Myung Oak Kim, out of somewhere between 111,000 to 120,000 eligible businesses, according to Census data. But Fort Collins Nursery is not among them. Its owner, Jesse Eastman, said he chose to renew the existing coverage for a dozen or so full-time employees rather than test the unknown. \u201cWe decided to opt to see where the chips are going to fall, and keep the plan we know,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, Mr. Eastman is missing out on the chance to offer his employees a choice of health plans, an efficiency that until now has been largely limited to bigger companies. In recent years, some insurers have quietly begun offering multiple plans to small businesses, but with restrictions, and offering employees choices from more than one insurer remains especially difficult. On a SHOP exchange, however, which is built for comparing policies and centralizing payment and other administrative functions, choice is not only possible, it is required.\n\n\u201cChoice between carriers is a unique value proposition for a SHOP exchange that wants to do that,\u201d said Jon Kingsdale, a consultant and the founding director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, the insurance exchange created by that state\u2019s overhaul in 2006. But, he said, \u201cit\u2019s more complicated for the employer, and it requires a very aggressive, sophisticated sales effort on the part of the SHOP exchange to promote that value. And the exchanges by and large are just having enough trouble getting up and running, so that most of them have not focused on a sophisticated sales effort with SHOP for small employers.\u201d (Some states, like the federal government, are limiting choice across insurers to a single tier of cost-sharing set by the employer.)\n\nMr. Arensmeyer, of the Small Business Majority, said it would take at least a year to get a true sense of how the exchanges are working. But, he added, \u201cwe\u2019re not surprised that the numbers are low, and we\u2019re not expecting a dramatic increase immediately. I think it\u2019s a process to get small-business owners, and perhaps even more importantly, brokers and agents, up to speed on all the processes and how to fully use the new system.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the success of the small-business exchanges is going to be very heavily dependent on brokers and agents,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do expect over time that the marketplaces will drive more competition, and will provide more choice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131223070003, "BN": "boss", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "boss", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/boss/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 23, 2013", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Insurance,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,The Agenda", "GBLC": "The Agenda", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/Small Businesses Showing Little Interest in State SHOP Exchanges ( 20131223 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robb Mandelbaum", "SCG": "boss", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robb Mandelbaum", "byl": "Robb Mandelbaum", "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/small-businesses-showing-little-interest-in-state-shop-exchanges/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "In part, it\u2019s because businesses that want to offer health insurance to employees can find other ways to do so.", "card": "summary", "title": "Small Businesses Showing Little Interest in State SHOP Exchanges"}, "blogpostid": 100000002617286, "description": "In part, it\u2019s because businesses that want to offer health insurance to employees can find other ways to do so.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 23, 2013", "article": {"tag": "The Agenda", "published_time": 1387800003, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-12-23T13:42:52-05:00"}, "utime": 20131223134252, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131223, "pdate": 20131223, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Insurance;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Small Business", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "You\u2019re the Boss Blog", "description": "In part, it\u2019s because businesses that want to offer health insurance to employees can find other ways to do so.", "title": "Small Businesses Showing Little Interest in State SHOP Exchanges", "url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/small-businesses-showing-little-interest-in-state-shop-exchanges/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/small-businesses-showing-little-interest-in-state-shop-exchanges/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Small Businesses Showing Little Interest in State SHOP Exchanges", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6df\"", "article_summary": "For advocates of the Affordable Care Act, a central reform to help small businesses buy health insurance was the creation of state-run exchanges.\nIn Washington State, the SHOP exchange is only available to businesses in two rural counties in the state\u2019s southwest corner.\nIn California, which has by far the largest population of businesses with fewer than 50 employees, small businesses could not enroll in an insurance plan until Nov. 25.\nFour other states \u2014 Idaho, Maryland, Mississippi, and Oregon \u2014 have yet to deploy a functioning SHOP exchange at all.\nIn Colorado, about 3,000 businesses have opened accounts on the SHOP exchange, said exchange spokeswoman Myung Oak Kim, out of somewhere between 111,000 to 120,000 eligible businesses, according to Census data."}
