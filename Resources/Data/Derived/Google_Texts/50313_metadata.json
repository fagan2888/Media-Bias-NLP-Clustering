A drug addict. A devastated young mother whose six-year-old son had recently drowned in a swimming pool accident.\n\nThese are the vulnerable women who alleged that comedian Bill Cosby sexually preyed on them over a span of five decades. The Washington Post reports new details of their experiences this morning, amid a firestorm of controversy surrounding the comedian\u2019s alleged behavior. At this point, 16 women have accused Cosby of sexually assaulting them; 12 say he drugged them before forcing himself upon them, while another woman says that Cosby unsuccessfully attempted to drug her. As the Post reports:\n\nThe allegations are strung together by perceptible patterns that appear and reappear with remarkable consistency: mostly young, white women without family nearby; drugs offered as palliatives; resistance and pursuit; accusers worrying that no one would believe them; lifelong trauma. There is also a pattern of intense response by Cosby\u2019s team of attorneys and publicists, who have used the media and the courts to attack the credibility of his accusers.\n\nIndeed, it was the fear of near-certain demonization and disbelief that prevented many accusers from coming forward.\n\n\u201cWho was going to believe me?\u201d writer Joan Tarshis, who says Cosby forced oral sex on her in the 1960s, said. \u201cIf he was a regular joe, I might have done something.\u201d\n\nFormer Playboy Playmate Victoria Valentino \u2014 the accuser whose six-year-old son drowned in a swimming pool \u2014 voiced similar fears.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of credibility did I have?\u201d she said. \u201cIn those days, it was always the rape victim who wound up being victimized. You didn\u2019t want to go to the police. That\u2019s the last thing you wanted to do back then.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In extensive new report, Cosby accusers detail decades-long damage", "title": "\u201c44 years later it makes me feel shameful\u201d: Horrific new revelations as Cosby accusers speak out", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In extensive new report, Cosby accusers detail decades-long damage", "title": "\u201c44 years later it makes me feel shameful\u201d: Horrific new revelations as Cosby accusers speak out", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/23/44_years_later_it_makes_me_feel_shameful_horrific_new_revelations_as_cosby_accusers_speak_out/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/bill_cosby3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In extensive new report, Cosby accusers detail decades-long damage", "title": "\u201c44 years later it makes me feel shameful\u201d: Horrific new revelations as Cosby accusers speak out", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/bill_cosby3.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bill cosby, Rape, Rape Culture, Sex, Sex abuse, Sexual assault, Washington Post", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd608\"", "article_summary": "Topics: bill cosby, Rape, Rape Culture, Sex, Sex abuse, Sexual assault, Washington Post, Entertainment News, NewsAn alcoholic.\nThe Washington Post reports new details of their experiences this morning, amid a firestorm of controversy surrounding the comedian\u2019s alleged behavior.\nA devastated young mother whose six-year-old son had recently drowned in a swimming pool accident.\nThese are the vulnerable women who alleged that comedian Bill Cosby sexually preyed on them over a span of five decades.\n\u201cWho was going to believe me?\u201d writer Joan Tarshis, who says Cosby forced oral sex on her in the 1960s, said."}
