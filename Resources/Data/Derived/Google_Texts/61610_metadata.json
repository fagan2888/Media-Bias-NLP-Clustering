She is the only swimmer and the highest-ranked Olympian on the 2015 list, which is weighted toward an athlete\u2019s marketability over the next three years.\n\nThe only athletes deemed more marketable in 2015: Canadian tennis player Eugenie Bouchard (1), Brazilian soccer star Neymar (2) and Masters champion Jordan Spieth (3).\n\n\n\nFranklin, 19, who announced in March that she would turn pro following two years at the University of California Berkeley, is set to compete at the Santa Clara Pro Swim Series in June, her agent told SwimSwam.com. Assuming she doesn\u2019t have a race lined up beforehand, it will be her professional debut ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics. She will also compete in World Championships, in Kazan, Russia, in August.\n\nAt the 2012 London Games, Franklin captured five medals, four of which were gold. Her collection of hardware also includes 13 World Championships medals (nine gold, three silver, one bronze) and four Pan Pacific Championships medals (one gold, two silver, one bronze).\n\nFranklin, who gave up millions in endorsement money to spend two years at Cal, finished her college career with four individual NCAA championships \u2014 one in 2014 (200-yard freestyle) and three in 2015 (200-yard freestyle, 200-yard backstroke, individual medley). She also helped Cal to a team title in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Missy Franklin,Olympics,Swimming", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Olympics", "description": "Colorado native and four-time Olympic swimming champion Missy Franklin was deemed one of the most marketable athletes over the next three years by SportsPro.", "title": "Missy Franklin ranked 4th-most marketable athlete in the world", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2015/05/24/missy-franklin-ranked-4th-most-marketable-athlete-in-the-world/26948/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2015/05/453416554-495x363.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado native and four-time Olympic swimming champion Missy Franklin was deemed one of the most marketable athletes over the next three years by SportsPro.", "title": "Missy Franklin ranked 4th-most marketable athlete in the world", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2015/05/24/missy-franklin-ranked-4th-most-marketable-athlete-in-the-world/26948/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2015/05/453416554-495x363.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado native and four-time Olympic swimming champion Missy Franklin was deemed one of the most marketable athletes over the next three years by SportsPro."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcffd\"", "article_summary": "Her collection of hardware also includes 13 World Championships medals (nine gold, three silver, one bronze) and four Pan Pacific Championships medals (one gold, two silver, one bronze).\nShe will also compete in World Championships, in Kazan, Russia, in August.\n4 on SportsPro\u2019s annual list of the 50 most marketable athletes in the world.\nFranklin, who gave up millions in endorsement money to spend two years at Cal, finished her college career with four individual NCAA championships \u2014 one in 2014 (200-yard freestyle) and three in 2015 (200-yard freestyle, 200-yard backstroke, individual medley).\nAt the 2012 London Games, Franklin captured five medals, four of which were gold."}
