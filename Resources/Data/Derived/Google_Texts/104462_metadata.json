Common Core is but one of many parts of an intricate plan to infiltrate every area of American society with Islam. Which is why, Common Core\u2019s origin and funding came from Qatar, Libya and Saudi Arabia.\n\nGlobally, Common Core originated from the \u201cOne World Education\u201d concept, a global goal orchestrated by the Connect All Schools program. Its origin is funded by the Qatar Foundation International (QFI). The director of QFI\u2019s Research Center for Islamic Legislation and Ethics is Tariq Ramadan, grandson of Muslim Brotherhood founder, Hassan al-Banna.\n\nAccording to the WND website, in 2011, QFI \u201cpartnered with the Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education to facilitate matchmaking between classrooms in the U.S. and international schools through \u2026 the \u2018Connect All Schools\u2019 project.\u201d QFI states on its website that the initiative was founded in response to Mr. Obama\u2019s infamous 2009 Cairo speech, during which the Muslim Brotherhood was seated in the front row.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s mentor, domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, received $49.2 million from Vartan Gregorian, a board member of the Qatar Foundation, who also is involved with Mr. Obama\u2019s White House Fellowships Commission. Gregorian is an integral part of Connect All Schools, through which Qatar invested $5 million to teach Arabic in American public schools.\n\nDomestically, in America, Common Core was \u201ccreated by\u201d the National Governor\u2019s Association (NGA), Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), Achieve Inc., ACT and the College Board. The Common Core State Standards are copyrighted by the NGA and CCSSO, a private company, which means they cannot be changed.\n\nMany groups helped create these standards (chief among them, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations) but Pearson Education, an NGA donor and CCSSO\u2019s listed business and industry partner, is integral to Common Core.\n\nPearson Education designs \u201ceducation products and services to institutions, governments and direct to individual learners.\u201d Listed on the London and New York Stock Exchange, of its numerous investors, the Libyan Investment Authority is its largest financial contributor, holding 26 million shares.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the Libyan Investment Authority was founded by Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s son, Seif al-Islam; more than five Gaddafi family members own shares. The Council on Islamic Relations (CAIR, a recently designated terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates), Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the Muslim Brotherhood invested in Pearson Education through the Libyan Investment Authority.\n\nDespite this connection, according to the Guardian, Pearson Education claims as a public company operating in a free market it has no control over its shareholders\u2019 terrorist-related activities.\n\nCommon Core was implemented in states that accepted federal funds from the 2009 \u201cRace to the Top\u201d initiative, which encouraged states to receive federal money to adopt new standards that would improve their public school children\u2019s test performance results.\n\nIn order for a state to participate, the state board of education and the state\u2019s educational professional standards board would have voted to adopt Common Core standards. Each participating state has posted the Common Core Standards on its state department of education website.\n\nTwo years prior to the Obama administration\u2019s Race to the Top initiative, in 2007, the FBI uncovered documents revealing the goals of the Muslim Brotherhood, and its subsidiary organizations like CAIR, planned to indoctrinate American K-12 students by teaching Islam.\n\nThe seized documents were part of the 2007 Holy Land Foundation trial, the largest terror-funding trial in U.S. history. The FBI uncovered the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s manifesto \u201con the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America\u201d (Exhibit 42945 and Exhibit 42946).\n\nAfter states applied for \u201cRace to the Top\u201d federal funds in 2009, Pearson Education created Common Core curriculum and standards. Pearson Education is also the sole evaluator of teachers in some states. In order for New York State to continue receiving \u201cRace to the Top\u201d federal funds, it had to implement \u201creforms.\u201d Pearson Education now solely administers the Teacher Performance Assessment (TPA).\n\nNew York State no longer evaluates its teachers \u2014 a private company does \u2014 whose primary investors fund terrorism and propagate Islam.\n\nAdditionally, no state or federal oversight exists for university programs (under Title VI of the Higher Education Act) that train K-12 teachers to develop lesson plans and seminars on \u201cMiddle East Studies.\u201d These programs and teacher training materials were developed by Pearson Education and largely funded by Saudi Arabia.\n\nParents must and can act\n\nIn order to end Common Core and eliminate the Islamic indoctrination being taught in public schools, parents must demand:\n\n\u2022 Their state school board members be investigated and/or fired and replaced.\n\n\u2022 Their state legislature and governor reject \u201cRace to the top\u201d federal funds and implement legislation or reverse its state education department\u2019s implementation of Common Core in their state, and at a minimum, in the interim.\n\n\u2022 Their child not participate in state testing.\n\nParents can also take their children out of public schools altogether.\n\nParental rights are guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that parents possess the \u201cfundamental right\u201d to \u201cdirect the upbringing and education of their children.\u201d The court has declared that \u201cthe child is not the mere creature of the State: those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right coupled with the high duty to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations\u201d (Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-35). The Supreme Court criticized the Nebraska state legislature for attempting to interfere \u201cwith the power of parents to control the education of their own\u201d (Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 402). And ruled a parent\u2019s right to raise his/her children means a parent is protected from unreasonable state interferences, one of the unwritten \u201cliberties\u201d protected by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment (Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 399).\u201d\n\nParents must say no more: The $632 billion the federal government spends each year on public school \u201ceducation\u201d is being wasted on violating the First Amendment, by the federal government instituting a religion through the teaching of Islam in public schools.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Where did Common Core come from?\" is a question I often hear from parents in every state I've visited as I travel the country speaking about the Islamic infiltration of America.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cWhere did Common Core come from?\u201d is a question I often hear from parents in every state I\u2019ve visited as I travel the country speaking about the Islamic infiltration of America.", "title": "BETHANY BLANKLEY: Common Core ties to Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/7/bethany-blankley-parents-must-reject-common-core-i/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/06/04/MIDEAST.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2009/06/04/MIDEAST.jpg", "description": "\"Where did Common Core come from?\" is a question I often hear from parents in every state I've visited as I travel the country speaking about the Islamic infiltration of America.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "BETHANY BLANKLEY: Common Core ties to Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia"}, "Author": "Bethany Blankley", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Education, Seif Al Islam, Saudi Arabia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10ab\"", "article_summary": "The Common Core State Standards are copyrighted by the NGA and CCSSO, a private company, which means they cannot be changed.\nCommon Core is but one of many parts of an intricate plan to infiltrate every area of American society with Islam.\nGregorian is an integral part of Connect All Schools, through which Qatar invested $5 million to teach Arabic in American public schools.\nAfter states applied for \u201cRace to the Top\u201d federal funds in 2009, Pearson Education created Common Core curriculum and standards.\n\u201cWhere did Common Core come from?\u201d is a question I often hear from parents as I travel the country speaking about the Islamic infiltration of America."}
