The jobs report is based on two different surveys \u2014 one of households, and one of employers \u2014 and it turns out that furloughed federal government workers will be treated as unemployed in the first survey but employed in the second. In other words, the temporary layoff of federal workers will probably increase the unemployment rate, but not (at least directly) depress the payroll job growth numbers.\n\nThe key reason that furloughed federal workers affect the results of one survey but not the other has to do with the different ways the two surveys categorize workers who ultimately receive back pay.\n\nIn the survey of households, workers who were furloughed during the entire week of Oct. 6-12 (the week that the survey asks respondents about) and therefore did not work at all will be classified as \u201cunemployed, on temporary layoff.\u201d\n\nAccording to an e-mail from a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, for the purposes of the household survey, \u201cworkers on temporary layoff need not be actively looking for work to be counted as unemployed, and they are so classified regardless of whether or not they are, or expect to be, paid for the time they are on temporary layoff.\u201d\n\nGot that? Even if you get back pay, if you didn\u2019t spend any time working, you\u2019re still considered unemployed by the household survey.\n\nThat is not true in the establishment survey (which surveys nonfarm payroll employers).\n\nIn the establishment survey, people who did not work during the reference week (the pay period that includes the 12th of the month) would normally not be counted as employed \u2014 unless they receive back pay. If they receive pay for the time they were on furlough, they\u2019re counted as employed, even though they didn\u2019t actually spend any hours working.\n\nCongress agreed to retroactive pay for furloughed federal workers for work they missed. That means that federal workers who were not allowed to work during the shutdown will all still be counted as employed.\n\nMind you, Congress\u2019s action guarantees back pay for federal employees only. Other workers who were furloughed as a result of the shutdown but don\u2019t work directly for the federal government \u2014 contractors, say, or people who normally work in lunchtime cafes across the street from government office buildings that were empty last week \u2014 may not have been given back-pay for those missed hours; it depends on what their employers decided to do. If they didn\u2019t work during the reference week and they didn\u2019t receive retroactive pay for missed hours, they will not be counted as employed by either the household or the establishment survey.\n\nExactly how many people fall into this camp \u2014 laid off as a result of Congress\u2019s actions, but not by Congress directly \u2014 will be harder to determine until the next batch of jobs numbers is in.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131022142632, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "hdl_p": "How To Count Furloughs", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 22, 2013", "keywords": "Government Employees,Labor and Jobs,Shutdowns (Institutional),Unemployment,United States Economy,Wages and Salaries,Working Hours,The Jobs Report,Uncategorized", "GBLC": "The Jobs Report", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/How the Furloughed Will Be Counted ( 20131022 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Catherine Rampell", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Catherine Rampell", "byl": "Catherine Rampell", "twitter": {"description": "Federal workers hit by the shutdown will be counted as employed in one Labor Department survey and unemployed in another, meaning a possible impact on the jobless rate but not the job growth figure.", "title": "How the Furloughed Will Be Counted", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/how-the-furloughed-will-be-counted/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@crampell", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002511940, "description": "Federal workers hit by the shutdown will be counted as employed in one Labor Department survey and unemployed in another, meaning a possible impact on the jobless rate but not the job growth figure.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 22, 2013", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1382466392, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T18:27:37-04:00"}, "utime": 20131022182737, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131022, "pdate": 20131022, "des": "Government Employees;Labor and Jobs;Shutdowns (Institutional);Unemployment;United States Economy;Wages and Salaries;Working Hours", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Federal workers hit by the shutdown will be counted as employed in one Labor Department survey and unemployed in another, meaning a possible impact on the jobless rate but not the job growth figure.", "title": "How the Furloughed Will Be Counted", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/how-the-furloughed-will-be-counted/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/how-the-furloughed-will-be-counted/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How the Furloughed Will Be Counted", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc747\"", "article_summary": "Congress agreed to retroactive pay for furloughed federal workers for work they missed.\nThat means that federal workers who were not allowed to work during the shutdown will all still be counted as employed.\nThe key reason that furloughed federal workers affect the results of one survey but not the other has to do with the different ways the two surveys categorize workers who ultimately receive back pay.\nIf they receive pay for the time they were on furlough, they\u2019re counted as employed, even though they didn\u2019t actually spend any hours working.\nIn other words, the temporary layoff of federal workers will probably increase the unemployment rate, but not (at least directly) depress the payroll job growth numbers."}
