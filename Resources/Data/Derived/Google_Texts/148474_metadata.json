A recent court-ordered redistricting has made CD 2 strongly Republican, so much so that one poll showed her \u201closing to any Republican challenger.\u201d The next election for the seat is in November.\n\n\u201cGraham scored a 79 percent party-voting score, making her the most independent Florida member; the sixth most independent Democrat in the House; and the ninth most independent representative of either party,\u201d the news release said.\n\nMatt Joiner, campaign manager for Republican challenger Mary Thomas, pushed back against that assessment.\n\nGraham \u201cvoted for Obamacare, voted for big-spending, budget-busting omnibus bills and has a 100 percent pro-abortion voting record,\u201d Joiner said in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s downright liberal.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Neal Dunn, another Republican challenger, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe North Florida Way and bipartisanship are working,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe passed legislation to defend Israel from terrorist tunnels. We gained StrikeForce status to fight poverty in rural counties. And we\u2019re providing outstanding constituent services.\u201d\n\nJim Rosica (jim@floridapolitics.com) covers the Florida Legislature, state agencies and courts from Tallahassee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "U.S. Rep.
