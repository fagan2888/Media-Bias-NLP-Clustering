Unity.

It’s what fueled the violent terrorists who killed more than 132 people and injured 350 more in Paris Friday. But it’s also fueling citizens and leaders with different religions, politics, and cultures around the world joining together in mourning.

While ISIS is unified in hatred for those who differ from it, the rest of the world is coming together in solidarity over sorrow for the victims of the attacks.

To protect them, to honor them.
