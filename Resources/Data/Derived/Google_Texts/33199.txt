Twitter and Facebook users were quick late Thursday to notice that several of CNN’s social media accounts had been hacked.

The tweets and Facebook submissions, allegedly posted by an organization calling itself the “Syrian Electronic Army,” criticized the network, stating that “all of its reports are fake!” and referred to U.S. President Barack Obama as “Obama Bin Laden the lord of terror.”

Another post declared: “Long live #Syria via @Official_SEA16 #SEA.”

The accusatory posts prompted the news network and website to issue a statement:

“Some of our organization’s social media accounts were compromised via third-party social publishing platform. We have secured those accounts and are working with the affected vendors to remedy the issue,” CNN posted on its Facebook page.

A number of the tweets and Facebook posts were up only for a couple of minutes before CNN deleted them, but by then users were rapidly liking and commenting on the faux posts as well as taking screenshots of the comprised accounts.

Facebook user Brenden Donaldson commented, “Awesome,” where a more perplexed Facebook user Maral Davari simply posted, “Hah????”

In August of last year, the U.S. blamed Syrian President Bashar Assad for a nerve gas attack that killed hundreds of people. Activists there also blamed Assad for the attack, but no action was taken on the part the U.S. after a growing number of Americans opposed to action in the region.

Assad also agreed to abide by the United Nation’s objective to destroy the regime’s stockpile of chemical weapons by mid-2014, staving a U.S. military strike.
