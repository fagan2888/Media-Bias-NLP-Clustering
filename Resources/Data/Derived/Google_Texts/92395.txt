THE Quay in Exeter is one of the city’s jewels; the perfect spot for walking, cycling, water sports, enjoying a meal or a coffee.

Sadly, it is now also the perfect spot for seagulls!

While I was enjoying a meal at one of the many excellent eateries my food was splattered with seagull droppings, my beer too – and I have noticed that the population of ducks has disappeared, I am guessing to get away from the seagulls with which they cannot compete for food.

Perhaps it is time to consider a cull?
