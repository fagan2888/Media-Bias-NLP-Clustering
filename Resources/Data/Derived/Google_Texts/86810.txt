That didnâ€™t take long: the conservative Americans for Prosperity has bought nearly $850,000 in air time in Colorado Springs and Denver, as it prepares to launch a three-week blitz on Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Udall beginning Monday.

The ad buy, which was first reported by Politico, comes as no surprise. AFP already has spent around $30 million in states where Democrats are deemed vulnerable.

After Congressman Cory Gardner, a rising star in the Republican Party, jumped into the race, it was obvious that both sides would spend millions to prevail in November.

Americans for Prosperity this week launched a $700,000 ad campaign targeting Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor for his support of the Affordable Care Act, the Wall Street Journal reported.

AFP is funded by Charles and David Koch, two billionaire brothers who have used their oil wealth to hammer Democratic candidates and their ties to President Barack Obama. Democrats now are fighting back against the Koch brothers, saying the brothers have grown stupendously wealthy while pushing an agenda that tries to privatize Social Security, reduce taxes on oil and undermine environmental regulations.
