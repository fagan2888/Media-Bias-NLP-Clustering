Shorter Charles Gaba: For now, it still looks like Obamacare enrollment this year will end up at around 14.7 million. That's not bad, especially considering that fewer people are dropping out of employer plans than expected.

For everyone except die-hard conservatives who are driven mad by the thought of poor people getting decent health care, this is a pretty good Christmas present. Enjoy it.
