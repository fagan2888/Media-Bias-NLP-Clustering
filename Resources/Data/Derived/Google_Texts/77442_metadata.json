Some of these speakers have lived in Derry for more than 30 years. But some of the strongest support for Rubio came from the Florida millennials who traveled to follow the presidential hopeful around the Granite State.\n\nHis hour-long speech touched on topics he has addressed at past events: immigration reform, national security, his proposed repeal of Obamacare, and, of course, the American dream. While pumping up the crowd before the event started, Tim Scott, the U.S. senator from South Carolina and a recent Rubio endorser, cited Rubio\u2019s ability to appeal to younger voters.\n\n\u201cHe inspires a new generation of voters, but he does so by holding onto our conservative principles,\u201d Scott said.\n\nRubio mentioned a recent poll of millennial Americans that asked whether they thought the American dream was alive or dead. \u201c50 percent of millennials said they think it\u2019s dead. That\u2019s a disaster,\" he said. \"If the future thinks that the American dream is dead, then we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nIn a contrast with the poll results, a group of students from the University of South Florida traveled to New Hampshire with their \u201cRoad to the White House\u201d class to follow candidates during the primaries. David Thompson, a USF freshman studying political science with a minor in environmental studies, considers himself a Democrat but said he will likely vote for Rubio.\n\nThompson said he not only agrees with Rubio\u2019s stance on certain issues, like environmental policy, but he sees himself in Rubio in many ways.\n\n\u201cBoth my parents are teachers and immigrants from Jamaica, so I really like Rubio\u2019s education policy and immigration policy,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI identify with what he went through with Cuban parents because my parents came to the U.S. from Jamaica without jobs.\u201d\n\nClassmate Miranda Latima said she believes in Rubio\u2019s immigration policy. \u201cMy uncle lives in the Philipines and it\u2019s difficult for him to fly back and forth to visit. I like that Rubio\u2019s immigration policy is secure yet easy for immigrants to enter the country.\u201d\n\nLatima said she likes Rubio\u2019s efforts on behalf of veterans, especially since her late father was a veteran.\n\n\u201cBefore my dad died three years ago, he was a vet receiving family benefits but they expired when I started high school,\" she said. \"The benefits should have continued through college, since I know if my dad were alive he would\u2019ve supported me past high school.\u201d\n\nAs a Floridian, Thompson said he cares about consumerism issues in the state, citing Florida's sales tax. \u201cSince he\u2019s from Florida he understands that and he can take it the national level,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nAlthough both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Rubio are running for the Republican presidential nomination, Thompson and Latima said they favor Rubio.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush did a lot of good things for Florida, but he has no backbone against other strong leaders. I couldn\u2019t see him standing up against someone like Vladmir Putin,\u201d Latima said.\n\nWhile Thompson said he would like the Republican candidates to talk more about minority issues, specifically police brutality, he said he believes in Rubio as the 2016 president.\n\n\u201cRubio can stand up and represent what the people want,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHe has a mastery of the issues that no one else understands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "(left to right) Miranda Latima, David Thompson, Chris Happle, 19, Chris Ward, 26, Georgia Pevy, 20 -- all students in the USF \"Road to the White House\" cla", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush and Rubio are running for the Republican presidential nomination, Thompson and Latima said they favor Rubio.\nBut some of the strongest support for Rubio came from the Florida millennials who traveled to follow the presidential hopeful around the Granite State.\n\u201cBoth my parents are teachers and immigrants from Jamaica, so I really like Rubio\u2019s education policy and immigration policy,\u201d Thompson said.\nBefore Rubio stepped on stage with his wife and four children, local community members took turns telling the crowd why they support Rubio.\n\u201cI identify with what he went through with Cuban parents because my parents came to the U.S. from Jamaica without jobs.\u201dClassmate Miranda Latima said she believes in Rubio\u2019s immigration policy."}
