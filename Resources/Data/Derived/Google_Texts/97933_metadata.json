I don\u2019t know. I can tell you that all the components of a plan that should be acceptable to both sides are on the table.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s nuclear negotiating team, led by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, on Oct. 27 made a rare visit to Iran\u2019s two enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordo.\n\nWhile the reported purpose of the visit was to \u201cpraise the achievements of the scientists and technicians working at the two facilities,\u201d Zarif also stressed \u201cthe use of nuclear technology for civilian applications,\u201d Iran\u2019s semi-official nuclearenergy.ir website wrote. The visit\u2019s significance was also symbolically notable. The issue of the size of Iran\u2019s enrichment capacity in a final nuclear deal has been the key hold-up to finalizing agreement, negotiators have said. Iran has wanted to keep the number of centrifuges it is currently operating \u2014 about 9,400 centrifuges; while the P5+1 (the five UN Security Council permanent members plus Germany) initially proposed Iran reduce its enrichment capacity to 1,500 centrifuges in the near term.\n\nIranian media reported last week that the P5+1 has offered a modified proposal under which Iran could keep around 4,000 centrifuges if it takes other steps to increase its breakout time, including sending out more of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium and converting the stockpile it keeps into a form that would be difficult to higher enrich.\n\nUS officials, while not confirming the reports, have recently said there are multiple combinations of ways that Iran\u2019s breakout time could be extended, and the focus should not only be on the centrifuge numbers in a deal. The goal, US officials said, should be a deal that closes off all possible pathways for Iran to make fissile material for a nuclear weapon, either through producing weapons-grade uranium, plutonium or through a covert facility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to shut down the four pathways to get enough nuclear material for a nuclear weapon,\u201d a US official told journalists in Vienna Oct. 15. \u201cThere are a lot of ways you can do that. There\u2019s no one right answer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake to focus inordinate attention on any one issue at the expense of all others,\u201d Sherman said in her Oct. 23 remarks. \u201cEvery piece is critical whether it involves infrastructure, or stockpiles, or research, or types of equipment, or questions of timing or sequencing.\u201d\n\nBut regarding the critical issue of the size of Iran\u2019s enrichment capacity, Sherman insisted Iran would have to come down from the status quo \u2014 its current operating numbers \u2014 and the time to make the concession was now.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s leaders would very much hope that the world would conclude that the status quo \u2014 at least on this pivotal subject \u2014 should be acceptable, but obviously, it is not,\u201d Sherman said in her Oct. 24 remarks, referring to the issue of the size of Iran\u2019s enrichment capacity.\n\n\u201cThe world will decide to suspend and then lift nuclear-related sanctions only if and when Iran takes convincing and verifiable steps to show that its nuclear program is and will remain entirely peaceful,\u201d Sherman said.\n\nIranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi echoed that standard in remarks responding to Sherman\u2019s speech, in which he criticized what he called efforts to negotiate through the media.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that the existing opportunity is a great chance that may not be available for neither side again,\u201d Araghchi said in an Oct. 25 statement reported by the Iranian media. \u201cWe are certain that if the other side adheres to its declared objective in the negotiations, making sure that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is peaceful, realizing this goal is not that difficult.\u201d\n\nArms control and Iran experts who regularly consult with the US administration offered conflicting assessments of prospects for completing the comprehensive nuclear accord by the Nov. 24 deadline, with some suggesting an extension would likely be needed, but others insisting the administration sees a narrow path to complete the deal by then.\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Iranians, Israelis Could Live With 'Bad' Nuclear Deal]\n\n\u201cIn terms of completing the comprehensive deal by Nov. 24, I would say the probability is very near zero,\u201d Robert Einhorn, a nuclear expert who previously served on the US-Iran nuclear negotiating team, told an Arms Control Association conference on Oct. 20.\n\nBut Einhorn said he thought one option would be that there could be agreement reached on a \u201ccluster\u201d of key issues (such as enrichment capacity, modifications to the unfinished Arak research reactor, etc.) reached by the Nov. 24 deadline that would justify a few more months to finalize the remaining technical details.\n\nIf the parties \u201creached agreement on a cluster of these issues, they would have a strong case to justify taking several more months,\u201d Einhorn said. \u201cThat may or may not be possible.\u201d\n\nOther experts said US officials had suggested that they believe they genuinely have a shot at getting the whole thing done by Nov. 24.\n\n\u201cThey are definitely in a new phase,\u201d one expert, speaking not for attribution, told Al-Monitor, referring to the US negotiating team. \u201cThe new phase is preparing the ground for the deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan they get a comprehensive agreement with the technical appendices\u201d by the deadline? the expert said. \u201cYes, they can.\u201d\n\nLaura Rozen reports on foreign policy from Washington, DC, for Al-Monitor's Back Channel.
