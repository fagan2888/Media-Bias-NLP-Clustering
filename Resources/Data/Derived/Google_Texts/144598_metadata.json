Bosch declined to comment.\n\nBild am Sonntag did not clarify whether the mechanism revealed in the Fiat test also functioned as a \"thermal window\".\n\nRegulators and environmental groups have criticized the widespread use of systems that switch off emissions treatment not just to improve engine performance but also to increase the interval between services.\n\nThe government official said there needed to be clarification at European level over the use and declaration of engine protection mechanisms.\n\n(Story refiles to clarify garble in fourth paragraph).\n\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak, Edward Taylor, Markus Wacket, writing by Vera Eckert, editing by John Stonestreet)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A spokesman for Fiat in Italy declined to comment.", "title": "Test of Fiat diesel model shows irregular emissions: Bild am Sonntag", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/24/Test-Fiat-diesel-model-shows-irregular-emissions-Bild-am-Sonntag", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autoshow-geneva_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/24/Test-Fiat-diesel-model-shows-irregular-emissions-Bild-am-Sonntag", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autoshow-geneva_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A spokesman for Fiat in Italy declined to comment.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Bild am Sonntag did not clarify whether the mechanism revealed in the Fiat test also functioned as a \"thermal window\".\nFollowing the KBA investigation, the firm and some other top German manufacturers -- Porsche, Opel, Audi and Mercedes -- agreed to recall 630,000 vehicles to tweak diesel engine software technology.\nThe Volkswagen emissions-test cheating scandal cast a spotlight on industry-wide emissions of health-threatening nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels in diesel fumes.\nAuto supplier Bosch [ROBG.UL] is said to have informed German investigators that Fiat was using a mechanism that virtually disabled exhaust filters, Bild am Sonntag reported.\nRegulators and environmental groups have criticized the widespread use of systems that switch off emissions treatment not just to improve engine performance but also to increase the interval between services."}
