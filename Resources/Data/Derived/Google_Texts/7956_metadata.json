The donation was first reported by the New Orleans website NoLa Defender.\n\nThe donation is part of a pattern of bipartisan giving from the GOP lawmaker. Donations to Democrats include to former Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco (D) in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\n\nCassidy is facing Tea Party candidate Rob Maness (R) as well as Landrieu in the all-party primary, and the unusual donation could undermine his credibility with the base and in attacking Landrieu.\n\nCassidy argued the donations came before Landrieu moved to the left.\n\n\"Mary claimed she was going to represent Louisiana and not D.C.
