A university lecturer, she was in the final stages of multiple sclerosis, and earlier this year she unsuccessfully petitioned the courts to be lawfully assisted to have a peaceful death at a time of her choosing without putting loved ones who helped her at risk of prosecution.\n\nPartner Tom Curran told mourners that she had died peacefully at home, in her own bed, and that was what she was fighting for. \u201cSo what she fought for she achieved,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Curran said recently she had slept during the day and was awake at night when they had many conversations. \u201cShe knew she was dying,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nTo laughter, he said that she was proud of the impact her red jacket had when she attended the High Court and she did not want people dressing in black for her funeral. \u201cShe wanted this day to be a happy day,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe recalled how he lay beside her at night, and recalled the thunderstorm which raged on the night she died. He thought that it might be anger at her passing, but then believed she was rearranging the furniture from heaven. \u201cShe had a bond with nature,\u2019\u2019 said Mr Curran.\n\nHe said that Ms Fleming had made it clear she wanted the right-to-die campaign to continue and he intended pursuing it with others. He said that being her carer was the most important job he had undertaken. \u201cI was not just her carer; I was her lover and partner,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nMs Fleming\u2019s daughter, Corrinna, read a letter written by her mother before her death in which she thanked everybody involved in her care and those she had encountered throughout her life.\n\nShe said of her partner, \u201cthank you for loving me, caring for me\u2019\u2019, urging him to find peace in the beautiful garden they had cultivated together. Corrinna also read a Christmas poem penned by Ms Fleming in which she said she would be spending the festive season \u201cwith Jesus Christ this year\u2019\u2019.\n\nMs Fleming\u2019s grandchildren gave short readings which spoke of their grandmother\u2019s love of flowers, reading, telling stories and that she made lovely buns Her coffin was taken from the church to the strains of I Will Survive, and she was then laid to rest in an elevated part of the cemetery under the shadow of large trees.\n\nShe is survived by her parter Tom, children Corrinna and Simon and step-son David and grandchildren.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Letter written by right-to-die campaigner thanks partner for loving and caring for her", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom11635903"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "og": {"site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Letter written by right-to-die campaigner thanks partner for loving and caring for her", "title": "Emotional tributes  as Marie Fleming buried in Wicklow", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/emotional-tributes-as-marie-fleming-buried-in-wicklow-1.1635903", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.1635925.1387737555!/image/image.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 824}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letter written by right-to-die campaigner thanks partner for loving and caring for her", "title": "Emotional tributes  as Marie Fleming buried in Wicklow", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/emotional-tributes-as-marie-fleming-buried-in-wicklow-1.1635903", "image": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.1635925.1387737555!/image/image.jpg", "site": "@IrishTimes", "card": "summary", "account_id": 15084853}, "robots": "all", "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "news_keywords": "News, George Butler, Jesus Christ, Marie Fleming, Michael O Regan, Tom Curran, Trinity Church, High Court, Wicklow, Supreme Court, Arklow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefeb\"", "article_summary": "Ms Fleming died on Friday at the age of 59 at her home near Arklow, Co Wicklow.\nThe funeral has taken place in Co Wicklow of the right-to-die campaigner Marie Fleming.\nHe said that Ms Fleming had made it clear she wanted the right-to-die campaign to continue and he intended pursuing it with others.\nShe was buried in the cemetery near Holy Trinity Church, in Castlemacadam, following a service where Rector Canon George Butler and family members paid emotional but uplifting tributes to her.\nHe recalled how he lay beside her at night, and recalled the thunderstorm which raged on the night she died."}
