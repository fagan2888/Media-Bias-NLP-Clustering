Training camp for the 2014-15 season opens Tuesday, and it is the Nuggets\u2019 desire for it to be the foundation of a return to the playoffs. They missed the postseason last year for the first time since 2003 in an injury-marred campaign. With good health, they hope to start a new playoffs streak. Denver Post NBA writer Christopher Dempsey looks at five story lines as the curtain is raised on this year\u2019s camp:\n\nHow will Gallinari look?\n\nWhen camp opens it will have been 544 days since Danilo Gallinari last took the basketball court in an NBA capacity. That\u2019s one year, five months and 26 days since he tore his left ACL and sparked a series of events that featured one failed knee surgery, one successful knee surgery, an entire missed season and one heck of a coat of rust to be knocked off when he plays in his first regular season since 2013. Gallinari\u2019s absence in the 2013 playoffs was a huge reason why the Nuggets were bounced out in the first round after earning the conference\u2019s No. 3 seed. His presence with this team will be just as critical. But first things first: getting timing back, regaining a shooting touch, learning the new offensive and defensive systems under coach Brian Shaw, getting chemistry with his new teammates, regaining confidence in his knee and getting back into NBA-caliber physical condition. If it looks like a lot, it\u2019s because it is. Gallinari\u2019s back, yes. But he\u2019s got a long road ahead to being the Gallo we remember. That process starts Tuesday.\n\nHow will the rest of the injured guys look?\n\nIn addition to Gallinari, the laundry list of players who were missing from the team by the end of the season \u2014 J.J. Hickson (knee), Nate Robinson (knee), JaVale McGee (tibia), Ty Lawson (ankle) \u2014 are all back. It means the Nuggets will have enough players to pull off a full practice for the first time since, well, since they all started dropping like flies from the rotation in January. But their continued steady progress in returning from some devastating injuries in some cases is paramount to the Nuggets\u2019 success, especially right out of the gate. They\u2019ll be brought along cautiously at the start of camp with the hope that most, if not all of them, will be ready to hit the ground running for the first regular-season game.\n\nTimofey Mozgov vs. JaVale McGee\n\nOn a team with limited spots of competition, this is the one true position battle. Timofey Mozgov took full advantage of JaVale McGee\u2019s 77 games missed last season by putting together the best season of his young NBA career. In the process, Mozgov served notice that he is fully capable of being an NBA starter and perhaps even one who grows into a 30-minutes-plus player. Shaw, however, will say at least initially that no matter who starts he envisions splitting the minutes at center right down the middle \u2014 24 apiece. Last season, McGee was the starter to begin the season, but a stress fracture ended his season five games in. This season, he\u2019ll have to fight to prove he should be the starter.\n\nThe Afflalo influence\n\nLawson, McGee, Mozgov, Wilson Chandler, Kenneth Faried and Gallinari were all on the team when Arron Afflalo last played for the Nuggets, which seems like a lot. Only, it feels like so much has changed since then. Certainly Afflalo has. He returns to the Nuggets at the peak of his career, playing his best basketball as a pro, ready to be a leader on and off the court and a reliable scorer on a nightly basis. The Nuggets hope his relentless work ethic rubs off on his teammates. That starts in camp.\n\nShaw\u2019s second training camp\n\nLast year was get-to-know-you time. Shaw was new. His staff was mostly new. His system was new. His practices were new. Now? He\u2019s a known commodity. Most of his team knows what to expect and can get straight to business.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Time for Denver Nuggets to get ball rolling again nears", "title": "Time for Denver Nuggets to get ball rolling again nears", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/time-for-denver-nuggets-to-get-ball-rolling-again-nears/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_CC3_SP28BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_CC3_SP28BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T17:44:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:56:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0622\"", "article_summary": "Denver Post NBA writer Christopher Dempsey looks at five story lines as the curtain is raised on this year\u2019s camp:How will Gallinari look?\nWhen camp opens it will have been 544 days since Danilo Gallinari last took the basketball court in an NBA capacity.\nLast season, McGee was the starter to begin the season, but a stress fracture ended his season five games in.\nTraining camp for the 2014-15 season opens Tuesday, and it is the Nuggets\u2019 desire for it to be the foundation of a return to the playoffs.\nGallinari\u2019s absence in the 2013 playoffs was a huge reason why the Nuggets were bounced out in the first round after earning the conference\u2019s No."}
