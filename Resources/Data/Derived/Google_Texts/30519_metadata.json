This might be taken as a form of modesty, because the man actually has three: one of them academic (a PhD in philosophy), one civil (a British life peer, Sacks sits in the House of Lords) and one religious (he\u2019s an Orthodox rabbi). Is it Lord Rabbi Dr. Sacks? Dr. Lord Rabbi Sacks? I\u2019ll leave that one to the copy editors, or perhaps to a committee on heraldry.\n\nFor 22 years, Sacks served as the British Commonwealth\u2019s Chief Rabbi, a role that made him the public face of Judaism for millions of Britons. The Chief Rabbi position doesn\u2019t carry any theological weight, but it did put Sacks in the middle of conversations about interfaith relations and the role of religion in modern society. (The role also drew Sacks into the internecine squabbles of British Jewry, which he mostly seemed to aggravate).\n\nReligion, politics and Jewish relations: not exactly dinner table conversation. Sacks stepped down from the Chief Rabbinate in 2013, but he clearly has a taste for contentious topics. In his most recent book, \u201cThe Great Partnership,\u201d which comes out in paperback this month, Sacks discusses science, religion and the pitfalls of hard-line atheism. His argument is not that science and religion are perfectly compatible. Instead, Sacks suggests that no single system of knowledge can engage the world entirely. The result is a moderate\u2019s manifesto; a lengthy, erudite defense of what Sacks calls \u201ccognitive pluralism.\u201d\n\nI reached Sacks by phone in New York, where he holds professorships at NYU and Yeshiva University. We spoke about Richard Dawkins, the relationship between religion and politics, and why there are so few Jewish creationists.\n\nYou write that \u201cthe mutual hostility between religion and science is one of the curses of our age.\u201d What\u2019s made this relationship so fraught?\n\nThere was a time when the church felt it could censure truths that it felt to be inconsistent with its own deeply held beliefs. Now it\u2019s as if it were almost a mirror image. Science is claiming a monopoly of knowledge, and thus some scientific atheists are intent on depriving religion of any cognitive status. I think this has been a swing of a pendulum, and I think it has more to do with power than with intellectual integrity.\n\nIn a recent interview, Richard Dawkins described you as very nice, but he said that attacking you was \u201clike attacking a wet sponge.\u201d Why does Dawkins have such trouble with your arguments?\n\nBecause Richard, who is a brilliant scientist, thinks that morality is a simple matter. Oh, we\u2019ll get a few scientists and we\u2019ll work out what we should do and what we shouldn\u2019t do. And quite frankly, the whole history of humankind has borne testimony to the fact that we may quite reasonably know what is the right thing to do. Actually getting people to do the right thing is the hardest thing on earth. I really admire Richard Dawkins\u2019 work within his field, but when he moves beyond his field, he must understand that we may feel that he\u2019s talking on a subject in which he lacks expertise.\n\nScience takes things apart to see how they work. Religion puts them together to see what they mean. And I think the people who spend their lives taking things apart to see how they work sometimes find it difficult to understand the people who put things together to see what they mean.\n\nI think there\u2019s an important distinction to be made here, though, between science and reductionism. Plenty of scientists put together grand theories of the universe, or study things like emergence. They aren\u2019t only taking things apart.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the reductivists. That\u2019s really what a number of these atheists are. They believe in science, but they believe that science is all there is. And that\u2019s just wrong. To me, science has religious significance in a sense, because it allows us to see the world as the work of God, and I think it\u2019s probably no accident that science grew up in cultures that were essentially Judeo-Christian.\n\nIn your book, you trace science-and-religion disputes back to the difference between Greek philosophy and early Jewish thought.\n\nThe Greeks were very visual. They saw knowledge as a kind of seeing. We still carry all those metaphors with us: insight, foresight. And that\u2019s what science is, really. The truth that you can see empirically by your senses, especially the sense of sight. Whereas ancient Israel, and Judaism in general, is a religion of the ear, and the fundamental truth is the truth you hear. It\u2019s much more concerned with language, and with language as a means of creating relationships and establishing bonds of trust.\n\nThe primal, basic scientific situation is where I am observing some phenomenon. The basic religious situation is where I am engaging with another person or personal being. Those are two mindsets. I think we need both. Judaism was an extreme example of one, and Greece is the other. Historically, they came together in Christianity.\n\nWhy do so few Jews take issue with the theory of evolution, while creationism is common among Christians?\n\nI think Christians tended to think that religion and science were part of the same universe of discourse. So they assumed that the Bible was telling us scientific stuff, as well as moral and spiritual stuff. Whereas Jews don\u2019t read the Bible that way.\n\nI mean, look how much time the Bible spends in describing creation: 34 verses. It spends 600 verses describing how the Israelites constructed the Tabernacle. Genesis 1 is not remotely thinking about being science. It\u2019s clear that the first chapter of the Bible is teaching us about the goodness of the world, not about the cosmo-genesis of the world.\n\nReading your book, I often felt as if you were asking Western society to become a little more Jewish, or to think a little bit more Jewishly.\n\nWell, I\u2019m just saying that sometimes a religion \u2014 and Judaism happens to be mine \u2014 embodies a truth that we may have forgotten for a while. There\u2019s nothing in Judaism that\u2019s hostile to science. I think we are great admirers of it, and the Talmud has here and there a little note of real admiration for the Greeks, and for their ability to think scientifically.\n\nIn the past few years, there\u2019s been a tendency to compare the New Atheists to certain fundamentalist religious groups. Is that a worthwhile comparison? Do you think that, when you look at the extremes of religiosity and scientism, you see a kind of kinship?\n\nA fundamentalist is somebody who can\u2019t really understand a point of view opposite to his own. He can\u2019t really hear in stereo, he can\u2019t really see 3-D. Whereas a really great scientist like Niels Bohr will say that the opposite of a superficial truth is a falsehood, but the opposite of a profound truth is very often another profound truth. Niels Bohr really got it. But some of today\u2019s atheists don\u2019t get it. They know that science is a profound truth, but they can\u2019t understand that something opposite can also be a profound truth.\n\nYou write that \u201catheism deserves better than the new atheists.\u201d What kind of thinkers do atheists deserve? Is there a type of atheism that our society needs?\n\nWell, you know, Bertrand Russell was an atheist with a sense of humor. And the new atheists tend either to lack a sense of humor, or the only humor they\u2019re capable of is sarcasm. I mean, somebody with a little intellectual humility does not say, \u201cAnyone who disagrees with me is stupid.\u201d That is fundamentalism. Fundamentalism is the attempt to impose a single truth on the plural world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Noted philosopher tells Salon atheism deserves better than new atheists, and how science and religion can get along", "author": "Michael Schulson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Noted philosopher tells Salon atheism deserves better than new atheists, and how science and religion can get along", "title": "Jonathan Sacks on Richard Dawkins: \u201cNew atheists lack a sense of humor\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/27/jonathan_sacks_on_richard_dawkins_new_atheists_lack_a_sense_of_humor/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/sacks_dawkins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Noted philosopher tells Salon atheism deserves better than new atheists, and how science and religion can get along", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/sacks_dawkins.jpg", "title": "Jonathan Sacks on Richard Dawkins: \u201cNew atheists lack a sense of humor\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jonathan Sacks on Richard Dawkins: \u201cNew atheists lack a sense of humor\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Books, Editor's Picks, isis, Jonathan Sacks, Judaism, moral majority, New Atheism, Religion, Religious Right, Richard Dawkins, Science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Atheism, Books, Editor's Picks, isis, Jonathan Sacks, Judaism, moral majority, New Atheism, Religion, Religious Right, Richard Dawkins, Science, Life NewsJonathan Sacks rarely goes by more than two titles.\nAnd the new atheists tend either to lack a sense of humor, or the only humor they\u2019re capable of is sarcasm.\nIn his most recent book, \u201cThe Great Partnership,\u201d which comes out in paperback this month, Sacks discusses science, religion and the pitfalls of hard-line atheism.\nWe spoke about Richard Dawkins, the relationship between religion and politics, and why there are so few Jewish creationists.\nYou write that \u201catheism deserves better than the new atheists.\u201d What kind of thinkers do atheists deserve?"}
