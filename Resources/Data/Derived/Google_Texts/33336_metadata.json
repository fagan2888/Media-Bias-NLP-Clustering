This alternative, he said in an interview, undercuts the government\u2019s entire rationale for controversial changes that it made in 2012 to the companies\u2019 financial support.\n\nFirst, a little background: The Treasury Department rescued the two mortgage companies from likely collapse during the financial crisis in 2008, agreeing to inject massive sums of aid and initially taking a 10% dividend on those stakes in exchange.\n\nBut the government changed those terms in 2012. The changes force the bailed-out firms to send all of their profits to the U.S. Treasury as dividend payments, replacing the fixed 10% dividend with this so-called profit \u201csweep.\u201d Mr. Berkowitz\u2019s Fairholme Funds has filed two different lawsuit challenging the legality of the sweep, joining more than a dozen other investors.\n\nIn legal filings last year, the Treasury said it made that change because of concerns that Fannie might ultimately exhaust the hundreds of billions in aid the government had pledged in order to pay the 10% dividend, which would trigger receivership. The 2012 amendment\u2014the third such amendment to the government\u2019s bailout terms\u2014don\u2019t require any dividend payments to be made when Fannie and Freddie lose money.\n\nProjections from the Treasury show that as of August 2012, Fannie would exhaust the $125 billion in remaining government support by 2024 simply to make the dividend payments. The mere threat of receivership would have spooked bond investors long before that date was reached.\n\nThe government wasn\u2019t alone in this view. Several Wall Street research reports in 2012 had raised similar concerns, in part because the dividend payments\u2014almost $12 billion a year for Fannie and $7 billion a year for Freddie\u2014exceeded the firms\u2019 annual profits for most of their corporate lives. In an interview one week before the government amended the bailout, Fannie\u2019s then-CFO, Susan McFarland, told the Journal that it was \u201chard for me to envision\u201d that the company would \u201cmake enough every single quarter to cover the dividend payment.\u201d\n\nOf course, those fears turned out to be wrong. Rising home prices fueled huge profits at Fannie and Freddie last year of $84 billion and $48.7 billion, respectively.\n\nThis brings us back to Mr. Berkowitz\u2019s latest argument. Even if the government\u2019s projections hadn\u2019t proven way off the mark, he says that the government\u2019s initial 2008 backstops of the companies allowed for them to avoid paying the 10% cash dividend, and instead to pay a 12% stock dividend. Under that scenario, the government wouldn\u2019t collect any cash, but it would increase its stake in Fannie or Freddie by a larger amount. (This Congressional Research Service report offers more background on the setup.)\n\nSpokesmen for Freddie Mac, the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the firms\u2019 regulator, declined to comment. Philip Laskawy, Fannie\u2019s nonexecutive chairman, said in a statement last week that the FHFA had sole authority to decide how dividend payments were made.\n\nIn Fairholme\u2019s view, if Fannie or Freddie stopped paying cash dividends, then the companies wouldn\u2019t have faced any prospect of exhausting their Treasury support because they wouldn\u2019t have had to take Treasury funds, which were finite, to pay the government the required dividends.\n\n\u201cThe rationale that\u2019s been given for the third amendment is total nonsense,\u201d said Mr. Berkowitz. Either the government, together with the companies, weren\u2019t aware of the non-cash alternative or \u201cthere\u2019s some Machiavellian something going on,\u201d he added. \u201cI prefer the simpler reason that no one bothered to read the agreement.\u201d\n\nA third possibility is that Fairholme\u2019s reading of the documents is different from the government\u2019s, just as Fairholme\u2019s argument that Fannie and Freddie should be run for private shareholders is at odds with the government\u2019s view that, under federal law, the rights and powers of the companies transferred to the FHFA when the firms were placed into conservatorship.\n\nSome officials may have viewed the non-cash dividend payment as a last resort, something to be exercised only in the event that the companies could not come up with the cash. The government\u2019s stock certificate covering their investments in Fannie and Freddie say the non-cash payment would be exercised only in the event that the companies \u201cfailed to pay dividends in a timely manner as required by this certificate.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the question is likely to end up before a judge. A separate lawsuit filed in federal court in Iowa last month by Continental Western Insurance Co., another Fannie and Freddie shareholder, raised the same argument put forward by Mr. Berkowitz. It argues that the companies weren\u2019t required to pay cash dividends. Continental Western is being represented by Cooper & Kirk PLLC, which is also representing Fairholme in its lawsuit before the U.S. Court of Claims.\n\n\u201cThe wording can be interpreted in different ways that people who drew up the document didn\u2019t expect,\u201d said David Felt, a lawyer in private practice who headed litigation for the FHFA until 2010.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that the Fairholme interpretation is wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cBut even if you view [non-cash payments] as an option, was there a reason for paying a 10% dividend versus a 12% non-cash dividend? It\u2019s pretty obvious that there is because one is cheaper.\u201d Mr. Felt is informally advising some shareholders but isn\u2019t involved in the Fairholme litigation.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "In a sideshow in the fight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a debate rages about whether the companies can pay their government dividends in stock.", "title": "Berkowitz: Treasury\u2019s Rationale for Fannie Bailout Fix Is \u2018Nonsense\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/berkowitz-treasurys-rationale-for-fannie-bailout-fix-is-nonsense/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BT312_BruceB_P_20140303133400.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Berkowitz: Treasury\u2019s Rationale for Fannie Bailout Fix Is \u2018Nonsense\u2019", "description": "In a sideshow in the fight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a debate rages about whether the companies can pay their government dividends in stock.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Nick Timiraos", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "In a sideshow in the fight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a debate rages about whether the companies can pay their government dividends in stock.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-10T16:19:37-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/berkowitz-treasurys-rationale-for-fannie-bailout-fix-is-nonsense/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-17755", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "In a sideshow in the fight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a debate rages about whether the companies can pay their government dividends in stock.", "title": "Berkowitz: Treasury\u2019s Rationale for Fannie Bailout Fix Is \u2018Nonsense\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/berkowitz-treasurys-rationale-for-fannie-bailout-fix-is-nonsense/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BT312_BruceB_P_20140303133400.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-17755", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-10T16:51:57-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf35f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut even if you view [non-cash payments] as an option, was there a reason for paying a 10% dividend versus a 12% non-cash dividend?\nThe 2012 amendment\u2014the third such amendment to the government\u2019s bailout terms\u2014don\u2019t require any dividend payments to be made when Fannie and Freddie lose money.\nPhilip Laskawy, Fannie\u2019s nonexecutive chairman, said in a statement last week that the FHFA had sole authority to decide how dividend payments were made.\nRising home prices fueled huge profits at Fannie and Freddie last year of $84 billion and $48.7 billion, respectively.\n\u201cThe rationale that\u2019s been given for the third amendment is total nonsense,\u201d said Mr. Berkowitz."}
