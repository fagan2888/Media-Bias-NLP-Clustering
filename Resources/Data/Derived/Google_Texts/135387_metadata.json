As evidence, many parents point to Europe, where legal drinking ages are lower or unenforced, and table wine flows at every meal.\n\nMany doctors, however, remain ambivalent on the best way to prevent a major public health problem. More than one in five high school students in the United States was binge drinking in 2011, according to a survey cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet, despite the Europhile parents\u2019 arguments, the picture sometimes seems more grim across the pond, where half of students in a 2009 survey reported having been intoxicated \u201cto the point of staggering when walking, having slurred speech or throwing up.\u201d\n\nIn a new report, published Tuesday in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, experts on addiction compiled the available evidence on alcohol sipping among children and attempted to draw a line between those statistics and statistics about problem drinking later in life. Just seven percent of 12-year-olds reported having consumed an entire standard alcoholic beverage, but \u201cmore than half of 12-year-olds have already had a sip, and even about one-third have by age 8,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cThe question for parents will be: 'Does that matter?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t much national data on the topic, no \u201congoing federal surveillance study\u201d to draw from. So the researchers, led by Dr. John E. Donovan, a psychiatrist and epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh, used community surveys conducted in Pennsylvania\u2019s Allegheny County. They call it the Tween to Teen Project, from which they've just reported two main findings.\n\nFirst, children who said they had tasted alcohol said their parents were OK with it. The parents, in interviews, confirmed their children\u2019s perceptions, indicating at least a common understanding between the parents and their children about alcohol use before the age of 12. More significantly, the scientists discovered that children who sipped alcohol before 12 were no more likely than their non-sipping peers to be involved \u201cin other kinds of problem behavior in adolescence, such as problem drinking, marijuana use, other drug use, delinquent behavior and risky sexual behavior,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThis finding suggests that sipping during childhood is not itself a problem behavior like delinquent behavior or drug use.\u201d\n\nOther scientists say this is perfectly healthy. Dr. David J. Hanson, of the State University of New York, Potsdam, has argued that \"societies that normalize drinking have fewer and less serious drinking problems than those that 'abnormalize' it,\" by outlawing it or associating it with deviance. In these societies, \u201cyoung people learn about alcohol from an early age within the safe environment of the home and from the parents,\" which is preferable to \"a fraternity house.\"\n\nBut Donovan and his colleagues aren\u2019t so sure. Other studies have shown that having a sip before 10 leads to having \u201cmore than a sip\u201d before age 15. \u201cEarly-onset drinking is associated with numerous negative outcomes,\u201d he said, from car wrecks to risky sexual behavior. Ultimately, they say, it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution until more conclusive evidence comes out. \"This research suggests that if children do not see their parents as strongly disapproving of child sipping, the children will be more likely to take a first step into alcohol use,\u201d Donovan said.\n\nSource: Donovan JE, Molina BSG.
