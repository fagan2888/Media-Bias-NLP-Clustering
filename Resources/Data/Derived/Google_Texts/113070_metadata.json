Why should we help you if you screwed up? You had your chance.\"\n\nAfter Feather's speech, one woman in the audience observed that in the current social climate, people who succumb to age-related diseases are seen as \"failures of wellness,\" instead of elders who deserve community support.\n\n\"As someone who cares for people who didn't make the wellness cut,\" she said, \"I'm concerned about that.\"\n\nBut on the final day of the conference, Florida Department of Elder Affairs Secretary Samuel Verghese did announce a new form of support for elders who don't make that cut because of dementia. He unveiled a plan to promote better care and treatment for an estimated 510,000 Floridians with Alzheimer's disease, as well as those uncounted others who have some form of cognitive decline.\n\nThe Dementia Care and Cure Initiative, he said, \"will engage communities across the state to be more supportive and improve the quality of life for Floridians affected by dementia.\" This does not involve any new funding, a department spokeswoman explained, but \"will be focused on coordinating and strengthening partnerships.\" According to a statement from the department, the first pilot \"Caring Community\" will be selected next month.\n\nAs the head of Elder Affairs since December, Verghese takes a lot of kidding from aging specialists for his youthful appearance. But he made it clear that focusing on his new job has taught him to plan ahead.\n\n\"We want to help people stay in their homes and their communities. That's where they age best, and that's where they want to be,\" he said, adding, \"I'm just a few years from there myself. I'm already thinking about which of my three kids are going to be my caregivers.\"\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1ff\"", "article_summary": "\"As someone who cares for people who didn't make the wellness cut,\" she said, \"I'm concerned about that.\"\nBut on the final day of the conference, Florida Department of Elder Affairs Secretary Samuel Verghese did announce a new form of support for elders who don't make that cut because of dementia.\nAfter Feather's speech, one woman in the audience observed that in the current social climate, people who succumb to age-related diseases are seen as \"failures of wellness,\" instead of elders who deserve community support.\nThis does not involve any new funding, a department spokeswoman explained, but \"will be focused on coordinating and strengthening partnerships.\"\nAs the head of Elder Affairs since December, Verghese takes a lot of kidding from aging specialists for his youthful appearance."}
