Nader: Obama the 'executioner'\n\nIn his new book, Ralph Nader calls for the end of \u201cunconstitutional wars and unchecked militarism\u201d \u2014 and lays blame on President Barack Obama for going beyond even George W. Bush.\n\nNader writes in \u201cUnstoppable\u201d that Obama \u201chas extended the Bush doctrine by declaring his unilateral right, as secret prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner, to destroy anybody, anywhere in the world, including American citizens, suspected to be engaged in alleged terrorist activities, all this vaguely and loosely defined as anti-U.S. security.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe continues, \u201cInspired by the military actions of the Clinton administration, the Obama and Bush teams made a seamless transition into a militarized foreign policy, extending even further the illegal reach of wars of choice, invasions, incursions, and drone attacks, carried out irrespective of national sovereignties.\u201d\n\n( Earlier on POLITICO: Nader to Boehner: Donate pay during shutdown)\n\nThe consumer crusader\u2019s new book also makes the case for a bipartisan effort to \u201cdismantle the corporate state.\u201d\n\nNader, best known recently for his unsuccessful presidential runs, writes in \u201cUnstoppable\u201d (out in April), that \u201cpositive spirited persons of the Right and of the Left\u201d can, in fact, come together.\n\n\u201cThis book is addressed first to those people who are not knee-jerk rejectionists,\u201d Nader writes. \u201cIt\u2019s meant for those who want to explore another beckoning pathway \u2014 one that can rescue our country from being driven further into the ground and turn into a nation where many more of its inhabitants can fulfill their potential.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Ralph Nader's plans for 2016)\n\n\u201cA major area of potential for building alliances comes from the deep aversion many people have to the wars of empire and corporate control over their lives, particularly the ever-tightening influence of Big Business on the mainstream media, elections, and our local, state, and federal governments.\u201d\n\nMuch of the book focuses on Nader\u2019s 25 proposed reforms, including linking the minimum wage with inflation and rethinking the war on drugs.\n\n\u201cThe classification and prosecution of drug use as a crime has activated and corrupted law enforcement, encouraged a truly self-defeating form of big government, endangered urban neighborhoods and many thousands of lives, and drained tens of billions of dollars a year from taxpayers.\u201d\n\nNader says that \u201calmost all the politicians are for sale \u2014 with few enough successful exceptions to point to as the preferable, contrasting alternative of politicians actually concerned with the good of the people.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Democratic governors: Obama needs to sell Obamacare)\n\nNader \u2014 no regular on the D.C. cocktail circuit \u2014 admits that pushing against the corporate state has its downfalls, especially for conservatives.\n\n\u201cYour social life might shut down,\u201d he writes. \u201cInvitations to homes and restaurants for dinner start to decline. You\u2019re not on the guest list anymore. Outings with your customary friends and their families become rarer. Your deviation from the norm is seen as apostasy or blasphemy. A few tough-skinned conservatives may shrug this off. Most are hurt and cannot easily abide ostracism.\u201d\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His new book calls for the end of \u201cunconstitutional wars and unchecked militarism.\u201d", "title": "Nader: Obama the 'executioner'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/ralph-nader-book-103908.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110922_ralph_nader_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Ralph Nader,George W.
