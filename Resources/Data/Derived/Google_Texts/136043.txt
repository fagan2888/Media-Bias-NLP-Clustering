TOMMY CHRISTOPHER, MEDIAITE: First of all, I don't know if you're aware of this, but when I had a heart attack a few years ago, I was uninsured and I haven't been able to get insurance ever since then. Listen to all the pressure on the president to negotiate, some of it coming from inside this room, made me think: Is there a chance the president would be willing to delay Obamacare for a year if Republicans would agree to delay heart attacks for a year?



JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE: Tommy, you know the president's position is that we need to implement the Affordable Care Act and when it comes to the millions of Americans across the country who have had a very hard time getting access to affordable health insurance. We need to focus on those folks and continue the business of implementing the Affordable Care Act so on January 1st those Americans should be able to purchase insurance, quality insurance.
