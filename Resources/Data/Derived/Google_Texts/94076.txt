One of the most important — and probably most difficult — things a woman goes through in her lifetime is giving birth to another human being. During pregnancy, a woman’s body goes from an autonomous form to an incubator for a new life, tasked with growing, feeding and eventually birthing a baby.

With so much going on biologically during that nine-month span, it is common for those expectant mothers to have several questions before, during and after pregnancy.

Dr. Kristina Mixer of Spectrum Health Obstetrics and Gynecology in Greenville answers a few important questions many expecting mothers may have and should ask their doctors:

1) What over-the-counter medications are safe?

Women often have a need for non-prescription medication during their pregnancy. Your provider typically will provide you with a list of recommended over-the-counter medications safe to take in pregnancy. While all medications have some risks, those typically recommended include:

• Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for headache, pain and fever

• Vitamin B6 and doxylamine (Unisom) for nausea and vomiting

• Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for cold symptoms and nausea

• Fiber supplement for constipation

• Saline nasal spray for allergic rhinitis

2) What does it mean if I am cramping or bleeding in the first trimester?

In the first trimester, it is not uncommon to experience some cramping and/or bleeding or “spotting.” As a normal pregnancy implants and begins to grow inside the uterus, a patient may experience occasional cramping and light spotting. Persistent cramping and/or bleeding can be a more concerning sign of one of the following:

• Possible miscarriage

• Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside of the uterine cavity) or other abnormal pregnancy (Molar pregnancy)

• Infection — vaginal or uterine

If you are experiencing persistent cramping and/or bleeding you should contact your provider.

3) How much weight should I gain in pregnancy and what exercise is safe?

Weight gain in pregnancy is typically modified to your pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by weight and height. General BMI are:

• For underweight women (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), weight gain would be between 28 to 40 pounds

• For women in the normal weight range (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2), 25 to 35 pounds

• For overweight women (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), 15 to 25 pounds

• For obese women (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2), 11 to 20 pounds

For exercise, a wide range of recreational activities are safe in pregnancy, including walking, swimming, yoga and strength training with some modifications to avoid abdominal trauma and prolonged periods of time in the supine position (especially in the second half of pregnancy). Additionally, pregnant women are advised to avoid exercises that are likely to lead to dehydration and overheating.

4) What vaccinations are recommended during pregnancy?

Only two vaccines are currently recommended for routine use during pregnancy. They include:

• Primary or booster doses of adult type tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap).

• Inactivated influenza vaccine (seasonal and H1N1)

5) How long can I work when I’m pregnant?

Depending on your job, you will probably be able to work up until you deliver. It is important, however, to discuss any physical or emotional stressors you are experiencing at work with your provider throughout the pregnancy. You should also discuss any maternity leave requirements with your employer. Oftentimes, your employer will require forms to be filled out by you and your provider. These forms may take a few business days to be completed by your provider’s office therefore you should plan accordingly.

6) Do I need a birth plan?

A birth plan is not required but many women choose to make one in an effort to familiarize themselves with the labor and delivery process and provide a comprehensive list of personal preferences during that process. Reviewing your birth plan with your provider prior to labor will provide an opportunity to discuss expectations and review concerns you and your provider may have regarding your labor and delivery experience.

7) What happens during a typical labor and delivery?

This will depend on your provider and the facility where you choose to deliver. Typically, during labor and delivery, you will have your blood drawn and an IV placed. There will be monitoring of your baby and your uterine activity with two monitors placed on your belly with soft straps. The nurse or provider will perform cervical exams intermittently to assess cervical dilation and effacement. Interventions for your well-being and the baby’s well-being may be recommended throughout the labor and delivery and should be explained to you as those situations arise. Pain management options will be reviewed with you throughout the various stages of labor. Recommendation for cesarean delivery can be made at any time during labor or delivery, even after pushing for some time. The entire experience will depend on a number of factors, some of which cannot be predicted. Your provider will do their best to keep you apprised of concerns as they arise and include you in any treatment decisions as they see fit. Another important question to ask you provider prior to labor is who you can expect to be your delivering provider.

8) What are my risk factors for a Cesarean delivery?

This is obviously going to be different for every person. Common risk factors for Cesarean section include:

• Maternal obesity

• Gestational diabetes

• Suspected macrosomia (larger than average baby)

• Nulliparity (a mom who has never delivered a baby before)

• Post-term pregnancy (going past your due date)

• Previous cesarean delivery

• Increasing maternal age (especially > 35 years old

It is important to review your personal risks with your provider prior to labor.

9) What support is available for breastfeeding mothers?

This is a very important question for all women who are considering breastfeeding to ask their provider prior to delivery. There are a number of practices in place to encourage and support breastfeeding moms and babies. Skin-to-skin contact immediately after delivery, rooming in with baby 24 hours a day and avoiding any pacifiers or artificial nipples has been shown to improve breastfeeding success. Discuss with your provider what access you have to lactation consultants and other support services, both during your hospital stay and after you go home.
