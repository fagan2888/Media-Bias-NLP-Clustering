Con-Way is the nation\u2019s second-largest provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) freight, in which freight from multiple companies, usually retailers, is shipped on the same truck. XPO will purchase Con-Way at a share price of $47.60, well above Con-Way\u2019s Wednesday closing price of $35.53. The deal becomes a centerpiece of XPO\u2019s frenzied array of purchases, having completed 14 mergers and acquisitions since CEO Brad Jacobs took over in 2011. XPO\u2019s 2015 projected revenue is $6.7 billion, which would be over 40 times what the company earned in 2010. Although the acquisition had been expected to easily pass a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust regulatory review, Morningstar has reported that New York-based firm Faruqi & Faruqi is investigating Con-Way\u2019s board over alleged violation of fiduciary duties for selling the company at the $47.60 share price, that number is down from the stock\u2019s 52-week high of $59.00. It remains to be seen if the inquiry will halt the deal\u2019s approval. XPO expects the purchase to be completed by October.\n\nFor its part, Con-Way has had a rough year, with its stock price dropping 28 percent in 2015 amid poor earnings reports, earning $2.8 billion in revenue so far this year. This comes even as the LTL market has been humming along. Despite the poor financial performance, Jacob\u2019s praised the relationship between Con-Way management and its workers, saying \u201cCon-way has good relations with its drivers. Turnover is in the low single digits within LTL and 55% in its TL division They pay very well, there is a cultural emphasis on safety, and they hold to a \u2018driver first\u2019 philosophy, and we\u2019re going to build on that.\u201d Jacobs noted that Con-Way is not a \u201cfixer-upper,\u201d adding that \u201cThey have very satisfied customers. We just want to improve the efficiency and profitability of the business.\u201d He also said that XPO would continue Con-Way\u2019s anti-union stance, saying \u201cWe believe very firmly that employees and drivers are better off without a union with ulterior motives getting between them and management.\u201d Despite offering praise to the company, XPO announced that it will not retain Con-Way\u2019s board members, although CEO Douglas Stotlar will remain on the board in an advisory role on a temporary basis.\n\nXPO Logistics, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has been primarily a middleman in the transport industry. Jacobs, who strongly believes there will be a capacity shortage in the near future, said in a conference call with analysts and reporters, \u201cThere is no doubt about it in my mind, though it is up for debate when it occurs,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut when it does, he who controls assets will do very well.\u201d The Con-Way purchase, along with the $3.5 billion purchase of French trucking company Norbert Dentressangle SA in June, gives XPO an instant foothold in the trucking market. The deals will lead to XPO earning more than a third of its revenue through \u201casset-heavy operations,\u201d as well as increase its flexibility, a major asset in the LTL market. Among the efficiencies cited by Jacobs will be to combine the freight-brokerage operations of the two companies, a move that he hopes to complete by the end of this year. Desiring to become a \u201cone stop shop,\u201d Jacobs said in the conference call, Jacobs said \u201cwe will be a flexible, adaptable, and opportunistic company. We will skate to where puck is going, not where it is, looking at where the trends going and embrace strategies to adapt to them.\u201d\n\nSources:\n\nBloomberg Business \u2013 Ed Hammond and Jeffery McCracken\n\nFleet Owner \u2013 Sean Kilcarr\n\nWall Street Journal \u2013 Brian Baskin and Loretta Chao\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "Acquisition-hungry XPO Logistics announced on Wednesday that it will purchase Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Con-Way Inc. for $3 billion in an all-cash deal.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Staff", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "Acquisition-hungry XPO Logistics announced on Wednesday that it will purchase Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Con-Way Inc. for $3 billion in an all-cash deal.", "title": "XPO Logistics to Buy Con-Way for $3 Billion - Legal Reader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/XPObig.jpg", "url": "http://www.legalreader.com/xpo-logistics-to-buy-con-way-for-3-billion/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 1598871133679697}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thelegalreader", "section": "Business", "tag": "XPO", "published_time": "2015-09-10T15:35:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3a9\"", "article_summary": "XPO will purchase Con-Way at a share price of $47.60, well above Con-Way\u2019s Wednesday closing price of $35.53.\nAcquisition-hungry XPO Logistics announced on Wednesday that it has agreed to purchase Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Con-Way Inc. for $3 billion in an all-cash deal.\nDespite the poor financial performance, Jacob\u2019s praised the relationship between Con-Way management and its workers, saying \u201cCon-way has good relations with its drivers.\n\u201cBut when it does, he who controls assets will do very well.\u201d The Con-Way purchase, along with the $3.5 billion purchase of French trucking company Norbert Dentressangle SA in June, gives XPO an instant foothold in the trucking market.\nXPO\u2019s 2015 projected revenue is $6.7 billion, which would be over 40 times what the company earned in 2010."}
