Joe Pitts, who earlier this year sponsored a failed attempt to rework ObamaCare, recently told The Hill that his colleagues \u201cregret\u201d that decision -- evidence Republicans are moving away from their do-or-die approach to the law.\n\nPitts told the newspaper that fellow House Republicans appear to be \u201cshifting toward targeted fixes, if you want to call it that.\u201d\n\nRepublicans strategists insist that harping on ObamaCare straight through the 2016 presidential election cycle is a winning strategy -- pointing to the recent Virginia governor\u2019s race in which Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli lost but managed to close a double-digit lead by hammering away at the law in the closing weeks of the campaign.\n\nSome Democrats are also trying also trying to change the law -- particularly senators seeking re-election next year in conservative-leaning states.\n\nAmong them are Mark Begich, of Alaska, Mary Landrieu, of Louisiana, and Kay Hagan, of North Carolina, who are also facing conservative groups vowing to spend millions to show voters their early support for ObamaCare.\n\nLandrieu,in fact, introduced a bill last week similar to the House one that would allow Americans to keep their existing health plans.\n\n\u201cWhen we passed the Affordable Care Act, we did so with the intention that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it,\u201d she said. \u201cA promise was made and this legislation will ensure that this promise is kept. I have said repeatedly that the \u2026 act isn't perfect, and I am willing to work with anyone who wants to improve it and implement it correctly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
