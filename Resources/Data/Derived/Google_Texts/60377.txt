Seven Cherokee Nation marshals were recently cross-deputized by the U.S. Marshal Service to maintain a presence at the Claremore Indian Hospital.

The agreement allows Cherokee Nation marshals to enter the Indian Health Services facility while investigating cases and other work. Two years ago the hospital was solely under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Marshals until a group of Cherokee Nation marshals were first cross-deputized.

“The U.S. Marshals rarely do cross-deputizations. The fact that we are able to do this for a second time in two years is a testament of the great reputation and relationship we’ve maintained with them,” said Cherokee Nation Marshal Shannon Buhl.

The Cherokee Nation Marshals who were cross-deputized are Mike Roach, Shawnna Roach and Vincent Smith, of Tahlequah; Jon Ketcher and Jess Anderson, of Pryor; Marshall Green, of Grove; and Danny Tanner, of Delaware County.

All 37 Cherokee Nation marshals are cross-deputized with one or more of about 50 law enforcement agencies in the state.
