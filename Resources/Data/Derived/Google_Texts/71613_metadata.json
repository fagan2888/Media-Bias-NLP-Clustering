Elise Stefanik (R-NY21-Willsboro) is running for re-election. \u201cAs 2016 begins, I\u2019ve been humbled and energized by the tremendous support our campaign received from hundreds of donors from all across the 21st District this past year,\u201d said the rep. She\u2019s pictured here in Willsboro last summer with her pup.\n\nGLENS FALLS \u2014 She\u2019s in.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY21-Willsboro) formally announced her campaign for re-election last week.\n\nThe first-term representative said she made the decision after consulting with numerous community, business and political leaders after a \u201csuccessful results-oriented year in office.\u201d\n\nStefanik said key accomplishments of her year-long tenure include the introduction of year-round Pell legislation, leading the effort to successfully suspend the medical device tax and leading the state congressional delegation\u2019s efforts to stave off cuts at Fort Drum.\n\nThe rep also cited the repeal of the auto-enrollment provision of the Affordable Care Act as a highlight, as well as a bipartisan approach to governance and transparency with her constituents.\n\n\u201cMy top priority has been keeping my promises to bring a new generation of leadership to Congress, and to demonstrate a new approach with a focus on accountability and transparency, accessibility through hundreds of community events to hear directly from constituents, and by prioritizing legislation that helps people raise a family or make a living in the North Country, not make it harder,\u201d Stefanik said in a news release.\n\nStefanik, 31, spent last weekend in the district, meeting with medical professionals in Lake Placid and skiing at Whiteface Mountain.\n\nShe begins the cycle with nearly $1 million on hand.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month, she batted away questions about the race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on doing my job,\u201d said Stefanik, citing the positive feedback she has received across the political spectrum.\n\nLast week, Stefanik met with the Essex County Republican Committee before they endorsed her.\n\nChairman Shaun Gillilland said Stefanik has accomplished more for the district than any member of Congress in living memory.\n\n\u201cShe has quickly become a rising leader in Congress, she has sponsored numerous successful bills in Congress, she has successfully protected Fort Drum, she has kept her promise to legislate in a bipartisan basis and work across the aisle,\u201d Gillilland said in an email.\n\nGillilland also cited the rep\u2019s dedication to constituent services across one of the largest districts east of the Mississippi.\n\n\u201cShe represents the future of our country, she represents the all the people of the North Country and she arduously works for and fights for the interests of all of us.\u201d\n\nCHALLENGERS STEP OUT\n\nThe Willsboro rep was elected in November 2014, beating Democrat Aaron Woolf by 21 percentage points. A third candidate, Matt Funiciello, garnered about 10.5 percent.\n\nThis year, Mike Derrick, a retired army colonel from Peru, is seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s nod.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she will try to ignore me as long as possible \u2014 and I don\u2019t blame her!\u201d Derrick told the Sun.\n\nDerrick, who entered the race last summer, said he has spent the past 7 months traveling the district and meeting with stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to a closely contested campaign between two different candidates,\u201d Derrick said.\n\nThe candidate cited his military bonafides and took a shot at Stefanik, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wasted opportunity to put someone with very thin experience in those areas in such a position,\u201d Derrick said.\n\nDerrick said he\u2019s running, in part, because American performance at the federal level pales when compared to more productive policies at the state and local levels.\n\n\u201cIt should be very, very closely synchronized and that is not happening right now,\u201d Derrick said.\n\nThe last legislative session was one of the most unproductive in US history, the candidate noted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived a life of leadership,\u201d Derrick said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve lived, and have delivered results.\u201d\n\nDerrick said he is a candidate \u201cof and for the North Country versus someone from Washington.\u201d\n\nWhile just red and blue for now, voters can expect a splash of green this spring.\n\nFuniciello said he plans on making an announcement in March.\n\n\u201cI have every full intention of running,\u201d Funiciello told the Sun. \u201cIt is soon going to be a three-way race.\u201d\n\nThe Glens Falls-based baker said the 2014 election helped galvanize independent voters in the district, which number some 40 percent of the electorate.\n\nThe Green Party also aims to run candidates for state assembly and senate, he said.\n\nFuniciello said he looked forward to debating the issues with Stefanik now that she has a voting record.\n\nStefanik, said Funiciello, voted for the now-defunct Keystone Pipeline and against Environmental Protection Agency carbon limits for power plants.\n\n\u201cShe needs to be held accountable for that,\u201d Funiciello said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to talk about these issues with someone who has voted on the wrong side of them.\u201d\n\nFuniciello said he has met Derrick and likes him.\n\n\u201cMike is a principled person who I think is running for sincere reasons,\u201d Funiciello said.\n\nFuniciello said he hoped he could discuss the issues without being marginalized by the two-party system.\n\nDerrick said Funiciello \u201cclearly struck a chord\u201d with the electorate in the district.\n\nAt one point, Funiciello called for Woolf to drop out and endorse him.\n\n\u201cMatt Funiciello doesn\u2019t stand a chance of getting elected and I certainly do,\u201d said Derrick.\n\n\u201cThat is too bad, but we\u2019ll leave that for the voters to decide,\u201d Funiciello shot back.\n\nNeither of the two parties will ever represent the working class, said Funiciello.\n\n\u201cIf the voters wish to see real change, I will give them that choice this November.\u201d\n\nFINANCES\n\nStefanik announced that the campaign had raised $236,000 in the fourth quarter, bringing in over $1.3 million in 2015 \u2014 the highest off-year fundraising total in the history of the district, the campaign noted. Stefanik begins the year with $928,000 cash on hand.\n\nThe Derrick campaign reported raising $209,352 in 2015, with $72,999 raised from 316 individuals within the district and $136,353 from 302 individuals from outside the district, with $135,000 cash on hand.\n\nFuniciello reported having zero on hand because he hasn\u2019t started fundraising yet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to until I announce officially in March,\u201d he said.\n\nSTEFANIK CAMPAIGN RESPONDS\n\nStefanik campaign spokesman Lenny Alcivar sounded off on Derrick\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cMike Derrick\u2019s stated belief that having the 21st District represented on the vital House Arms Service Committee is \u2018wasted\u2019 is an insult to the men and women serving at Fort Drum and around the world,\u201d Alcivar said in an email.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Stefanik is the only candidate running with the proven experience and record of getting things done on behalf of her district \u2014 especially when it comes to protecting and defending Fort Drum and the military community in her district,\u201d Alcivar continued.\n\nAlcivar said Stefanik has a \u201cproven record\u201d as a leading voice on the House Armed Services Committee leading the successful effort to unite the state\u2019s congressional delegation to \u201cprotect and strengthen\u201d Fort Drum, which was at risk of significant cuts last year.\n\nStefanik, he said, has been an outspoken critic of defense cuts and has consistently fought against sequestration, which was successfully suspended.\n\n\u201cStefanik has built a reputation as one of the most effective Members on the Committee, especially as it relates to Army Readiness issues. Stefanik also single handedly ensured that the planning and design for an East Coast Missile Defense site was included in final appropriations package,\u201d Alcivar said.\n\nOn Funiciello\u2019s comments:\n\n\u201cLike her predecessor Bill Owens, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik voted for the bipartisan Keystone Pipeline which helps bring needed energy independence and security and creates American jobs. Congresswoman Stefanik is one of the original co-sponsors of Chris Gibson\u2019s bill to combat climate change while protecting American jobs. Stefanik believes that we must address climate change but instead of increasing federal regulations, we need to solve this issue using free market principles.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GLENS FALLS \u2014 She\u2019s in. \nRep.
