Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who bought the Washington Post, Senator Ted Cruz, who battled Obamacare, and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who introduced Citibikes and tried to ban 20-oz. sodas, were raked over the coals at the 71st annual “Financial Follies” of the New York Financial Writers Assn. Nov. 22 at the Marriott Marquis. A black-tie audience of more than 1,000, which included more than 300 financial reporters, enjoyed not only the show and a night of networking but an after-party in the hotel’s duplex penthouse hosted by Vapor Corp., marketer of nicotine-delivering electronic cigarets, cigars and hookah sticks.

About half of the well-dressed gathering were women, some in floor-length gowns. The “Follies” night was for males only during its early years. The 14-member chorus serenaded Bezos as follows: “Oh my God this dweeb is brilliant He’s worth 27 billion Even though he’s crocodilian We just wanna be Jeff Bezos” The tune of “Sea Cruise” was used for Cruz: “Come on, sailors, let’s make some news Defund Obamacare, the socialist ooze Now hop on board, lose your Tea Party blues Won’t ya let me take you on a Ted Cruise?” Bloomberg Ribbed About Bikes, Sodas Bloomberg took a ribbing for providing thousands of bikes to city residents, defending stop-and-frisk, and trying to eliminate 20-ounce sodas. The chorus sang, to the tune of “Thank You Herbert Hoover” from “Annie”: “Today the city is a dandy Today the real estate’s a steal Today we’re flying down the bike lanes It’s damn near ideal We used to smoke with wild abandon We’d chug a 20-ounce or four We used to care about the homeless We don’t any more” SAC Capital Advisors, headed by Steven Cohen, which paid $1.2 billion in fines in November on insider trading charges, was one of the targets. Chorus sang, to the tune of “Jet Song” from West Side Story: “When you’re with SAC, you’re with SAC all the way From your first inside trade to your last dying day When you’re with Steven A. Cohen’s hedge fund
