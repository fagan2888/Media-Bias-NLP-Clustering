In the past, we\u2019ve been able to link behaviors outside the social norm with future acts of violence, and we\u2019ve even tried to figure out what it is that causes violent behavior in those who do seem to act normal.\n\nEven more difficult than recognizing the behaviors associated with an increased risk for violence is understanding biological traits that may be indicators of future violence. A low resting heart rate (LRHR) has been associated with certain types of bad behavior in past studies, and a new study has been published associating an LRHR as a late adolescent with an increased risk for violent criminality in men.\n\nLRHR has been linked to antisocial behavior in adolescents, the reason for which is still being discussed. Many experts believe an LRHR could be an indicator of a chronically low level of physical arousal, which could lead some to seek stimulating experiences. Another theory sees an LRHR as a marker of weakened responses to aversive and stressful stimuli, which could lead one down a path of fearlessness and risk-taking.\n\nVery little is known about the relationship between RHR and violence in particular, so researchers decided to take a look at this possible biological risk factor.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Antti Latvala of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the University of Helsinki, Finland. She and her coauthors used data from 710,264 Swedish men with up to 35.7 years of follow up. RHR and blood pressure had been measured at mandatory military testing when the men were 18 years old. During the follow up, 40,093 men were convicted of a violent crime.\n\nThe researchers observed that men with the lowest RHR (less than or equal to 60 beats per minute) had a 39 percent higher chance of being convicted of violent crimes and a 25 percent higher chance of being convicted of nonviolent crimes when compared to the group with the highest RHR (greater than or equal to 83 beats per minute.)\n\n\u201cOur results confirm that, in addition to being associated with aggressive and antisocial outcomes in childhood and adolescence, low RHR increases the risk for violent and nonviolent antisocial behaviors in adulthood,\u201d the authors wrote in the study.\n\nIn an associated editorial, Dr. Adrian Raine of the University of Pennsylvania pointed out the significance of the study\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cWe now have knowledge that a person\u2019s lower RHR raises, albeit weakly, the odds of an individual committing future offenses beyond his or her control,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCan the criminal justice system continue to turn a blind eye to the anatomy of violence?\u201d\n\nSource: Latvala A, et al.
