PhysioCare starts with a downloaded app that leads to selection of a physical therapist, a 45-minute exam and the creation of what she calls a “personal care plan” prescribed by a doctor of physical therapy. Jarmusz, a doctor of physical therapy student at Northeastern University, said her plan would not replace the annual exam of a physician, but be in addition to it. “Physical therapists are better suited to assess the musculoskeletal system,” Jarmusz said.
