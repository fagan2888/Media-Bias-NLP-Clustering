It was South Dakota\u2019s first win inside the Fargodome in nine tries and the team\u2019s first win in Fargo since 1978.\n\n\n\nThe Coyotes (3-3, 1-2 MVFC) scored 10 points in the game\u2019s final five minutes and held the Bison (4-2, 2-1) scoreless in the second half, yielding 56 yards on the Bison\u2019s five drives. South Dakota\u2019s defense forced five 3-and-outs on 11 possessions for the game as the Coyotes outgained the Bison 395-320. NDSU came in averaging 33 points and 450 yards per game.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a lucky win for us,\u201d said South Dakota Head Coach Joe Glenn. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fumble the ball to us. They didn\u2019t throw interceptions. They didn\u2019t get hurt by the officiating. They just got outplayed by a tough, gritty bunch that was bound and determined to win this game. They fought and scrapped to the final kick and came out winners and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of these guys.\u201d\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota fullback Drew Potter hauled in an 8-yard touchdown pass from Ryan Saeger to cap a 15-play, 72-yard drive that tied the game at 21-21 with 4:47 remaining. It was the third collegiate touchdown reception for Potter and his only catch of the day.\n\n\n\nThe Bison ran twice for five yards, threw an incomplete pass on third down and punted back to the \u2018Yotes with 3:20 remaining. The winning drive started on the South Dakota 29.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing the coaches stressed was get the game into the fourth quarter and let\u2019s see what happens, and that\u2019s exactly what we did,\u201d said Saeger. \u201cThe defense shut them out in the second half. Going into the fourth quarter we were down by a touchdown, they missed a field goal, and we just took advantage of a couple stops and did what we needed to do and then Bergner iced it for us.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaeger converted two first downs with his legs on the winning drive and Trevor Bouma added a 14-yard carry that got South Dakota down to the 27. Michael Fredrick ran to the Bison 16 on a first-down run and the Coyotes let the clock tick down to three seconds before calling timeout. The winning drive was nine plays, 55 yards.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur goal was to come here and play our best in all three phases of the game,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cThe last couple weeks we\u2019ve missed one part or the other.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe showed that we could give them a battle. We knew that and played pretty darn good. We had to. We played a very good football team.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaeger completed 12 of 20 passes for 202 yards, three yards shy of his career high. He threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Brandt Van Roekel with 10:38 left in the second quarter that cut North Dakota State\u2019s lead to 14-7. He snuck in from 1-yard out less than five minutes later to tie the game at 14-14. Saeger ran 16 times for 92 yards.\n\n\n\nSaeger faked a quarterback draw and hit Bouma for a 73-yard completion to the NDSU 8 and Bouma carried to the 1 before Saeger\u2019s sneak. Bouma caught two passes for 80 yards and ran 20 times for a game-high 94 yards.\n\n\n\nNorth Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz completed 16 of 28 passes for 195 yards. He threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Darrius Shepherd to put the Bison in front 14-0 with 2:30 left in the first quarter. He led NDSU on an 11-play, 72-yard touchdown drive just before halftime. He hit Andrew Bonnet with a 7-yard touchdown to give the Bison a 21-14 halftime lead.\n\n\n\nThe Bison forced two turnovers, but netted two yards on the two ensuing drives. Both teams missed field goals near the start of the fourth quarter. Bergner missed a 47-yard attempt that would have cut the Bison lead to 21-17. Cam Pedersen\u2019s first miss of the season followed, a 45-yard miss that would have made it 24-14 with 12 minutes left.\n\n\n\nJohn Wessel\u2019s career-high 11 tackles led South Dakota\u2019s defense. Keyen Lage added 10. Andrew Van Ginkel had seven tackles and netted his sixth sack of the season.\n\n\n\nThe Coyotes return to Vermillion and will host Missouri State (1-5, 0-3) next Saturday at 2 p.m. inside the DakotaDome.\n\nCollege {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 Associated Press.
