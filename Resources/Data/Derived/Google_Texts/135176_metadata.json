Wolf headlined: \u201c5 Benefits Of Having a Friend With Benefits.\u201d In case you\u2019re not hip to liberal-speak, \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d refers to the \u201cprogressive\u201d idea that it\u2019s really cool for friends to use each other for casual, meaningless sex.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nWrites Wolf:\n\n\u201cSome of us believe that friends with benefits can be mutually enjoyable and perfectly suited to our needs \u2014 not just when we\u2019re very young, and not as a matter of explicitly avoiding commitment. \u201cIn fact, it seems to me that friends with benefits gets a bad rap, as if women aren\u2019t supposed to feel desire (in general) or lust (in particular) \u2014 especially once they become mothers, or if they\u2019re \u2018of a certain age.\u2019\u201d\n\nYes, nothing says \u201cI respect you\u201d like using your \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d body to sexually gratify yourself.\n\nWolf then asks the following:\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re putting the pieces back together after a divorce, isn\u2019t discovery of our newly single sexual self part of the process? Don\u2019t we want to enjoy the flirtation, the fantasy, the sensation and the sense of well-being that comes from sexual foreplay and sex itself? Who doesn\u2019t love the jolt of energy, the boost to mood, the sparkle of feeling fully alive that comes from great sex? \u201cAnd don\u2019t we feel reassured when we re-engage with our sexual selves after divorce or a tough breakup?\u201d\n\nYes, again, nothing gives a woman a \u201csense of well-being\u201d like being exploited for casual sex by some jerk who calls himself her friend, yet uses her like a piece of meat. Giving away the milk for free? Now that\u2019ll earn you some respect. The fellas will be lining up around the corner with marriage proposals. But they\u2019ll have to wait on all your \u201cfriends\u201d to get done \u201cbenefiting\u201d first.\n\nMs. Wolf, a veritable fount of \u201cprogressive\u201d wisdom, blah-blahs on:\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, especially as a mother, if you\u2019re looking for sex but not in a position to pursue something more, whatever exploration you undertake, you owe it to your kids (and of course yourself) to do it safely.\u201d\n\nHow thoughtful. Parent of the year material. Hear that, kids? Sure, mommy\u2019s a trollop \u2013 and sure, she\u2019s hooking up with all the guys at the office, but she\u2019s \u201cdoing it safely.\u201d\n\nAren\u2019t we proud of mommy?\n\nWolf drones on:\n\n\u201cOne of the advantages of a friend with benefits is freedom from overly romantic attachments. \u2026 So why not experiment with your special friend, if the thought appeals to you?\u201d\n\nExactly! Why not? For that matter, why short-change yourself? Why go gratis? You\u2019re basically there anyway. Fifty bucks a pop would sure help with those Botox injections.\n\nWolf concludes:\n\n\u201cI admit that I was a fan of the friends with benefits model from an early age. I love being in love, but that sort of attachment doesn\u2019t come around every day. Friends with benefits \u2014 in my life \u2014 was just right, several times.\u201d\n\nReally? Only several times? Mommy has lots of \u201cspecial friends,\u201d doesn\u2019t she? Your children must be so proud. \u201cHey, everybody! Look what my mommy wrote in the Huffington Post!\u201d\n\nAnd the great news? Once the feds figure out how to make this whole Obamacare thingy work, you\u2019ll get all the herpes meds you can swallow \u2013 for free!\n\nNow that is a \u201cbenefit\u201d you can share with your friends.\n\nMatt Barber is founder and editor-in chief of BarbWire.com.
