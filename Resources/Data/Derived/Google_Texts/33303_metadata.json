Jeb Bush speaks at an AARP New Hampshire Social Security Summit on Dec. 8, 2015, as part of the group's \"Take A Stand\" campaign.\n\nThe largest seniors group in the country has launched a campaign to get presidential candidates to discuss their plans for Social Security -- only it won\u2019t say which Social Security reforms it prefers, and progressive retirement policy leaders are none too happy about it. AARP, a nonprofit with 37 million members all over the age of 50, announced its \u201cTake A Stand\u201d initiative last November. The organization is asking presidential candidates to present their detailed plans for shoring up Social Security\u2019s finances and ensuring that its benefits are adequate now and in the future. Social Security is an increasingly vital source of income for seniors and people with disabilities, but the program faces a funding gap that will prevent it from paying out all of its scheduled benefits in 2034 unless adjustments are made. John Hishta, AARP's senior vice president of campaigns who heads the new initiative, said the group is focusing on Social Security because it's simpler than dealing with Medicare, which also faces financial challenges. \u201cWe believe that [Social Security] is the major issue that needs to be dealt with first,\u201d Hishta said. \u201cOnce you deal with that, you can get into Medicare as well.\u201d The campaign includes a multi-million-dollar TV advertising blitz in early primary states. In one of the spots, a donkey and an elephant stand by as a phone with \u201cSocial Security\u201d on the caller ID continues to ring. \u201cYou can\u2019t deal with something by ignoring it,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cBut that\u2019s how some candidates seem to be dealing with Social Security.\u201d\n\nAARP has also enlisted thousands of its members to volunteer in early primary states and directly ask candidates to detail their plans for the popular social insurance program. The red-uniformed AARP members have already made their presence known at recent South Carolina campaign events for Republican hopefuls Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). AARP has also launched a \"Take A Stand\" website that features video testimonials from several presidential candidates about their Social Security proposals and keeps track of the politicians' statements in real time. Although the group does not endorse political candidates in an effort to remain non-partisan, the size of its membership and outspokenness about specific public policy issues has historically given it major clout on Capitol Hill. However, the campaign refrains from passing judgment on the merit of the candidates\u2019 Social Security plans. As long as they propose ways to close the program\u2019s long-term funding gap and maintain adequate benefits, AARP gives the candidates credit for \u201ctaking a stand.\u201d\n\nGreeted at @marcorubio event with \"#take a stand, y'all are everywhere!\" @AARPadvocates pic.twitter.com/cKUtH9AoOy \u2014 AARP South Carolina (@AARPSC) February 12, 2016\n\nRepublican front-runner Donald Trump is the only presidential candidate still in the race who AARP says does not have a plan. Trump has vowed to protect Social Security from benefits cuts, but has offered little information about how he would do this. AARP\u2019s neutrality about the substance of the candidates\u2019 plans rankles progressive advocates, who have taken a strong stance against benefit cuts and believe that the country\u2019s largest and most-recognized senior organization should as well. \u201cI like that they are demanding that candidates talk about Social Security,\u201d said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a group devoted to protecting and expanding Social Security benefits. \u201cI do not understand why after a candidate talks about it, they don\u2019t do the obvious next step, and say, \u2018That\u2019s a good plan and that\u2019s a bad plan\u2019 based on where their members stand,\" he added. \"Having a shitty plan, universally hated by your people, versus having a good plan, is not equal, but AARP is pretending it is.\u201d\n\nHaving a shitty plan, universally hated by your people, versus having a good plan, is not equal, but AARP is pretending it is. Alex Lawson, Social Security Works\n\nMaya Rockeymoore, president of Global Policy Solutions and a specialist in the challenges that older people of color face, also criticized the initiative, though she noted that it's consistent with AARP\u2019s attempts to avoid partisanship. \u201cIf you are advocating for older adults, the question becomes, 'What is the situation of older adults?'\u201d she said. \u201cAre there policy proposals overall that would benefit older adults?\u201d Rockeymoore was an early proponent of expanding Social Security benefits in 2011, a position that has since become the norm in progressive circles. \u201cThere is no question where AARP should stand: on the side of older adults trying to make ends meet. And their policy prescriptions should reflect that,\u201d Rockeymoore said. Hishta rejects the notion that AARP's decision not to lay out specific preferences for Social Security right now betrays its commitment to protecting seniors. He said that the organization is trying to encourage a conversation about a contentious topic that has been relegated to the back burner in recent years. AARP hopes that the campaign will help prompt the next president and Congress to prioritize action on Social Security. \u201cThis is not about AARP -- it is about the candidates and the voters being engaged on an issue that millions of people rely on,\u201d Hishta said. \u201cThe candidates need to talk about the solutions they are going to put forth, to talk about the program so we can have a legislative debate with presidential leadership.\u201d Once Social Security is firmly on the next president\u2019s agenda, Hishta noted, AARP will be less hesitant to express its opinion about individual reform proposals. \u201cThere will be a time and a place once there is a legislative debate for there to be more engagement on whatever the solutions are,\u201d Hishta said.\n\nThere will be a time and a place once there is a legislative debate for there to be more engagement on whatever the solutions are. John Hishta, AARP\n\nAARP published a presidential voting guide as recently as 2012 that compared the two main presidential candidates\u2019 answers on issues like Social Security alongside AARP\u2019s position on the issue. It is perhaps as close to an endorsement as the organization offers. But AARP will not be publishing a comparable voter guide offering its views on Social Security this time.\n\nIt is impossible to understand the criticism of AARP\u2019s \u201cTake A Stand\u201d campaign without noting how the Social Security policy debate -- and AARP\u2019s role in it -- has evolved in recent years. The progressive groups that joined AARP in scuttling President George W. Bush\u2019s privatization effort in 2005, for example, have since shifted their goal from beating back cuts to fighting for the program\u2019s expansion. National progressive icons like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and liberal opinion leaders like The New York Times editorial board have brought expansion proposals into the mainstream, arguing that increasing Social Security benefits is a logical response to what they say is an impending retirement income deficit. Nowhere is the shift on the progressive side of the debate more evident than in the two Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 agreement that benefits should be expanded. There is also some lingering suspicion among progressive organizations that AARP views itself as a Beltway dealmaker and may not fight prospective benefit cuts. Other seniors groups denounced the organization in June 2011 after John Rother, then the group\u2019s policy chief, indicated that AARP would not oppose all Social Security benefit cuts and would merely use its leverage to insist that cuts would be \u201cminimal.\u201d At the time, Obama was seeking a \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d on fiscal policy with congressional Republicans that would trade cuts in social insurance programs for revenue increases. \u201cThey were wrong then, and I think that their membership spoke out against that,\u201d Social Security Works' Lawson said in reference to the 2011 fight. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how they got the wrong message from that.\u201d\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton has insisted that, like her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), she supports expanding Social Security benefits.\n\nAARP later fought Obama's proposal to effectively cut Social Security in 2013 through a change to the formula used to calculate its cost-of-living adjustment -- a position that it shared with Social Security Works, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the Alliance for Retired Americans, and other more distinctly political seniors groups. Frederick Lynch, an expert on the politics of aging at Claremont McKenna College and author of One Nation Under AARP: The Fight Over Medicare, Social Security, and America\u2019s Future, argues that AARP's relatively neutral approach in its \u201cTake A Stand\u201d campaign reflects the \u201cfundamental conflict\u201d between its brand as a purveyor of services for older Americans and its historic role as a defender of seniors\u2019 policy priorities. \u201cThey want to be the Consumer Reports of health and services for seniors,\u201d said Lynch, who encouraged AARP to come out forcefully against Social Security cuts in 2011. \u201cBut the minute they get partisan, they\u2019re gonna lose some people. So there is sort of a tug of war between their trust brand -- the Good Housekeeping 'Seal of Approval'\" and being more of an advocacy-oriented organization. Since some AARP members reportedly left the group after it backed the Affordable Care Act -- which included Medicare cost savings that many seniors viewed as benefit cuts -- the organization has likely become more cautious, Lynch suggested.\n\nDavid Duprey/Associated Press AARP CEO William D. Novelli speaks out against President George W. Bush's Social Security privatization plan on March 9, 2005.\n\nLynch says that AARP was more willing to advance a position on controversial issues under the leadership of William Novelli, who ran the organization from 2001 to 2009. Under Novelli, AARP supported the creation of Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program in 2003, and opposed President George W. Bush\u2019s attempts to privatize Social Security in 2005. Under CEO Barry Rand, it also notably backed the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Lynch worries that if AARP does not step up as a major opponent of benefit cuts, it risks ceding ground to less scrupulous groups and individuals like Trump, who is clearly appealing to the economic and cultural insecurities of the same Baby Boomers who make up a disproportionate share of the organization\u2019s membership, according to Lynch. \u201cTrump is representative of Boomer politics,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThe fact that he immediately took Medicare and Social Security off the table has increased his strength.\u201d That would be a shame, Lynch argues, since if there is one organization capable of uniting Boomers across racial and class lines and turning them into a cohesive political force, it's AARP. \u201cAARP is the 900-pound gorilla,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThere really is nobody else.\u201d Also on HuffPost:\n\nAARP's Best Movies For Grownups\n\nAARP's Best Movies For Grownups\n\n1 of 15 Career Achievement Award Michael Douglas Share this slide:\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's called \"Take A Stand,\" but the seniors group won't do so itself.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-17 19:37:30 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "It's called \"Take A Stand,\" but the seniors group won't do so itself.", "title": "Why AARP's New Social Security Campaign Is Upsetting Progressives", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-social-security-campaign_us_56c3854fe4b0c3c55052e81e", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56c39db11900002a00377d18.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's called \"Take A Stand,\" but the seniors group won't do so itself.", "title": "Why AARP's New Social Security Campaign Is Upsetting Progressives", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56c39db11900002a00377d18.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@danielmarans", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-16 19:37:30 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56c3854fe4b0c3c55052e81e", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "AARP,Social Security,Medicare,presidential election,take a stand campaign,senior vote,Elections 2016,2016 election,benefits,senior citizens", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "AARP,Social Security,Medicare,presidential election,take a stand campaign,senior vote,Elections 2016,2016 election,benefits,senior citizens", "published_time": "2016-02-16 19:37:30 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-02-16 22:15:54 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI like that they are demanding that candidates talk about Social Security,\u201d said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a group devoted to protecting and expanding Social Security benefits.\nHowever, the campaign refrains from passing judgment on the merit of the candidates\u2019 Social Security plans.\n\u201cWe believe that [Social Security] is the major issue that needs to be dealt with first,\u201d Hishta said.\nIt is impossible to understand the criticism of AARP\u2019s \u201cTake A Stand\u201d campaign without noting how the Social Security policy debate -- and AARP\u2019s role in it -- has evolved in recent years.\nAARP hopes that the campaign will help prompt the next president and Congress to prioritize action on Social Security."}
