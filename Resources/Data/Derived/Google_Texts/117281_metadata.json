indictment of President Barack Obama\u2019s first six years in office, using video of the president\u2019s speeches to show the sharp contrast with his behavior and policies.\n\n\u201cOur world, our nation are in an alarming state of emergency,\u201d Hannity said, citing the downing of the Malaysian airliner and Israel\u2019s incursion into the Gaza Strip in exposing Obama\u2019s \u201cshocking

and TV host upbraided the president for his lack of zeal in closing the U.S. border to an excessive flow of illegal immigrants and for his numerous vacations and golf excursions, urging Obama to tell the truth to the American people.\n\nIn light of Obama\u2019s many failures, Israel\u2019s problems and the Malaysian airliner crash add up to \u201ca very costly and deadly wake-up call,\u201d Hannity said.\n\nClick here to watch the Fox News video via Western Free Press on YouTube.\n\nWatch the latest video at &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a
