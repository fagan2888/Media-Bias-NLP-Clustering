Ohio Gov. John Kasich had a surprise for first-in-the-nation voters Wednesday night – a cake in celebration of his 50th town hall meeting in New Hampshire.

Earlier in the afternoon, Kasich participated in a panel on human trafficking in Concord. Then he held a meeting at the American Legion post in Hooksett.

“I’m for fracking,” Kasich said when asked by a person in the crowd. “Yeah, but I have the toughest rules in the country on fracking. We know who puts what materials in the ground.”

Kasich was asked why he accepted federal funding for Medicaid in Ohio if he wants to repeal Obamacare and what, specifically, he opposes in the Affordable Care Act.

“Well, I don’t like the mandates that have driven up the cost of insurance. And you have to remember, Ronald Reagan expanded Medicaid, I think five times. And so by expanding Medicaid, we’re not only saving lives, but saving money because we’re keeping people out of prison,” Kasich said.

The latest polls show an average of 10 percent of New Hampshire voters support Kasich.

“To get prosperity then, leave no one behind. If they’re drug addicted, or if they’re mentally ill, or working poor, or the developmentally disabled or the autistic, everyone should have a chance to rise,” he said.

Kasich said he plans to hold 50 more town hall meetings in the state before Feb. 9.
