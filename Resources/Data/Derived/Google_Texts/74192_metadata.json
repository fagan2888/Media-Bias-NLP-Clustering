For example, 99% of California plans are fully insured, with only the state\u2019s largest employers offering self-funded plans. In the country\u2019s North Central region, on the other hand, 17.7% of employers have self-funded plans.\n\n\u201cNorth-central employers are more likely to self-fund due to the favorable climate for doing so \u2013 a less competitive workforce, higher-than-average concern for costs, and a greater amount of manufacturing and agricultural businesses,\u201d says a spokesperson for TrueNorth Companies/MedOne, a UBA partner firm.\n\nNot surprisingly, the increase in self-funded pharmacy plans coincides with an increase in stop-loss coverage. UBA\u2019s survey finds that 95.3% of self-funded pharmacy plans had specific stop-loss coverage last year, up from 89.3% five years earlier.\n\nSimilarly, the data show that 76.7% of self-funded pharmacy plans had aggregate stop-loss coverage in 2014, compared with 70.3% five years earlier.\n\nLast year\u2019s average specific stop-loss level was $140,235, an increase of 13.8% (from $123,188).\n\n\u201cWith the no annual and lifetime maximum clauses that have come into play, the increased cost of specialty medications, and no pre-authorization, employers/payers have had no choice but to protect themselves by using specific and aggregate loss coverage with the pharmacy included,\u201d says the TrueNorth Companies/MedOne spokesperson.\n\nAdds Mark Kmety, senior managing director and co-practice leader at Mesirow Financial, another UBA partner firm. \u201cWith the rapid emergence of so many high-cost drugs, you can\u2019t continue to provide a prescription drug benefit without stop-loss coverage or not be aware of the risks without this protection.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Provisions of the Affordable Care Act are pushing employers away from fully insured pharmacy benefits plans.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"More Companies Self-Fund Pharmacy Benefits\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2015\\/09\\/companies-self-fund-pharmacy-benefits\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-04 11:54:16\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-09-04 11:54:16\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":436053,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"pharmacy benefits\",\"pharmacy plans\",\"self funded\",\"self funding\",\"United Benefit Advisors\"],\"categories\":[\"Accounting &amp; Tax\",\"Corporate Finance\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/04\\/pharmacy.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Provisions of the Affordable Care Act are pushing employers away from fully insured pharmacy benefits plans.", "title": "More Companies Self Fund Pharmacy Benefits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2015/04/pharmacy.jpg", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2015/09/companies-self-fund-pharmacy-benefits/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Provisions of the Affordable Care Act are pushing employers away from fully insured pharmacy benefits plans.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "More Companies Self Fund Pharmacy Benefits", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "More Companies Self-Fund Pharmacy Benefits", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20150904, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Capital & Careers", "tag": "United Benefit Advisors", "published_time": "2015-09-04T11:54:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "pharmacy benefits, pharmacy plans, self funded, self funding, united benefit advisors"}, "article_summary": "Provisions of the Affordable Care Act are pushing employers away from fully insured pharmacy benefits plans.\nUBA\u2019s survey finds that 95.3% of self-funded pharmacy plans had specific stop-loss coverage last year, up from 89.3% five years earlier.\nNot surprisingly, the increase in self-funded pharmacy plans coincides with an increase in stop-loss coverage.\nSimilarly, the data show that 76.7% of self-funded pharmacy plans had aggregate stop-loss coverage in 2014, compared with 70.3% five years earlier.\nAs a result of the Affordable Care Act imposing cost increases on fully insured health plans, more employers, particularly large ones, are self-funding their pharmacy benefits."}
