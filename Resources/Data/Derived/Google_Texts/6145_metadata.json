Many had traveled to Washington to beseech Congress to take action. The comedian and former Daily Show host Jon Stewart also became a spokesman for the group.\n\nA bipartisan deal to renew the so-called James Zadroga Act, named after a New York fireman who died from respiratory disease in 2006 that was traced to the weeks he spent at the smoldering pile at Ground Zero after the attacks, is embedded in an omnibus federal spending and taxation bill for the upcoming financial year that both houses in Congress are expected to pass on Thursday.\n\nThe wider law, which President Barack Obama would be expected to sign before leaving for his Christmas holiday in Hawaii on Friday, means Congress has dodged what many feared would be a protracted fight over budget and tax priorities which continue to divide the two parties on the Hill.\n\nThe draft, agreed by negotiators from both sides of the aisle and from the White House, includes an end to the more than 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports from the US that dates back to the energy crisis of the early 1970s. President Obama had resisted such a move which oil companies had clamoured for.\n\nJon Stewart, the longtime host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, has been a long advocate for the bill, urging congress to extend the healthcare act.\n\nIn addition to ensuring the Zadroga Act remains fully funded until 2090, Congress will also extend for five years the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund that also provides support for survivors.\n\nThe measure was hailed by Democrats representing the region around New York. \u201cWe will never fully repay the sacrifices our first responders made following September 11th. All they ask of us is that we never forget - and Congress is now sending a clear message back: we haven't.\u201d Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney said. \u201cThis is the strongest possible deal we could have negotiated in this Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the Christmas the 9/11 responders deserved: some peace of mind for each and every hero. Their selfless actions in response to that tragic day deserve a lifetime's worth of care and respect,\u201d added Charles Schumer, the senior US Senator from New York.\n\nIn a success for Republicans, the omnibus law delays taxes that were due to come into effect under the 2010 Affordable Healthcare Act, also known as Obamacare, threatening its future financial viability.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After weeks of withering criticism for allowing a law providing free healthcare to emergency responders sickened by their work at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks to lapse, members of Congress have agreed to renew the programme and restore payments to families.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Independent", "description": "After weeks of withering criticism for allowing a law providing free healthcare to emergency responders sickened by their work at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks to lapse, members of Congress have agreed to renew the programme and restore payments to families.", "title": "Congress extends benefits lifetime health care benefits for 9/11 first responders", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/congress-extends-benefits-lifetime-health-care-benefits-for-911-first-responders-a6775881.html", "image": "http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/12/16/17/GettyImages-488504888.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-16T18:06:10+00:00", "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/congress-extends-benefits-lifetime-health-care-benefits-for-911-first-responders-a6775881.html", "title": "Congress extends benefits lifetime health care benefits for 9/11 first responders", "description": "After weeks of withering criticism for allowing a law providing free healthcare to emergency responders sickened by their work at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks to lapse, members of Congress have agreed to renew the programme and restore payments to families.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "fb": {"admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "keywords": "Congress, John Stewart, september 11, Americas, World, News", "article": {"video_count": 0, "published_time": "2015-12-16T17:41:47+00:00", "section": "Americas", "embed_count": 0, "author_name": "David Usborne", "tag": "september 11", "word_count": 480, "content_type": "story", "internal_link_count": 1, "image_count": 2, "modified_time": "2015-12-16T18:06:10+00:00", "external_link_count": 0}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the strongest possible deal we could have negotiated in this Congress.\u201d\u201cThis is the Christmas the 9/11 responders deserved: some peace of mind for each and every hero.\nJon Stewart, the longtime host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, has been a long advocate for the bill, urging congress to extend the healthcare act.\nIn addition to ensuring the Zadroga Act remains fully funded until 2090, Congress will also extend for five years the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund that also provides support for survivors.\nIn a success for Republicans, the omnibus law delays taxes that were due to come into effect under the 2010 Affordable Healthcare Act, also known as Obamacare, threatening its future financial viability.\nMany had traveled to Washington to beseech Congress to take action."}
