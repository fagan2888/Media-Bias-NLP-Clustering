Historically (and speaking very broadly), populism has been a generally leftish phenomenon \u2014 the have-nots demanding more from the haves, regardless of the rule of law, property rights, etc. There have been complex exceptions, both here and abroad, and sometimes even though it\u2019s been leftish, it\u2019s also been right \u2014 in the sense that the populists had the right idea.

And I think that is nonsense. It\u2019s one thing to say that the GOP is too liberal or the Democrats are too conservative, statements that have often been not merely defensible but accurate, depending on where you sit on the political spectrum. But the notion that there is no meaningful difference between the two parties is just silly. Even if supposed RINOs John McCain or Mitt Romney had been elected, the policies we have today would be very, very different. If McCain won, we might have had less-than-ideal health-care reforms, but we wouldn\u2019t have gotten Obamacare. If Mitt Romney had won, regardless of what was in his heart, his vows to Republican voters would have required him to undo Obamacare, perhaps not entirely but certainly very significantly.\n\nLet\u2019s simply agree that for the sake of argument that the deal hashed out by McConnell is awful.
