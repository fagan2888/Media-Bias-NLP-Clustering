Avila's last-second bucket caps comeback over Regis\n\nJ.J. Avila\n\nFORT COLLINS -- Larry Eustachy said last month that some expectations for his Colorado State basketball team this season were unrealistically high.\n\nSuch lofty hopes will likely be tempered after the Rams barely escaped Division II Regis, 70-69, in an exhibition at Moby Arena on Saturday.\n\nJ.J. Avila, a transfer from Navy, showed off his all-around skill set that made him the Patriot League rookie of the year as a freshman in 2011. Avila led the Rams in points (27), rebounds (12) and assists (five). The 6-foot-7 forward also hit the game-winning shot, a short turnaround inside the lane with 13 seconds left to give the Rams their only lead of the second half.\n\n\"They should've won the game. The lesser team won. ... But UNLV lost to Dixie (State on Friday). This is common,\" Eustachy said. \"I've sat on benches a long time as a head coach and when you get a team like that that's making baskets, it makes sense what happened tonight. I'm very optimistic about our team. I really am, whether we had lost or won by 1.\"\n\nThe Rangers led by as many as 10 with less than 4 minutes to go, 68-58, but CSU responded with a 9-0 run to close the gap to one. Regis scored just one point in the final 3:51 on a free throw by Mike MacKelvie. Avila and guard Jon Octeus combined to score nine of the Rams' final 11 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We just buckled down. I don't know why we didn't do that at the beginning of the game,\" said Avila, who didn't play intercollegiate basketball last year while taking classes at South Texas College in McAllen. \"But we all just started talking, started moving harder, faster, getting back, helping each other. Luckily they started missing shots at the end. I think they got a no-call at the end as well, but a win's a win.\"\n\nOcteus was the only other Ram in double figures with 17 points, while guard Kevin Marshall's 17 led four Rangers who scored at least 10, including Broomfield grad Spenser Reeb, who came off the bench and scored 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting.\n\nRegis was 7-for-12 from the 3-point line, a problem area for the Rams a season ago. The Rangers shot 56.5 percent in the second half and 49.0 percent for the game.\n\n\"It's just like last year again,\" Eustachy said. \"I'm sitting here going, 'Is there a curse here about we bring out the best (in the opponent)?' It just seemed like they didn't miss.\"\n\nThe Rangers were 5-for-8 from 3 in the first half as they built a 33-31 lead at the break. CSU, on the other hand, was just 2-for-10 from 3 and looked out of synch offensively for long stretches. That's to be expected for a team replacing its entire starting lineup, as players said it was on the defensive end where the biggest adjustments need to be made.\n\n\"We weren't playing our best defense. We weren't playing the passing lanes right as well. And we weren't into them,\" Rams guard Daniel Bejarano said. \"They felt comfortable, and we needed to make them feel uncomfortable. No one's satisfied with this game. So you guys are going to see something different next game -- just better and better D.\"\n\nCSU opens the regular season Friday, Nov. 8 at home against UCCS.\n\nSean Star can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 512, sstar@reporter-herald.com or on Twitter @seanvstar\n\nColorado State 70, Regis 60\n\nREGIS\n\nJ.
