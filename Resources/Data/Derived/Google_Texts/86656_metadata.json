(AP) \u2014 Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, has resigned, his attorney said Saturday, nearly four months after the confrontation between the white officer and unarmed black 18-year-old that ignited protests in the St. Louis suburb and across the nation.\n\nWilson, who has been on administrative leave since the Aug. 9 shooting, resigned effective immediately, said his attorney, Neil Bruntrager. He declined further immediate comment.\n\nThe Brown family attorney, Benjamin Crump, didn\u2019t immediately return phone and email messages from The Associated Press.\n\nWilson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he was stepping down out of his \u201cown free will\u201d after the police department told him it had received threats of violence if he remained an employee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not willing to let someone else get hurt because of me,\u201d said Wilson, who had been with the department for six years.\n\nWilson fatally shot Brown after a scuffle in the middle of a street, where Brown\u2019s body lay for several hours as police investigated and a crowd of angry onlookers gathered. Several days of tense and at times violent protests followed, prompting Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to call in the National Guard to help.\n\nSome witnesses have said Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him. Wilson told a grand jury that reviewed the case that he feared for his life when Brown hit him and reached for his gun.\n\nThe grand jury spent more than three months reviewing evidence before announcing Monday that it wouldn\u2019t indict Wilson, igniting violence among protesters that resulted in at least a dozen commercial buildings in the area being destroyed by fire. Several other large but peaceful protests have since been held in Ferguson and across the country.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department is conducting a civil rights investigation into the shooting and a separate investigation of police department practices.\n\nWilson\u2019s resignation didn\u2019t seem to affect protesters outside Ferguson police headquarters Saturday night.\n\nRick Campbell said he didn\u2019t care about the resignation, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been protesting out here since August.\u201d Several other protesters merely shrugged their shoulders when asked about the resignation.\n\n\u201cWe were not after Wilson\u2019s job,\u201d civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a written statement. \u201cWe were after Michael Brown\u2019s justice.\u201d\n\nFerguson Police Chief Tom Jackson didn\u2019t immediately return a message left on his cellphone seeking comment.\n\nWilson spent months in hiding and made no public statements following the shooting. Wilson, who recently got married, broke his silence after the grand jury decision, telling ABC News that he couldn\u2019t have done anything differently in the encounter with Brown.\n\nWilson said he had a clean conscience because \u201cI know I did my job right.\u201d Brown\u2019s shooting was the first time he fired his gun on the job, he said. Asked whether the encounter would have unfolded the same way if Brown had been white, Wilson said yes.\n\nWilson began his career in nearby Jennings before moving to the Ferguson job a few years ago. He had no previous complaints against him and a good career record, according to Jackson, who called Wilson \u201can excellent police officer.\u201d\n\nA few months before the shooting, Wilson had received a commendation for detaining a suspect in a drug case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, has resigned, his attorney said Saturday, nearly four months after the confrontation between the white officer and unarmed black 18-year-old that ignited protests in the St. Louis suburb and across the nation.", "Author": "Alan Scher Zagier", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, has resigned, his attorney said Saturday, nearly four months after the confrontation between the white officer and unarmed black 18-year-old that ignited protests in the St. Louis suburb and across the nation.", "title": "Darren Wilson, Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown, resigns", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/29/ferguson-officer-who-shot-michael-brown-resigns/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/fae12020e95ed72e660f6a70670040b5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/fae12020e95ed72e660f6a70670040b5.jpg", "title": "Darren Wilson, Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown, resigns", "description": "Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, has resigned, his attorney said Saturday, nearly four months after the confrontation between the white officer and unarmed bl", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Darren Wilson, Michael Brown, Ferguson, Ferguson Police"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedf4\"", "article_summary": "Wilson began his career in nearby Jennings before moving to the Ferguson job a few years ago.\nSome witnesses have said Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him.\nWilson fatally shot Brown after a scuffle in the middle of a street, where Brown\u2019s body lay for several hours as police investigated and a crowd of angry onlookers gathered.\nWilson told a grand jury that reviewed the case that he feared for his life when Brown hit him and reached for his gun.\nWilson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he was stepping down out of his \u201cown free will\u201d after the police department told him it had received threats of violence if he remained an employee."}
