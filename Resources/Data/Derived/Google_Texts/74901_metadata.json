They\u2019d rather have a longer-term approach to government spending, or more of the entitlement and tax reform deals Obama said he was eager to cut.\n\nBut on everything from guns to reproductive health to opening up Cuba, Obama\u2019s team says it has been battling for years the very politics that paved the way for Trump\u2019s ascendance this election cycle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a reaction to Obama,\u201d said one person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking about the Trump phenomenon. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a reaction to their strategy that, \u2018We\u2019re just going to be antithetical to everything [Obama] stands for.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to people in the White House, Obama doesn\u2019t talk about Trump much. When he does, it\u2019s with a combination of amusement and disgust at the rhetoric, occasionally mentioning his amazement at GOP leaders\u2019 inability to understand Trump\u2019s supporters and the long-term damage the president thinks Trump is doing to the party with the groups of voters who will decide future elections.\n\n\u201cComing out of 2008 and the demographic changes in the country, Republicans needed energy, and instead of reaching for new ideas and new leadership, they reached for the political equivalent of Four Loko,\u201d said Hari Sevugan, a senior spokesman for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cSure it gives a shot of energy, but it eventually rots your brain and kills you.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s more than told-ya-so. It\u2019s personal.\n\nThe West Wing still burns over Trump leading the birth certificate charge in 2012, forcing an official rebuttal from the White House and the release of the president\u2019s long-form birth certificate. Aides say Trump played into fears and racism and encouraged voter distrust of the president, as he\u2019s doing now on the campaign trail.\n\nObama administration alumni remember hearing what they call the \u201cthose people\u201d strain of politics when they were knocking on doors in 2008. It was evident at rallies for Sarah Palin and at tea party events in the first term of his presidency. Americans weren\u2019t wrong to think Obama\u2019s election in 2008 meant the country had changed \u2014 the president himself bought into it and was frustrated in the early years to see how slowly it translated into policy accomplishments.\n\nStill, Obama\u2019s team refuses to see Trump\u2019s political success as some kind of backlash against the president.\n\n\u201cIn the long sweep of history, this chapter is all pretty simple: The country actually switched from one dominant culture that was in charge for 240 years to one that\u2019s multicultural,\u201d said one Obama campaign veteran. \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t going to go easy. But now we\u2019re in the middle of it, so it seems chaotic and complicated.\u201d\n\nThey also won\u2019t concede that Trump might win. The billionaire real estate developer\u2019s six months atop the GOP primary race have coincided with arguably the most successful year of Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 scoring deals with Iran and Cuba and on climate change and trade, and seeing previous efforts on Obamacare and gay marriage secured by the Supreme Court. That this all happened simultaneously with Trump\u2019s rise demonstrates how little support Trump politics has in the country, Obama\u2019s aides say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the country has changed, it\u2019s that a narrow band of mostly white, low- and middle-income Americans are supporting a candidate who is speaking to their anxiety about being left behind in this economy,\u201d said Bill Burton, a former deputy White House press secretary. \u201cUnder no circumstances could Trump get a majority of Americans to support the nonsense and intolerance that he espouses.\u201d\n\nAfter all, Burton said, there\u2019s not a lot of overlap between the people showing up at Trump rallies and the ones who had HOPE posters pinned on their walls eight years ago.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing play out in the Republican primary is a conversation between the GOP and itself about what kind of party it wants to be,\u201d said Brent Colburn, the communications director for Obama\u2019s reelection campaign. \u201cNo one who has ever worked for President Obama is surprised by the fact that there is a deeply divisive wing of the Republican Party. That was true in 2008, it was true in 2012, and, sadly, that is turning out to be true in 2016.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about the GOP. White House aides say they are legitimately concerned that Trump is damaging America\u2019s reputation around the world. It\u2019s more than just Trump\u2019s rhetoric playing into ISIL recruitment, they say; to people watching overseas, he\u2019s eating away at ideals of what America\u2019s supposed to stand for.\n\nGoing into next year, Obama will be speaking out against Trump, as he did indirectly in several pro-immigration speeches earlier this month and by name in an interview with NPR last week, when he argued that the Republican front-runner is exploiting the fears of \u201cparticularly blue-collar men [who] have had a lot of trouble in this new economy.\u201d And pushing back against Trump will be a central theme of Obama\u2019s international engagement.\n\n\u201cThe nature of American politics is that all these statements are consumed around the world,\u201d said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. \u201cWhen there are statements that could present challenges in terms of perceptions of America\u2019s openness to people of different faiths and America\u2019s inclusiveness, the president is going to speak out on that.\u201d\n\nObama loyalists like to point out that Trump\u2019s been good at two things in his career \u2014 sales and bankruptcy. So when asked what Trump\u2019s rise says about Obama\u2019s America, the president\u2019s team likes to note that Trump hasn\u2019t won a single vote yet.\n\n\u201cThe rise of Trump says more about the lack of progress in the GOP since 2008 than the progress the country has made since the president came into office,\u201d Sevugan said. \u201cBut there's only one way to find out if the country has changed: Nominate Trump.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Loyalists say that after two terms of obstruction, Republicans are getting the anger candidate their rhetoric created.", "title": "Obama\u2019s team says the GOP earned Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/obama-trump-republicans-217144", "image": "http://static.politico.com/63/15/f4926a4440b8b3688179f7a6c7cf/151226-trump-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Loyalists say that after two terms of obstruction, Republicans are getting the anger candidate their rhetoric created.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That this all happened simultaneously with Trump\u2019s rise demonstrates how little support Trump politics has in the country, Obama\u2019s aides say.\nInside the White House, poetic justice looks a lot like Donald Trump.\nSo when asked what Trump\u2019s rise says about Obama\u2019s America, the president\u2019s team likes to note that Trump hasn\u2019t won a single vote yet.\nWhite House aides say they are legitimately concerned that Trump is damaging America\u2019s reputation around the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a reaction to their strategy that, \u2018We\u2019re just going to be antithetical to everything [Obama] stands for.\u2019\u201dAccording to people in the White House, Obama doesn\u2019t talk about Trump much."}
