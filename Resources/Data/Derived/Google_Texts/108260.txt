A new cartoon is claiming that Obamacare will increase the number of men who get sexually transmitted diseases from women who will now be able to receive free birth control.

The top of the cartoon by A.F. Branco asks: “got insurance?” There is an angry man in the foreground of the cartoon and a woman in the background holding birth control pills — both have sores on their mouths.

The man claims that he got an STD from “one of the many women who now get free birth control,” and that “now you can too. Thanks Obamacare!”

The cartoon is a parody of a real ad for Obamacare from DoYouGotInsurance.com, according to the Huffington Post.

The original “Let’s Get Physical” ad shows a young man and a young woman giving a thumbs up while holding birth control pills.

In a statement to HuffPost, the cartoon’s artist Branco said:

I’m not against birth control or nor do I feel that it is any of my business what people do sexually. However, I do feel that contraceptives are inexpensive and accessible enough that I shouldn’t have to pay for them through my taxes. I also feel that my government shouldn’t be promoting promiscuous sex as though condoms are the answer to all STDs and promiscuous behavior.
