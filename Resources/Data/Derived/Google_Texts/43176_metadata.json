However, many other Americans, like Terri Corcoran of Falls Church, Va., have been feeling the pain of increased premium rates. What's bad for many consumers, though, spells good news for insurance companies reaping the financial benefits of these payments.\n\nCorcoran says her health insurance premiums doubled under Affordable Care Act (ACA) to almost $600 a month. \u201cI used to get a policy with a high deductible -- so lower premiums -- because I didn't have many medical expenses,\u201d Corcoran says.\n\n\u201cUnder [the] ACA, \u2026 I could not get a higher deductible unless I was under 26 years old,\u201d says Corcoran, PR chairperson at Well Spouse Association, a volunteer organization that offers peer support to spousal caregivers. That lack of flexibility frustrates her.\n\n\u201cI'm 64 [and] healthy,\u201d Corcoran said.\n\nThat scenario is due to the influx of healthy individuals, along with the federal government\u2019s requirements for health insurance companies to reduce overhead costs and direct a larger percentage of premiums to health care. As a result, the insurance industry appears to be doing well under the ACA, despite early fears.\n\nAccording to a recent report from the Commonwealth Fund, profits in the health insurance industry remain nearly the same as before the ACA was implemented.\n\nStock prices for the biggest insurance companies also remain healthy and, despite early fears centering on the requirement that insurance companies could no longer deny coverage to sick individuals, few insurers exited the marketplace.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "A recent report shows the healthcare industry doing well, thanks in part to the influx of healthy Americans and government subsidies.", "author": "S.Z.
