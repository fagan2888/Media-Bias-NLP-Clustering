So, here we are, near the end of my kids\u2019 first week back at school, and I have to say: What was I smoking?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s lovely to get out the pencil cases and pick out the first-day outfit and meet the teachers and see old friends and try to spot new ones. But it\u2019s also a flat-out crazy week of adjusting to new routines, getting back in the groove, filling out more paperwork than anyone should have to deal with in this electronic age and, oh yeah, getting to work more or less on time.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I find all this a bit stressful. (Can I get an amen?) And that\u2019s why it seemed like such a great idea last week to promise that I would interview an expert on stress, and then let you all know all the great things I learned.\n\nOnly here\u2019s the thing: I was too stressed out to get it done. Sure, I could tell you that her book didn\u2019t arrive in the mail as quickly as it was supposed to (which it didn\u2019t), and that therefore I didn\u2019t get back in touch with her publisher to set up the interview before the long weekend (which I didn\u2019t), and that then I came up with a backup plan (which I did) to interview someone else (which I didn\u2019t), but essentially that all boils down to the adult equivalent of \u201cthe dog ate my homework.\u201d\n\nSo, look, I\u2019m sorry, and I promise \u2013 I swear \u2013 I more than swear, I\u2019ve told my editor! \u2013 to have real information on dealing with stress next week. But meanwhile, let\u2019s just talk about stress for a quick minute. I\u2019ve told you some of mine, but here\u2019s a more complete list:\n\nTaking care of a teenager and a 6-year-old\n\n\n\nWorking full-time-plus at a job that requires evenings out fairly often, and even the odd weekend\n\n\n\nTrying to hold the family finances together in spite of some real (and private) challenges\n\n\n\nResolving some seemingly intractable problems in a key relationship (also private, so I wouldn\u2019t even mention it but it\u2019s a huge stressor)\n\nLearning to navigate this strange new electronic world we all live in \u2013 and, for example, figuring out those lines between public and private, to say nothing of taming an email inbox that daily threatens to crash from its own weight; this sounds trivial compared to everything else, but it\u2019s surprising how much angst it causes\n\nWondering how I\u2019m ever going to fix up the \u201ccharming,\u201d \u201cneeds TLC\u201d old wreck I live in, enough to either be happy in it or put it on the market\n\nFretting about my health, not just the tired old song-and-dance you\u2019ve been hearing about my weight and cholesterol and so forth, but also that funny-looking mole on my back\n\nAnd did I mention the three dogs and the gecko?\n\nThe good news is that the kids seem pretty happy and well fed, the job is mostly fun and I\u2019m pretty good at it, I\u2019ve made an appointment for the funny-looking mole, and I\u2019ve even managed to keep Agent Sticky supplied with crickets, so I guess I\u2019m dealing with the things that really need to get dealt with. But I could really, really use just a little more time to breathe.\n\nSo here\u2019s hoping that the stress expert can help with that. And if you\u2019ve got any stresses of your own that you want help with, just let me know.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louise had great plans for dealing with stress ... until the stress got in the way.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Louise had great plans for dealing with stress ... until the stress got in the way.", "title": "Project Louise: The Dog Ate My Homework", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/project-louise-the-dog-ate-my-homework", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/09/dog-eating-homework-620x379.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/project-louise-the-dog-ate-my-homework", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/09/dog-eating-homework-620x379.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Project Louise: The Dog Ate My Homework"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-04", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Thu, 04 Sep 2014 12:45:34 -0400"}, "article_summary": "But I could really, really use just a little more time to breathe.\nProject Louise: The Dog Ate My HomeworkHmm, was that me last week, waxing rhapsodic about that great \u201cback to school\u201d feeling?\nSo, here we are, near the end of my kids\u2019 first week back at school, and I have to say: What was I smoking?\nAnd if you\u2019ve got any stresses of your own that you want help with, just let me know.\n\u2013 to have real information on dealing with stress next week."}
