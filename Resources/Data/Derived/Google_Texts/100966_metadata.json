Part one, in the Oct. 18 edition of The Watch, described how schools, doctors\u2019 offices, hospitals and a network of clinics operated by the Center for Mental Health in Montrose address the need for mental health services.]\n\nDespite the existence of mental health services in Ouray, San Miguel and Montrose counties, problems still arise when it comes to accessing them. Cost, physical constraints and access to practitioners often prevent those who could most use mental health counseling from getting the attention they need.\n\nThe cost \u2014 or the perceived cost \u2014 can be a barrier to accessing mental health services. Even for people who can afford them, not all mental health services are covered by insurance, and therapists in private practice can be expensive.\n\nThose requiring mental health services are often the ones who can least afford them. \u201cPeople who are under-insured or non-insured are the people most in need,\u201d said Jon Gordon, the executive director of the Center for Mental Health in Montrose. \u201cThey have difficulty making appointments and then getting transportation to appointments, getting child care, getting off work. People with fewer resources have a much more difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe CMH is funded primarily by the state\u2019s Office of Behavioral Health to serve indigent clients, and by its Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which facilitates Medicaid. Over the past 18 months, the number of Medicaid-eligible patients has doubled at the center.\n\nIn response, CMH is expanding its hours and improving its outreach. The goal is to help service clients in their own environments, rather than forcing them to travel to a provider\u2019s headquarters in Montrose.\n\n\u201cBecause of Obamacare, a lot more people who want to seek therapy are able to get it,\u201d explained Lynton Moore, a licensed professional counselor who sees patients in Ridgway and Telluride.\n\n\u201cMost people in crisis can\u2019t afford much,\u201d Moore added. \u201cThey\u2019re in survival mode.\u201d\n\nSome private practice providers in the area accept Medicaid. One is Nancy Read, a licensed psychologist who sees patients in Telluride. Her schedule is booked solid. Read accepted both Medicare and Medicaid when she practiced in Iowa and Minnesota, before moving to Colorado, because she believes people who depend on these programs are often marginalized.\n\n\u201cObamacare has changed the landscape in a good way,\u201d according to Read. \u201cSo many people have said, \u2018I finally have insurance coverage,\u2019 and that increases medical access.\u201d\n\nURBAN PROVIDERS, RURAL NEEDS\n\nAlthough there is a rise in interest in family practice and psychiatry among medical students nationally, according to data from national medical associations, the trend has been for those new doctors to work in urban areas rather than remote rural communities that might benefit from those services the most. Turnover is also a problem.\n\nIn the past three years, for example, there have been four or five different providers working out of the Center for Mental Health\u2019s office in Telluride alone.\n\n\u201cIn the schools, you run into the problem of turnover,\u201d said Lynn Borup, executive director of the Tri-County Health Network, a Telluride-based nonprofit that works to fill gaps in regional public health by improving access to care. \u201cIf you keep hiring a different therapist, the program won\u2019t gain traction, and that\u2019s not a sustainable model.\u201d\n\nAnother trend in regional mental health practice is for people to visit their primary practitioners to be assessed for behavioral health problems.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, these [primary care] doctors do a good job treating depression and anxiety,\u201d Gordon, executive director of the Center for Mental Health, said. \u201cBut they get to a point where patients don\u2019t respond to these treatments and need a psychiatric provider.\u201d\n\nPrimary care doctors, according to Read, are not necessarily specialists in psychotropic medicine: \u201cThey\u2019re out of their realm with patients who suffer from bipolar or psychosis or delusions. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a mental health crisis in terms of therapy, but I would definitely say there\u2019s one when it comes to prescribing medications.\u201d\n\nWhile there are plenty of people listed as therapists, it\u2019s important to pay attention to credentials. \u201cColorado is interesting because you can be a registered psychotherapist with the state with little or no psychological training,\u201d Read said. \u201cThey have allowed people to work in this state who aren\u2019t properly trained. I\u2019m not sure the public is aware of the difference between therapists who are registered and therapists who are licensed.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Regulatory Agencies oversees the regulation of psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, licensed professional counselors and registered psychotherapists statewide. There are big differences between \u201cregistered\u201d psychotherapists and those who are \u201clicensed,\u201d \u201ccertified,\u201d \u201cclinical\u201d or \u201cstate-approved.\u201d\n\nRead urges consumers to look for a provider who is licensed by DORA in the state of Colorado. A providers\u2019 licensure status can be found online with DORA, by checking the provider\u2019s web site, or through a state professional association such as the Colorado Psychological Association.\n\nMany mental health providers also cited a need for closer professional collaboration.\n\n\u201cPeople are really well-intentioned,\u201d Borup noted. \u201cBut a lot of times we\u2019re all working separately. Someone might being doing something innovative in mental health, the school could be doing something and so could social services \u2014 and we\u2019re not collaborating.\u201d\n\nRead suggested that a meet-and-greet among local therapists would be beneficial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have patients who come in and say, \u2018I\u2019ve seen so and so before,\u2019 and I\u2019ve never heard of that therapist,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen she moved here several years ago from Minnesota and established a practice in Telluride, there were only three practicing psychologists in the area. They formed a consultation group for awhile, and met roughly once a month to talk about cases and issues in the field. That kind of discussion among professionals is a challenge in a remote place, but for these mental health professionals it was crucial.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH CARE, PRIMARY CARE\n\nThe integration of mental health care into primary care visits is an increasingly recognized medical best practice.\n\nA pilot program described by Tri-County Health Network\u2019s Borup was implemented recently in Telluride in which, during regular check-ups, a physician inquires about a patient\u2019s mental health. For those needing help, the doctor immediately arranges a consultation directly with an on-staff therapist, as opposed to referring that person to a therapist for an appointment at a later date.\n\nSimilarly, the Center for Mental Health has integrated staff at Montrose Hospital and at Pediatric Associates in Montrose. The group\u2019s integrative footprint extends to the Norwood and Telluride school districts, where staff work with students two to three days a week. The Center for Mental Health also provides staff in regional jails to assist with tele-therapy and to organize access to additional mental health resources upon a detainees\u2019 release.\n\n\u201cNew staff are going into new programs, whether that\u2019s in school-based programs or primary care clinics or the jail-based services we offer,\u201d said Ed Hagins, deputy director at the Center for Mental Health. Hagins has worked in mental health services for 20 years and has witnessed a great deal of change, especially when it comes to integrative practices.\n\n\u201cEvery year there\u2019s something new. And we are learning. There are a lot of opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nTri-County Health Network has also made forays in mental health services by implementing training sessions for workers to act as First Responders for Mental Health. Borup likened the sessions to \u201cmental health first aid, similar to CPR\u201d which help stabilize patients \u201cuntil help can get there.\u201d\n\nShe added that an important by-product of the new training is breaking down stigmas, and raising critical awareness of and empathy for people with mental illnesses.\n\nStigma regarding the need for mental health services is at its worst in rural areas, and often prevent people from seeking help.\n\nNegative judgments \u201care still out there, alive and well,\u201d Hagins said. Yet \u201cthere are a lot of us living with mental illness successfully. It\u2019s part of the human condition. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d\n\nIndeed, one in four people in their lifetime will have a mental illness. And mental illness is one of the most easily treated disorders.\n\n\u201cThe data shows that it\u2019s very treatable,\u201d Hagins emphasized. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for people to suffer with this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Telluride Daily Planet", "description": "[Editor\u2019s Note: This story is the second in a two-part series.
