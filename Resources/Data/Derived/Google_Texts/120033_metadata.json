But first: A dire new warning of the risk of Zika virus.\n\nPAHO ON ZIKA: 500 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE AMERICAS AT RISK \u2014 Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, the Zika incident manager for the Pan American Health Organization, said Tuesday that half a billion people in the Americas are at risk of being infected by the Zika virus.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAldighieri and NIAID Director Anthony Fauci briefed reporters at PAHO headquarters in Washington on the status of the Zika response. Both warned that they expect to see an influx in cases in the coming months, Pro's Brianna Ehley reports.\n\n\u2014 Vaccine developments: Researchers are preparing a vaccine study to begin in September and should be able to determine if the vaccine is ready to test on groups of people at the beginning of 2017, Fauci said. If so, the vaccine will be tested first in an infected country and might be ready for widescale use in anywhere from one to three years.\n\nFauci repeated warnings that Congress must approve the full sum requested by the administration if it is to be prepared to respond to Zika and other health crises. \u201cWe cannot do the job that\u2019s necessary to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president asked for $1.9 billion because we need $1.9 billion.\u201d\n\nWELCOME TO WEDNESDAY PULSE \u2014 Where we hope you're not having these side effects from Abilify.

FEDS: STATE FILES LAWSUIT OVER COLLAPSED CO-OP \u2014 Iowa on Tuesday sued the federal government to recover millions it believes are owed to a nonprofit insurance startup seeded with Obamacare loan dollars that collapsed after running up huge losses, Pro's Paul Demko reports.\n\n\u2014 How it quickly went bust: CoOportunity Health received $147 million in startup loans from the federal government under the Affordable Care Act. It collapsed in December 2014 after losing $163 million that year.\n\n\u2014 Details of the lawsuit: Iowa's insurance commissioner says that CoOportunity is owed $130 million in \"risk corridor\" funds, but has not received any of that money. That program was established to protect insurers entering the exchanges from big losses, but initially paid out only 12.6 percent of anticipated payments because congressional Republicans imposed restrictions.\n\n\u2014 One key goal: The lawsuit seeks to invalidate claims by the Obama administration that the federal government should have \u201csuper priority\u201d status in recovering funds it's owed by CoOportunity Health, which did business in Iowa and Nebraska. \u201cThe federal government has tried to jump to the head of the creditor line, but is not following Iowa or federal law in withholding over $20 million due to CoOportunity,\u201d Iowa's insurance commissioner Nick Gerhart said in a statement.\n\nOREGON INSURERS PROPOSE RATE INCREASES \u2014 Nine of the 10 insurers that participate on the state's ACA insurance exchange are asking for average rate increases of at least 15 percent, and three are requesting average rate hikes of at least 29.6 percent.\n\nSee the proposed rates: 1.usa.gov/1WHeXVj\n\nMEDICAL ERRORS MAY BE THIRD-LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH \u2014 That's according to a new BMJ study, which concludes that more than 250,000 Americans die per year because of surgical errors, inaccurate diagnoses and even communication breakdowns.\n\nAccording to the researchers, led by Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary, the exact toll of medical errors is difficult to quantify because of how they're reported and recorded. In an open letter, they call on CDC to update how it tracks medical errors on death certificates.\n\n\"Creating one additional field on the death certificate form to inquire if immediately preventable complications stemming from the patient's medical care was the primary contributor to the patient's death would advance the science of safety,\" they write\n\nThe CDC's Bob Anderson told ProPublica that the agency's approach to tracking mortality data is consistent with international guidelines. It would be difficult to change \"unless we had a really compelling reason to do so,\" he said.\n\nRead the study: http://bit.ly/1rtW6Sa\n\nTop causes of death in 2014, per CDC\n\n\u00b7 Heart disease: 614,348 deaths\n\n\u00b7 Cancer: 591,699\n\n\u00b7 Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 147,101\n\n\u00b7 Accidents (unintentional injuries): 136,053\n\nOBAMA'S IN FLINT TODAY \u2014 The president is spending the day in the Michigan city affected by a toxic water crisis. He'll tour local facilities, take part in a roundtable discussion, give a speech, meet with local leaders \u2014 and drink the water, if Gov. Rick Snyder gets his way.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful the president will drink the water in Flint, to help reinforce Gov. Snyder\u2019s actions and the EPA\u2019s message that filtered Flint water is safe to drink,\u201d Snyder's spokesperson said in a media statement.\n\nState of recovery. In the four months since Flint was declared a federal emergency, workers armed with blood tests and resources \u2014 including bottles of water \u2014 have poured into the city. But tens of millions of dollars in federal support are still being held up in the legislative process, and while Michigan will expand Medicaid coverage to an additional 15,000 Flint residents next week, the effort has been delayed for weeks.\n\nHOW RICK SNYDER'S INNER CIRCLE FAILED ON FLINT \u2014 MLive.com is out with an in-depth investigation of how the Flint crisis unfolded and who knew what \u2014 and when. The article concludes that Gov. Snyder's once-praised corporate management style became his downfall.\n\n\"A year ago \u2026 Snyder was stoking rumors of a presidential bid as a metrics-driven Republican whose ability to run government like a business transformed a troubled state,\" the article begins. \"Now, he is viewed as the person ultimately responsible for one of the nation's biggest public-health disasters in memory \u2014 the lead contamination of a water system serving 100,000 people, and a possible link between the water system and an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease that killed 12 people.\"\n\nRead the story: http://bit.ly/1QRR5aE\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Expand seniors\u2019 access to prescription drugs.

Several House committees have already approved bills that will make up the package, with Medicaid, Obamacare and Dodd-Frank some of the biggest targets.\n\nHere's a roundup of the health care implications.\n\n\u2014 The Energy and Commerce backed legislation to reduce federal contributions to the State Children's Health Insurance Program; eliminate the prevention and public health fund under Obamacare; tweak Medicaid provider taxes, provide less funds to states for providing Medicaid health care to prison inmates; and prohibit multimillion-dollar jackpot lottery winners of being eligible for Medicaid.\n\n\u2014 The Ways and Means Committee approved bills to eliminate the Social Services block grant; and recover Obamacare subsidy overpayments.\n\nBROOKINGS CAUTIOUS ON PART B DEMO \u2014 Kavita Patel and Caitlin Brandt write that Medicare's planned Part B pilot to change how the program pays for drugs is well-intentioned, but could cause unintended complications.\n\nFor instance, the Brookings Institution researchers warn that the Part B demo is competing with a new oncology care model that's also trying to improve payment, and there needs to be an exemption for organizations participating in the cancer pilot.\n\nThey also caution that CMS needs to anticipate the potential consequences related to geographic stratification. \"It is possible to imagine organizations with multiple locations directing patients to optimal sites for their business,\" they argue, citing a Drug Channels blog post.\n\nRead the Brookings post: http://brook.gs/1NjvgWQ\n\nIMS, QUINTILES THE LATEST HEALTH CARE MEGA-MERGER \u2014 The two firms on Tuesday announced plans to merge in a nearly $9 billion deal.\n\nIMS Health specializes in health care information and technology, while Quintiles works with pharmaceutical companies on clinical trial research. The combined organization would work \"to transform the clinical development of innovative medicines, demonstrate the value of these medicines in the real world, and drive commercial success,\" Quintiles CEO Tom Pike said in a statement.\n\nMore: http://on.wsj.com/1TtiIbQ\n\nURBAN INSTITUTE'S PRIMER ON PAYMENT MODELS \u2014 The Urban Institute and the Catalyst for Payment Reform are out with a detailed, five-part review of how different payment models and benefit design options work.\n\nThe series includes reports on:\n\n1) How payment methods like bundled payment, capitation, and shared savings work.

This is largely concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, and heroin victims tend to be men in their twenties or thirties.\n\n\u00b7 Prescription opioid epidemic.

Kornfeld wasn't able to immediately make the trip from California, but sent his son \u2014 who arrived at Prince's estate on the morning of April 21, helped find Prince unconscious and reportedly was the one who called 911. http://strib.mn/1Y7bWfR\n\nCHANGES AT HHS \u2014 Secretary Burwell on Tuesday announced one new hire and two other significant changes.\n\n\u00b7 Drew Littman, who's been working at Venn Strategies, is joining HHS as Senior Counselor. Littman, who previously worked for Sens. Al Franken and Barbara Boxer, will focus on communication and external engagement issues and inherit some of Leslie Dach's portfolio.\n\n\u00b7 Sonya Bernstein will become a Deputy Chief of Staff with more responsibility for communications and long-term scheduling.\n\n\u00b7 Dawn O'Connell's role is being broadened to include implementing top priorities out of the Administration for Children and Families, including unaccompanied children and refugee issues.\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD BACKS STRICKLAND IN OHIO \u2014 Planned Parenthood today is endorsing former governor Ted Strickland in his Ohio Senate race against sitting Sen. Rob Portman. The organization's endorsement is one of its first of the cycle, and its announcement focused as much on bashing Portman as it did on backing Strickland. \"Senator Rob Portman has voted to severely restrict access to these critical services at Planned Parenthood health centers and shamefully dismissed reproductive care as illegitimate,\" Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards said in a statement.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Rachana Pradhan\n\nDemocrats in the Arizona House on Tuesday failed to restore the state\u2019s CHIP program through a budget amendment, the Associated Press reports.http://bit.ly/1VJmsw7\n\nBloomberg's Zach Tracer profiles a blues singer who helped revolutionize America\u2019s drug pricing model. http://bloom.bg/1WFcx9O\n\nThe Washington Post reports on a JAMA study suggesting that health care price transparency tools aren\u2019t saving much money. http://wapo.st/23nQYuq\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has the latest on lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson from women who blame their ovarian cancer on the company\u2019s baby powder. http://on.wsj.com/1ZaCKvK\n\nAlso from the WSJ: soda sales in Mexico are on the rise again two years after it imposed a tax on sugary drinks. http://on.wsj.com/1NjATEl\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Many Medicare drug plans effectively require the use of \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies that are inconvenient for patients. That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
