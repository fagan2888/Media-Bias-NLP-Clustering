For CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie, wariness of air travel seldom happens for him within the United States.

As a safety and accident investigator, Soucie developed confidence in the U.S.' flight rules and regulations.

"We have a very good system for maintaining those standards," Soucie said on "New Day" Friday.

However, Soucie explained that fastidiousness should come into play for international air travel.

It's harder to discern whether or not foreign countries uphold the same guidelines for air safety, Soucie said, as political climates and bureaucracies are capable of shifting rapidly.

Soucie developed a quick checklist, broken down into the acronym of "S.A.F.E.," in order to attain a sense of control as a passenger.

He shared his guidelines with us below:

David Soucie Says Fly S.A.F.E.

S = SEARCH

Search the web using Google, social media, etc., in order to learn about your destination country.

A = ASSESS

Use websites like AirlineRatings.com and JADEC Denmark to check airline safety ratings, and scope out the US State Department and FAA pages to learn about travel safety in foreign countries.

F = FLIGHT ROUTE

Get familiar with the flight route - websites like Flight Aware and Flight Radar 24 are excellent resources - and learn what else you'll be flying over.
