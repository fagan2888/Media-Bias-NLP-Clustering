LOUIS \u2014 A grand statue outside Busch Stadium honors Stan \u201cThe Man\u201d Musial, one of the greatest and most consistent players in baseball history.\n\nConsider this statistic: Musial finished his career with 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 on the road.\n\nNo one, of course, is going to confuse Rockies first baseman Justin Morneau with the iconic Cardinals Hall of Famer, but consistency is a trait Morneau does share with Musial.\n\nMorneau entered Friday leading the National League in hitting with a .317 average, just ahead of Pittsburgh\u2019s Josh Harrison (.314).\n\nUnfortunately, Morneau left the game in the sixth inning with what the Rockies are calling \u201cleft-side intercostal soreness.\u201d Morneau is listed as day to day. He went 0-for-3, dropping his average to .315\n\nWhile Rockies hitters are often discounted because of their wide home-and-away batting splits, Morneau has been Musial-esque.\n\nMorneau is batting .321 at Coors Field vs. .312 on the road. For his career, Morneau is batting .279 at home and .282 on the road.\n\n\u201cJustin never gives away at-bats, and he has great preparation,\u201d said Michael Cuddyer, who won the 2013 National League batting title with the Rockies last season and played alongside Morneau with Minnesota for nine seasons. \u201cHe studies pitchers\u2019 tendencies, and that doesn\u2019t change at home or on the road. He doesn\u2019t get out of his game plan very often. He stays with his approach and with his plan.\u201d\n\nMorneau said he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect at the hitter\u2019s paradise known as Coors Field. As it turns out, the ballpark has renewed him as a hitter.\n\n\u201cCoors got me back to where I wanted to be,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cI got away from my strengths over the last few years. Getting back into a hitter\u2019s park (as opposed to the Twins\u2019 Target Field), has me using the whole field again.\u201d\n\nMorneau remembers an April series against the White Sox at Coors Field as the starting point.\n\n\u201cI hit a couple of balls the opposite way, to left field, that carried over the left fielder\u2019s head,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized I could use the big ballpark to my advantage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s carried over the whole season, home or away. \u2026 It\u2019s nice to feel comfortable using the whole field again.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Lefty reliever Boone Logan, out for the season because of a strained left elbow, had arthroscopic surgery Thursday to remove a small bone spur in the elbow. \u2026 The Single-A Modesto (Calif.) Nuts and the Rockies extended their player development contract through the 2016 season, the Rockies announced Friday. \u2026 Rocky Mountain High School graduate Marco Gonzales will be St. Louis\u2019 starting pitcher Sunday against the Rockies.
