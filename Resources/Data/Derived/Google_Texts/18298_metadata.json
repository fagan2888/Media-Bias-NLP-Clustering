He's hoping an Oval Office camera shot will help.\n\nTwo and a half weeks after terrorist attacks across Paris and four days after a rampage in San Bernardino, California, that the FBI is investigating as terrorism, Obama will make what will be just his third address ever from the Oval Office. It comes as the West Wing recognizes that Obama's reserved response to crises over the years and in the last three weeks, and his insistence that he's beating ISIL, has left many feeling nervous.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama won\u2019t be announcing a new strategy against ISIL, administration officials say. He\u2019s going for the hearts and guts, not the minds. The president understands that the Paris and California attacks made the threat feel close to home, an aide explained Sunday, and he wanted to speak directly to the country about the threat and steps he\u2019s taken since the terrorists hit France.\n\nAdministration officials say they understand why Americans are concerned. They've launched an intense administration-wide catch-up effort that began Thursday and continued into the weekend, with briefings for reporters at the White House and State Department, a deployment of officials armed with talking points to Sunday news shows, and culminating with the address from the Oval Office. The only previous occasions Obama has scheduled an address from the Oval Office were both in the summer of 2010 -- first to address the Gulf oil spill and then to announce the end of combat operations in Iraq.\n\nOne reason the president has made so few national statements from the Oval Office is that Obama and his aides don\u2019t like the format. They think the president\u2019s at his best feeding off of a crowd, and argue that people who make a big deal out of primetime presidential speeches are stuck in a 20th century media mindset. And on the few occasions when he\u2019s had to straight-to-camera speeches from the White House\u2014revealing the killing of Osama bin Laden, marking the Supreme Court\u2019s approval of Obamacare in 2012, announcing the Iran nuclear deal in July\u2014they\u2019ve had him stride in and out of the hallway of the East Room.\n\nBut actually, at this moment, America could do with a fireside chat, the White House decided. America needs that leader-father-comforter presence that Obama\u2019s never quite mastered\u2014a result of his own laid-back approach to power, deep-seated generational and racial tensions many people feel about having him in charge and larger existential anxieties about living in a time as dangerous and unpredictable as 2015.\n\n\u201cThe president has the opportunity tonight to tell the American people how he is willing to adapt to the threat and how he can better prepare our nation for a fight that will inevitably be passed on to his successor,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday, in a statement ahead of the speech.\n\nThat should include, McConnell said, laying out the new legal authorities Obama needs to help authorities crack ISIL\u2019s online communications, how a coalition ground force would work as well as what its goals and structure would be, and why he\u2019s not going to interrogate more people involved at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nAdministration officials say not to expect anything that detailed. But they are hoping to shift the general mood.\n\n\n\nIn a sign of how much reassurance he needs to provide, even Obama's former secretary of state said Sunday that his terrorism strategy needs a reboot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not winning, but it\u2019s too soon to say that we are doing everything we need to do,\u201d said Hillary Clinton, the nearly presumptive Democratic nominee who has the most to lose if he seems like he\u2019s slipping.\n\nAsked on ABC\u2019s This Week by George Stephanopoulos, once the communications director in her husband\u2019s White House, what she\u2019d say if she were the one in the Oval Office making the speech, Clinton predicted \u201ca much more robust air campaign against ISIS targets, against the oil infrastructure, against their leadership.\u201d\n\nThe two terror attacks, horrible and deadly as they were, haven\u2019t changed Obama\u2019s mind that invading and occupying another country in the Middle East isn\u2019t in his or America\u2019s long-term interests. That will leave him on Sunday night trying to explain progress when there\u2019s no easily measurable progress, and trying to provide security when he\u2019s said before that there\u2019s only so much that can be done to stop people who are willing to die for their hateful cause. He\u2019ll have to sit and look into the camera and figure out how to say both that ISIL\u2019s a more serious threat than he\u2019s made it out to be and that he\u2019s done more to disable it than he\u2019s made clear.\n\nOn Thursday, in a session for reporters called to discuss ISIL strategy at the White House, a senior administration official struggled with just how tricky that message is. On one hand, ISIL is \"degraded,\" the official said.\n\n\"If I was here six months ago, I don\u2019t think I might have said that. But it\u2019s a degraded organization. I haven\u2019t thought through I\u2019m going to use that word to kind of signal something,\u201d the official said.\n\nBut at the same time, ISIL remains \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most complicated things in the world and this is so incredibly difficult and challenging,\u201d the official said. \u201cJust because it\u2019s degraded doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s still not extremely dangerous. It\u2019s going to take a very long time. I can\u2019t overemphasize how difficult this is.\u201d\n\nNahal Toosi and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He is seeking to reassure, rather than offering new plans.", "title": "Obama to use Oval to calm nation's fears", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/obama-oval-office-address-isil-terrorism-216472", "image": "http://static.politico.com/e9/18/dd7c47794ddcabe1aaf56cd54b6a/obama-san-bernardino-shooting-1160-ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He is seeking to reassure, rather than offering new plans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f03\"", "article_summary": "| AP Obama to use Oval to calm nation's fears He is seeking to reassure, rather than offering new plans.\nPresident Barack Obama will address the nation from the Oval Office Sunday evening.\nOne reason the president has made so few national statements from the Oval Office is that Obama and his aides don\u2019t like the format.\nHe's hoping an Oval Office camera shot will help.\nPresident Barack Obama knows he hasn't convinced people he's keeping them safe."}
