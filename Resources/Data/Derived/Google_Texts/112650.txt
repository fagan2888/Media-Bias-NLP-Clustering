Last week, MRCTV’s Dan Joseph decided to ask folks around D.C. what woman they would like to see featured on our currency. Of course, President Obama endorsed the idea. Time magazine had a piece about it and left a poll for its readers; one of the choices was Beyoncé.

As Joseph strolled around the Lincoln Memorial, one man said his wife should be on the next dollar bill, which she said was a good answer. In the end, his vote would have been for Betsy Ross. Another man wanted Sandra Day O’Connor since she was first female Supreme Court Justice.

One woman said, “right now, it’s just been presidents, so I think it should be a female president if were going to keep going with that theme.” Yes, I know what you’re about to say; Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin were not presidents.

Other names that were dropped included Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Condoleezza Rice.

One girl said Taylor Swift, which prompted Joseph to “quit” MRCTV.
