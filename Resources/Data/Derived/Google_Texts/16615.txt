Dog owners are being asked to return a brand of dog chews over fears the chews could be contaminated with the bacteria Salmonella, putting both the pets and owners at risk.

On April 22, the FDA issued a nationwide recall on Nylabone brand Puppy Starter Kit dog chews designed for teething puppies. In the agency’s report, it stated the product involved could cause dogs to vomit, have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, come down with a fever, or be lethargic. If people haven’t thoroughly washed their hands after coming in contact with the chews, they may also face risks for infection, which comes with similar symptoms.

In rare cases, Salmonella can result in arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation, and urinary tract symptoms, the FDA states. To date, no illnesses have been reported as a result of the dog chews.

The product was distributed from Nylabone’s headquarters in Neptune, N.J. to states nationwide and in Canada. The FDA encourages all consumers to return the dog chews for a full refund.

The product comes in a 1.69 oz. package marked with Lot #21935, UPC 0-18214-81291-3, located on the back of the package, and with an expiration date of 3/22/18 also stamped on the back of the package. FDA
