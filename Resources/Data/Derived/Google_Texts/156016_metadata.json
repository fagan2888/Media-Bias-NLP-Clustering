Burwell, followed 2014\u2019s controversial Hobby Lobby case as a challenge by religious groups to the requirement that insurance companies cover contraception for female employees under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act. The plaintiffs in Zubik v. Burwell had argued that the requirement violates the religious freedom affirmed under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, the tenets of which have triggered conflict this election cycle over issues ranging from abortion to contraception to, more recently, transgender rights.\n\nThe ruling, as Slate\u2019s Dahlia Litwick puts it, \u201ctook religious liberty off [the Court\u2019s] docket, and also out of the center of the 2016 presidential election.\u201d But the court\u2019s decision isn\u2019t just an arcane tactic designed to punt on the issue until next year. It\u2019s a reminder that a deadlocked Supreme Court isn\u2019t just unsustainable\u2014it\u2019s a threat to democracy.\n\nZubik has been unusual since it was first argued in March, barely a week after the U.S. got its first look at what a deadlocked 4\u20134 Supreme Court looks like following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. After hearing oral arguments in the case, the Court issued another unusual unsigned order, asking the associated parties to submit briefs addressing \u201cwhether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners\u2019 employees through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees.\u201d Essentially, the Court was asking them to negotiate a regulatory compromise out of the desire to avoid a deadlocked decision that would kick the issue back down to a lower court, which is exactly what happened on Monday.\n\nThe back-and-forth with lower courts isn\u2019t itself rare. \u201cThe Supreme Court will often send cases back to a lower court without rendering a detailed opinion if questions or facts emerge during oral arguments before the Court that the lower body simply didn\u2019t consider,\u201d explains Harvard Law School professor Richard Fallon.\n\nBut what is rare in Zubik, Fallon says, is that the Supreme Court appeared to ask the parties involved in Zubik to provide an additional briefing that would generate questions about the efficacy of a compromise, essentially creating an excuse for the Supremes to punt to a lower court so that they might consider all the options rather than rule and set a precedent based on imperfect information. \u201cThe parties submitted their responses, and now it\u2019s on the basis of this new potential compromise position that the Court has gone itself to try to generate,\u201d Fallon says. The Supreme Court seemingly created its own loophole.\n\nA deadlocked Supreme Court isn\u2019t just unsustainable \u2014 it\u2019s a threat to democracy.\n\nThis desire to avoid a precedent-setting split decision is reflected in the Court\u2019s unanimous majority opinion (per curiam decisions make up about 18 percent of Supreme Court rulings), along with concurrences from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which stressed that the Supreme Court \u201cwas emphasizing nothing\u201d in its Monday ruling, as Adam Liptak at the New York Times put it.\n\n\u201cThe Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\u201d the ruling states. \u201cIn particular, the Court does not decide whether petitioners\u2019 religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s meticulous ruling, designed to avoid establishing a precedent in any way, shape, or form, was trumpeted as a victory for contraception advocates. It should, however, be seen as something more subtle: a deliberate effort, motivated by institutional responsibility, to keep the Court from falling into the same pattern of deadlock that\u2019s enveloped Congress in recent years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s every reason to expect that if the Court had simply decided the issue, they would have been divided four to four, and they don\u2019t want to do that if they can help it,\u201d Fallon speculates. \u201cThey are taking this alternative and unusual route to try to avoid simply dividing 4\u20134 and leaving the courts of appeals and the law in the state of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s been struggling with the uncertainty issue since March\u2019s Hawkins v. Community Bank of Raymore, which, while not as politically polarizing as Zubik, first began to articulate how the Court\u2019s split could reverberate beyond the American legal system. The case, which dealt with a bank\u2019s requirement to guarantee its business loans and, in turn, its liability for damaged credit, resolved in favor of the Eighth Circuit Court, though only within that court\u2019s narrow jurisdiction.\n\nYes, it seems overly boring, but that\u2019s exactly the problem, as The Atlantic\u2019s Matt Ford writes: \u201cAs arcane as this might seem, it\u2019s the kind of disagreement in federal law the Supreme Court exists to resolve. And thanks to a single indefinite vacancy, it can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhile the Court took a 4\u20134 deadlock on the chin in Hawkins, Fallon notes that it generally tends to avoid these decisions, even with unusual compromises. Even without a case actually resolving in a split decision, the specter of deadlock is visibly changing the dynamics of the Court in such a way that\u2019s resulting in increasingly unusual rulings. Consider one of Monday\u2019s other rulings, in Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, which saw the Court again pivoting on a case involving class action lawsuits despite the fact that legal experts had anticipated a clear victory for Spokeo.\n\n\u201cPretty much everybody agreed that Spokeo was fated to win this case, scoring another blow against class actions and consumer privacy. Then Justice Antonin Scalia died and all bets were off,\u201d Slate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern wrote in response to the sudden change in the Court\u2019s make-up. \u201cWith the court\u2019s four liberals holding firm, it was apparent that the justices were scrambling to avoid a 4\u20134 tie. On Monday, they revealed their solution: A big old punt that essentially freed the court from having to reach a final decision. In a brief opinion, six justices concluded that the lower court did not sufficiently analyze the standing question.\u201d\n\nSee the trend? Unable to fulfill its role as the country\u2019s highest court due to the threat of a tie, we\u2019re now getting a dysfunctional Court that\u2019s abdicating its duty to decide constitutional controversies by both deadlock and choice.\n\nWhy go through all this trouble? Why does the Supreme Court hate 4\u20134 rulings? It comes down to a matter of institutional responsibility, Fallon explains\u2014it\u2019s a way to keep the Court functioning as an institution of the federal government despite the political obstinacy that\u2019s left Scalia\u2019s seat unfilled.\n\n\u201cOnce cases are granted, the justice themselves feel to be members of a Court with institutional responsibilities,\u201d Fallon says. \u201cIt\u2019s not every person for himself, as if each justice is an individual umpire calling balls or strikes and tallying up the total to produce a ball-or-strike ruling. They have an institutional responsibility to decide cases, and in order to get majority decisions in cases, they decide cases in ways they wouldn\u2019t normally on their own to preserve the balance of the court.\u201d\n\nThe unusual outcomes of Zubik and Spokeo on Monday are both probably consequences of an equally divided Court, according to Fallon. \u201cMany people expected a 5\u20134 decision that Robins had no standing, with Scalia part of the five,\u201d he says. \u201cThe decision as it comes down is 6\u20132, which means that two justices who thought Robins had standing joined four who didn\u2019t as a matter of compromise to avoid deadlock and create an opinion that neither upheld or denied standing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s actually not in any way a disastrous thing for the Supreme Court to split 4\u20134 \u2014 the first iteration of the Court had six justices. But one of the principal responsibilities of the Court outside of ensuring the primacy of federal law over states is to maintain uniformity, something it can\u2019t do when a deadlock forces issues back down to a lower court with a specific jurisdiction, as was the case in Hawkins.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one sense where perfect uniformity can never be achieved, but too many cases the Supreme Court agrees to hear are often the most important ones,\u201d Fallon says. \u201cFar worse things have happened in the course of American constitutional history, but it\u2019s unfortunate we have to wait six months to a year to get uniformity to respect to these issues.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a simple solution to this problem: Appoint a justice to fill Scalia\u2019s place on the Court. While Republicans have vowed to put a hold on any nomination for Scalia\u2019s seat by Obama \u2014 including Merrick Garland, a jurist Fallon describes as \u201cthe model of mature judgment rather than a 35-year-old ideologue\u201d \u2014 the remaining justices are slowly and subtly fighting to keep the institution functioning in the face of judicial uncertainty.\n\nThat the Court has managed to duck and weave in the face of deadlock so far is unsurprising; after the death of Scalia, Justice Elena Kagan praised the ability of Chief Justice John Roberts to forge compromise on an often-split bench as a \u201cconsensus builder.\u201d But just as the justices have a responsibility to keep the Court afloat, so does Congress \u2014 and Congress shouldn\u2019t punt on its responsibility any longer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Court\u2019s recent rulings reveal a judicial body slowly staving off deadlock.", "title": "The Supreme Court Is Itching for a Tie-Breaker \u2014 Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "The Court\u2019s recent rulings reveal a judicial body slowly staving off deadlock.", "title": "The Supreme Court Is Itching for a Tie-Breaker \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/the-supreme-court-is-itching-for-a-tie-breaker-8682144f17db", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*oUb0VDzUF798lE_BBYqf3Q.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"creator": "@jaredbkeller", "label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*oUb0VDzUF798lE_BBYqf3Q.jpeg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "6 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/8682144f17db"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jared Keller", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/the-supreme-court-is-itching-for-a-tie-breaker-8682144f17db"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/8682144f17db", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/8682144f17db", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2016-05-17T11:01:01.237Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@jaredbkeller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a reminder that a deadlocked Supreme Court isn\u2019t just unsustainable\u2014it\u2019s a threat to democracy.\nThe United States Supreme Court is getting awfully good at punting.\nA deadlocked Supreme Court isn\u2019t just unsustainable \u2014 it\u2019s a threat to democracy.\nThe Supreme Court seemingly created its own loophole.\nWhy does the Supreme Court hate 4\u20134 rulings?"}
