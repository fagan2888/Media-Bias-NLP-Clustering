( David Powers/Courtesy of UCSF )\n\nIn 1953, Dr. John Clements realized something fundamental about the way the lung functions \u2014 an insight that would ultimately save the lives of millions of premature babies.\n\nThe story begins in 1950, when the U.S. Army sent Clements, a newly graduated physician, to the medical division of what was then called the Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Md. Clements was interested in doing research in biochemistry. His commanding officer was of a different mind.\n\n\u201d \u2018We don\u2019t need any biochemists,\u2019 \u201d Clements recalls the officer saying. \u201d \u2018You\u2019re going to be a physiologist.\u2019 And I became a physiologist because the Army said so.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the Army was worried about the Soviet Union using chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cMy assignment was to find out how nerve gases worked on the lungs,\u201d says Clements. So he set out to learn all he could about human lungs.\n\nLungs are made up of thin, pliable sacs called alveoli. You can think of them as tiny, somewhat permeable balloons. Oxygen enters the bloodstream though the outer membranes of these sacs.\n\nWhen the sacs inflate, there\u2019s more surface area for oxygen to cross into the blood.\n\nBut how much surface area is there in the normal lung? This wasn\u2019t an easy question to answer. Researchers who had looked at lung tissue through the microscope said the surface area was huge \u2014 maybe the size of a football field if you spread it all out.\n\nBut physiologists who estimated the energy that\u2019s used to inflate the sacs came up with a much, much smaller area.\n\n\u201cThat huge discrepancy between two supposedly correct methods bothered me,\u201d Clements says.\n\nIn 1953, he suggested an explanation for the discrepancy. Maybe there was a substance in the lung that made the alveoli easier to inflate and keep inflated. A few years later, Clements and others found it \u2014 a slippery substance known as a surfactant that reduces surface tension in the alveolar membranes. Soon scientists showed that a lack of surfactant is involved in human lung disease.\n\n\u201cAt that point the research, to use the trite term, exploded,\u201d Clements says.\n\nClements was doing basic research, not trying to cure a disease. But his work did contribute to a cure. In 1959, a researcher named Dr. Mary Ellen Avery, who was then at Harvard Medical School, showed that the lungs of premature babies can\u2019t make that surfactant. In those days, many children born at less than 37 weeks\u2019 gestation would die from something called respiratory distress syndrome, or RDS.\n\nThe FDA has since approved five synthetic surfactants to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies. Surfaxin, approved in 2012, is the latest to hit the market. (The first, Exosurf, is no longer sold.)\n\n\u201cIt took 40 years \u2014 from the initial discovery in the early \u201950s to the first approval of the FDA in the 1990s,\u201d says Dr. Sam Hawgood, a neonatologist who once worked in Clements\u2019 lab and is now chancellor at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cAll of us would like to compress that timeline,\u201d Hawgood says. \u201cBut if you think that we had no idea that this substance even existed or was needed in the \u201950s, to an actual drug four decades later \u2014 it\u2019s pretty remarkable.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s also remarkable is John Clements himself. Today he has a lab at UCSF. At 92, he still heads in every day and is proud of what his work has meant for treating premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n\u201cWhen we began this work back in the 1950s, the mortality from RDS was above 90 percent,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, that mortality is 5 percent or less.\u201d\n\nI asked Clements why he still works \u2014 surely he\u2019s achieved enough to rest on his laurels. He says there\u2019s always the chance that a new day will bring a new scientific insight.\n\n\u201cThe thrill of that is the best thing there is. At my age, I\u2019d put it even higher than sex,\u201d says Clements with a laugh. Then his tone is more serious. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big thrill when you think you\u2019ve made a discovery \u2014 found an idea \u2014 that no one else has had,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s as good as it gets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before John Clements' discovery many babies born before 37 weeks would die -- from respiratory distress syndrome.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Veteran UCSF Scientist Looks Back on Key Discovery That Helped Save Preemies' Lives\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/03\\/veteran-ucsf-scientist-looks-back-on-key-discovery-that-helped-save-preemies-lives\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-03 11:17:19\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-03 11:17:19\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":56245,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/08\\/john-clements-2_enl-ea29728975f50ad7220a05c8aa584faaad6ebf1f-e1438625730842.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Before John Clements' discovery many babies born before 37 weeks would die -- from respiratory distress syndrome.", "title": "Veteran UCSF Scientist Looks Back on Key Discovery That Helped Save Preemies\u2019 Lives", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/03/veteran-ucsf-scientist-looks-back-on-key-discovery-that-helped-save-preemies-lives/", "image": "http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif?utmac=UA-5828686-4&utmdt=How+A+Scientist%27s+Slick+Discovery+Helped+Save+Preemies%27+Lives&utme=8(APIKey)9(MDAxOTAwOTE4MDEyMTkxMDAzNjczZDljZA004)", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25a0\"", "article_summary": "Researcher John Clements seen in the early 1980s at UCSF, after he figured out that lungs need surfactants to breathe.\n( David Powers/Courtesy of UCSF )In 1953, Dr. John Clements realized something fundamental about the way the lung functions \u2014 an insight that would ultimately save the lives of millions of premature babies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big, big thrill when you think you\u2019ve made a discovery \u2014 found an idea \u2014 that no one else has had,\u201d he says.\nMaybe there was a substance in the lung that made the alveoli easier to inflate and keep inflated.\nA few years later, Clements and others found it \u2014 a slippery substance known as a surfactant that reduces surface tension in the alveolar membranes."}
