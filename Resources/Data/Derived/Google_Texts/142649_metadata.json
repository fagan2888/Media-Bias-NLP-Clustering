(AP) - Cowboys and cowgirls looking to improve their skills often spend a summer or two at the Cody Nite Rodeo.\n\nThis year that group included several Australians. A handful were in Cody most of the summer, but more started showing up later in the season, trying to qualify for the finals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for young fellas to get good,\u201d said Jesse Spencer, a 22-year-old bull rider from Queensland who grew up around the sport.\n\n\u201cMy dad rode a little bit and when I was 16, me and my little brother wanted to try it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got on a steer and it started from there.\u201d\n\nHe fell in love with the sport and has been competing for six years. This is his first time in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal getting to ride every night, so I wanted to come over here.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s spent most of his time in Cody but did go to the Jackson rodeo a few weekends.\n\n\u201cWe drove through Yellowstone and it was nice to see the animals,\u201d he said.\n\nSteve Tapp, 28, heard about the Nite Rodeo from an older cowboy who came through last season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still learning and it\u2019s good place to get a lot of rides under your belt,\u201d he said.\n\nOriginally from Brisbane, he spent the last five years in the Outback and competed in a bush rodeo riding bulls.\n\n\u201cFirst it was an adrenaline thing and now it\u2019s a challenge to get it right,\u201d Tapp said. \u201cI\u2019ve been learning a lot of what not to do and getting my technique right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s his first time in the U.S. and he\u2019s enjoying his time in Cody.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad and the locals are good people,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the finals, I might go to Oklahoma for a month before I go back home.\u201d\n\nTim McArthur, 26, and his brother Jack, 20, came over from Queensland.\n\n\u201cWe grew up with rodeo but this is full on,\u201d Tim said. \u201cYou\u2019re going every night, not like Australia.\u201d\n\nBoth said they expect their summer experience will make them better bull riders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for us to experience different things,\u201d Jack McArthur said. \u201cEveryone we\u2019ve met has been very helpful.\u201d\n\nIn early August, more Aussies began arriving almost every day. They heard about the great opportunities the Nite Rodeo has to offer and decided to check it out for themselves.\n\nAmong them was Chris Williams, 31, of Eastern South Wales. He competed at rodeos in West Texas and around the Midwest before coming to Cody.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going through the state doing PRCA rodeos,\u201d he said.\n\nWilliams started his rodeo career on bulls but began riding broncs when he was 25.\n\n\u201cOnce I did it I thought that\u2019s the way to go,\u201d he said.\n\nHe plans to stay in the U.S. and compete until the end of October.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll fly home for winter,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the Australian NFR at the end of January and I plan to come back next summer.\n\nWilliams has been traveling with Tyrell Smith, 23, a saddle bronc and bull rider. From Western Australia, he grew up around the sport, as his mom and dad both did rodeos.\n\nIn his few nights in Cody this year he\u2019d done well in the saddle bronc competition.\n\n\u201cI got second and first on my first two days,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m loving it here.\u201d\n\nRobert Dawson, 22, of Queensland heard about the rodeo and arrived in early August.\n\n\u201cIn Australia rodeos are weeks apart, which is why I came here,\u201d he said.\n\nDawson grew up on a ranch and competed in bull riding for several years before switching to saddle broncs.\n\nBareback rider Strawbs Jones, 20, of Queensland competed in the Calgary Stampede before coming to Cody.\n\n\u201cThe Calgary Stampede was the experience of a lifetime even though I got bucked off,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard about Cody through a mate and decided to come down for the month.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s still perfecting his technique after taking up bareback riding last year.\n\n\u201cI always said I\u2019d give it a go and I did last year,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was better than bulls and I fell in love.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Cody Enterprise, http://www.codyenterprise.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cowboys and cowgirls looking to improve their skills often spend a summer or two at the Cody Nite Rodeo.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Cowboys and cowgirls looking to improve their skills often spend a summer or two at the Cody Nite Rodeo.", "title": "Australians find success at Cody Nite Rodeo", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/13/australians-find-success-at-cody-nite-rodeo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/eb0469cee57bbf28810f6a706700884b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/eb0469cee57bbf28810f6a706700884b.jpg", "description": "Cowboys and cowgirls looking to improve their skills often spend a summer or two at the Cody Nite Rodeo.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Australians find success at Cody Nite Rodeo"}, "Author": "AMBER PEABODY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bbd\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Cowboys and cowgirls looking to improve their skills often spend a summer or two at the Cody Nite Rodeo.\nOriginally from Brisbane, he spent the last five years in the Outback and competed in a bush rodeo riding bulls.\nThey heard about the great opportunities the Nite Rodeo has to offer and decided to check it out for themselves.\nSteve Tapp, 28, heard about the Nite Rodeo from an older cowboy who came through last season.\nDawson grew up on a ranch and competed in bull riding for several years before switching to saddle broncs."}
