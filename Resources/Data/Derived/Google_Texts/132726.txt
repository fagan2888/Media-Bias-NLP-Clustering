Virginia’s special “Don’t Tread on Me” license plate featuring the Gadsden flag has exploded in popularity since its introduction. It has quickly overtaken many other specialty license plates in the Old Dominion, according to The Virginian-Pilot.

The rattlesnake has overtaken Jamestown, wildlife, and God. It left clean-fuel vehicles in its dust and is coming next for Virginia’s lighthouses. Autumn likely will fall soon afterward, along with the commonwealth’s great seal. Virginia’s “Don’t Tread On Me” license plate – yellow and bearing the popular rallying cry for limited government – is quickly climbing the ranks of special tags in the state.

The plates are now on more than 38,000 cars in the commonwealth. The meteoric rise may soon see the plate near the top of the list for specialty plates.
