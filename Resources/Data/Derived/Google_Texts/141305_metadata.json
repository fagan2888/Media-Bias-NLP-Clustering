Age and love of marathons have taken their toll on the 64-year-old billionaire owner of InterSystems, a Cambridge, Mass., database software company.\n\nLittle known outside the niche its technology dominates, InterSystems underpins health-related information for the national health services of England, Scotland and Wales and the U.S. Defense Department, as well as trading systems at Credit Suisse and the efforts of the European Space Agency to map the Milky Way.\n\nRagon, who prefers Terry to his first name, Phillip, isn\u2019t complaining in his sun-drenched office overlooking Boston. He\u2019s mentioning his knees for a reason.\n\n\u201cI saw two doctors at two different facilities on the same day,\u201d he says. \u201cBoth did X-rays. I can\u2019t believe that the way they like to do them is so different they couldn\u2019t share one. But each one got reimbursed.\u201d\n\nThe duplication adds time, cost and inconvenience. The solution \u2014 that the doctors review the same X-ray \u2014 is so easy it hardly needs mentioning. This being health care, simplicity ends there.\n\nRagon watched the fumbled rollout of HealthCare.gov with keen interest.\n\n\u201cHealth care is a lot more complicated than everybody thinks,\u201d he says. \u201cLarge-scale IT projects are a lot more complicated than everybody thinks. When you put the two together, you have a recipe for disaster.\u201d Still, he says, \u201cas health-care applications go, that one was pretty simple.\u201d The United States replaced IT provider CGI in March with Dublin-based Accenture when Montreal-based CGI\u2019s contract for the patient sign-up site expired.\n\nRagon has reason for confidence. He has expanded InterSystems into the dominant player in health-care information technology from a shop that 20 years ago battled over a stagnant $50 million market. The company, which had $463 million in revenue last year, employs 1,300 and has offices in 25 countries from Chile to China. Ragon had a net worth of $3.1 billion on July 1, largely from his sole ownership of InterSystems, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nRagon is competing in a field that\u2019s taking off thanks to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. Doctors and hospitals are also going digital after the federal economic stimulus package of 2009 provided more than $31 billion for computerized medical efforts. The market for electronic health records totals $23 billion in annual sales, not including health information exchanges, according to researcher Kalorama Information, a division of MarketResearch.com of Rockville, Md.\n\nIn the case of Ragon\u2019s knees, an electronic record would be one of the X-ray and his health history. The exchange would be the network that lets his doctors share that X-ray and other information.\n\nInterSystems makes money three ways. It licenses database technology that Epic Systems and other developers use as platforms for their own software. The more sales Epic makes, the more revenue Ragon gets. InterSystems also sells its software platforms starting at $107,000. These are launched off the shelf by hospitals or modified by vendors. A large percentage of business comes from national and state health systems. InterSystems has secured 170 federal contracts totaling $97.9 million since 2001, according to the USASpending.gov database.\n\nNot everyone is sold on private medical records circulating in cyberspace. Viruses can compromise files, prompting concerns about potential unauthorized access to confidential information, according to Mark Hickman, chief operating officer of WinMagic, a data security firm.\n\nIn April, the Rhode Island Department of Health settled a lawsuit brought by the state\u2019s American Civil Liberties Union over how Rhode Island would disclose matters of patient confidentiality related to the state\u2019s health exchange. The health information exchange is based on an InterSystems product that enables different technologies to share information.\n\nRagon plans to expand his market share even as database billionaire Larry Ellison and others vie to increase their piece of the medical industry.\n\nRagon in late 2013 reorganized InterSystems into three divisions, two focused on health care. HealthShare enables software applications to work together throughout hospitals and networks of doctors. An international unit, TrakCare, caters to customers such as the government-run health system of Brasilia, Brazil\u2019s federal district. The third focuses on InterSystems databases and platforms, called Cach\u00e9 and Ensemble, which developers use to store and retrieve data.\n\nToday, InterSystems software is running health exchanges in Illinois, Missouri, New York, Rhode Island and Texas.\n\n\u201cInterSystems has been in this market for a very long time,\u201d says John Moore, founder and managing partner of Chilmark Research, an analysis firm also based in Cambridge. \u201cThey\u2019re a well-run company, very technology savvy, and they fly under the radar.\u201d\n\nCompetitors are making some headway in the medical field. EMC, Microsoft, Oracle and VMware have had success selling their Web site and data-storage software to health-care providers, says Steve Flammini, chief technology officer with the Partners HealthCare system, a Boston-based collection of hospitals, research institutes and doctor practices.\n\n\u201cBut when Microsoft, Oracle and others have tried to drive their health-care-specific offerings, it\u2019s been very difficult for them to compete with the established vendors,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s because designing a health-care system is like flying a passenger jet \u2014 only so much reduction of complexity is possible, Flammini says. Doctors, like pilots, have a low tolerance for unpredictability. Ragon can satisfy administrators who want gastroenterologists and podiatrists to share the same software and make that software work in old networks.\n\n\u201cThis is what makes InterSystems a unique company,\u201d Flammini says.\n\nRagon, a native of Arizona, didn\u2019t have his mind on health care when he arrived as a freshman at MIT. In his senior year, the physics major decided he wanted to be a rock star, so he taught himself guitar. He left for London upon graduation in 1972, instrument in hand. He made ends meet by reselling Indian clothing he picked up in Britain to boutiques on Boston\u2019s Newbury Street. When the economy went south, so did demand for Nehru jackets.\n\nRagon returned stateside to start his tech business. Boston\u2019s Brighton neighborhood became his base. His landlord gave him and fellow MIT alumnus Paul Egerman free use of basement space. Ragon wrote code and tinkered with an out-of-tune piano stored there.\n\nThe pair sold the company they founded, now called IDX, in 1978. Ragon started InterSystems while Egerman stayed on with IDX and later formed eScription, a medical transcription service.\n\nRagon found himself in the middle of three efforts that remain at the core of health-care technology. While working on a federal contract, he refined code on a database program called \u201cMumps.\u201d The name is an acronym for Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System, a reference to the place where it was developed.\n\nRagon went on to do programming work for two companies that commercialized Mumps and made it the standard: Digital Equipment and Meditech. Fire up a medical software program from the 1980s, and there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll work on Cach\u00e9 or Ensemble, Ragon says.\n\nInterSystems grew even as the medical IT industry foundered. A competitor gave Ragon an opening. Digital Equipment\u2019s board wanted the company to turn a profit in the last quarter of 1994, Ragon says. The solution: Sell Ragon the same database division he\u2019d worked with more than 15 years earlier.\n\nRagon says he persuaded his bankers to stay late on Christmas Eve to wire Digital the funds. Chief executive Robert Palmer got his profit, $18.9 million \u2014 roughly equal to what InterSystems paid for Digital\u2019s Mumps business, Ragon says, confirming only that the purchase price was $10 million to $20 million.\n\nRagon doubled InterSystems\u2019 sales to about $33 million a year, a big chunk of the $50 million market. That gave InterSystems the heft to break a logjam of small, entrenched rivals. Sales tripled in the eight years through 2002.\n\nRagon\u2019s next big experience was with the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the 1970s and 1980s, patient care was at the center of an effort among department programmers who were nicknamed the Underground Railway, according to George Timson\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Hardhats,\u201d posted on a Mumps user Web site.\n\nThese techies covertly built and installed applications based on the Mumps technology Ragon helped develop. He weighed in with some ideas the programmers used. The agency at first didn\u2019t back the endeavor. \u201cLet\u2019s say it was more than unsanctioned,\u201d Ragon recalls.\n\nThe work gained support because VA doctors were able to summon computerized records in seconds, vital for treating vets hustled into an emergency room, according to Ragon\u2019s 2006 testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.\n\nInterSystems went on to build a platform for Veterans Affairs that allowed 130 computer systems to communicate, winning contracts for technology that was rolled out nationwide.\n\nToday, the department is embroiled in a scandal over patients waiting for doctor appointments. A May 28 inspector general\u2019s report found mismanagement and falsified records in hospitals that treat 8.3 million veterans. VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki resigned May 30.\n\nHouse Veterans Affairs\u2019 Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) said in a June 9 statement that recent deaths of at least 23 veterans have been linked to delayed VA medical care; an additional 35 veterans have died while awaiting care in the Phoenix area alone, he said.\n\nPresident Obama has nominated former Procter & Gamble chief Robert A. McDonald to head the department.\n\nPaul Grabscheid, vice president of strategic planning at InterSystems, says Veterans Affairs probably built its electronic patient queue on the company\u2019s technology. The patient waiting times aren\u2019t caused by flawed technology, he says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the problem there is the appointment system,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is people behaving badly.\u201d\n\nGrabscheid adds that InterSystems hasn\u2019t been affected by the situation.\n\nToday\u2019s federally mandated push to computerize records is complicated because the industry is so fragmented, Chilmark\u2019s Moore says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a cottage industry,\u201d he says.\n\nRagon is more blunt, even as he adopts the same metaphor.\n\n\u201cIf you see the U.S. as a cottage industry, you\u2019ve got to do one of two things: consolidate the cottages or find a mechanism where the cottages can work together,\u201d he says. \u201cThis country is on the latter path.\u201d\n\nThe full version of this Bloomberg Markets article appears in the magazine\u2019s August issue.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "terry ragon, intersystems, electronic health records, bloomberg, obamacare, health care it, obamacare software, digital medical records, digitizing medical records, medical records privacy issues", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Terry Ragon\u2019s knees ache.
