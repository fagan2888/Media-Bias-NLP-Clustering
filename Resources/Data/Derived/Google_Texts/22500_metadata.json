But they can also introduce a dangerous bacterial infection, since the body isn\u2019t accustomed to the metal or plastic devices. To help prevent the spread of infections, researchers have developed a novel way of spotting it with the use of lasers and fluorescent antibiotics.\n\nAbout one out of every 100 implant patients become infected after an operation. Spotting these infections can be especially difficult for surgeons though, as it\u2019s not always clear whether the inflammation is caused by a bacterial infection \u2014 in which case the implant must be removed \u2014 or the body\u2019s response to a foreign object. It becomes harder to diagnose the problem when bacteria surround themselves with a biofilm that protects from antibiotics.\n\nThe researchers used a technique for tracking the spread of cancer, in which laser light activated fluorescent dyes in affected areas of the body, causing them to light up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to perform surgery, take a sample, [and] cultivate the bacteria,\u201d Jan Maarten van Dijl, a microbiologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, told LiveScience. \u201cNow, with this fluorescent dye, we would have a tool that would allow bedside monitoring.\u201d\n\nVan Dijl and his team infected mice with Staphylococcus aureus, and then injected the antibiotic vancomycin \u2014 both were modified to contain a fluorescent molecules (the antibiotic was red and the infection was blue). The fluorescent molecules became excited when the researchers shone a camera emitting a laser beam on the mice, and appeared as a faint glow through the skin.\n\nAfter testing the fluorescent antibiotic on a human ankle from a cadaver, they found similar results. But they also found that \u201cit will only work as deep as the laser light and fluorescence can go through the tissue,\u201d van Dijl told LiveScience. The fluorescent molecule would also have to be tested for toxicity in humans with regards to dosing, but since it\u2019s been used in humans before, and the antibiotic is safe, van Dijl says there\u2019s a good chance they are safe together.\n\nSource: van Oosten M, Schafer T, Gazendam J, et al.
