Boulder resident Geoff Noyes kicked off his 2015 by running straight into freezing water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rejuvenating,\u201d Noyes said. \u201cThere\u2019s no feeling like it in the world.\u201d\n\nHundreds of people joined Noyes today as they doggie-paddled, danced and dunked themselves in the 36-degree waters of the Boulder Reservoir for the 32nd Polar Plunge.\n\nThe Boulder County AIDS Project \u2014 which took over the event last year \u2014 said about 400 to 600 people registered, raising about $25,000 for HIV education, prevention and care.\n\nThis was Noyes\u2019 second year taking the plunge, and he said it\u2019s not exactly something that gets easier with time.\n\n\u201cIt was just as hard this year,\u201d Noyes said. \u201cBut when you get out of the water you feel like a newborn person.\u201d\n\nNoyes family watched him make the plunge this year, but he still holds out hope they will join him in the plunge.\n\n\u201cOne of these years I\u2019ll get them to go,\u201d Noyes said.\n\nWhile Noyes braved the waters solo, many of the plungers showed up in teams, including Team Hamhock, named for the celebratory ham they always feast on after the plunge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of friends having a good time and starting off the new year right,\u201d said Charlie Barkmeier, a member who has done five plunges so far. \u201cOne year around Christmas we just said, \u2018Let\u2019s try this thing out.'\u201d\n\nMaria LeFebre, another member of the team, said she was keeping a close eye on the forecast before the plunge, with temperatures in Boulder as low as -14 just two days ago.\n\n\u201cI kept checking the weather,\u201d LeFebre said, though Barkmeier said he was never that concerned.\n\n\u201cNo matter what, we would have been out here,\u201d Barkmeier said.\n\nLuckily for the plungers, the skies were sunny and the temperatures hovered in the mid-20s for the plunge, though Barkmeier said that almost made the plunge even harder.\n\n\u201cThe water just hits you hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe broke up some ice with our shins this year.\u201d\n\nThe 17 people on Team Hamhock included a new plunger this year in Paul Rohr, who admitted he was a little hesitant to join at first.\n\n\u201cI made the decision after a few drinks,\u201d Rohr said.\n\nRohr did say that he felt his strategy of going into the plunge wearing as little clothing as possible actually helped.\n\n\u201cI saw people coming out wearing cotton and they were freezing,\u201d Rohr said. \u201cMy feet were the only things that got really cold.\u201d\n\nRohr said he will be coming back for another go at the plunge, and didn\u2019t even need any adult beverages to come to that decision.\n\n\u201cIt was better than I expected,\u201d Rohr said. \u201cI think I\u2019m hooked.\u201d\n\nTwo other first time plungers were cousins Hope and Erica Atkinson, both 13, who heard an ad for the event on the radio.\n\n\u201cWe decided it would be a good way to start of 2015,\u201d Hope said.\n\nBoth of the girls said it was a fun \u2014 but chilly \u2014 experience.\n\n\u201cIt was cold, very very cold,\u201d Erica said. \u201cYour body turns numb.\u201d\n\nAnd unlike Boulder native Erica, Hope hails from Texas, where polar plunges aren\u2019t exactly a local tradition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so not used to this,\u201d Hope said.\n\nBut when asked if they would take the plunge again, both girls answered instantly with a resounding, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMitchell Byars: 303-473-1329, byarsm@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/mitchellbyars",
