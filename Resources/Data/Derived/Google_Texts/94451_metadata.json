Her daily rants and fables also are available at her blog where she writes as a Granny Guerrilla to entertain and enlighten low-information voters, amuse patriots, and piss off progressives.\n\nMontel Williams, talk show host, TV personality and former Marine, recently appeared on The Glenn Beck Program to share a common-sense solution to the Department of Veterans Affairs health care debacle.\n\nWilliams commented:\n\n\u201cThere are 50,000 children (to date) that came across the border illegally. We\u2019re opening up DOD [Department of Defense] facilities to triage them. They are refugees. We should help them. But, how dare we let them go to a DOD facility before we let our own people \u2013 our veterans who fight for our lives \u2013 do the same thing?\u201d\n\nDoes Williams have a point? Is America obligated to care for and absorb 80 to 90,000 illegal alien children into our culture at the expense of our own?\n\nEvery single one of our heroic veterans waiting for medical care is somebody\u2019s child.\n\nEvery single one of our heroic veterans has put his/her life at risk for us.\n\nWilliams urges Americans to support a straightforward plan that could clear the backlog of veterans waiting for care:\n\n\u201cPresident Obama can act, without Congress, and order each branch of the service that has allowed corpsmen to go off active duty and into the reserve, to bring them back on temporary active duty. They could man every VA hospital, and the hospitals on military bases, with the mission of clearing the entire backlog in 90 days.\u201d\n\nWilliams explained how Obama, as commander in chief, could make the call \u201ctoday\u201d and tap into the skills of thousands of off-duty corpsmen (\u201ccorpsemen\u201d in Obama-speak). In 90 days, we would have gained understanding about the actual cost (present and future) of fulfilling our promises and debt to our veterans.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have to do this.\u201d\n\nIs anyone in Washington listening? Does America\u2019s procrastinating and feckless commander in chief have a clue about the need to take immediate action to treat our sick and wounded veterans?\n\nWho knows?\n\nObama seems to be terribly, terribly, terribly busy ignoring America\u2019s failing economy, Iraq\u2019s disintegration, and escalating Middle East chaos.\n\nBut, he\u2019s not too busy to spew tons of carbon (from Air Force One and support aircraft) as he flits hither and yon to promote the dangers of climate change.\n\nWhat about Congressional action? Anything happening on that front? Yes and no.\n\nThe Senate has spawned an unlikely alliance between lib-tard Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Republican Progressive Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who have cobbled together a bill for veteran assistance that doesn\u2019t really help our vets.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated an initial expenditure of $500 million for the construction of additional VA facilities and to support vouchers called \u201cchoice cards.\u201d This program allows vets to seek medical care outside of the VA system.\n\nJust in case you forgot, these are the same Congressional Budget Office bean counters who assured us that Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act would save money, and become a blessing for America. Same deal here, just different players. When presented with additional specifics, the CBO revised the estimate to $35 BILLION dollars by 2016.\n\nDoes this ballooning expenditure actually help our veterans? Probably not. Based on prior experience ($700 BILLION dollars siphoned from Medicare to pay for Obamacare), the money allocated for veteran medical care will be diverted to illegal aliens or some other Obama pet project.\n\nWill the re-distribution of $35 billion of our tax dollars become a blessing for America? Certainly so, if you\u2019re referring to Central America.\n\nWhoopsie! Elephant-in-the-room alert! The Sanders/McCain program holds down costs by limiting the use of choice cards to Medicare providers, the Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, and federally qualified health centers (code words for overcrowded facilities that provide preventive care to uninsured and low-income patients).\n\nSay what? Will this help our veterans obtain quality medical services? NO!\n\nIncreasing numbers of doctors are turning away Medicare patients because they can\u2019t afford to accept the low reimbursement rates. Therefore, in order to accommodate thousands of VA patients, doctors who continue to accept Medicare will be forced to diminish patient time, or will turn VA escapees\u2019 evaluations over to physician assistants.\n\nUnfortunately, before a choice-card-carrying veteran spends three-and-a-half minutes with a doctor, they\u2018ll wait long hours in overcrowded hospitals and/or waiting rooms overflowing with seniors, the poor, and of course, illegal aliens infected with highly contagious diseases like scabies, lice, measles, chicken pox, and tuberculosis.\n\nTake a number. Sit down. Shut up. Wait your turn. Do our vets deserve the McSanders\u2019 program? NO, they deserve better.\n\nUh oh! Another elephant in the room. Rules and regulations haven\u2019t been developed\u2026 yet. Like everything undertaken by our government, the McSanders\u2019 bill seems destined to evolve via Uncle Scam\u2019s four-step program.\n\nONE: Lie about the cost.\n\nTWO: Establish convoluted and disingenuous rules (or write them as you go along).\n\nTHREE: Promise more, but deliver less.\n\nFOUR: Assign overpaid and under-skilled bureaucrats to perform their usual piss-poor implementation.\n\nHaven\u2019t we already been here with Obamacare? How\u2019s that working out for millions of We-the-People? Lost our doctors. Lost our insurance plans. Lost premiums we could afford. Lost our full-time jobs. Lost quality medical care for our families. Lost trust in the government, especially in Obama.\n\nSo, what can you do to help America\u2019s veterans in their time of need?\n\nFire up your passion (instead of your anger) by watching physician assistants\u2019 emotional appearance on The Glenn Beck Program.\n\nSend Williams a tweet of support @Montel_Williams\n\nAppeal to Obama\u2019s giant ego and desperate quest for a meaningful legacy. Tell him that he can regain popularity points by launching a VA surge. Then sign the petition.\n\nOr, if you think it\u2019s more effective, demand Obama get his fanny off Air Force One and call up off-duty corpsmen to launch a VA Surge. Then, sign the petition.\n\nRegardless, enlist your friends and neighbors to support America\u2019s brave warriors. Talk and tweet it out across the land. Do it now! OORAH!\n\nListen TheBlaze\u2019s Mike Opelka talk with Montel Williams about the importance of the #VASurge.\n\nP.S.
