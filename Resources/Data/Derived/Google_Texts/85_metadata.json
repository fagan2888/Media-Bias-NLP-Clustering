As a result of the demand, she created a course designed specifically for the industry.\n\nMcNamara, who has taught food-safety and alcohol courses to the restaurant industry for 18 years, bases her curriculum on the ServSafe Food Safety Training Program developed by the National Restaurant Association to provide comprehensive training materials to the restaurant industry.\n\nAnd the edibles food-safety classes are selling out.\n\n\u201cIn the restaurant industry, people do not want to come to these classes,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cIn the cannabis classes, they want to be there.

She\u2019s already received an inquiry from the Massachusetts Department of Health regarding how her cannabis course is designed.\n\n\u201cI think it elevates the industry,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cAs consumers, we will start looking at how edibles are made.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd amid edibles-induced injuries and death in its first year of legal recreational marijuana, Colorado has realized the importance of maintaining such regulatory standards when it comes to pot-infused food.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "Instructor tailors curriculum to suit the cannabis industry", "author": "Margaret Jackson", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Instructor tailors curriculum to suit the cannabis industry", "title": "Edibles Manufacturers Hungry for Information on Best Practices", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/edibles-manufacturers-hungry-for-information-on-best-practices", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-medicalmarijuana-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-medicalmarijuana-mslarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "date": "2015-01-20T06:45Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "marijuana edibles, regulation, cannabis economy, marijuana in colorado, personal finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "personal finance", "published_time": "2015-01-20T06:45Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1625724"}, "guid": 13010334, "twitter": {"description": "Instructor tailors curriculum to suit the cannabis industry", "title": "Edibles Manufacturers Hungry for Information on Best Practices", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/edibles-manufacturers-hungry-for-information-on-best-practices", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-medicalmarijuana-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-medicalmarijuana-mslarge.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "marijuana edibles, regulation, cannabis economy, marijuana in colorado, personal finance"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFood is food,\u201d McNamara said.\n\u201cIn the restaurant industry, people do not want to come to these classes,\u201d McNamara said.\n\u201cI think it elevates the industry,\u201d McNamara said.\n\u201cThere are certainly differences between a restaurant and a food manufacturer \u2014 I\u2019m not aware of manufacturers working with foods like chicken.\nADVERTISEMENTDENVER(MainStreet) \u2014 When marijuana became legal in Colorado, food safety instructor Maureen McNamara found that many people involved in the production of edible marijuana products started showing up at her classes."}
