If people want to take a carriage ride in Central Park, that is just what they should do \u2014 the carriages should be confined to Central Park. If people want to go sightseeing on the streets, it should not be done with a carriage. They can get on a doubledecker bus. That is what they are there for. By the way, Julie, what do you think is going to happen to a lot of those horses? I don\u2019t want to think about that. The horses don\u2019t deserve what might happen. Rowena Lachant\n\nHold your horses, Jimmy\n\nManhattan: I think Councilman Jimmy Vacca was a little harsh in his judgment of Edie Falco\u2019s ad urging him to vote in favor of the proposed ban on horse-drawn carriages. She just wanted to point out that horses are forced to pull carriages work long days on the congested streets in all types of weather, even while they are sick or injured. She isn\u2019t asking him to support the bill because of \u201cthe opinions of celebrities.\u201d She\u2019s a New Yorker asking him to support it because the horses are suffering, and retiring them to sanctuaries is the right thing to do. Jannette Patterson\n\nTried and true\n\nHastings-On-Hudson, N.Y.: We feel very strongly that taking the horses and carriages out of New York is an error and sends a negative message about keeping old traditions. Barbara and Ira Finegold\n\nIncentive to care\n\nFlushing: To all of the dopes who are against the Central Park carriage horses, please answer this question: Why would a carriage driver abuse his meal ticket? Mike Murray\n\nLet\u2019s fight back\n\nManhattan: Hey, Sony, didn\u2019t you get the memo that we don\u2019t cave to terror threats? Show the movie. Give it away. Let anyone who wants to see it watch for free. Don\u2019t give in to these bums. Obama, say something, do something. We can\u2019t let these lowlife monsters get away with this form of terrorism. Send a drone to that little nut in North Korea. This was an act of war. Let\u2019s put him down for real. Louie Dumbrowski\n\nThe coward\u2019s way\n\nMamaroneck, N.Y.: As if the current administration in the White House hasn\u2019t done enough over the last few years to give the United States a reputation of being soft, Sony Entertainment has topped that in just two days. Leave it to Hollywood tree-hugging liberals not only to negotiate with terrorists, but to completely knuckle under. This kind of capitulation by Sony may give more cyber-terrorists the green light to act, knowing there will probably be no repercussions for their actions. Ted Rallis\n\nBush was right\n\nCortlandt Manor, N.Y.: In 2002, President George W. Bush referred to North Korea as part of an \u201caxis of evil\u201d in his State of the Union speech and was laughed at by the left. Now, North Korea, through the use of cyber-terrorism and direct threats of 9/11-type violence, has brought Sony Pictures to its knees over a film the regime finds offensive. In a country where there is no such thing as freedom of speech, they sure seem to have had an easy time denying Sony\u2019s. Michael P. Devine\n\nDead letter office\n\nBrooklyn: To Voicer Patty Giugliano on the problems with her post office, ZIP code 11204: My post office, ZIP code 11226, is the worst in Brooklyn. It\u2019s a small building that services a million people. There are no stamp machines or self-service machines, as at other stations. The lines are always to the door, which makes the small area overcrowded and a fire hazard. One line is for money orders and stamps, another is for package pickup and the third is for mailing packages or letters. Someone is always arguing, and the employees make you feel like they are doing you a favor \u2014 especially the man who does passports. Since September, I have had three packages returned without ever receiving a notice. One package was left next door, in a large building complex. A man brought it over to me. The package had my correct name and address. It went to him only because he had the same apartment number as me. And this mess doesn\u2019t happen only at holiday time \u2014 it\u2019s year-round. Before I retired, I did all my mailing in Manhattan at Cooper Station, which runs smoothly. Emily A. Cole\n\nOur new friends down South\n\nSayville, L.I.: President Obama said it\u2019s good to have a relationship with Cuba so Americans can visit. I\u2019d rather spend time in my cat\u2019s litter box than go there! Now that he\u2019s friendly with Cuba, I wonder if he\u2019s going to offer them Obamacare? Maureen Fazio\n\nA built-in bias\n\nManhattan: While I do not condone the violence in Ferguson, I understand that time and time again our black youth are challenged by a system designed for whites. Cathy Mims\n\nThe cardinal rule\n\nHamden, Conn.: May I say that we should fully support Timothy Cardinal Dolan! He is the voice of the common people. Truly, we should be grateful for those who literally put their lives on the line, for all of us, the officers of the NYPD. I have family living in NYC. Every day, I thank God for the NYPD, New York\u2019s Finest! Patricia Mayko Santacroce\n\nBack to work, Bill\n\nBronx: Suggestion for Bill de Blasio: Instead of kvetching about \u201cincome inequality,\u201d trying to become a national progressive leader and kissing up to Al Sharpton, how about attending to the city\u2019s nuts and bolts, like Rikers? Gene Roman\n\nDefaming cops\n\nPort Jervis, N.Y.: New York Jet Sheldon Richardson was quoted in the newspaper saying his cop friends laughed when he said Darren Wilson was a murderer and a pig. Wilson was in the pit, a pit far darker and deeper than any football field, and he survived. He is not a pig. I am amazed that none of his cop buddies explained to Richardson why it was not murder, and that there was no objection to the word \u201cpig.\u201d Mike Misczuk\n\nBlame Eli, not Tom\n\nMiddlebury, Conn.: I can\u2019t understand the demise of the football Giants being blamed on Tom Coughlin. It\u2019s the fault of the terrible quarterback, Eli Manning. George Robinson\n\nThink water safety\n\nBrooklyn: As winter vacation gets closer and many go on trips to wamer climes, child safety is very important. Always swim near the lifeguard. Make sure the ocean looks safe when one goes in. Never go into a rough ocean with a riptide, which can drag a person underwater. When the ocean looks challenging, just stay out. Kids should always go into the ocean with an experienced swimmer. They can always stay near the lifeguard. Never swim near a jetty or play on rocks. Adults should always hold the hand of kids 5 and under until they get the hang of it at the edge of the water. Water safety entails knowing about caution and taking it. It\u2019s being ready in a second to help a child with a helping hand. Not all kids can swim, but they can all be safe with an adult who is a good swimmer. Water safety is taking precautions against what could happen. Many accidents can be prevented. Raquel Boujo\n\nBus stop\n\nManhattan: Why do I, a citizen of the greatest city on earth, have to take a taxi when I don\u2019t want to do so? Because, though the MTA may deny it, bus service on Broadway and Amsterdam Ave. seems to have been cut back. I have to wait at least 20 minutes, and if I haven\u2019t given up by then, a bus \u2014 or two or three buses at once \u2014 will show up. Some stops don\u2019t have seats. Many times elderly people with walkers and wheelchairs are forced to wait in the cold. This is unacceptable. The other day, when a bus finally appeared, I quietly asked the driver why, in recent months, I\u2019ve had to wait so long. His reply: \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d No, he may not care, but those of us waiting do care. Why is this happening? Marcia Epstein\n\nA blown play\n\nBrooklyn: Brian Cashman must be fired at once. This stupid dingbat should have signed David Robertson for the Yankees.
