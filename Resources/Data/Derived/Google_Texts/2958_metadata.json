Aside from some overblown criticism of the conservative justices, nobody is speculating that anybody on the real-life Supreme Court is suffering from a degenerative brain disease.\n\nBut the show\u2019s plotline calls attention to the fact that, barring death or an impeachable offence, the justices themselves decide when to hang up their robes. And today\u2019s Supremes are no spring chickens. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal lion who has resisted calls to retire during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, is 82. Antonin Scalia, on the right, and Anthony Kennedy, in the centre, are both 79. Stephen Breyer is 77. Four justices\u2014Clarence Thomas (67), Samuel Alito (66), Sonia Sotomayor (61) and the chief, John Roberts (60)\u2014are sexagenarians. The new kid on the bench, Elena Kagan, is a wee 55. If nobody leaves the court in the next five years\u2014an unlikely permutation\u2014the average age of the justices will be 75 at the end of the next president\u2019s first term.\n\nIs there anything wrong with a grey bench? Fix the Courts, an advocacy group, says yes, and proposes that future nominees to the Supreme Court take a pledge to serve no more than 18 years before stepping down. Given how hard it is to amend the Constitution, this proposal is less quixotic than an attempt to change the provision in Article III permitting justices to \u201chold their offices during good behaviour\u201d. But are term limits for justices, whether imposed or voluntarily agreed to, a good idea?\n\nFix the Courts has one primary argument in favour of fresh blood, and it\u2019s not quite convincing. The goal of life tenure was to \u201cshield those serving on the court from the political pressures of the day\u201d, the group observes, but \u201ctoday\u2019s justices...are polarised along partisan lines in a way that mirrors our other broken and gridlocked political institutions\u201d.\n\nThere are three problems with this line of reasoning. First, while the Roberts Court issues more closely divided rulings than previous courts ever did, it\u2019s a myth that \u201ctoday\u2019s justices\u201d are more political than their forebears. In 1803, under Chief Justice John Marshall, the court flexed its Federalist party muscle against the new president, Thomas Jefferson, in its ingenious Marbury v Madison ruling. During the Lochner era from 1905 to 1937, the court routinely struck down progressive legislation to improve worker health and safety and to extricate the country from the Great Depression. It was enough to spur Franklin Delano Roosevelt to propose an ill-fated court-packing plan to change its composition and the tenor. (He withdrew the plan when the court started upholding New Deal policies.)\n\nSecond, there\u2019s no reason to believe term limits would put a damper on the court\u2019s politicisation, or fundamentally change the \u201cpolitical circus\u201d of the Senate confirmation hearings. Even if nominees taking the pledge can be trusted to keep their word\u2014remember, it isn\u2019t legally binding\u201418 years is still a long time. Political actors will remain quite worried about who ends up among the nine most powerful jurists in the land.\n\nThird, 5-4 decisions show the justices may be \u201cpolarised\u201d on certain issues, but it does not mean the justices are \u201cpartisan\u201d. Nobody on the court seeks to toe the line of either of the major political parties. In fact, during the term that ended in June, many of the justices\u2014the conservative ones in particular\u2014were willing to stray from their typical ideological camps in plenty of cases. This past spring, for example, Chief Justice Roberts voted with the four liberal justices to save Obamacare and to uphold restrictions on fundraising by judicial candidates. Justice Thomas voted against his conservative brethren in permitting Texas to refuse to print Confederate flags on licence plates. And Justice Alito came to the defence of pregnant women\u2019s rights in the workplace.\n\nEliminating life terms for justices is questionable as a solution to the purportedly novel problem of judicial politicisation. But there are other good reasons to wish for a court where no one stays on for three or four decades. At the founding, Thomas Jefferson suggested that since the \u201cearth belongs usufruct to the living\u201d, America ought to have a constitutional convention every 20 years to scrap the old document or subject it to revisions. That proposal did not go anywhere and may not have been a recipe for the early republic\u2019s stability. But there is wisdom in the general notion of more frequent leadership change.\n\nNo matter how wise or enlightened they may be, a bench of seven or nine octogenarians will have a circumscribed perspective on the country for which they are adjudicating fundamental questions. Encrusted jurisprudence won\u2019t necessarily be bad for the country: as Alexander Hamilton pointed out in Federalist 79, the \u201cdanger of a superannuated bench\u201d resulting from aged judges is \u201cimaginary\u201d. Indeed, Justice Ginsburg shows in both her written opinions and incisive questions during oral argument that she is as vigorous intellectually as she has ever been. But breathing new life into the nation\u2019s highest court more often\u2014even if it does not make the tribunal any less political\u2014would bring more dynamism to the judiciary, jog the justices' decision-making patterns and narrow, even if only slightly, the yawning gap between the enrobed ones and everyday citizens.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150822_blp902.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Term limits and the Supreme Court", "description": "Fresh blood is good, but judges should not be forced to leave", "pubdate": 20150820, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Fresh blood is good, but judges should not be forced to leave", "title": "Is it bad to have a bunch of old judges?", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/08/term-limits-and-supreme-court", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150822_blp902.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Fresh blood is good, but judges should not be forced to leave", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-20 17:27:18", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150822_blp902.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150822_blp902.jpg", "articleid": 21661911, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150822_blp902.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Term limits and the Supreme Court", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150822_blp902.jpg", "news_keywords": "Term limits and the Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "ON THE third season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d, the Netflix show about Washington Machiavellianism gone haywire, a fictional Supreme Court justice mulls retirement when he is diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s.\nJustice Thomas voted against his conservative brethren in permitting Texas to refuse to print Confederate flags on licence plates.\nAside from some overblown criticism of the conservative justices, nobody is speculating that anybody on the real-life Supreme Court is suffering from a degenerative brain disease.\nFix the Courts, an advocacy group, says yes, and proposes that future nominees to the Supreme Court take a pledge to serve no more than 18 years before stepping down.\nBut are term limits for justices, whether imposed or voluntarily agreed to, a good idea?"}
