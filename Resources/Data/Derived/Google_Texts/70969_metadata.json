Lawmakers also made it illegal to condone anorexia and said any re-touched photo that alters the bodily appearance of a model for commercial purposes must carry a message stating it had been manipulated.\n\n\"The activity of model is banned for any person whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is lower than levels proposed by health authorities and decreed by the ministers of health and labor,\" the legislation says.\n\nThe lawmaker behind the bill previously said models would have to present a medical certificate showing a BMI of at least 18, about 55 kg (121 lb) for a height of 1.75 meters (5.7 feet), before being hired for a job and for a few weeks afterwards.\n\nThe law, voted through the lower house of parliament by Hollande's Socialist majority despite opposition by conservative parliamentarians, envisages imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of 75,000 euros ($82,000) for any agency contravening it.\n\nA second measure means that any website inciting a reader to \"seek excessive thinness by encouraging eating restrictions for a prolonged period of time, resulting in risk of mortality or damage to health\" will face up to a year in prison and fines of up to 100,000 euros.\n\nElite and IMG, two big modeling agencies present in France, both declined to comment on the moves.\n\nSome 30,000-40,000 people in France suffer from anorexia, most of them teenagers, health experts estimate.\n\nIn 2010, Isabelle Caro, an anorexic 28-year-old former French fashion model, died after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness.\n\n(By Emile Picy; Writing and additional reporting by Mark John; Editing by Crispian Balmer)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "france, bans, super, skinny, models, anorexia, clampdown", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "France will ban excessively thin fashion models and put agents and fashion houses that hire them at risk of fines or even jail time under a new law passed Friday.", "title": "France Bans Super-Skinny Models In Anorexia Clampdown", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/france-bans-super-skinny-models-anorexia-clampdown-328110", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/anorexia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "France will ban excessively thin fashion models and put agents and fashion houses that hire them at risk of fines or even jail time under a new law passed Friday.", "title": "France Bans Super-Skinny Models In Anorexia Clampdown", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/france-bans-super-skinny-models-anorexia-clampdown-328110", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/anorexia.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/anorexia.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-04-04T10:25:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-04T10:26:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "France will ban excessively thin fashion models and put agents and fashion houses that hire them at risk of fines or even jail time under a new law passed Friday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0a3\"", "article_summary": "In 2010, Isabelle Caro, an anorexic 28-year-old former French fashion model, died after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness.\nFrance will ban excessively thin fashion models and put agents and fashion houses that hire them at risk of fines or even jail time under a new law passed Friday.\nSome 30,000-40,000 people in France suffer from anorexia, most of them teenagers, health experts estimate.\nPARIS (Reuters) - France will ban excessively thin fashion models and expose modeling agents and the fashion houses that hire them to possible fines and even jail, under a new law passed on Friday.\nElite and IMG, two big modeling agencies present in France, both declined to comment on the moves."}
