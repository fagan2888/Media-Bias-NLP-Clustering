Others, however, like DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, are apparently not quite ready to admit it.\n\nThe two found themselves at odds on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d on Friday as they battled over whether it truly was a \u201clie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a bad week for the president, let\u2019s be honest here,\u201d Maher began. \u201cWe\u2019re not like them, we don\u2019t live in the bubble. It was a bad week.\u201d\n\nHe also asked his panel whether or not a lie is ever \u201cjustified\u201d if it\u2019s for something good, and then speculated as to whether Obamacare would have even passed if the president had been honest about the impact it would have on private insurance.\n\nWasserman Schultz quickly insisted the president didn\u2019t lie.\n\n\u201cIt was not a lie, let\u2019s just be very clear,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the president and myself and every other Democrat talked about that if you like your health care you can keep it, that was referring to the overwhelming majority of Americans who had health care\u2026and in fact, what the reality of Obamacare is, not only are they able to keep their health care, but it is very likely going to cost less and have better benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people can\u2019t,\u201d Maher shot back. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s be honest. Obamacare says basically if you have a really crappy plan, you can\u2019t keep it. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nHe wondered aloud why people would want a \u201ccrap\u201d plan, but said the truth is that Obamacare is forcing people off of their plans.\n\n\u201cTo me, that is a lie,\u201d Maher added.\n\nMovie director Rob Reiner chimed in and said it doesn\u2019t matter if it was a lie or not and went on a rant about the complexities of Obamacare made worse by Republican opposition.\n\nLater in the discussion, Maher argued the Obamacare lie is Obama\u2019s \u201cno new taxes\u201d moment and a \u201ccampaign pledge that didn\u2019t hold up to the complexities of governing.\u201d\n\nWatch the segment via HBO/Mediaite:\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Far-left comedian Bill Maher has consistently admitted that President Barack Obama \"lied\" when he promised all Americans they would be able to keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare.
