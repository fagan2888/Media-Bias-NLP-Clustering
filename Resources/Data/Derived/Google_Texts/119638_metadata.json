Martin O\u2019Malley pointed out some of the differences during his closing remarks at the Democratic debate on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOn this stage, you didn\u2019t hear anyone denigrate women, you didn\u2019t hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn\u2019t hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, that was the only time the word \u201creligious\u201d was used in the Democratic debate. In addition, the way Democratic candidates spoke about immigration and women was quite different from the way the Republican candidates did.\n\nHere are some comparisons of how different words were used in the debates:\n\nReligion\n\nIn comparison to the one mention of religion by O\u2019Malley in the Democratic debate, during the two GOP debates, religion was brought up seven times, most often in discussing about religious liberty.\n\nGod was mentioned only three times in the Democratic debate, each time by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton while using the phrase \u201cGod-given potential.\u201d During the GOP debates, candidates or moderators said \u201cGod\u201d 24 times \u2014 primarily in the first debate with Fox News when Megyn Kelly asked the candidates a question from a viewer who wanted to know if any of them had \u201creceived a word from God on what they should do and take care of first.\u201d\n\nEquality\n\nDuring the Democratic debate, the words \u201cequality,\u201d \u201cinequality\u201d or \u201cequal\u201d were used 12 times. They were used mainly to discuss income inequality and the fights for racial equality and equal pay for women. In both Republican debates, neither the terms \u201cequality\u201d nor \u201cinequality\u201d were used. The word \u201cequal\u201d was used four times in the phrase \u201cequal protection under the law\u201d or with relation to \u201cunder God.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d was used in the Democratic debate six times, but only once in the GOP debate \u2014 when Kelly asked a question about the group.\n\nImmigration\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats brought up the country\u2019s immigration system, mentioning immigration or immigrants 56 and 24 times, respectively. Republicans, however, used the phrases \u201cillegal immigration\u201d and \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d in nearly half of those mentions.\n\nWhen Democrats specified the legal status of immigrants, they used the word \u201cundocumented.\u201d In both CNN debates, the moderators used the term \u201cundocumented immigrants,\u201d as well.\n\nAbortion\n\nRepublican candidates discussed women more than the Democratic candidates \u2014 mostly in reference to defunding Planned Parenthood. The word \u201cabortion\u201d was used 13 times during the GOP debates, while it was not used at all in the Democratic debate.\n\nHealth care\n\nAll the debates had discussions about health care, but, like immigration, the terminology used differed between the Republican and Democratic candidates. During the Republican debates, \u201cObamacare\u201d was used 19 of the 23 times someone spoke about health care. During the Democratic debate, \u201chealth care\u201d was said 12 times, and \u201cObamacare\u201d was only used twice by one of the moderators, CNN\u2019s Juan Carlos Lopez.\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe Democratic candidates made climate change a major topic in their debate, speaking about it 22 times. In the first GOP debate on Fox News, climate change was not mentioned. In the second debate, it was mentioned 10 times.\n\nTaxes\n\nTaxes were discussed 34 times in the two GOP debates but only mentioned three times during the Democratic debate.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nThe main foreign policy topics discussed in the debates were the Iran nuclear deal and the crisis in Syria involving ISIS.\n\nIran was mentioned 69 times in the GOP debates, mostly to express opposition to the Iran nuclear deal. In the Democratic debate, Iran was mentioned 14 times.\n\nSyria was mentioned 28 times in the the GOP debates and 22 times in the Democratic debate. The word \u201crefugees\u201d was used three times in both CNN debates, but not at all in the first GOP debate on Fox News.\n\nISIS was mentioned 49 times in the GOP debates \u2014 but only four times in the Democratic debate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\n\nPresident Obama was mentioned about the same number of times in each debate. There were a total of 66 mentions of him in the GOP debates, and 32 mentions in the Democratic debate.\n\nOpposing front-runner\n\nDuring the two GOP debates, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was mentioned 62 times. In the Democratic debate, Republican front-runner Donald Trump was only mentioned three times.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The terms used in the two GOP debates and those used in the Democratic debate show some clear differences.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/differences-clear-between-democratic-debate-republican-debates", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The terms used in the two GOP debates and those used in the Democratic debate show some clear differences.", "title": "Word choice highlights differences between Democratic, GOP debates", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/differences-clear-between-democratic-debate-republican-debates", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/fullsizerender4_5.jpg?itok=pH5tfZSj", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/differences-clear-between-democratic-debate-republican-debates", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/fullsizerender4_5.jpg?itok=p5o_xQIk", "title": "Word choice highlights differences between Democratic, GOP debates", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The terms used in the two GOP debates and those used in the Democratic debate show some clear differences."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-16T14:46:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "nicolecbrown", "tags": "debates,democrats,elections,republicans", "title": "Word choice highlights differences between Democratic, GOP debates", "published": 1, "date": "10/16/2015 14:46:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/differences-clear-between-democratic-debate-republican-debates"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "The terms used in the two GOP debates and those used in the Democratic debate show some clear differences.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Elections, Republicans, Debates"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22b6\"", "article_summary": "There were a total of 66 mentions of him in the GOP debates, and 32 mentions in the Democratic debate.\nIn addition, the way Democratic candidates spoke about immigration and women was quite different from the way the Republican candidates did.\nThe word \u201cabortion\u201d was used 13 times during the GOP debates, while it was not used at all in the Democratic debate.\nTaxesTaxes were discussed 34 times in the two GOP debates but only mentioned three times during the Democratic debate.\nMartin O\u2019Malley pointed out some of the differences during his closing remarks at the Democratic debate on Tuesday."}
