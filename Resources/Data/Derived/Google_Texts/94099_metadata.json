People without insurance by tax season will face far steeper penalties, almost double the fee from the previous year, reports The Hill.\n\nOf the 8.3 million sign-ups, about 2.4 million are new to the marketplace \u2014 a figure that is one-third higher than last year\u2019s new total at the same distance from the deadline.\n\nSignificantly, this year\u2019s sign-ups include 2.1 million people under age 35 \u2014 nearly double the number of young people enrolled during the same period last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited in terms of what it means for health security and financial security. We\u2019re excited about the fact that it does mean a younger risk pool, which is generally stronger,\u201d Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced on a conference call with supporters Tuesday.\n\nThe growing diversity of the marketplace will be welcome news to health insurance companies, many of which remain worried that customers are older, and therefore costlier to cover, than they had originally expected.\n\nRead the FULL report at The Hill.\n\n16 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
