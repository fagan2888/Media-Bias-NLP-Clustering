Group Associates reformats after split, acquisition

For nearly 30 years, David Zick ran Bingham Farms-based Group Associates Inc. as an insurance brokerage, technology services and benefit consulting firm with his business partner Kent Grathwohl.



But a growing conflict of interest between brokerage and providing administrative services through information technology led Zick and Grathwohl to conclude they needed to change their business model and focus on one or the other. So, in an amicable split in September 2014, Grathwohl took his clients and left Group Associates and became area vice president with Gallagher Benefit Services Inc. in Bingham Farms.



"It wasn't easy because Kent and I worked together for 25 years," said Zick, president of the company. "It was a painful decision. Kent and I have a lot of respect for each other. It was almost like a divorce on very friendly terms. We continue to share accounts and work together."



Grathwohl said his brokerage work selling life and health policies at Gallagher is similar to his former job at Group Associates.



"We weren't able to deliver enough lives to (fuel) the administrative (technology) engine" at Group Associates because "(outside) brokers were not willing to put business with him," Grathwohl said.



Zick said Group Associates was one of the first benefit companies to take advantage of online information technology in the late 1980s.



"We worked with a lot of carriers, and over the years our services increased and added capability of enrolling employees online," he said. "As time went on, technology became more sophisticated, and we realized we could do far more."



But Zick said the conflict developed between brokerage services and administrative services because other insurance brokers didn't want to do business with Group Associates because they feared "we could replace them as broker" to their clients.
