DENVER (AP) — A new law allowing Colorado cooks to sell homemade pickles is among five dozen new measures that have been signed into law by Gov. John Hickenlooper.

The governor’s office announced the bill signings Friday. They include an expansion of the state Cottage Foods law, which allows home cooks to sell some items without seeking a commercial food license. The law had been limited to mostly homemade breads and jellies. The expansion adds pickled vegetables and fruit empanadas.

Other new laws include an update to Colorado’s medical marijuana regulations, which were due to expire without action from the Legislature.

The governor also signed a law clearing the way for state universities to develop certified hemp seed. Currently growers of the new crop have difficulty acquiring seeds for the newly legal crop.
