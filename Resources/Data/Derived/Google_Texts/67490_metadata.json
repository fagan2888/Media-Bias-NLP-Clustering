They\u2019ve each agreed to participate in the PA Progressive Summit in February.\n\nThe Pa. Progressive Summit will be held February 28 and March 1 at the Harrisburg Hilton, with the debate scheduled for Friday at 6:00pm. Candidates will take questions from progressive leaders in the audience and sponsoring organizations of the event.\n\nHosted by Keystone Progress, an online activist community, the event expects nearly 1,000 attendees at its fifth annual summit.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the impact that our gubernatorial debate will have,\u201d said Eileen Connelly, Chair of the Board of Keystone Progress. \u201cThis is an incredible opportunity for the progressive community to set the agenda for the entire campaign.\u201d\n\nTechnically, this will be the second debate for the Democratic primary candidates, as they were all invited to a debate hosted by a Harrisburg community group back in June. Only Max Myers and John Hanger actually participated. Schwartz was in a voting session in DC, McGinty and McCord declined, though McCord was still undeclared at that point.\n\nDespite the event\u2019s poor candidate attendance, Myers and Hanger didn\u2019t waste the opportunity to chastise their opponents for not participating.\n\nHanger questioned, \u201dIf you are not ready to do this debate why are you ready to run for governor?\u201d\n\nMyers quipped, \u201dThe risk is too high for those who aren\u2019t here.\u201d\n\nThe Progressive Summit debate promises to be better attended, though Jack Wagner and Mike Stack have yet to respond to their invitations.\n\nOctober 10th, 2013 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Governor, Top Stories | 7 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic candidates for governor have agreed to face off at the PA Progressive Summit at the Harrisburg Hilton in February 2014.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/gov-candidates-agree-to-debate-in-february/51933/", "description": "The Democratic candidates for governor have agreed to face off at the PA Progressive Summit at the Harrisburg Hilton in February 2014.", "title": "Gov Candidates Agree to Debate in February"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "governor,2014,election,democratic primary", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced06\"", "article_summary": "The Pa.
