The production tax credit for wind power expired last year, and solar power\u2019s investment tax credit will expire next year without renewal.\n\nWind and solar advocates, and their Democratic and environmental allies, want long-term renewal of their credits. The potential for an oil exports provision could increase the likelihood of a trade-off that includes renewable energy credits.\n\nBefore lawmakers start to formally consider those bills, a subcommittee of the House Natural Resources Committee on Monday will hold a field hearing in Colorado on legislation to boost mining education.\n\nThe measure is one piece of House Republicans\u2019 legislative response to the EPA\u2019s mine waste spill earlier this year in Colorado. It would direct some federal funding toward mining and mineral engineering programs at mining schools.\n\nSenior White House adviser Brian Deese will be the featured guest Wednesday at an event examining the future of climate policy after the United Nations climate talks in Paris, hosted by the New Republic.\n\nThe Wilson Center will host its own event to look at climate change policy after the Paris talks Wednesday. The White House National Security Council\u2019s Paul Bodnar will speak, along with experts and think tank representatives.\n\nRECENT STORIES\n\nNations on cusp of climate pact\n\nhttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262958-nations-on-cusp-of-global-climate-pact\n\nDeal to end oil export ban in sight\n\nhttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262874-deal-to-end-oil-export-ban-in-sight\n\nLawmakers cancel trips to Paris climate talks\n\nhttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262649-lawmakers-cancel-trips-to-paris-climate-talks\n\nCruz blasts \u2018alarmists\u2019 at climate change hearing\n\nhttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262515-cruz-blasts-climate-industrial-complex\n\nKerry says he\u2019s looking to the private sector to solve climate change\n\nhttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262314-kerry-private-sector-is-key-in-climate-fight", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Week ahead: Oil export ban teeters in Congress", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Week ahead: Oil export ban teeters in Congress", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262983-week-ahead-oil-export-ban-teeters-in-congress", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262983-week-ahead-oil-export-ban-teeters-in-congress", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-14T06:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jesse Helfrich", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-14T06:00:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262983-week-ahead-oil-export-ban-teeters-in-congress", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Week ahead: Oil export ban teeters in Congress"}}, "article_summary": "The production tax credit for wind power expired last year, and solar power\u2019s investment tax credit will expire next year without renewal.\nRECENT STORIESNations on cusp of climate pacthttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262958-nations-on-cusp-of-global-climate-pactDeal to end oil export ban in sighthttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262874-deal-to-end-oil-export-ban-in-sightLawmakers cancel trips to Paris climate talkshttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262649-lawmakers-cancel-trips-to-paris-climate-talksCruz blasts \u2018alarmists\u2019 at climate change hearinghttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262515-cruz-blasts-climate-industrial-complexKerry says he\u2019s looking to the private sector to solve climate changehttp://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/262314-kerry-private-sector-is-key-in-climate-fight\nBut in return, Democrats want to renew a tax credit for renewable energy on a long-term basis, or see other green energy measures included.\nMeanwhile, the wind and solar energy sectors are keeping a close eye on the tax extenders bill for incentives for their industries.\nThe potential for an oil exports provision could increase the likelihood of a trade-off that includes renewable energy credits."}
