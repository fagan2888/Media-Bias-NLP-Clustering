I see an American flag, as beautiful as the one flying in front of my house being stomped on and set on fire by these ungrateful criminals who have broken our immigration laws to come here and gain access to the freedom to act in a manner that would result in prison or worse in most countries including the one they have escaped.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailyinterlake.com/members/letter-a-surprise-vote-for-trump/article_83dbed86-1494-11e6-a727-77004c85ef1f.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Daily Inter Lake", "description": "I am sitting at my computer, listening to my playlist of patriotic music.
