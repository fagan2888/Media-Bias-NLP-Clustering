He had just explained to the reporter riding along that he wanted no role in a Trump administration when news arrived of a new poll naming him as the best liked of a list of potential running mates.\n\n\u2018\u2018Who else was on the list?\u2019\u2019 he asked quietly, maintaining his usual inscrutable calm. The most favorably regarded contenders after himself, he was told, were John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and Chris Christie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018Those are all people on our list,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018Well, not you,\u2019\u2019 Candy reminded him sharply.\n\nThat the Trump campaign might want their potential VP picks held close to the vest didn\u2019t seem to occur to Carson. He\u2019s not the type to keep his candid thoughts to himself.\n\nIt\u2019s an attribute typically unbecoming of a \u2018\u2018surrogate,\u2019\u2019 campaign shorthand for the high-profile friend-of-the-candidate assigned to offer up flattering comments and spin away the controversies. Since joining Team Trump, Carson has acknowledged that the mogul wasn\u2019t his top choice and that supporting him was merely \u2018\u2018pragmatic.\u2019\u2019 He\u2019s called into question Trump\u2019s Twitter habits, said he \u2018\u2018has major defects\u2019\u2019 and recently went off-message by suggesting they might consider picking a Democrat for the ticket.\n\nAnd despite all that, or perhaps because of it, he\u2019s apparently earned the trust of Trump, speaking to the candidate a few times a week, making the rounds on television on his behalf, calling up House Speaker Paul Ryan ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting on Capitol Hill and, yes, helping campaign manager Corey Lewandowski come up with a list of possible VP candidates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson says there\u2019s no plan to pull a Dick Cheney and suggest himself. Having already run for president, Carson understands he\u2019s a lightning rod for controversy, and Trump doesn\u2019t need help sparking fires.\n\n\u2018\u2018He\u2019s not interested,\u2019\u2019 said Carson\u2019s business manager and friend Armstrong Williams. \u2018\u2018But miracles can happen, right?\u2019\u2019\n\nWilliams added: \u2018\u2018But I don\u2019t see that miracle happening.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd then: \u2018\u2018But we\u2019ve seen stranger things, right?\u2019\u2019\n\nYes, yes we have. Not the least of which has been watching Carson say things that would get any other surrogate benched, only to be elevated within the campaign. He\u2019s what some commentators have called \u2018\u2018the worst surrogate ever.\u2019\u2019 Which raises the question: Is Carson the best surrogate ever?\n\nNo, he\u2019s not.\n\nOr is he?\n\n---\n\nNot long ago, Donald Trump stood on a stage in front of thousands of Iowans accusing Carson of fabricating parts of his life story, calling him \u201cpathological\u2019\u2019 and comparing him to a child molester. No big deal, Carson says today. He didn\u2019t take it personally.\n\n\u2018\u2018It just means he\u2019s like a typical politician,\u2019\u2019 Carson said; at the time, he noted, he was creeping up on Trump in the polls. \u2018\u2018Other politicians might not be as colorful, but they do the same things.\u2019\u2019\n\nCarson puts greater weight on another moment he shared with Trump. It was during the ABC debate in February, when Carson, waiting in the wings to be introduced, didn\u2019t hear his name come through the loudspeaker. He remained standing offstage, hands clasped. Cruz, Rubio and Bush all breezed past him to take their spots at the lecterns, but when Trump was called, he, too, hesitated in the wings.\n\nTo viewers at home, they looked like a pair of middle school drama students who had both missed their cue. But Carson saw Trump\u2019s pause as a deliberate gesture to ease his awkwardness.\n\n\u2018\u2018That showed the kind of person that he is, to stand by me even though it did nothing for him personally,\u2019\u2019 Carson said.\n\n\u2018\u2018They stood together that day like brothers,\u2019\u2019 said Williams, one of Carson\u2019s closest confidants. \u2018\u2018That was a very important moment.\u2019\u2019\n\nShortly after dropping out of the race, Carson headed to Mar-a-Lago to have breakfast with Trump. He hadn\u2019t endorsed anyone yet but was leaning toward giving his support to the reality star who cared as little about political correctness - or, some would say, polite discourse - as he did. They sat in an ornate room eating fruit and talking about, as Carson might put it, the fruit salad of each other\u2019s lives.\n\n\u2018\u2018I wanted to make sure we were on the same page, and we were,\u2019\u2019 Carson said. In mid-March, he endorsed. He stumbled right out of the gate, telling the conservative website Newsmax that Trump wasn\u2019t his first pick and that he had been promised some sort of advisory role in the administration.\n\nOr was it a stumble?\n\n\u2018\u2018No one is going to believe him if he came out and said Trump is the perfect candidate, because he isn\u2019t the perfect candidate,\u2019\u2019 explained Deana Bass, Carson\u2019s former spokeswoman. \u2018\u2018If he did that, Dr. Carson would lose the respect he\u2019s earned for not telling the truth as he sees it.\u2019\u2019\n\nGood doctors don\u2019t sugarcoat bad situations. If a patient requires an unpleasant but necessary procedure - say, a spinal tap or an enema - any physician worth his scrubs will warn that it\u2019s going to be rough, not gonna lie, but it\u2019s the best path forward. In other words, what critics see as Carson\u2019s gaffes are really just part of his bedside manner: Look, this candidate comes with some unpleasant side effects - but if he couldn\u2019t heal the country, I wouldn\u2019t be prescribing him.\n\n\u2018\u2018Would I and everyone always prefer someone who is completely consistent 100 percent of that time? Yes,\u2019\u2019 Carson said. \u2018\u2018But who is that? Who is that person?\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump may have changed positions on a number of issues, but on the \u2018\u2018spectrum of deceit\u2019\u2019 Carson sees Hillary Clinton as being much worse.\n\n\u2018\u2018That\u2019s why I made it very clear that this is a pragmatic choice,\u2019\u2019 he said: Trump, he believes, is the Republican who has a chance of winning. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s sort of like: Would you rather have a cut on your finger or have both your legs cut off?\u2019\u2019\n\nVote Trump: Doctors agree, he\u2019s better than having your legs chopped off.\n\n\u2018\u2018The left-wing media loves to say I\u2019m a terrible surrogate, but I pay so little attention to it,\u2019\u2019 Carson said. \u2018\u2018If I said their mother was a good person, they\u2019d find something terrible to say about it.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut it\u2019s not just people on the left who think the doctor should surgically remove his foot from his mouth.\n\n\u2018\u2018If I were to grade him, I\u2019d give him a B-minus,\u2019\u2019 said Doug Watts, Carson\u2019s former communications director. \u2018\u2018He wings it a little bit too much.\u2019\u2019 Watts, who is now working for a new pro-Trump super PAC, the Committee for American Sovereignty, took particular issue with Carson saying they might pick a Democrat as a vice president.\n\n\u2018\u2018That wasn\u2019t helpful,\u2019\u2019 said Watts, who thinks Trump has already had enough trouble proving he\u2019s a conservative. \u2018\u2018He would say it\u2019s just him not being a politician, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s him not being mentally prepared.\u2019\u2019\n\nNot so fast, Doug, don\u2019t put words in Ben\u2019s mouth. Let\u2019s let him speak for himself.\n\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not a politician, and I will never be a politician,\u2019\u2019 Carson said when asked about his propensity to go off script.\n\nIt\u2019s not a lack of preparation, he says, so much as a matter of being true to himself. Yes, he said that Trump has defects, because all people have defects. Sure, he said he\u2019d consider a Democrat, if they could find one that stood strong on all parts of the Constitution, including the Second Amendment. And of course there will be times he disagrees with the candidate he is standing behind. \u2018\u2018If two people agree all the time,\u2019\u2019 Carson said, \u2018\u2018then one of those people isn\u2019t necessary.\u2019\u2019\n\n---\n\nThe Town Car dropped them off at the TV station, where Ben and Candy retreated to a conference room to wait. They idly watched an episode of \u2018\u2018Mike and Molly\u2019\u2019 while leaving a hospitality plate of sugar cookies untouched.\n\n\u2018\u2018Is that Paul Blart the mall cop?\u2019\u2019 Candy asked.\n\n\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u2019 said a staffer with Sinclair Broadcast Group, the company hosting the evening\u2019s event, an hour-long conversation in front of a small studio audience.\n\nNot much for sitcoms, Ben Carson turned to Greg Massoni, a Sinclair executive, and began talking Trump.\n\n\u2018\u2018Part of the problem is this whole my-way-or-the-highway mentality that makes people your enemy,\u2019\u2019 said Carson, who once claimed Obamacare was the worst thing to happen to the country since slavery. \u2018\u2018I would strongly suggest to Donald Trump, and he will do this, that even when you have the advantage, you should be respectful of the other side.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018You promise that he\u2019s going to do that?\u2019\u2019 Massoni asked with a chuckle.\n\n\u2018\u2018He can\u2019t do it now because now he\u2019s got to win,\u2019\u2019 Carson said, leaning back in his chair and tapping his hands together. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a difficult line to walk. You don\u2019t want to turn off all the people who supported you because you are like that, but you don\u2019t want to get so far out that other people will never support you.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018You wouldn\u2019t allow your 12-year-old to act that way,\u2019\u2019 Massoni said.\n\n\u2018\u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 said Carson, who for a while had a habit of comparing the trajectory of this nation to Nazi Germany. \u2018\u2018But by the same token, look at the people like me or Mike Huckabee - nice, decent, caring and respectful of others. Where does that get people? Not very far.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe \u2018\u2018Mike and Molly\u2019\u2019 studio audience laughed and clapped. The credits rolled, and then \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory\u2019\u2019 was beginning.\n\nCarson stood up and flipped through the channels, stopping on a news program that happened to be talking about him. Although it wasn\u2019t technically another sitcom, it sure feels like it sometimes.\n\ncarson\n\n_____\n\nKeywords: ben carson, donald trump, surrogate, gaffe, best surrogate, worst surrogate", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3720926668", "eomportal-id": 284612, "description": "Carson is not the type to keep his candid thoughts to himself.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Carson is not the type to keep his candid thoughts to himself.", "title": "Is Ben Carson the worst or the best surrogate of all time? - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/05/15/ben-carson-worst-best-surrogate-all-time/bX85hbAgA2vxv1FYg6dpaL/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/05/05/BostonGlobe.com/Politics/Images/carson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "ben carson, Donald J Trump, Marco  Rubio, Sarah  Palin, Paul  Ryan, Armstrong  Williams, Hillary Rodham  Clinton, Mike  Huckabee, Dick  Cheney,Washington Post", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 07:28:46 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "ben carson, Donald J Trump, Marco  Rubio, Sarah  Palin, Paul  Ryan, Armstrong  Williams, Hillary Rodham  Clinton, Mike  Huckabee, Dick  Cheney,Washington Post, Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc, Twitter, Democratic Party, House of Representatives, Senate,House of Representatives, ABC Inc, Sinclair Broadcast Group Incorporated,Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc|SBGI|NASDAQ, Sinclair Broadcast Group Incorporated|SBGI|NASDAQ", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "11c86f9e-1ae3-11e6-8043-54c676f329e2"}, "article_summary": "carson_____Keywords: ben carson, donald trump, surrogate, gaffe, best surrogate, worst surrogate\nHe\u2019s what some commentators have called \u2018\u2018the worst surrogate ever.\u2019\u2019 Which raises the question: Is Carson the best surrogate ever?\nNot the least of which has been watching Carson say things that would get any other surrogate benched, only to be elevated within the campaign.\nYes,\u2019\u2019 Carson said.\n\u2018\u2018The left-wing media loves to say I\u2019m a terrible surrogate, but I pay so little attention to it,\u2019\u2019 Carson said."}
