Bush, 91, the oldest living president, fell at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine on Wednesday and fractured his vertebrae, said the family’s spokesman, Jim McGrath.

On Saturday, McGrath said on Twitter that Bush was in “good spirits” and his doctors were “very pleased with his progress.”

The type of fracture that Bush sustained can take three to four months to heal, his physician, Dr. William D’Angelo, said in a statement released by Bush’s office.

Bush’s office said Thursday that “the president never lost consciousness, and the injury he sustained neither impinged on his spine nor resulted in any neurological deficits.”

According to the statement, Bush will not need surgery but will be in a neck brace for “at least a couple of months.”

Bush was treated at Portland’s Maine Medical Center, where a children’s hospital is named for his wife, according to the Associated Press.
