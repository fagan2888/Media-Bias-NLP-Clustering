It was the inaugural state football title for the school, which opened in 1959.\n\n\u201cThese boys, their heart, they just played like champions and that\u2019s why they are champions,\u201d East coach David Ramirez said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than I could ever imagine (to win state). To know where we started from, and we won this thing. It is a great feeling.\u201d\n\nPueblo East (11-3) made an improbable run to the state championship after starting the season 3-3. Rifle (12-2) was trying to win its fourth state title.\n\nThe game was in limbo at the start of the fourth quarter. In a 14-14 game, Rifle\u2019s defense stopped Pueblo East quarterback Danny Martin just short of the end zone on fourth-and-goal.\n\nOn the next play, Pueblo East linebacker Damon Sabbagh hit left-handed Rifle quarterback Layton Stutsman as he was attempting to pass out of his own end zone. Stutsman\u2019s pass was caught by offensive lineman Gage Johnston, who was tackled by a mob of Pueblo East defenders for a safety. That gave the Eagles a 16-14 advantage with 10:25 left.\n\n\u201cI was trying to get the ball out, and it got knocked out as I was throwing,\u201d Stutsman said. \u201cThat was my fault. I should have gotten the ball out sooner, knowing I was in the end zone.\u201d\n\nPueblo East defensive end Josh Tellez said the safety was just the jolt the Eagles needed.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, we thought we needed to get a safety to turn things around,\u201d Tellez said. \u201cI hit him (Stutsman) at the legs, and Damon got him up top. It was a big play and got us going.\u201d\n\nOn East\u2019s ensuing possession, Bryson Torres broke free on the first play for an 80-yard touchdown run over the right side.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWe knew we just had to keep pounding and win the game.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles put the game all but out of reach when Martin scored on a 22-yard run for a 30-14 lead with 8:33 remaining.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible to win state,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMartin paced East with 192 yards rushing and two touchdowns, and he tossed an 8-yard scoring pass to Bruno DeRose.\n\nTorres added 156 yards rushing, and East\u2019s defense held Rifle to 196 yards of total offense, 79 in the second half.\n\nRifle7070\u201414Pueblo East07716\u201430\n\nR \u2014 Leyba 37 pass from Stutsman (Sandoval kick).
