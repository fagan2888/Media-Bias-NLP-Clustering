Essential California will return on Monday.\n\nHere's what else is happening in the Golden State:\n\nTightening UC admissions: Fewer Californians were accepted to UC schools, while the number of offers to foreign students increased, according to the latest statistics. This highlights tensions within the university system. Out-of-state students pay more in tuition but leave fewer spots for native Californians. The campuses in Irvine and San Diego were the most aggressive in seeking students from outside the Golden State.

City Council\u2019s new ordinance that would make it easier to tear down homeless encampments.

That\u2019s the central question in a case brought by two unpaid interns against Fox Searchlight Pictures. An appeals judge just ruled in the studio\u2019s favor, but the case has resonated. It prompted a wave of lawsuits from other unpaid interns and prompted some studios to turn internships into paid positions. Los Angeles Times\n\nTicket fix: When an Orange County woman got a DUI, she searched Craigslist for an attorney who could take the case.
