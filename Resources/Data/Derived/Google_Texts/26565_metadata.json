Around 300 have signed up to work for the campaign.\n\nThe group has a three-year plan: Throughout 2016 they will continue recruiting organizers and selecting a set of more than 400 candidates \u2014 from across the political spectrum, apparently \u2014 who conform to the Sanders brand of political integrity, and by January 2017 they\u2019ll begin a hard push to the midterm elections in November 2018.\n\nAlthough electing an entirely new Congress seems like a stretch, the massive mobilization we\u2019ve seen of previously disenganged primary voters in 2016 makes just about anything seem feasible, at least on paper.\n\nBrand New Congress doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to want to swap out everyone on Capitol Hill \u2014 just those they deem part of the \u201cdo nothing\u201d problem that has pushed so many voters to the fringes of their respective parties.\n\nA statement on the group\u2019s website reads, \u201cAmerica needs an honest, accountable Congress to enact Bernie\u2019s program. But trying to win each Congressional seat one-by-one is impossible. So let\u2019s run one campaign to replace Congress all at once\u2026that whips up the same enthusiasm, volunteerism and money as Bernie\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nThe group is pinning most of its hopes on convincing inexperienced political observers to throw their hats into the ring.\n\nIn an interview with The Attitude, a progressive talk show out of New Hampshire, Brand New Congress organizer Stacie Hopkins said \u201c[political] experience is good to have, but it\u2019s not always necessary to have that experience to be a good representative of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope to be able to provide training to people who have natural leadership qualities,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cWe want to encourage people who may not have thought of running for public office, but who have the qualities that would make them conducive to being good representatives.\u201d Hopkins noted that some congresspeople \u201cmay have gotten into [politics] not to serve the public, but for ego and personal ambitions, for the sake of having power.\u201d\n\nThe group also plans on taking some of the fundraising pressure off of its newly-minted politicians, an awkward conflict with Sanders\u2019s pledge not to accept money from outside groups. It\u2019s a similar position to Harvard Law School professor \u2014 and one-time Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 Lawrence Lessig\u2019s Mayday PAC, a super PAC meant to support candidates in favor of campaign finance reform.\n\nBrand New Congress hasn\u2019t shied away from its commitment to recruit new candidates from both parties. In an interview with the Huffington Post, organizer Zack Exley said, \u201cWe want a supermajority in Congress that is fighting for jobs, criminal justice reform and the environment. Most Americans actually want that, and I think we get it by running Dems in blue areas, Republicans in deep red areas, and by running independents wherever we didn\u2019t defeat incumbents.\u201d\n\nGiven the current \u2014 and longstanding \u2013 polarity of our political parties, it\u2019s easy to disregard the potential for successfully finding Democrats and Republicans to run under the same umbrella group. According to a representative from the PAC, they plan on endorsing Republican candidates who back progressive social issues like LGBT and women\u2019s rights \u2014 and those Republicans are out there, in and around the pro-privacy, live and let live libertarian camp.\n\nIf the real hope of Brand New Congress is to break up congressional gridlock and create an environment where all the issues can be contested on a level playing field, then this might be worth watching. It may be a long shot, but what about Bernie Sanders\u2019s insurgent campaign for president isn\u2019t?\n\nPhoto: Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks during a rally at Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington March 25, 2016.
