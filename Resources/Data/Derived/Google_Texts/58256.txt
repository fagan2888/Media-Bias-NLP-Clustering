CEO Michael Israel said the reimbursements are too low to cover the costs of the services it offers as a teaching hospital.

The Journal News reported that patients and lawmakers are expressing outrage.

Westchester Medical Center used to be a public hospital. After years of red ink, it became a public benefit corporation 15 years ago.

It still uses public land and buildings, and its employees are part of the state pension system.

Montefiore, which has a teaching hospital in the Bronx, is accepting six out of the seven exchange plans available in Westchester County.

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is accepting two plans available in Westchester and Rockland.
