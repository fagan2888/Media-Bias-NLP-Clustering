But hear me out...\n\nToday's pharmacy departments have millions of dollars of drug products in inventory, plus several professional level staff members (including pharmacists, technicians, buyers and analysts).\n\nBelieve it or not, the product costs far outweigh the labor costs. But as you can imagine in any industry, when looking to reduce costs, labor is often the first thing to get cut. Especially in the mind of an executive who may be unfamiliar with the day-to-day workings of a pharmacy department.\n\nAs a pharmacist, I've seen it happen time and again. So how can we as pharmacists explain to our healthcare leaders that the use of clinical pharmacists in both the inpatient and outpatient settings is the most efficient way to control the costs of these ever-increasing drug products?\n\nHere are 5 ways clinical pharmacists help cut\n\n1. Ensure the most appropriate product is used\n\nClinical pharmacists can ensure that the most appropriate product is used for the diagnosis being treated, thus avoiding the waste of an inappropriate product with failed outcomes.\n\n2. Prevent waste and harm\n\nThey can also prevent waste and harm by avoiding products that have not been approved for formulary inclusion at their place of practice. They continually review the latest guidelines and protocols that have been established by experts in this field.\n\n3. Reduce medication misadventures\n\nClinical pharmacists have successfully targeted reducing medication misadventures or adverse drug events to help reduce lengths of stay.\n\n4. Manage transition of care\n\nThey ensure the patient does not experience any gaps in medication therapy by helping manage the transition to the next level of care through medication reconciliation.\n\n5. Manage medications\n\nAnd in the outpatient setting, pharmacists who help manage the patient's medications, including access and financial assistance, are key in avoiding readmissions.\n\nBottom line: pharmacists are clinical experts and patient advocates.\n\nThey are knowledgeable in regulatory matters, and state and federal laws concerning medications. They, along with other members of the care team, are critical to the long-term success of healthcare organizations and improved patient outcomes. Healthcare leaders who fail to recognize them as partners in the future are not giving them full credit.\n\nPartnerships between the clinical teams and the executives are the best approach to manage drug costs. If clinical positions are removed as an attempt to reduce costs, it's common to see drug costs rise due to the lack of oversight by the trained eye of the pharmacist. It takes time, talent and a continued focus on medication usage to manage these very expensive products. Cutting labor is not the answer. Increasing the right kind of labor may be just the answer.\n\nWhat do you think? How have you made change happen in your pharmacy department?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/5-ways-cut-costs-hiring-more-pharmacy-staff", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Today's pharmacy departments have millions of dollars of drug products in inventory, plus several professional level staff members, including pharmacists, technicians, buyers and analysts.", "title": "5 ways to cut costs by hiring more pharmacy staff"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "Today's pharmacy departments have millions of dollars of drug products in inventory, plus several professional level staff members, including pharmacists, technicians, buyers and analysts.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "5 ways to cut costs by hiring more pharmacy staff"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It seems counterintuitive, I know.
