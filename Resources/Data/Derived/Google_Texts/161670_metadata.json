Attack ads coming my way.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy opponent just bought time on TV and that means I need your help now more than ever,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAsked whether it\u2019s an attack ad, Sasse\u2019s campaign manager, Tyler Grassmeyer, said, \u201cBen has crisscrossed Nebraska, running his campaign the Nebraska way, with a positive conservative message. Everywhere Ben goes, his anti-Obamacare, anti-establishment message is resonating with Nebraska voters. Ben will be Nebraska\u2019s anti-Obamacare warrior in the Senate and we are happy to have Fred Davis, one of the most creative ad guys in the business, helping us deliver Ben\u2019s message \u2014 in only a way Fred Davis can.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll take that as a \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWell-known California media consultant Fred Davis , who helped produce the ad, is known for his unorthodox TV ads such as Christine O\u2019Donnell\u2019s \u201cI am not a witch\u2026 I\u2019m you\u201d ad. Davis also helped produce a racially charged Super Bowl TV ad last year for a Michigan Republican.\n\nOsborn took the opportunity to ding Sasse again for getting the support of outside groups.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, money can make or break an election \u2013 and with special interest groups in D.C. trying to influence our election here in Nebraska, your support is more crucial than ever,\u201d Osborn\u2019s email said.\n\nA greater percentage of Osborn\u2019s campaign cash has come from outside Nebraska than Sasse\u2019s \u2014 just over half of Sasse\u2019s money came from Nebraskans, compared to 30 percent for Osborn \u2014 but Osborn\u2019s campaign has derided Sasse for playing the inside Washington game by snagging several endorsements from outside groups. Sasse has been endorsed by the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund, while Osborn has been endorsed by the Tea Party-affiliated FreedomWorks.\n\nThe other Republican candidates are Omaha banker Sid Dinsdale and Omaha attorney Bart McLeay. Independent cattle rancher and restaurant entrepreneur Jim Jenkins of Callaway is also running.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
