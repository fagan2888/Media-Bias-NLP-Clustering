They just might, if a dispute involving one of California\u2019s major insurers, Blue Shield of California, is any indication.\n\nThe nonprofit insurer\u2019s decision to purchase a luxury box at the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 new facility, Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., has drawn the wrath of at least one consumer group.\n\nConsumer Watchdog is calling on California Attorney General Kamala Harris to examine Blue Shield\u2019s purchase, which the consumer group estimates will cost anywhere between $2.5 million and $8 million. It\u2019s part of a broader plan by the organization to pass Proposition 45, a ballot initiative that would give insurance regulators the power to block excessive rate increases.\n\nOfficials from Harris\u2019s office declined to comment on the issue and wouldn\u2019t say whether they are looking into the matter.\n\nFor its part, the insurer says the luxury box is geared toward customers.\n\n\u201cThe purchase of the box and season tickets at Levi\u2019s Stadium was a business decision that allows us to host customer events. The box is not available to senior executives for personal use,\u201d the insurer said in a prepared statement.\n\nBut Consumer Watchdog says Blue Shield has benefited from what it calls \u201cgenerous\u201d tax breaks that it receives as a nonprofit entity. Blue Shield also has a reserve of nearly $3.7 billion that far exceeds the minimum requirement under state law. For those reasons, the group is asking Harris to impose a charitable trust on Blue Shield\u2019s assets.\n\nThe issue was noted in a San Francisco Chronicle column last week. The 49ers will begin their first season in the new facility on Sept. 7. It\u2019s located roughly 45 minutes from the football team\u2019s old home at Candlestick Park.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\n\n\nMore must-reads from MarketWatch:\n\nPayPal spinoff would slice eBay in half\n\nWhat not to buy over Labor Day weekend", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-08-28T15:29:42-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "How health insurers spend their cash may come under scrutiny if a case involving Blue Shield of California is any indication.", "title": "Luxury-box purchase inspires calls for scrutiny of insurer\u2019s expenses", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/28/luxury-box-purchase-inspires-calls-for-more-scrutiny-of-insurers-expenses/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT056_levis__MG_20140828144852.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Blue Shield of California,health care,Health insurer,luxury boxes", "article.headline": "Luxury-box purchase inspires calls for scrutiny of insurer\u2019s expenses", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "How health insurers spend their cash may come under scrutiny if a case involving Blue Shield of California is any indication.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "Blue Shield of California,health care,Health insurer,luxury boxes", "article.published": "2014-08-28T15:29:42-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/28/luxury-box-purchase-inspires-calls-for-more-scrutiny-of-insurers-expenses/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "How health insurers spend their cash may come under scrutiny if a case involving Blue Shield of California is any indication.", "title": "Luxury-box purchase inspires calls for scrutiny of insurer\u2019s expenses", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/28/luxury-box-purchase-inspires-calls-for-more-scrutiny-of-insurers-expenses/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT056_levis__MG_20140828144852.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-3033", "article.updated": "2014-08-29T02:42:02-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd971d\"", "article_summary": "They just might, if a dispute involving one of California\u2019s major insurers, Blue Shield of California, is any indication.\nBlue Shield also has a reserve of nearly $3.7 billion that far exceeds the minimum requirement under state law.\nBut Consumer Watchdog says Blue Shield has benefited from what it calls \u201cgenerous\u201d tax breaks that it receives as a nonprofit entity.\n\u201cThe purchase of the box and season tickets at Levi\u2019s Stadium was a business decision that allows us to host customer events.\nFor its part, the insurer says the luxury box is geared toward customers."}
