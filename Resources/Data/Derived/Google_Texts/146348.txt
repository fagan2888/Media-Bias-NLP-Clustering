Justin Morneau peered through the batting cage at Coors Field on Friday like he was just another player. And that was a huge relief.

The Rockies’ veteran first baseman, who still hasn’t played this summer because of a concussion and neck injury, hit batting practice on the field for the first time since he went on the disabled list May 14.

“It’s nice to see the ball travel and be out with the boys,” Morneau said. “It feels like another step in the process.”

Morneau vowed again that his goal remains to return to the Rockies this season. And he hinted that he’s looking for a break in his rehab soon.

“I’m going through a regular routine this homestand. I’ll see how it feels, then we’ll see (what’s next),” he said. “I wouldn’t be out here if I didn’t think (I could return). That’s the point.”

Morneau, 34, suffered whiplash and a concussion after diving for a ball May 13 in Anaheim against the Angels. He also missed significant time in 2010 and 2011 with concussions.

The Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season.

“It’s a big step,” Colorado manager Walt Weiss said of Morneau’s batting practice. “He’s been building up to this.”

Morneau has been hitting off a tee and against pitching in an indoor cage at Coors Field. But he’s not traveling with the team. After winning the National League batting title last season, Morneau said he’s been able to find his swing, but hurdles remain on his comeback.

“I’m sure it’ll be like the first day of spring training where it seems like everybody is throwing 120 mph,” he said. “Once we get back to that point, hopefully I’ll have seen some guys in the minors. That’s the goal I’m working toward right now.”
