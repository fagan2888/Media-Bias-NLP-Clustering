Using the accounts, families can spend their tax dollars on private school or university tuition, textbooks, tutoring, transportation and other educational needs. More than 90 percent of Nevada students will be eligible for the accounts. The program \"set the standard of Milton's vision of school choice,\" a spokeswoman from the Friedman Foundation told the Examiner.\n\nDavid also spoke about what the perfect form of school choice would look like. \"I think the ideal version is one in which any child can get a voucher for the average amount spent in the public schools, creating direct competition between private and governmental schools. Any voucher system is going to have some government involvement in determining what counts as a school. My own view is that the least damaging form for that is some outcome measure, such as performance on standardized tests, where a school qualifies to accept vouchers if it does as well as (say) the 30th percentile of public schools.\"\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

David countered those concerns, saying, \"The real question is what parents want. If parents care more about status symbols than education, some of the money will go to status symbols \u2014 polished marble buildings and the like. But I suspect most parents will care more about what sort of education their children get.\"\n\nDavid predicts that vouchers may cause tuition to rise at some elite private schools, but that new private schools would open and be more affordable. \"Vouchers might raise the cost of tuition at elite private schools, which have some degree of market power due to their reputation,\" he said. \"But although a lot of people think of private schools in those terms, they are a small part of the market. If anything, I would expect a voucher system, by creating a large market for private schools at about the expenditure level of the public schools, to lower costs due to economies of scale, specialized firms producing inputs to such schools, and the like.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "School choice supporters marked the 103rd birthday of Nobel laureate Milton Friedman Friday, celebrating the legacy of the the father of school choice.
