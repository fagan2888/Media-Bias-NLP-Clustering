On that date, the provider will no longer accept premium payments from third parties, including a federal programs designed to provide financial assistance to low-income individuals living with AIDS and HIV.\n\nThe suit also names Louisiana Health Cooperative Inc. and Vantage Health Plan as defendants. Louisiana Health Cooperative, Inc. has said it plans to follow BCBS's lead and stop accepting payments from third parties; Vantage Health Plan has stated it will take the new policy under advisement.\n\nThe suit focuses specifically on HIV and AIDS sufferers who rely on assistance from the Ryan White AIDS/HIV Program to cover their monthly health insurance premiums. Under the new policy, those individuals will either be forced to pay out of pocket, or relinquish their policies.\n\nLouisiana has the second-highest rate of HIV and AIDS infection in the United States, according to a December 2013 report by Human Rights Watch.\n\nJohn East, a 30-year BCBS policyholder living with HIV, is the suit's named plaintiff. East is a U.S. Marine veteran living with HIV who has worked in the medical industry for 30 years. In 2009, East, who is low-income, sought assistance from the Ryan White AIDS/HIV Program when his insurance premiums became unaffordable. Today, his monthly premium payments are $1,306. East is one of at least 400 people living with HIV and AIDS in Louisiana who rely on Ryan White subsidies to pay their insurance bills.\n\n\"We must have our medications to maintain our health and continue to be productive citizens,\" East said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. \"No one should be made to choose between life-saving medications and keeping a roof over our head and food on the table. It should not matter where the payments come from, and it is unconscionable, despicable and a humanitarian atrocity that Blue Cross and other insurance companies are dumping policyholders with HIV.\"\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield said in a written statement that the company is not discontinuing coverage for any policyholder, and that the new policy is designed to ward off fraud in an environment where, in light of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, more people than ever are purchasing health insurance.\n\n\"Because we are offering the majority of the Marketplace products in Louisiana, we also feel a great responsibility to maintain the integrity of the ACA and ensure that all individuals are free to choose the health plans that are best for them and their families, free of influence or manipulation, without being steered or manipulated by people or organizations trying to take advantage of their situations for their own personal gain,\" the statement read. \"We developed this policy as a safeguard against this type of patient steering and other fraudulent activity.\"\n\nThe insurance company said it developed the new policy based on a November recommendation from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that administers the two programs, that insurance companies stop accepting third-party payments to diminish the risk of fraud. But last week, CMS changed its stance on payments from the Ryan White Program. Still, Blue Cross Blue Shield remains steadfast in its decision, though emphasized in a news release that the company will not terminate any existing policies, and that the change in how payments are accepted will affect \"very few of our individual members,\" and that those members \"are not all Ryan White clients.\"\n\nBut Lambda Legal Director of Constitutional Litigation Susan Sommer said the new policy undermines one of the cornerstones of the Affordable Care Act, which bars health insurance providers from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. Sommer says the policy is discriminatory, and designed to \"freeze out\" those suffering with HIV and AIDS.\n\n\"Blue Cross being the leader, they are trying to deter people with HIV from being on their insurance rolls,\" Sommer said. \"Lower income people rely on Ryan White subsidies, and if they can't use those subsidies, they simply can't afford health insurance. This is a tactic to freeze large numbers of people living with HIV out of health insurance, and they will have no alternatives. These insurance companies are creating a health care crisis in Louisiana.\"\n\nSeveral attorneys have joined Sommer, Scott A. Schoettes and Kenneth D. Upton of Lambda Legal in the suit, including Amanda Phillips and Anthony Biagioli of Ropes and Gray LLP, and Harry Rosenberg of Phelps Dunbar LLP.\n\nA spokesperson for Louisiana Health Cooperative did not immediately return a call for comment. A spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana could not be reached for comment after the suit was filed.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Juliet Linderman, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "federal court, health care, new orleans, new orleans courts, news", "title": "LGBT rights group sues three insurance companies over new payment policy on HIV treatments", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "A national legal and advocacy organization is suing Louisiana's largest health insurance provider and two other companies over a new payment policy of no longer accepting payments from a federal program that helps HIV and AIDS patients.Lambda Legal, a civil...", "title": "LGBT rights group sues three insurance companies over new payment policy on HIV treatments", "url": "http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2014/02/legal_organization_sues_three.html", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/crime_impact/photo/14323699-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A national legal and advocacy organization is suing Louisiana's largest health insurance provider and two other companies over a new payment policy of no longer accepting payments from a federal program that helps HIV and AIDS patients.Lambda Legal, a civil...", "title": "LGBT rights group sues three insurance companies over new payment policy on HIV treatments", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/crime_impact/photo/14323699-standard.jpg", "creator": "@JulietLinderman", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, February 20, 2014,  7:46 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, February 20, 2014,  6:43 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "A national legal and advocacy organization is suing Louisiana's largest health insurance provider and two other companies over a new payment policy of no longer accepting payments from a federal program that helps HIV and AIDS patients.
