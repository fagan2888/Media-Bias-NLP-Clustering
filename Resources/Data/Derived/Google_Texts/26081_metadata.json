Paul has got the right idea when he says his party must \u201cevolve, adapt or die\u201d (although I think the first two are virtually the same thing). Katie Glueck of Politico wrote that \u201cThe Kentucky senator drew a largely friendly reception at the University of California-Berkeley as he skewered the intelligence community.\u201d\n\nSen. Paul spoke of \u201cdystopian nightmares\u201d and added that \u201cyour rights, especially your right to privacy, are under assault.\u201d Paul also said he perceives \u201cfear of an intelligence community that\u2019s drunk with power, unrepentant and uninclined to relinquish power.\u201d\n\nVirtually all of the other politicians taking that stand come from the left side of the political spectrum. They include figures like independent socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall. Rand Paul is not like these other defenders of civil liberties.\n\nRand Paul, like his father, prefers to package his fairly old-school brand of economic conservatism under the trendier name of \u201clibertarianism.\u201d That\u2019s not just a labeling change. It also means Paul has paired his retrograde economic ideas with a very outspoken stance against militarism and the espionage state. It\u2019s a mixture that Paul hopes can make inroads with groups that are not traditionally Republican voters.\n\nPaul\u2019s play for millennials was almost inevitable. As a recent Pew study reported, that generation\u2019s disaffection with the two-party system appears to be at record levels. Fifty percent of millennials polled said that they do not associate themselves with either party, which is the highest percentage recorded thus far. It\u2019s also a 10 point jump from their equivalent age group\u2019s level of political affiliation only seven years ago.\n\nBut Rand Paul gravely misunderstands the nature of that political disaffection. Yes, millennials feel alienated toward political and other institutions. They have a right to feel that way. As Joshua Holland says, millennials didn\u2019t abandon these institutions. The institutions abandoned them.\n\nBut Rand Paul and libertarianism are not the answer. His economic strategy can be summed up in a quota used for one of his bills: \u201cremove the shackles of big government by reducing taxes, regulations, and burdensome union work requirements.\u201d\n\nIn other words, more of the same conservative philosophy that got us in this mess in the first place. Here are 10 reasons why millennials should be extremely wary of the senator from Kentucky.\n\n1. His philosophy of deregulation created your jobs problem.\n\nRand Paul loved to preach the gospel of deregulation. He went so far as to proclaim that Obama was putting his \u201cboot heel\u201d on the neck of\u2014get this\u2014British Petroleum. Why? Because BP was being asked to bear part of the cost for the oil spill it created.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Rand Paul believes \u201cregulation\u201d is evil, even when it\u2019s only asking a reckless private corporation to clean up its own messes.\n\nWall Street deregulation crashed the economy in 2008. As a result, the millennial generation is entering the job market at the worst time in modern history. Millennials are facing record levels of unemployment and under-employment. What\u2019s Rand Paul\u2019s solution? More of the same.\n\n2. He doesn\u2019t believe in jobs programs.\n\nThose of us who are fighting for jobs programs and infrastructure investment\u2014two things that would help the millennial generation significantly\u2014have a fierce opponent in Rand Paul. Paul believes government spending is inherently bad, and tax cuts are inherently good. There are jobs proposals that target millennials for assistance. Rand Paul is against them.\n\n3. He thinks \u201ctax cuts\u201d create jobs.\n\nThere\u2019s a simple answer to that, once we remember that the wealthy and corporations are paying lower taxes than at any time in modern history.\n\nSo where are the jobs?\n\nRand Paul\u2019s solution is to eliminate the income tax altogether. That would be a red letter day for billionaires, millionaires and corporations. It would spell the end of vital services for the rest of us, in everything from public health to military defense.\n\nCreate jobs? Not so much.\n\n4. Those \u201cburdensome union work requirements\u201d gave us Saturdays and Sundays off.\n\nWithout unions we would still be working six or seven days a week with no overtime pay. The weekend as we know it wouldn\u2019t exist if we lived in Rand\u2019s world.\n\nNeither would paid vacations, the minimum wage, health and disability benefits, and quite a few other things a lot of working people count on to help them get by.\n\n5. Civil rights for African Americans and other minorities wouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nRand Paul believes businesses have the right to discriminate against minorities, or against pretty much anybody, because he thinks that\u2019s part of their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe First Amendment, as most of you may know, reads as follows: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in there about \u201cbusinesses that want to force women like Rosa Parks to stand at the back of the bus when there are empty seats in the front of the bus,\u201d or \u201clunch counters that won\u2019t serve black folks.\u201d\n\nNo, the First Amendment doesn\u2019t say that. But Rand Paul thinks it does. He also says he would\u2019ve voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Here\u2019s a newsflash for Sen. Paul: Millennials come in all races, religions, genders and sexual orientations. They value their rights just as much as Americans of other generations do.\n\n6. He wants to eliminate Social Security.\n\nBecause, you know, the \u201cfree market\u201d has done so well in protecting Americans\u2019 financial security when they\u2019re disabled or elderly.\n\nMany millennials are collecting Social Security survivor benefits, like Rand Paul compatriot Paul Ryan did. Or disability benefits. Or they have parents and grandparents who are collecting retirement benefits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's right that America's youth is disaffected, but it's precisely his economic policies that are responsible", "title": "10 reasons Americans should be wary of Rand Paul\u2019s libertarianism \u2014 especially millennials", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "He's right that America's youth is disaffected, but it's precisely his economic policies that are responsible", "title": "10 reasons Americans should be wary of Rand Paul\u2019s libertarianism \u2014 especially millennials", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/04/10_reasons_americans_should_be_wary_of_rand_pauls_libertarianism_especially_millennials_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/rand_paul_mtp.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He's right that America's youth is disaffected, but it's precisely his economic policies that are responsible", "title": "10 reasons Americans should be wary of Rand Paul\u2019s libertarianism \u2014 especially millennials", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/rand_paul_mtp.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "RJ Eskow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Civil Rights, Libertarianism, Rand Paul, Social Security", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86f9\"", "article_summary": "Rand Paul believes \u201cregulation\u201d is evil, even when it\u2019s only asking a reckless private corporation to clean up its own messes.\nMany millennials are collecting Social Security survivor benefits, like Rand Paul compatriot Paul Ryan did.\nRand Paul, like his father, prefers to package his fairly old-school brand of economic conservatism under the trendier name of \u201clibertarianism.\u201d That\u2019s not just a labeling change.\nBut Rand Paul thinks it does.\nBut Rand Paul and libertarianism are not the answer."}
