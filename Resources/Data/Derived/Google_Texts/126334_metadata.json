Again, Delaware State and UD student questions were included.\n\nThe candidates answered questions about the economy, national security, ebola, education and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI feel the debates achieved several important goals,\u201d said Ralph Begleiter, director of UD\u2019s Center for Political Communication. \u201cFor the Delaware community, they provided a rare opportunity to see the candidates respond to unrehearsed questioning, in depth, on the important issues facing the state and the nation. Rather than a battle of sound bites, the Delaware Debates offered thoughtful conversation revealing the candidates' real thinking on these issues.\u201d\n\nWith the University serving as host, Begleiter said the Delaware Debates \u201cdemonstrated again UD\u2019s commitment as a \u2018citizen university\u2019 to its public service mission, to serving the state and the nation, combined with student engagement.\u201d\n\nBegleiter said there were more than 100 students watching the \"live\" debates, and commenting thoughtfully on what they saw and heard. \u201cFor many students, the debates were very likely their first exposure to hands-on politics, and proved that politics is not a \u2018dirty word,\u2019 but rather can be respectful, thoughtful dialog and disagreement on policy issues,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the University's partnership with Delaware Public Media in this manifestation of civic engagement,\u201d Begleiter said. \u201cOur partnership is both meaningful and powerful, because our combined expertise and resources produce the highest quality debates, not only in Delaware but across the nation. Other states have consulted with us on how we do it, and C-Span\u2019s broadcasts of our debates proves UD is known and respected nationwide in the arena of political communication.\u201d\n\nBegleiter added he is \u201cvery grateful to our supporters, both within the University and in the community, for helping us achieve these significant goals.\u201d\n\nPhotos by Kevin Quinlan", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "UDaily", "description": "University hosts debates among state's congressional candidates", "title": "Delaware Debates", "url": "http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2015/oct/delaware-debates-101614.html", "image": "http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2015/oct/images/Delaware_Debates_21.jpg", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1; maximum-scale=1;"}, "article_summary": "(Editor's note: The Delaware Debates website has been updated with videos of the debates on the \"Watch\" page.)\n\u201cI am proud of the University's partnership with Delaware Public Media in this manifestation of civic engagement,\u201d Begleiter said.\nThe debates featuring candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives were held back-to-back.\n\u201cI feel the debates achieved several important goals,\u201d said Ralph Begleiter, director of UD\u2019s Center for Political Communication.\n2:06 p.m., Oct. 16, 2014--Candidates for the state\u2019s congressional delegation squared off in the Delaware Debates 2014, a joint initiative of the University of Delaware\u2019s Center for Political Communication and Delaware Public Media, on Wednesday evening, Oct. 15, in Mitchell Hall on the UD campus in Newark."}
