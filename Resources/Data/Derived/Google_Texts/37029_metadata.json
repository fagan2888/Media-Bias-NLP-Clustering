A quick tour of the WSJ\u2019s Frontier Markets map gives an inkling why: In a world where the major developed markets have been struggling to raise their economic output, the 11.7% growth in Mongolia or the 9.7% climb in Ethiopia\u2019s GDP begin to look extremely appealing.\n\nEven frontier-market fund managers, though, caution against investors assuming that companies in a country enjoying rapid economic growth will necessarily outperform those in slower growing nations. So are investors misguided if they focus on countries with sharply growing economies?\n\nNot necessarily, says executive chairman of fund giant Templeton\u2019s emerging markets group, Mark Mobius: \u201cIf you have high economic growth in a country, obviously there will be many companies that have good earnings-per-share growth,\u201d he says in a video interview with WSJ Frontiers. \u201cIf you look at the history of prices of securities around the world, earnings per share are very important. The growth of earnings is really a key factor.\u201d\n\nIn a nod to the skeptics, though, Dr. Mobius warns that investors should not assume a rising tide will lift all the boats: \u201cThere will be a lot of duds, a lot of companies that are not doing very well, so you have to really pick and choose and do your research,\u201d he cautions.\n\nIn common with many frontier and emerging-market fund managers, Dr. Mobius focuses heavily on financial services companies. The reason? Banks have a wide exposure to a variety of industries and the economy in general,\u201d he says.\n\nRecent research has shown that frontier markets as a group have been less volatile than emerging markets over the past decade. Analysts attribute the lower volatility partly to the fact that frontier economies don\u2019t tend to move in lockstep with other regions and markets because their economies are not connected as tightly via trade or financial instruments.\n\nAccording to Dr. Mobius, another key factor ensuring frontier markets are less affected by global turmoil than larger emerging markets is the fact that, in many of them, domestic investment is driving economic growth. And he expects that factor to grow in significance: \u201cMy bet is that, more and more it will be the local investors\u201d driving growth, Dr. Mobius predicts.\n\nWhile frontier markets as a group have proved less volatile than many had expected, individual countries can provide a bumpy ride. Dr. Mobius points out, though, that he looks for opportunity in market turmoil.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, given Templeton has over $40 billion in assets under management, which includes $3.9 billion in frontier markets, Dr. Mobius strongly urged investors who don\u2019t have the time or the expertise to conduct effective company-level analysis to invest through a diversified mutual fund.\n\nIn the long term, the growth prospects for frontier markets and the companies operating in them are extremely positive, says Dr. Mobius: \u201cThere will be volatility, there will be too much money going into some areas \u2026 but the potential is incredible,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Video: Mark Mobius, who helps run Templeton's $4 billion frontier markets funds, says careful stock selection is key to generating returns in young, high-growth economies.", "title": "Mobius: Frontier Markets Will See Ups and Downs but Potential is \u2018Incredible\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/03/mobius-frontier-markets-will-see-ups-and-downs-but-potential-is-incredible/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DB115_mobius_P_20140602170346.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Mobius: Frontier Markets Will See Ups and Downs but Potential is \u2018Incredible\u2019", "description": "Video: Mark Mobius, who helps run Templeton's $4 billion frontier markets funds, says careful stock selection is key to generating returns in young, high-growth economies.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Dan Keeler", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Video: Mark Mobius, who helps run Templeton's $4 billion frontier markets funds, says careful stock selection is key to generating returns in young, high-growth economies.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-03T16:52:09-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/03/mobius-frontier-markets-will-see-ups-and-downs-but-potential-is-incredible/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-692", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Video: Mark Mobius, who helps run Templeton's $4 billion frontier markets funds, says careful stock selection is key to generating returns in young, high-growth economies.", "title": "Mobius: Frontier Markets Will See Ups and Downs but Potential is \u2018Incredible\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/03/mobius-frontier-markets-will-see-ups-and-downs-but-potential-is-incredible/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DB115_mobius_P_20140602170346.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-692", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-05T11:51:59-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group: Frontier markets\u2019 \u201clong-term potential is incredible.\u201d The Wall Street JournalFrontier markets have attracted attention in recent months because of their robust economic growth rates.\nRecent research has shown that frontier markets as a group have been less volatile than emerging markets over the past decade.\nWhile frontier markets as a group have proved less volatile than many had expected, individual countries can provide a bumpy ride.\nAccording to Dr. Mobius, another key factor ensuring frontier markets are less affected by global turmoil than larger emerging markets is the fact that, in many of them, domestic investment is driving economic growth.\nIn common with many frontier and emerging-market fund managers, Dr. Mobius focuses heavily on financial services companies."}
