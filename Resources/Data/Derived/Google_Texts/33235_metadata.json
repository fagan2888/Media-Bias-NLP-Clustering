Roberts Jr.\u2019s ruling was a narrow one, pointing out that other states and cities had found less-intrusive ways to both protect women entering clinics and accommodate the First Amendment rights of those opposed to abortion.\n\nMassachusetts asserts \u201cundeniably significant interests in maintaining public safety on [its] streets and sidewalks, as well as in preserving access to adjacent healthcare facilities,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cBut here the commonwealth has pursued those interests by the extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, only the court\u2019s liberals joined Roberts\u2019s opinion: Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. That is a rare combination at the court, Roberts\u2019s majority opinion upholding the Affordable Care Act in 2012 the most notable example.\n\nThe court\u2019s four conservatives agreed that the law violated the First Amendment but, writing separately from Roberts, said he was wrong in not simply finding that the law discriminated against those opposed to abortion.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s opinion carries forward this court\u2019s practice of giving abortion-rights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the free-speech rights of their opponents,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. \u201cThere is an entirely separate, abridged edition of the First Amendment applicable to speech against abortion.\u201d\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. did not join Scalia\u2019s biting opinion and wrote his own, agreeing that the law was unconstitutional because employs \u201cblatant viewpoint discrimination.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019s opinion did not mention a 2000 Supreme Court decision that said governments could enact some restrictions. It upheld a Colorado law that established 100-foot buffer zones outside all health-care facilities \u2014 not just abortion clinics \u2014 and prohibited approaching a person within an eight-foot bubble to protest or counsel.\n\nThat ruling brought forceful dissents at the time from Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas, who again Thursday called for it to be overruled, and was sharply criticized by First Amendment activists.\n\nThe latest case seemed to divide justices during oral arguments in January, and the outcome was hard to predict because Roberts, normally an active participant, did not ask a single question.\n\nThe challenge to the Massachusetts law was brought by activist Eleanor McCullen, 77, and others who say they use quiet conversation and offers of help to try to persuade women not to have an abortion.\n\nBecause of the law, they must stay behind painted lines on the sidewalk at a clinic in Boston and away from driveways that lead to other facilities. They say this hinders their chance for persuasive conversation \u2014 McCullen said she had persuaded about 80 women not to terminate their pregnancies since the 2007 law passed, far fewer than before.\n\nBut the state maintained that the buffer zones were the most effective way of dealing with decades of harassment and violence at abortion clinics, including shootings in the 1990s.\n\nWhile McCullen\u2019s group might be nonviolent, the state said there was no way of knowing who would show up at the clinics, and the law kept away those on both sides of the controversial issue.\n\nThe law bars everyone from entering or remaining in the zones. There are exceptions for people going in or out of the building, people using the sidewalk, law enforcement officials and clinic employees.\n\nMcCullen and her supporters said that last exception was one reason the law was unconstitutional, because it allowed speech from clinic employees but not from others. They also said it singled out abortion clinics as the only places where speech was restricted.\n\nRoberts\u2019s opinion, which Scalia mocked as \u201cSomething for Everyone,\u201d found a middle ground.\n\nRoberts said the law was viewpoint-neutral, because neither clinic employees nor activists were permitted to talk to women about abortion within the buffer zones. And he said Massachusetts had a legitimate interest in enacting restrictions only around abortion clinics, because that is where it had problems in the past.\n\nTo meet First Amendment standards, a law that restricts speech has to be narrowly drawn so as not to be more restrictive than necessary, Roberts said. The Massachusetts law failed that test, he said, because it did not consider \u201calternatives that leave the forum open for its time-honored purposes.\u201d\n\nThe commonwealth is alone among states with such restrictions, he said, and just a handful of cities have similar ones. As a practical matter, Roberts said, the problems are only at the Boston clinic on Saturday mornings.\n\n\u201cFor a problem shown to arise only once a week in one city at one clinic, creating 35-foot buffer zones at every clinic across the Commonwealth is hardly a narrowly tailored solution,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe said Massachusetts could \u201cconsider\u201d a New York City ordinance that prohibits obstructing access to a clinic and following and harassing another person within 15 feet of an abortion clinic.\n\nScalia criticized Roberts for offering an example of legislation that the court has not reviewed.\n\nMark Rienzi, the Catholic University law professor who argued the case, said the decision meant that \u201cthe government cannot reserve its public sidewalks for Planned Parenthood, as if their message is the only one women should be allowed to hear.\u201d\n\nHe also released a statement from McCullen: \u201cI am delighted and thankful to God that the court has protected my right to engage in kind, hopeful discussions with women who feel they have nowhere else to turn.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley (D) said the state\u2019s work \u201cbegins again.\u201d\n\nShe said the state will look for a solution that meets the court\u2019s requirements and protects \u201ceveryone from harassment, threats, and physical obstruction.\u201d\n\nWhile Roberts\u2019s opinion did not make his conservative colleagues happy, it also was not well received by abortion rights supporters.\n\nCecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the ruling showed a \u201cdisregard for American women, who should be able to make carefully considered, private medical decisions without running a gauntlet of harassing and threatening protesters.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts case is McCullen v.
