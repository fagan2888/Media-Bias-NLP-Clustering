The House of Representatives slapped the White House’s chief technology officer with a subpoena Friday to compel testimony about his role in the botched roll out of the ObamaCare website.

“You are the only invited witness who remains unwilling to testify,” House Oversight and Government Reform chairman Darrell Issa said in a letter to US chief technology officer Todd Park.

Park, in a prior communiqué, insisted he was too busy try to fix the HealthCare.gov website to testify.

But Issa fumed that Park previously found time to talk to the media about the website’s failings, but now is trying to duck a committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 13.

“Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance and are rapidly approaching a point where they must begin to prepare for the possibility of having no health insurance on January 1, 2014. They deserve your sworn testimony before their elected representatives about what went wrong,” Issa said.

“Given your continued unwillingness to appear voluntarily next week, I am left with no choice but to compel your appearance.”

The website is crucial in determining whether Americans are eligible for subsidies when they apply for medical coverage on the new health market exchanges.
