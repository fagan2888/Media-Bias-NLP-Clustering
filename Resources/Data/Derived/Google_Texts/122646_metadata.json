His tactics turned into a legal and financial liability after a group of Hispanics brought a class-action lawsuit saying that Arpaio\u2019s office had singled out Latinos in its patrols.\n\nU.S. District Judge Murray Snow two years ago concluded that Arpaio\u2019s officers had systematically racially profiled Latinos in regular traffic and immigration patrols, ushering in a series of court-ordered changes that are proving costly to taxpayers.\n\nThat includes buying body cameras for hundreds of deputies, setting up a computerized system aimed at detecting misconduct by officers and conducting more training to ensure officers aren\u2019t making unconstitutional traffic stops. Taxpayers also are picking up the tab for a team of retired police officials to monitor Arpaio\u2019s office on behalf of the judge.\n\nThe costs from the profiling case come directly out of the county\u2019s budget, and not from the sheriff himself. County officials say they don\u2019t believe Arpaio has had to pay any legal fees, settlements and judgments related to his work in his 22 years as sheriff. The sheriff did offer to pay $100,000 from his own pocket in an unsuccessful bid to short-circuit contempt-of-court hearings against him in the case.\n\nThe county also is on the hook for an additional $74 million related to Arpaio that is separate from the racial-profiling costs. That figure includes judgments, settlements and legal fees for the sheriff\u2019s office during Arpaio\u2019s tenure, covering things like lawsuits over deaths in his jails and the lawman\u2019s failed investigations of political enemies.\n\nThe costs were paid for through a county fund dedicated to covering legal costs.\n\nIt\u2019s not known how long the legal costs will drag on.\n\nSnow has signaled that he may hold a second trial in the profiling case stemming from Arpaio\u2019s acknowledged defiance of a court order that he quit his immigration patrols. Lawyers who won the profiling case said hundreds of Latinos have been identified as having been pulled over by deputies after the order was issued and should be financially compensated by the county for the harm they suffered.\n\nAnd the efforts to comply with the judge\u2019s orders will take several years. Snow recently also said the sheriff\u2019s office is 29 percent in compliance. Once the sheriff\u2019s office is fully compliant, it must remain so for three straight years before it can be released from the court\u2019s oversight. Taxpayers will pick up the compliance costs.\n\nAll the while, the county is in the midst of defending a civil rights lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice Department that alleges retaliation against Arpaio\u2019s political rivals and racial profiling. The county has pulled $4.7 million out of its budget so far to defend that case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As county officials in metro Phoenix work to enact a budget for the next fiscal year, they are confronted with a looming financial liability: the legal costs associated with Sheriff Joe Arpaio's racial-profiling case.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Jacques Billeaud, Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "As county officials in metro Phoenix work to enact a budget for the next fiscal year, they are confronted with a looming financial liability: the legal costs associated with Sheriff Joe Arpaio's ra...", "title": "Arizona racial profiling case to cost taxpayers $45 million", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2015/05/19/arizona-racial-profiling-case-to-cost-taxpayers-45-million/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2015/05/Joe-Arpaio-illegal-immigration-AP-620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Arizona racial profiling case to cost taxpayers $45 million Arizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "arizona, joe arpaio, maricopa county sheriff's office, maricopa county, legal bills, legal judgments, lawsuits, financial liability, $45 million, racial profiling case, courts, compliance, court monitoring, taxpayers,$45 million,compliance,court monitoring,courts,financial liability,joe arpaio,lawsuits,legal bills,legal judgments,maricopa county,maricopa county sheriff's office,racial profiling case,taxpayers", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27ce\"", "article_summary": "Taxpayers also are picking up the tab for a team of retired police officials to monitor Arpaio\u2019s office on behalf of the judge.\nOnce the sheriff\u2019s office is fully compliant, it must remain so for three straight years before it can be released from the court\u2019s oversight.\nArpaio spokeswoman Lisa Allen said the legal costs for the sheriff\u2019s office are nowhere near as high as some other police agencies elsewhere in the country.\nSnow recently also said the sheriff\u2019s office is 29 percent in compliance.\nIt\u2019s not known how long the legal costs will drag on."}
