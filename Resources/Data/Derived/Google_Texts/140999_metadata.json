This change does not impact our commercial and Medicare plans,\" UnitedHealth spokewoman Maria Gordon Shydlo wrote in an email, without further comment.\n\nThe move raises questions about how many insurers will offer individual plans on the marketplace, and whether the disappearance of large players could cause premiums to rise for lack of competition.\n\nUnitedHealth, based in Minnesota, had sold plans on the exchange through a company called All Savers Insurance Co., which is legally based in Indianapolis.\n\nIndiana was All Savers\u2019 second-biggest market for growth during the first nine months of last year, pulling in $129 million in premiums, up from $12.2 million during the same period a year earlier.\n\nIn addition, UnitedHealth is not going to sell individual plans off of the marketplace, according to the Indiana Department of Insurance.\n\nIn April, UnitedHealth said it would drop out of all but a \u201chandful\u201d of state exchanges where it sells individual Obamacare plans.

But it has proven volatile for health insurances selling coverage in the new markets.\n\nIn November, UnitedHealth officials told investors that premiums for Obamacare exchanges came with too many medical claims.\n\nUnitedHealth had about 795,000 customers of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges as of March 31.\n\nRoughly half of the health insurers selling on the Obamacare exchange in Indiana were losing money on that business last year, according to third-quarter financial filings with the state insurance department.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation\u2019s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, will stop selling individual Obamacare plans in Indiana next year.
