There, urban areas looked just like any other first-world city, she said.\n\nBut once you got outside those areas, there was no running water, people with little education and high rates of poverty.\n\n\u201cIt was the very hard for those who had to see the other side of it,\u201d Rawl said. \u201cI can see that quality here. There are communities that don\u2019t have access to basic things, like affordable water and healthy food.\u201d\n\nSugar Free Kids Maryland is pushing for two bills during the 2015 legislative session, one that would remove the 6 percent sales tax from bottled water and another that would prohibit restaurants from automatically including sugary drinks with kids\u2019 meals.\n\nHow to help: If you are interested in becoming involved in Sugar Free Kids Maryland or joining their coalition, go to www.sugarfreekidsmd.org . You can also attend the hearings on the bottled water bill, which are scheduled for 1 p.m. on Feb. 24 before the House, and 1 p.m. on Feb. 25 before the Senate. The hearings on sugary drinks in kids's meals will be held at 1 p.m. on March 3 before the House, and at 1 p.m. on March 12 before the Senate.\n\nRawl majored in anthropology and art history at the University of Maryland, with a focus on archeology in both disciplines. She also minored in international studies and Spanish language and literature, studying abroad in Spain before she graduated in 2000.\n\nAfter college, she taught Spanish to middle schoolers before deciding to join the Peace Corps.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa was looking for experienced teachers,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was an \u201ceye-opening experience,\u201d she said. While much progress has been made since the end of apartheid in 1994, the effects of decades of segregation linger in every level of society.\n\nAfter her stint in the Peace Corps ended, Rawl decided she wanted to pursue a career in social work, believing change starts at the local level.\n\nShe pointed to the corner stores in many Baltimore neighborhoods, where many residents buy the bulk of their groceries. Even if they know which foods are more nutritious, that doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t have access to a grocery store with a complete inventory of healthy foods.\n\nRELATED: National report ranks Baltimore City as unhealthiest in state, food deserts contributing to problem\n\n\u201cNo matter what kind of education you have, you\u2019re limited to what\u2019s in your neighborhood and how much money is in your wallet,\u201d Rawl said.\n\nAfter graduating with her master\u2019s degree in social work, Rawl worked as a social work fellow with the Healthcare For All coalition, and worked on outreach related to the Affordable Care Act, the tobacco tax and tightening Maryland\u2019s gun laws.\n\n\u201cIf we want to make a change, we have to affect the underlying policies that affect everything else,\u201d Rawl said.\n\nRight now, that\u2019s fighting for policies that help curtail the amount of sugar in children\u2019s diets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point now that if we don\u2019t make any change, this generation of kids will live shorter lives than their parents,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "People sometimes get confused when Robi Rawl tells them she\u2019s a social worker.
