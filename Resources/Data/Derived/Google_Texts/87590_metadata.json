I shared in this \u2014 and yet, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder at the remnants here in the U.S. of attempts of doing just that.\n\nIn fact, we still have laws against sodomy in several states \u2014 Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah. Currently. In the year 2013. [I pause to let you pick your jaw up off the floor.] Two states \u2014 Kansas and Texas \u2014 explicitly outlaw homosexual contact. (And did I mention that the military still bans sodomy?) That\u2019s right: the United States of America still has laws on the books criminalizing gay sex \u2014 in addition to codes forbidding oral and anal sex for heterosexuals.\n\nHow the hell did we get here? It all started \u2014 as do many unfortunate stories \u2014 with religion. As the American Civil Liberties Union puts it, \u201cOriginally, sodomy laws were part of a larger body of law \u2014 derived from church law \u2014 designed to prevent nonprocreative sexuality anywhere, and any sexuality outside of marriage.\u201d\n\nUntil the mid twentieth century, sodomy arrests were largely made in non-consensual cases. As Margot Canaday wrote in The Nation, \u201cMcCarthyist anxieties about homosexuality, sex-crime panics and the advent of the vice squad led to a midcentury boom in sodomy arrests, as many as 80 percent of which may have involved homosexual offenses,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs further reflection of midcentury homophobia, consensual homosexual sodomy emerged for the first time as a major regulatory concern.\u201d A sodomy conviction could land you behind bars for as little as five years and for as long as the rest of your life.\n\nIn part because of dawning awareness about what Americans were actually getting up to in the privacy of their bedrooms \u2014 thanks, Alfred Kinsey \u2014 sodomy was cut from the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code in 1962. \u201cNearly simultaneously, as part of its updating of its criminal code, the State of Illinois became the first to decriminalize consensual sodomy,\u201d explains Canaday. Several states followed suit \u2014 but reform got more complicated as sodomy \u201cbecame even more closely associated with homosexuality in the decade after the Stonewall riots,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSimultaneously, the connection to homosexuality \u2018became a reason, as well as an obstacle, for sodomy law reform.'\u201d\n\nAnd here we are today, with two states still explicitly outlawing gay sex (and several more banning sodomy regardless of sexual orientation). The Kansas law criminalizes sodomy between \u201cmembers of the same sex or between a person and an animal.\u201d (Because in some conservatives\u2019 eyes, gay sex and bestiality are the same. No exaggeration \u2014 remember Rick Santorum comparing homosexuality to sex with dogs?) The Texas statute defines it as an offense for a person to engage in \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse\u201d \u2014 defined as anal or oral \u2014 \u201cwith another individual of the same sex.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "News of India\u2019s ban on gay sex sparked outrage in the U.S. Let\u2019s not forget: We still have anti-gay laws", "author": "Tracy Clark-Flory", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "News of India\u2019s ban on gay sex sparked outrage in the U.S. Let\u2019s not forget: We still have anti-gay laws", "title": "Sodomy laws still exist?!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/15/sodomy_laws_still_exist/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/handcuffed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "News of India\u2019s ban on gay sex sparked outrage in the U.S. Let\u2019s not forget: We still have anti-gay laws", "creator": "@TracyClarkFlory", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/handcuffed.jpg", "title": "Sodomy laws still exist?!", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Sodomy laws still exist?!", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-sodomy laws, Editor's Picks, LGBT, LGBTQ, Love and Sex, Sex, sodomy, sodomy laws", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef08\"", "article_summary": "Topics: anti-sodomy laws, Editor's Picks, LGBT, LGBTQ, Love and Sex, Sex, sodomy, sodomy laws, Life NewsWhen the Indian Supreme Court this week reinstated a law banning gay sex, everyone in my liberal social circle began circulating outrage.\nIn fact, we still have laws against sodomy in several states \u2014 Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah.\n\u201cSimultaneously, the connection to homosexuality \u2018became a reason, as well as an obstacle, for sodomy law reform.\n'\u201dAnd here we are today, with two states still explicitly outlawing gay sex (and several more banning sodomy regardless of sexual orientation).\nAs the American Civil Liberties Union puts it, \u201cOriginally, sodomy laws were part of a larger body of law \u2014 derived from church law \u2014 designed to prevent nonprocreative sexuality anywhere, and any sexuality outside of marriage.\u201dUntil the mid twentieth century, sodomy arrests were largely made in non-consensual cases."}
