Jan Christian, CC BY SA 2.0\n\nWisconsin sisters, Madelyn and Olivia Meylor, have filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming Gardasil, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine both women took when they were younger, caused them to go through early menopause and may have made them infertile.\n\nGardasil, a product made by Merck and Co., is \u201cthe only HPV vaccine that helps protect against 4 types of HPV.\u201d HPV is a virus that exists in over 100 different varieties and has over 40 different strains that affect the genital area. HPV is considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI) because it is transmitted primarily through skin-to-skin contact, which includes sexual intercourse, anal sex, and oral sex. While HPV can cause genital warts like other STIs, it is considered especially dangerous because of its link to genital and other serious cancers.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 79 million Americans, most of whom are teens and young adults, are infected with HPV. About 14 million people contract the virus each year. The HPV vaccine, which was introduced in 2006, is recommended for girls and boys between the ages of 11 and 12. It is given as a series of three shots over a six-month period.\n\nThe Meylor sisters, ages 19 and 20, blame the vaccine for both of their premature ovarian failure. They also have premature menopause, marked by insomnia, night sweats, and headaches. Doctors say that it is highly unlikely the women will be able to get pregnant in the future due to their conditions.\n\n\"I've always wanted a huge family, but I don't know if that will be possible,\" Madelyne Meylor said.\n\nTests for a possible genetic cause for the sisters\u2019 symptoms were all negative. They are using hormone replacement therapy and taking birth control to ward off the continuing negative health effects.\n\n\u201cPeople should look into the vaccine more and see if the benefits outweigh the risks,\u201d Olivia said. Merck, however, maintains that the women\u2019s condition \u2014 which the company calls \u201cpremature ovarian insufficiency\u201d (POI) \u2014 is not linked to the use of Gardasil.\n\n\u201cMerck has reviewed the post-licensure reports of POI after administration of Gardasil and has concluded that the evidence does not support a causal relationship to the vaccine,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe cases have been reported to the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies. There have been no reports of POI in the clinical trials with Garsadil.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wisconsin sisters, hpv vaccine, gardasil", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Two Wisconsin sisters say the HPV vaccine Gardasil caused them to go into early menopause, which includes insomnia, night sweats, and possible infertility.", "title": "Wisconsin Sisters Say HPV Vaccine Caused Early Menopause And Infertility [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wisconsin-sisters-sue-over-gardasil-say-hpv-vaccine-caused-early-menopause-and-infertility-video", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/08/800px-gardasilvaccineandbox.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two Wisconsin sisters say the HPV vaccine Gardasil caused them to go into early menopause, which includes insomnia, night sweats, and possible infertility.", "title": "Wisconsin Sisters Say HPV Vaccine Caused Early Menopause And Infertility [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wisconsin-sisters-sue-over-gardasil-say-hpv-vaccine-caused-early-menopause-and-infertility-video", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/08/800px-gardasilvaccineandbox.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/08/800px-gardasilvaccineandbox.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-08T16:16:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-08T16:16:35-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Two Wisconsin sisters say the HPV vaccine Gardasil caused them to go into early menopause, which includes insomnia, night sweats, and possible infertility."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2466\"", "article_summary": "Two Wisconsin sisters say the HPV vaccine Gardasil caused them to go into early menopause, which includes insomnia, night sweats, and possible infertility.\nThe HPV vaccine, which was introduced in 2006, is recommended for girls and boys between the ages of 11 and 12.\nGardasil, a product made by Merck and Co., is \u201cthe only HPV vaccine that helps protect against 4 types of HPV.\u201d HPV is a virus that exists in over 100 different varieties and has over 40 different strains that affect the genital area.\nThey also have premature menopause, marked by insomnia, night sweats, and headaches.\nThe Meylor sisters, ages 19 and 20, blame the vaccine for both of their premature ovarian failure."}
