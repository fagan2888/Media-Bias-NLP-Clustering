Should ObamaCare Be Defunded? Vote in Urgent National Poll

Conservative political commentator Charles Krauthammer has rejected President Barack Obama's apology to the millions of Americans who are losing their health insurance under Obamacare. The president, he says, now is "toxic."Responding to Obama's interview Thursday with NBC News , the Pulitzer-prize winning columnist said, "The president now is toxic. The thing is called Obamacare. There's no running away from it. It's got his name on it."You see the president, you think about the policy and you know it's a disaster."Krauthammer, a nightly panelist on Fox's "Special Report with Bret Baier," maintained that Democrats will pay for the disaster.Story continues below video."They are hostage to a bunch of geeks working right now late into the night trying to fix a system which is not just the glitches we talked about," Krauthammer said. "The architecture, the underlying structure of it is wrong."As for the administration's promise that it would have the site fixed by the end of the month, Krauthammer stated, "I think the likelihood of it being fixed, working like you would expect from any normal commercial private website normally by Dec. 1, is pretty small.""And the pressure on the White House will become irresistible," he said. "If it isn't up and running smoothly and perfectly, they're going to start with postponements and then the whole thing starts to unravel."
