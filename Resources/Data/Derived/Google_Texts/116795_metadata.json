Ted Cruz and his staff mobilized to extinguish it. It was a one-two punch that showcased the stature of one of the Texas Republican's top aides.\n\nWhile Cruz countered House leaders' rollout of their immigration principles on conservative outlets like Breitbart News, Amanda Carpenter, who helps formulate and amplify Cruz's message as his senior communications adviser and speechwriter, slung slices of red meat on Twitter.\n\n\u201cMaybe after offering up amnesty for Obama, the Establishment GOP will start working on a global warming cap-and-tax bill for Obama. #WhyNot,\u201d Carpenter tweeted . She continued in rapid fire, tweeting: \u201cWant to know why conservatives aren't, supposedly, pushing happy ideas? bc we keep having to kill terrible ones the establishment pushes!\u201d and \u201cHey, remember when they promised to keep the focus on Obamacare. Dontcha kinda think amnesty distracts from that?\u201d\n\nSoon after, Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, began to express doubt that immigration reform could be done this year .\n\nCarpenter's acerbic wit has helped grow her Twitter presence to reach more than 50,000 people \u2014 far more followers than most congressional staffers and surpassing many of Cruz's fellow senators.\n\nHer unique position in the Twitterverse has provided another pipeline from Cruz to the conservative grass roots. And Carpenter doesn't hold back \u2014 targeting the establishment and GOP leaders again and again, as well as President Barack Obama.\n\nShe said in an interview last week that pushing aggressively for change makes the establishment uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cWashington is resistant to change,\u201d Carpenter told CQ Roll Call. \u201cThe rise of the grass roots and the influence they have been able to wield in terms of phone calls, letters, emails. This is a relatively new thing that\u2019s happening. We view it as a very positive thing. As Cruz likes to say, \u2018Liberty is never more safe than when politicians are terrified.\u2019 So I think people are trying to adapt to that.\"\n\nCarpenter acknowledged she has more freedom on social media than is typical for staffers, \u201cwhich I really enjoy.\"\n\nBut that freedom has provoked the quiet \u2014 and sometimes not so quiet \u2014 ire of fellow Republicans who contend that Cruz and his operation are merely seeking publicity for a possible 2016 presidential run at the expense of electing a Republican majority.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page recently called Cruz \u201cthe minority maker\u201d and part of the GOP\u2019s \u201ckamikaze caucus\u201d after he forced his fellow Republicans to back a procedural vote to advance a bill to suspend the debt ceiling and avoid a default. Both Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Whip John Cornyn face tea party primary challengers who were quick to use their \"yes\" votes as campaign fodder .\n\nAnd Carpenter herself has been target of vitriol. Playboy magazine in 2009 singled her out among 10 GOP women in a crudely headlined article they subsequently took down, and in September a Sacramento County Democratic Party official resigned after a posting an offensive tweet about Carpenter\u2019s children.\n\nShe makes no apologies for her vocal Twitter presence, though she said she doesn\u2019t find herself antagonistic. She argues any tension has more to do with complacency among establishment Republicans than anything she says or does.\n\n\u201cThis office has allowed me to be fairly vocal on social media in a way that other offices don\u2019t allow their staffs to do,\u201d Carpenter told CQ Roll Call. \u201cBut this is the model. We want to be making our argument, making our case, pretty vocally and when we are not the popular voice in Washington it's more important than ever for us to communicate what we are doing and why so people can understand it and it's not viewed as \u2018Oh, Cruz is just causing trouble.\u2019 No, here is the explanation behind it.\u201d\n\nShe said her boss is good at making his own case, \u201cbut it also helps to have other people amplifying that in real time when a vote is going down.\"\n\nCarpenter's Twitter presence helped boost Cruz's lengthy #MakeDCListen floor speech on Obamacare last year . And she was active before, during and after the government shutdown, which many establishment Republicans blamed on Cruz.\n\nShe dismissed a common criticism of her boss \u2014 that Cruz values party purity over pragmatism.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about purity, it's not about making people look bad, it's about how are we going to change Washington for the better,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that by green-lighting the status quo and keep doing the things that we\u2019ve done that have created a $17 trillion debt and a government that we can\u2019t even exercise any oversight of.\n\n\u201cAm I passionate about stopping that, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that cause disagreement? Yes. [But] that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nEchoing Cruz on elections, she added: \u201cRepublicans, when they stand on principle, they win.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old mother of two grew up in Montrose, Mich., in an apolitical family. She embraced becoming a conservative Republican working her way through college at Ball State University and founded a website where she wrote about, among other things, the rising cost of tuition.\n\nThat led to jobs at conservative media outlets and a column at the Washington Times. She became a regular on Fox News, and built trust among online conservative activists. She first made her way to Capitol Hill as a senior communications adviser and speechwriter for South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint \u2014 who has since become a key Cruz ally as the head of The Heritage Foundation.\n\nDeMint \u201cpioneered a lot of the grass-roots model ... and trying to change Washington from the outside in rather than from the inside out,\u201d she said. Initially, she worried that as a freshman, Cruz wouldn't get active immediately, but joining the Texan's office was the \"best decision that I could have made\" after leaving DeMint's staff, she said.\n\nCarpenter warned not to expect anything different from Cruz if Republicans win the majority.\n\n\u201cHis principles are not going to change,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s said before, \u2018I don\u2019t trust Republicans, I don\u2019t trust Democrats.\u2019 He\u2019s still going try to do the things he set out to do. The goal of being in the Senate isn\u2019t just to be the guy with the most people on your team. It's to fix it.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just as there was a glimmer of hope late last month that House Republican leaders would try to pass an immigration overhaul this year, Sen.
