Business Insider partnered with Niche to analysis hundreds of colleges, using information about varsity sports, social life and school spirit, all based on Niche\u2019s rankings of schools with the best overall student experience.\n\nNot surprisingly, the top school was Florida State University. The football team recently won the national championship, putting the program back on top after years removed from the glory days of the 1990s. Even a cursory glance at a game on television shows you how into their Seminoles the Florida State fans can be \u2013 from flaming spears to dressing in Florida State superhero costumes.\n\nThe business school there has expanded rapidly since its founding in 1950. The Florida State College of Business is one of the 10 largest in the country, according to the school\u2019s website, despite being one of the nation\u2019s newest business schools.\n\nThe other schools in the Top 5, in descending order, are:\n\nUniversity of Georgia. Like many of the teams on this list, this school is located in the South, where football is far and away the most popular sport. Last year, 80% of the graduates from Georgia\u2019s Terry College of Business had accepted jobs within three months of graduation.\n\nUniversity of Alabama. A perennial power in college football has spawned a legion of Crimson Tide fans. The university also has the Culverhouse College of Commerce, which began in 1919. Alabama\u2019s Culverhouse School of Accounting was the first of just 13 programs across the country to have separate accreditation in accounting.\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin. They are not using sign language to say \u201cI love you\u201d when they do the Hook \u2018em Horns sign \u2013 it\u2019s meant to conjure the image of bull steer\u2019s horns. So it\u2019s sort of the opposite of \u201cI love you.\u201d The school\u2019s McCombs School of Business is one of the largest in the country and consistently ranked among the Top 20 best business schools by U.S. News and World Report. In 2013, it was ranked 17th overall and 5th among public schools.\n\nIndiana University. America\u2019s Heartland produces some of the most devoted fan bases in the country, including those who back the Hoosiers, particularly the basketball team. The university\u2019s Kelley School of Business started in 1920 and the school, on its website, says it produces positive, hard-working graduates with the skills to excel in the real world business environments.\n\nFor the complete list, go here.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Business Insider decided to make a list of the colleges that showed the best \u201cteam spirit\u201d when it comes to the college\u2019s sports teams.", "og": {"site_name": "Business Administration Information", "description": "Business Insider decided to make a list of the colleges that showed the best \u201cteam spirit\u201d when it comes to the college\u2019s sports teams.", "title": "What Are Business Schools Like at Universities With the Best Sports Fans? - Business Administration Information", "url": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/news/what-are-business-schools-like-at-universities-with-the-best-sports-fans", "image": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fsu-fans-300x159.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1478982362392941}, "msvalidate.01": "E97402E8C75E1396BEAE2A02AE1A06E8", "google-site-verification": "-7d0XhlweD9ac6X0iGygOuxos-tqbyEAEVk9SXNyc-Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "education, sports, humor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30e8\"", "article_summary": "Even a cursory glance at a game on television shows you how into their Seminoles the Florida State fans can be \u2013 from flaming spears to dressing in Florida State superhero costumes.\nThe Florida State College of Business is one of the 10 largest in the country, according to the school\u2019s website, despite being one of the nation\u2019s newest business schools.\nBusiness school students have a lot to consider before choosing the right school \u2013 cost, quality of the faculty, course topics, facilities, the school\u2019s reputation.\nSo it\u2019s sort of the opposite of \u201cI love you.\u201d The school\u2019s McCombs School of Business is one of the largest in the country and consistently ranked among the Top 20 best business schools by U.S. News and World Report.\nThe business school there has expanded rapidly since its founding in 1950."}
