Saturday was the first of nine events where anyone can come in for free assistance on income taxes.\n\n\u201cThe first person didn\u2019t bring last year\u2019s return with her, which is a lot easier for us to do it if they bring last year\u2019s return. We were still able to do it, no problem,\u201d said Carla May, YSU student.\n\nDr. Raymond Shaffer with the Lariccia School of Accounting and Finance said it makes sense to get help when filing returns. He said mistakes such as a birth date or social security number can kick out a tax return. Also, the Affordable Care Act has changed how some returns are figured.\n\nYSU student Maria Bukovinsky said those who need to consider their health insurance this year will get a form from the government.\n\n\u201cIf you have coverage through the Marketplace, the government should send you a from 1095 that you should be bringing in while you get your taxes done,\u201d Bukovinsky said. \u201cIf they had coverage for the entire year, it is a lot easier. If they only had coverage for three months for four months, then it gets a little more complicated.\u201d\n\nShaffer says to only start working on tax returns once all the forms from 2014 are in.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to rush into things if you don\u2019t think you have all your information. Just gather all your information and make sure everything is reported, and just take your time and work through it. That is the biggest thing,\u201d Shaffer said.\n\nItems needed included:\n\nSocial security card, photo ID\n\nWage and earnings statements (Form W-2) from all employers\n\nInterest, dividend and investment/stock sales statements (Forms 1099)\n\nA copy of last year\u2019s tax return if available and other relevant information about income and expenses.\n\nIf you are not sure whether it is needed, bring it!\n\nAssistance is offered every Saturday through April 11 at YSU\u2019s Williamson Hall, 221 North Hazel Street. Walk-ins are welcome.
