Kibbe was so angry, in fact, that he was moved to petulantly declare, \u201cIf the only way the K Street wing of the GOP establishment can win is by courting Democrats to vote in GOP primaries then we\u2019ve already won.\u201d This Black Knight-like declaration of victory following conspicuous defeat was widely mocked as yet another example of the Tea Party\u2019s preference to curate reality.\n\nNot every Tea Party opponent was so dismissive, though. Calling \u201cthe daily vicissitudes\u201d of the battle between the Tea Party and the GOP establishment \u201cbeside the point,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent wrote that McDaniel\u2019s defeat obscured a more significant truth: \u201c[O]n many key issues, the business community is getting nothing for its investment in the GOP establishment\u2019s picks.\u201d He went on to cite immigration reform, the Export-Import Bank, and federal spending on infrastructure as just three obvious examples. The obvious conclusion to be drawn? Maybe what Kibbe said wasn\u2019t quite so silly after all.\n\nAt the very least, those on the American left hoping to push the Democratic Party away from the centrist, neoliberal policies it\u2019s embraced since at least Bill Clinton (and arguably earlier, beginning with Jimmy Carter) and more toward a more populist, redistributionist approach should be lucky to be so silly. Indeed, members of what little there is of an American far left have long admired the Tea Party\u2019s effectiveness, if not its goals. When, during last October\u2019s Tea Party-inspired government shutdown, Jacobin\u2019s Bhaskar Sunkara wrote that \u201cTea Party-like success \u2026 would be a tremendous advance for those looking not just to protect, but to expand, the welfare state,\u201d he wasn\u2019t playing contrarian but rather echoing a sentiment I\u2019ve heard many times from leftist friends over the past four years. (For those unaware, here\u2019s a good rundown as to why Occupy Wall Street, for all its virtues, doesn\u2019t count.)\n\nSome pundits have argued that the rising popularity of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is proof that, even without a left-wing Tea Party, demographic changes are pushing the Democratic Party inexorably leftward. There\u2019s no doubt at least a kernel of truth to this. But it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there\u2019s nothing new about unapologetically liberal politicians coming out of the Big Apple and the Bay State. And the narrative gets even screwier if we keep in mind Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s fiscally conservative record, as well as his pending, almost certain, landslide reelection. Above all else, focusing on high-profile pols misses what makes the Tea Party so powerful: its ability to rally American conservatism\u2019s activist troops.\n\nAs Ned Resnikoff recently wrote in the Baffler, if there\u2019s to be a true left-wing Tea Party, it\u2019ll have to be a bottom-up affair, one that is driven as much or more by longtime activists, issue-advocacy groups, organized labor and disaffected youth. It will have to be a movement, not a P.R. campaign. And as is the case with the Tea Party, it\u2019ll have to derive much of its power and influence from hard work on the state and local levels, saving the more glamorous \u2014 but often less fruitful \u2014 work on Congress and the White House for last. As is the case for the real Tea Party, there would no doubt be politicians who seek to align themselves with the movement; but its real power players (at least at first) will have names you\u2019ve never previously heard.\n\nI frame a left-wing Tea Party as a hypothetical because, quite frankly, it right now manifests itself chiefly in tremors and glimmers of something bigger that may one day come. For this piece, I spoke to a handful of state-level candidates who fit that description \u2014 politicians whom Howard Dean might describe as coming from \u201cthe Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d But while fondness for the party as it currently exists varied among them, a belief that Democrats need to do a better job pushing for economic justice \u2014 and against corporate prerogatives \u2014 was universal.\n\nWhen I asked Rhode Island House of Representatives Democratic candidate Aaron Regunberg how he felt about the Democratic Party in Rhode Island (which is at once prohibitively powerful and often decidedly unprogressive), he answered at first with a pause and then a long sigh. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of frustration nationally with Democratic officials who folks feel have sort of sold out the values \u2014 justice, equity, fairness \u2014 that we want in our Democratic Party,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think here in Rhode Island that problem is taken to an extremity.\u201d Despite his misgivings, though, the 24-year-old candidate \u2014 like many Tea Party-aligned politicians on the right \u2014 said that he ultimately wanted to bring the party back to its fundamental principles. \u201cAs often as the Democratic Party has let us down, I am a Democrat and I\u2019m running as a Democrat and I want to be working to make our party live up to the values that it should,\u201d he said. Asked what those values are, Regunberg descried them as \u201cvaluing the collective, valuing the community good and using the state effectively to advance that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A few liberal pols get all the press, but the real work of movement-building is happening in the states", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A few liberal pols get all the press, but the real work of movement-building is happening in the states", "title": "A left-wing Tea Party may be closer than you think", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/a_left_wing_tea_party_may_be_closer_than_you_think/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sanders_warren_deblasio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A few liberal pols get all the press, but the real work of movement-building is happening in the states", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sanders_warren_deblasio.jpg", "title": "A left-wing Tea Party may be closer than you think", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "A left-wing Tea Party may be closer than you think", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Aaron Regunberg, Bernie Sanders, Bill de Blasio, Chris McDaniel, Cory McCray, Dan Cantor, Editor's Picks, Election 2016, Elizabeth Warren, Freedomworks, Greg Sargent, Marina Dimitrijevic, Maryland Working Families, Matt Kibbe, Ned Resnikoff, Occupy Wall Street, Pramila Jayapal, Tea Party, Thad Cochran, working families, Working Families Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f92\"", "article_summary": "Above all else, focusing on high-profile pols misses what makes the Tea Party so powerful: its ability to rally American conservatism\u2019s activist troops.\nSome pundits have argued that the rising popularity of Massachusetts Sen.
