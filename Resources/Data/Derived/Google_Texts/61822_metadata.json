It also had no controls in place to \u201censure the accuracy\u201d of the tax revenue reported.\n\nRelated: Is the Embattled IRS the Next Obamacare Nightmare?\n\nBecause of that, the auditors concluded the number of forms filed and revenue reported from the tax were much lower than estimated.\n\nThe auditors recommended that the IRS improve its compliance strategy and include actions that the agency can take to better identify noncompliant manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWhile the IRS has taken steps to educate medical device manufacturers of the medical device excise tax during implementation, it faces challenges to definitively identify manufacturers subject to the medical device excise tax reporting and payment requirements,\u201d said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\n\nThis is just the latest TIGTA report to raise concerns about the IRS\u2019s ability to enforce the more than 40 new ACA provisions.\n\nEarlier this year, auditors released a report saying the IRS needed to develop a more effective plan to determine whether tax-exempt hospitals were in compliance with the law. \u201cUntil guidance is published, the public cannot be assured that the IRS has implemented controls to ensure compliance with ACA provisions designed to protect those served by tax-exempt hospitals,\u201d the auditors said.\n\nAgency officials such as IRS Commissioner John Koskinen have blamed the agency\u2019s issues on a lack of funding.\n\n\u201cThe IRS is basically the only major agency running on post-sequester level funding,\u201d Koskinen said at a congressional hearing this spring. The agency\u2019s budget was cut from $12 billion in 2013 to $11.2 billion for the fourth consecutive year in the omnibus $1.1 trillion spending bill.\n\nStill, some lawmakers \u2013 especially House Republicans \u2013 have been skeptical about increasing the agency\u2019s funding. They\u2019re often quick to point to the expensive employee retreats and hefty employee bonuses doled out over the last few years.\n\n\u201cWhat I find unacceptable is that you can\u2019t find the money to answer more than half the phone calls and yet you can find the money to pay $63 million in bonuses,\u201d said Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) at a committee hearing this spring. \u201cThat might be a slap in the face to the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is struggling to collect a new tax that\u2019s critical to fin", "title": "How the IRS Is Botching Obamacare Tax Collection", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/20/How-IRS-Botching-Obamacare-Tax-Collection", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/20/How-IRS-Botching-Obamacare-Tax-Collection", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is struggling to collect a new tax that\u2019s critical to fin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6d3\"", "article_summary": "Under the law, producers and manufactures are required to file Form 720 that reports the medical device tax on their tax returns.\n\u201cWhile the IRS has taken steps to educate medical device manufacturers of the medical device excise tax during implementation, it faces challenges to definitively identify manufacturers subject to the medical device excise tax reporting and payment requirements,\u201d said J.
