Groen\n\nPrincipal Attorney and General Counsel\n\nPacific Legal Foundation\n\njmg@pacificlegal.org\n\n(916) 419-7111\n\n\n\nJames S. Burling\n\nDirector of Litigation\n\nPacific Legal Foundation\n\njsb@pacificlegal.org\n\n(916) 419-7111\n\nHigh-profile amici back PLF\u2019s Murr property-rights case\n\nNine states are among \u201cfriends of the court\u201d arguing against Wisconsin and St. Croix County\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C.; April 22, 2016: Dozens of high-profile entities, including national business, industry and trade associations, think tanks, legal foundations \u2013 and nine states \u2013 submitted amicus curiae briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court this week, siding with Pacific Legal Foundation in PLF\u2019s precedent-setting case for property-owners\u2019 rights, Murr v. State of Wisconsin and St. Croix County.\n\nAll of the briefs urge the court to rule in favor of PLF\u2019s clients, Donna Murr and her siblings Joseph Murr, Michael Murr, and Peggy Heaver. Officials barred them from selling or making use of a vacant lot they own on the St. Croix River, without offering \u201cjust compensation\u201d as required by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, because the Murrs also own a neighboring lot with a recreational cabin on it.\n\n\n\nThe litigation is precedent-setting because the strategy used by regulators to avoid takings liability in this case has been employed in many parts of the country. Officials will arbitrarily treat separate, adjacent lots owned by the same person as if they were a single property \u2013 and claim that they can deny the use of one of the lots without compensation, on the grounds that the \u201cwhole\u201d property has not been taken.\n\nThe amicus brief from Nevada and eight other states urges the Supreme Court to forbid this tactic and rule against their sister State of Wisconsin and St. Croix County: \u201cAggregating contiguous parcels under common ownership into a single super-parcel,\u201d contends the brief, \u201cwill undermine traditional notions of property rights ... and encourage the undisciplined regulation of individuals\u2019 and states\u2019 property.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPacific Legal Foundation and the Murrs are grateful to all the parties that have filed in support of the Murrs\u2019 property rights and, by extension, everyone\u2019s property rights,\u201d said PLF General Counsel John M. Groen. \u201cAs the \u2018friend of the court\u2019 briefs recognize, land-use officials cannot be allowed to do an end-run around the Fifth Amendment and its ban on uncompensated takings. If regulators tell you that you can\u2019t use your land, you must be reimbursed. That\u2019s a basic constitutional protection, and you can\u2019t be robbed of it just because you might own another piece of property next door.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe list of \u201cfriends of the court\u201d in support of PLF in the Murr case includes:\n\nNevada, joined by Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2226\n\nChamber of Commerce of the United States: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2221\n\nNational Association of Home Builders, The Real Estate Roundtable, National Association of REALTORS\u00ae, along with five other national real-estate and building associations, and leading builders of America: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2225\n\nCalifornia Cattlemen\u2019s Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, and National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Legal Center: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2222\n\nWisconsin REALTORS\u00ae Association: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2224\n\nCato Institute and Owners\u2019 Counsel of America: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2228\n\nCenter for Constitutional Jurisprudence: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2218\n\nMountain States Legal Foundation: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2219\n\nNew England Legal Foundation: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2227\n\nReason Foundation: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2223\n\nSoutheastern Legal Foundation and The Beacon Center: http://www.pacificlegal.org/document.doc?id=2220\n\nThe case is Murr v.
