JOYCE? via Andrea Estes on BostonGlobe.com: \u201cIt looked like state Senator Brian Joyce was raking in the campaign donations despite his legal woes and his decision not to seek re-election. Campaign regulators said his extra campaign finance report, filed in April as part of a settlement of charges he misused campaign funds, showed he has raised money in 2016. But they wouldn\u2019t release the report, saying they weren\u2019t sure it was public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA day later, when they decided the document was public, the report showed that Joyce, a Democrat from Milton, had received more than $50,000 in January and February. But the money didn\u2019t come from constituents, voters or anyone else.

Fox on BostonGlobe.com: \u201cCommon Core education standards have become a political football across the country, with Republican presidential candidates scrambling to distance themselves from the guidelines that set goals for what students should know by the end of each grade.

CASINO, via the Associated Press in Springfield: \u201cA historic Massachusetts church started slowly rolling along the street Tuesday to make way for a nearly $1 billion casino. After weeks of preparation, crews began moving Springfield\u2019s 129-year-old First Spiritualist Church about two football-field lengths, where it will eventually stand next to a skating rink within the MGM Springfield casino\u2019s 14-acre footprint. ...\u201d Link via Washington Times, with photo: http://bit.ly/1WDJ1BC\n\nLAWMAKERS WARN ON BROCKTON CASINO, via Sean P.

Then Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. Now, advocates for legal marijuana are looking to New England, hoping this part of the country will open a new front in their efforts to expand legalization nationwide.

They knew driving drunk was a problem, but they didn\u2019t know how to police it. How do you measure drunkenness? ... [A]s marijuana fans push for full legalization, the same problem is surfacing again. Law enforcement officials say there is no way to accurately determine whether someone who is driving is high and there is no standard for determining how high is too high. ...\u201d http://bit.ly/1U5xGcH\n\nNEW ENGLAND MARIJUANA WATCH \u2014 ADVOCATES PUSH TO LET PATIENTS USE POT TO TREAT OPIATE ADDICTION, via Gillian Graham of the Portland Press Herald: \u201cMedical marijuana caregivers and patients will ask state regulators Tuesday to consider adding opiate addiction as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana.

So does Hillary Clinton.

CEO Stephen Hemsley said Tuesday that the company expects losses from its exchange business to total more than $1 billion for this year and last. He added that the company cannot continue to broadly serve the market created by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansion due partly to the higher risk that comes with its customers. The state-based exchanges are a key element behind the Affordable Care Act\u2019s push to expand insurance coverage.

By Andrew Marantz in the this week\u2019s issue of the New Yorker.: \u201c... \u2018V.R.\u2019 stands for virtual reality \u2014 a loosely defined phrase that is now being applied to several related forms of visual media. You put your smartphone into a portable device like a Google Cardboard or a Samsung Gear \u2014 or you use a more powerful computer-based setup, such as the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive \u2014 and the device engulfs your field of vision and tracks your head movement. The filmic world is no longer flat. Wherever you look, there\u2019s something to see. ...\n\nCinematic grammar no longer applies. There is no frame in which to compose a shot. An actor who directly addresses the camera isn\u2019t breaking the fourth wall, because the viewer is already in the middle of the action. The viewer can look anywhere, so the director often adds subtle visual or auditory cues to indicate where to look, or to signal that the viewer\u2019s gaze can wander without missing anything important. ...\u201d http://bit.ly/1NioZuf\n\nSome day this newsletter will be an immersive political environment, and come with an actual drink.
