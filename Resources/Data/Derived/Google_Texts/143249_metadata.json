Who is in charge, then, of the response to the Ebola virus?\n\nFor the Obamacare website debacle, Americans pointed to former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned as a result of the VA hospital scandal. More recently, Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned after a fence-jumper made it inside the White House.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBut as mistakes pile up in the fight to contain Ebola in the United States, the Obama administration appears reluctant to point to one person in charge of the response.\n\nDr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Center for Disease Control, has frequently been the public face of the government\u2019s response to the disease, but the White House pointedly refused to cite him as the person responsible.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters that President Obama continued to have confidence in Frieden\u2019s abilities, but he also reminded them that he was just one aspect of the administration\u2019s \u201cwhole of government approach\u201d to the disease. He reminded reporters that Obama\u2019s leadership style was not about \u201cpointing fingers of blame,\u201d adding that it was not \u201cconstructive\u201d to solving problems.\n\nCalls for an \u201cEbola czar\u201d have also been routinely dismissed by the administration, as Earnest explained on Wednesday that \u201cvery clear lines of responsibility\u201d were designated by the White House.\n\nIn the past, the key officials involved with the response included Director Frieden; Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; Dr. Tony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health; and Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for Homeland Security.\n\nMembers of the media are growing increasingly frustrated, however, as there is no one on whom to pin the blame for government failures to contain the disease.\n\nEarnest resisted the question, finally pointing to \u201can individual here at the White House who is responsible for coordinating the actions of the government,\u201d without mentioning President Obama by name.\n\nEd Henry, the White House correspondent for Fox News, pointed out during the briefing that Burwell appeared to be emerging as a lead spokesperson for the administration\u2019s response, but Earnest resisted putting her in the spotlight.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s White House correspondent Kristen Welker also noted the lack of White House leadership.\n\nEarnest repeated that every administration official who was talking about Ebola were being guided by \u201cmedical professionals\u201d who were \u201cguided by the science.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every scandal in the Obama administration has a face.
