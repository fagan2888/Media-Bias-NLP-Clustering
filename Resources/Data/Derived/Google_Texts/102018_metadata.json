Is it time to start worrying?\n\nAmong the costs of complying with the Affordable Care Act, one potentially big-ticket item is far enough in the future that there is perhaps little cause for alarm. But it may not be a good strategy to sit idle for long, some experts say.\n\nEmployers that trigger the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d could suffer severe financial effects. The controversial ACA provision will, starting in 2018, require self-insured companies to pay a 40 percent excise tax on the value of group health benefits \u2014 the total cost of coverage including both the employer\u2019s and employees\u2019 shares \u2014 that exceeds a threshold amount.\n\nThe tax applies to group plans offered by fully insured employers as well, but the law requires insurers to pay it. Those organizations won\u2019t get a free pass, though. Observers agree it\u2019s a forgone conclusion that insurers will pass that cost to their group customers.\n\nAs the legislation is currently written, plans that cost more than $10,200 for individuals and more than $27,500 for families will be subject to the tax. Those thresholds may be altered before 2018 based on medical-cost inflation, and also may be adjusted for people in high-risk professions or those over a certain age or of a certain gender, according to a United Healthcare fact sheet.\n\nAnswering a recent Towers Watson survey of 420 benefits managers at employers with more than 1,000 workers, 44 percent of the managers said they are \u201cvery confident\u201d they will trigger the tax if they don\u2019t prepare for it by making changes to their health-care programs. Seventeen percent said they are \u201csomewhat confident.\u201d Thirty-one percent said the Cadillac tax will have a \u201csignificant influence\u201d on their health-care strategy by 2015.\n\nChanging plans enough to avoid the tax may be a rigorous exercise that transfers significant additional cost burden to employees. But what will constitute \u201cpreparing\u201d to come in under the threshold, given that most employers are already making changes to their plans each year to keep up with rising costs?\n\n\u201cThe excise tax provides a specific dollar goal, whereas most companies today don\u2019t have a specific long-term cost goal,\u201d says Tom Billet, a Towers Watson senior consultant. \u201cTo use a football analogy, it\u2019s the difference between starting the game with a goal of scoring as many points as possible versus being behind by two touchdowns with three minutes left and knowing you have to score 14 points or you lose the game.\u201d\n\nBut is there any need to start making preparations so far in advance? Absolutely, says Ron Fontanetta, the consulting firm\u2019s senior health-care consulting leader. \u201cIt takes time to evolve and amend your program,\u201d he says. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t want to be in a position where they wake up in 2017 and realize they have to make dramatic changes in one year. They need to anticipate, based on their current cost structure, whether they are they likely to trigger the tax. And if they are, they should make changes over time in a thoughtful, rational, sequential way.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that, of course, Towers Watson and other human-capital consulting firms \u2014 several others are also advising companies to get moving now \u2014 get paid to help companies adjust their benefits strategies.\n\nSheldon Blumling, an attorney with Fisher & Phillips who advises companies on health-care matters, notes that many experts in the field believe that either the Cadillac tax\u2019s thresholds will be raised or it will be removed from the law altogether before 2018.\n\n\u201cAll the corporate people I\u2019ve talked to have said they\u2019re waiting to make decisions around this,\u201d says Blumling. \u201cWorrying about an excise tax that\u2019s four-plus years out is alarmist, as is much of what you read about health-care reform. There\u2019s a reason that provision was pushed so far out, which is that it\u2019s not very palatable politically.\u201d\n\nEd King, CFO of 600-employee Marina del Rey Hospital and a principal at Hardesty LLC, a national executive-services firm focused on the office of the CFO, says the Cadillac tax is nowhere near his radar screen yet. \u201cThings about that provision are likely to change,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with what my costs are going to be in the next six to 12 months.\u201d\n\nThe reality is, Blumling says, that very few employers are going to pay the tax. \u201cThat tax is going to set a standard for the value of group health plans, and employers and carriers are going to make sure their plans come in under the threshold. Nobody\u2019s going to be interested in paying a 40 percent excise tax.\u201d\n\nIn a recent address, Jonathan Gruber, an MIT professor who helped write the ACA, provided insight on the Cadillac tax. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear on what this is,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America today if you are paid in wages you are taxed; if you\u2019re paid in health insurance you\u2019re not. So if [my employer asked me whether I] wanted a $1,000 raise or $1,000 in orthodontia benefits for my daughter, I would say, \u2018if you give me a thousand-dollar raise I\u2019m going to take home $600. I\u2019ll choose the orthodontia.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat taxing system, Gruber said, has three fundamental flaws. First, it\u2019s incredibly expensive. \u201cIf we taxed health insurance like we tax wages, we would raise $250 billion a year more in tax revenues. That\u2019s twice what it would cost every uninsured American to buy health insurance.\u201d\n\nSecond, tax-free benefits are unfair because the richer someone is, the bigger tax break that person gets, by virtue of being in a higher tax bracket.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, it causes excessive health-care consumption. \u201cPeople are buying health care with 60-cent dollars, so they buy too much of it,\u201d Gruber said.\n\nThe Cadillac tax, he points out, is a compromise between taxing all health benefits and taxing none of them. \u201cIt\u2019s intended to neutralize the playing field between health insurance and wages. In doing so it\u2019s going to exert enormous downward pressure on the most-expensive health insurance policies and be a key cost-control device.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Gregory Moine", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, cadillac tax, excise tax, health-care reform, jonathan gruber, medical cost inflation, ron fontanetta, sheldon blumling, towers watson", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "The Affordable Care Act's excise tax on rich health-benefits plans to take effect in 2018 could be ruinous for some companies.
