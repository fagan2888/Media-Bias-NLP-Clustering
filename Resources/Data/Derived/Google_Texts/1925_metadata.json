A new study suggests while the overall number of El Ni\u00f1os is unlikely to increase, particularly strong \u201csuper\u201d El Ni\u00f1os are likely to occur twice as frequently in a warming world.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o refers to a pattern of unusually warm water stretching across the surface of eastern equatorial Pacific that occurs every 3-7 years. That warm water influences climate patterns around the world, increasing the likelihood of wet and cool weather in the Southeast, heavy rain in California, warm and dry conditions in the Pacific Northwest, and host of other global impacts.\n\nA map showing sea surface temperature anomalies leading up and during the 1997-98 super El Nino.\n\nCredit: NOAA View\n\nThe strongest El Nino ever recorded occurred in 1997-98. It led to heavy rains across the southern U.S., landslides in Peru, wildfires in Indonesia, and the cratering of the anchovy fishery in the eastern Pacific. These and other impacts were responsible an estimated $35-45 billion in damage and 23,000 deaths worldwide.\n\nAnother \u201csuper\u201d El Nino in 1982-83 wreaked similar havoc globally.\n\nIn a study published on Sunday in Nature Climate Change, researchers show that climate change could double the frequency of super El Nino events.\n\nTo obtain the results, researchers led by Wenjun Cai, a climate modeler at Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, used 20 climate models to simulate ocean temperatures and rainfall in the tropical Pacific with and without changes in greenhouse gases. Cai looked specifically at the period of December-February, when El Nino tends to peak and its impacts are the most widespread.\n\n\u201cUnder greenhouse warming the eastern equatorial Pacific warms faster than the surrounding regions . . . making it easier to have maximum SST (sea surface temperatures) in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and hence more occurrences of extreme El Nino events,\u201d Cai said in an email.\n\nSurface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific averages around 72\u00b0F, about 10\u00b0F cooler than the western tropical Pacific. Cai said that makes it easier to warm, which reduces the overall temperature difference between the two regions and makes conditions more ripe for super El Ninos to develop.\n\nSpecifically, the results show that the likelihood of super El Ninos doubles from one every 20 years in the previous century to one every 10 years in the 21st century.\n\nWhile the results show an increase in the number of abnormally strong El Ninos, they don\u2019t show a change in the total number of El Ninos. The study also shows that the the current influence El Nino has on weather elsewhere is unlikely to change. Both are results that other studies have found as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The strongest El Ni\u00f1o ever was nearly two decades ago.
