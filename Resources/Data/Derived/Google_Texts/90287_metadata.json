Now the ACS is recommending annual mammography start at age 45, cutting back to once every two years at age 55, and eliminating the screen altogether when a woman\u2019s future life expectancy falls inside of 10 years. As for the physical exam, the ACS no longer recommends it at all.\n\nThe reason for the change is that both screens provide so many stressful false positives that the ACS doesn\u2019t believe regular testing passes a cost-benefit test unless the woman is of \u201chigher than average risk.\u201d\n\nThe shift should be welcome news for women. Mammograms and doctor breast exams are charitably described as \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d and probably more accurately described as \u201cpainful and embarrassing.\u201d But the ACS change could become painful and embarrassing for the architects of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nOne of the most scrutinized provisions of the ACA is the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), whose ostensible job is to recommend cost-containment measures if Medicare expenditure projections begin to outpace a previously determined growth rate. In reality, IPAB is to monitor the cost and effectiveness of various types of care to determine which will be covered by Medicare, with the expectation that those decisions will serve as a template for private health insurers and other third-party payers. The hope is that IPAB\u2019s decisions will eliminate coverage of procedures that don\u2019t measure up, thereby \u201cbending the cost curve\u201d\u2014that is, reducing the nation\u2019s overall spending on health care.\n\nIPAB has been derided by critics as a \u201cdeath panel\u201d that could eliminate crucial care, and criticized by more thoughtful scholars as an unaccountable rationing board that will inject itself in decisions that ought to be private. In contrast, I\u2019ve argued that IPAB is more likely to be a paper tiger that may occasionally block some treatment or another, but will usually cave to political pressure and approve popularly appealing procedures and treatments that pass no reasonable cost-benefit test. Those decisions will then pressure third party payers to also cover the care. That way, IPAB will bend the cost curve\u2014just in the opposite direction from what the ACA writers intended.\n\nSo think of the ACS shift as a looming test of IPAB, as not-recommended breast cancer screenings are exactly the sort of Medicare expenditure the board should identify for elimination. So far, the \u201cprojected expenditures\u201d provision for the board (or the secretary of health and human services, acting in IPAB\u2019s stead) has not been triggered, so no cost-containment recommendations are currently forthcoming. Thus give IPAB an \u201cincomplete\u201d on this test for now\u2014but don\u2019t expect a good grade later.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American Cancer Society\u2019s new breast cancer screening guidelines provide an unpleasant first test for Obamacare\u2019s Independent Payments Advisory Board.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The American Cancer Society's new breast cancer screening guidelines provide an unpleasant first test for Obamacare's Independent Payments Advisory Board.", "title": "ACA\u2019s Looming IPAB Test", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/acas-looming-ipab-test", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/acas-looming-ipab-test", "title": "ACA\u2019s Looming IPAB Test", "description": "The American Cancer Society's new breast cancer screening guidelines provide an unpleasant first test for Obamacare's Independent Payments Advisory Board.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/10/21", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-21T14:24:34-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/10/21", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So think of the ACS shift as a looming test of IPAB, as not-recommended breast cancer screenings are exactly the sort of Medicare expenditure the board should identify for elimination.\nThus give IPAB an \u201cincomplete\u201d on this test for now\u2014but don\u2019t expect a good grade later.\nThat way, IPAB will bend the cost curve\u2014just in the opposite direction from what the ACA writers intended.\nThe hope is that IPAB\u2019s decisions will eliminate coverage of procedures that don\u2019t measure up, thereby \u201cbending the cost curve\u201d\u2014that is, reducing the nation\u2019s overall spending on health care.\nOne of the most scrutinized provisions of the ACA is the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), whose ostensible job is to recommend cost-containment measures if Medicare expenditure projections begin to outpace a previously determined growth rate."}
