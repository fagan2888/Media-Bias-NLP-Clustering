In typical Hebdo form, the magazine has chosen to mark the event with a provocative cover that features a bearded man representing God with a Kalashnikov slung over his shoulder, accompanied by the text: \u201cOne year later: the assassin is still out there.\u201d Their point? Little has changed.\n\nWhile the cover has already come under fire for crossing the line, including a condemnation from the Vatican, it\u2019s worth pausing to reflect on the fact that the cartoonists are right. Little has, indeed, changed: Charlie Hebdo is still suffering threats because they refuse to stop covering religion; the threat of extremism is still unchecked; and satirical media continues to offer the public a provocative view of the truth that we don\u2019t get from mainstream media.\n\nWhile millions rallied in support of \u201cCharlie Hebdo\u201d after the attacks, it was also true that in the days following many condemned the satirists for crossing the line and for using humor in ways that were degrading and disrespectful. Their choice to depict the Prophet Mohammed came under fire, as did their grotesquely sexualized cartoons. They were often critiqued for their staunch atheist and secularist views.\n\nWhile Charlie Hebdo might seem crass to U.S. audiences, it follows the humor genre found in Mad Magazine, South Park, The Onion and \u201cThe Simpsons;\u201d and it follows in the tradition of French absurdist humor. It satirizes features of French life but focuses more than half of its humor on politics. According to Le Monde, which analyzed a 10-year breakdown of Charilie Hebdo\u2019s cartoons, only 7.3 percent of all of their cartoons ridiculed religion and only 1.3 percent of their cartoons featured Islam.\n\nAnd yet, one year after some of their cartoonists were murdered for daring to draw the Prophet, they are still under fire for being intolerant of religion. The obsessive critique reveals two key issues: First, despite being attacked by terrorists, the Hebdo artists are still criticized for their worldviews more than the terrorists themselves; and second, leftist politics is caught in a tough bind when it comes to openly debating religion and conflict.\n\nCharlie Hebdo director Laurent Sourisseau, who goes by the name Riss, dives right into this thorny issue in the editorial he wrote to accompany his cartoon on the new cover. He explains that before the attacks he and his colleagues never thought it would be possible to be assassinated for cartoons: \u201cWe saw France as a secular haven, in which it was possible to take [a] piss, to lampoon, to have fun without a thought for dogmas or lunatics.\u201d He explains that one of their key mantras was \u201cFuck everything\u201d \u2014 a position that simply means that nothing is sacred, nothing is taboo. The idea was to cross every line in an effort to use irony and satire to question the status quo.\n\nBut he points out that he now sees he was wrong about France. Not only were there people plotting to kill him and his friends; but they were also under fire from \u201cembittered intellectuals, insipid columnists and jealous journalists who take the utmost care in making sure not to tread on dangerous ground by writing anything sincere.\u201d They were attacked by the religious for blasphemy and by the media because they dared to raise issues that the media was largely avoiding. One of those issues was the link between religion and terrorist violence.\n\nA weird consequence of this is that the secularism of Hebdo is often treated as more of a social threat than the religious convictions of the terrorists. And the reason for that, as Bill Maher has pointed out, is that we are more comfortable critiquing a group of comedians than we are asking tough questions about the role of Islam in contemporary conflict. As Maher puts it, we need to be able to talk about these issues without being condemned for Islamophobia just as we would want to talk about the religious ideology of the KKK.\n\nAt the core of the dilemma is the question of how to square a politics of tolerance and diversity with a commitment to rational thought and critical thinking that derives from secularism.\n\nThe Vatican newspaper claims that, \u201cIn Charlie Hebdo\u2019s choice, there is the sad paradox of a world which is more and more sensitive about being politically correct, almost to the point of ridicule, yet does not wish to acknowledge or to respect believers\u2019 faith in God, regardless of the religion.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch. Satirists like Hebdo\u2019s cartoonists or Maher don\u2019t care about being politically correct. They see it is a form of censorship and restriction that cuts off productive and necessary debate. They follow the line of thought that considers religion as the \u201copiate of the masses.\u201d And for that they are condemned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Irony, snarky comedy and satire still remain our best weapons against political folly and media spectacle", "title": "What the media can learn from Bill Maher: 1 year after Charlie Hebdo attack, satirists still taking risks news outlets won\u2019t", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Irony, snarky comedy and satire still remain our best weapons against political folly and media spectacle", "title": "What the media can learn from Bill Maher: 1 year after Charlie Hebdo attack, satirists still taking risks news outlets won\u2019t", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/09/what_the_media_can_learn_from_bill_maher_1_year_after_charlie_hebdo_attack_satirists_still_taking_risks_news_outlets_wont/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/bill_maher6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Irony, snarky comedy and satire still remain our best weapons against political folly and media spectacle", "title": "What the media can learn from Bill Maher: 1 year after Charlie Hebdo attack, satirists still taking risks news outlets won\u2019t", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/bill_maher6.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia A.
