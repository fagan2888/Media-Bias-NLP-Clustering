He also said he will not go forward with a bill increasing the government's borrowing authority without a similar conversation.\n\n\"We're not going to pass a clean debt limit increase,\" Boehner told ABC\u2019s This Week. As for the possibility of a first-ever default, Boehner said \u201cThat\u2019s the path we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Boehner and Obama traded salvos over the government shutdown Sunday.\n\nIn a tweet, the president called for a straight up and down vote in the House. \u201cThere are enough votes in the House to end the shutdown,\u201d he posted.\n\nBut Boehner dug in. \"I told the president, there's no way we're going to pass one. The votes are not in the House to pass a clean debt limit, and the president is risking default by not having a conversation with us,\" he said Sunday.\n\nBoehner said he doesn't know when the government shutdown will end, suggesting it was up to Obama to start negotiations.\n\nSince Tuesday, the Republican-led House of Representatives has passed several bills to reopen selected parts of the government.\n\nDemocratic leaders are resisting the piecemeal approach, saying the entire government should be reopened and the 800,000 federal workers on furlough sent back to work.\n\nOn Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, described the debt ceiling deadline as a means to extract concessions from Democrats.\n\nCruz, a darling of the GOP\u2019s tea party fringe, said the threat of a first-ever default is the best leverage that Congress has to rein in the White House.\n\nHe told CNN that any agreement to allow the government to borrow more money to pay its bills must include a \"significant\" plan to reduce future spending, no new taxes and \"mitigating the harms from Obamacare.\"\n\nAl Jazeera and The Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jack Lew says it would be 'reckless' and 'dangerous' to let Oct. 17 deadline lapse", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/6/treasury-secretarycongressrecklessindebtlimitfight.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/6/treasury-secretarycongressrecklessindebtlimitfight/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Jack_lew_FTN100613.1381098087256.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Jack Lew says it would be 'reckless' and 'dangerous' to let Oct. 17 deadline lapse", "title": "Congress 'playing with fire' over debt ceiling: US Treasury Secretary"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/6/treasury-secretarycongressrecklessindebtlimitfight/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Jack_lew_FTN100613.1381098087256.jpg", "description": "Jack Lew says it would be 'reckless' and 'dangerous' to let Oct. 17 deadline lapse", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress 'playing with fire' over debt ceiling: US Treasury Secretary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Shutdown, Health Care, Barack Obama, John Boehner, Obamacare, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9de8\"", "article_summary": "US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew calls on Congress to 'end threats' over debt limit REUTERS/CBS News/Chris Usher/Handout via ReutersU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew accused Congress of \u201cplaying with fire\u201d over an approaching deadline to raise the debt ceiling, as Republican opponents of the White House vowed to not pass a clean bill over the issue.\n\"We're not going to pass a clean debt limit increase,\" Boehner told ABC\u2019s This Week.\nBut House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Sunday it would be President Barack Obama\u2019s fault if Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling.\nOn Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, described the debt ceiling deadline as a means to extract concessions from Democrats.\nThe votes are not in the House to pass a clean debt limit, and the president is risking default by not having a conversation with us,\" he said Sunday."}
