The American public is about due for another maybe-maybe not prediction from Dick Morris. Here it is, as seen in The Hill:

Those with insurance under ObamaCare are … about to find out how fraudulent is the president’s promise that they can keep their doctor or hospital. With many doctors refusing to participate in the program, the president cannot keep this promise. When all this hits the fan, the political consequence for Obama and his Democratic allies will be horrific in 2014.

In December, Morris similarly wrote that “ObamaCare sends a crushing political burden to blue states.”

That should give comfort to Republicans. But as is necessary, a reminder of the last time Morris predicted a devastating defeat for Democrats.
