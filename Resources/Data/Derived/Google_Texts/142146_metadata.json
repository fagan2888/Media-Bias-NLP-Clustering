Sometimes she\u2019d cross her legs tightly, trying to make it all stop \u2014 to no avail.\n\n\u201cI had to live with it,\u201d said the 50-year-old Frederick woman, who suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease. \u201cI tried to keep it to a dull roar, but that was the best that I could do.\u201d\n\nThat all changed in a matter of hours after Spletter recently underwent a groundbreaking procedure at the University of Maryland Medical Center that guided ultrasound waves through her skull to kill the brain cells interfering with her motor skills. She\u2019s participating in a clinical study looking at a cutting-edge way \u2014 known as focused ultrasound \u2014 to possibly treat certain Parkinson\u2019s symptoms noninvasively.\n\nAs many as 1 million people in the United States live with Parkinson\u2019s, a nervous system disorder that affects movement and becomes progressively worse over time. The disease most often afflicts older people, but about 4 percent of those suffering from it are under age 50. Symptoms include tremors, stiff limbs, trouble balancing and a general slowdown in movement. Medications can ease the symptoms but may trigger other side effects in patients.\n\nSpletter was the first at the University of Maryland Medical Center to participate in the study, which also is being conducted in Korea, Canada and at the University of Virginia.\n\nSpletter said many of her painful symptoms have subsided, and she is looking forward to evening walks in downtown Frederick as her condition continues to improve.\n\n\u201cI feel like a got a new lease on life,\u201d she said. \u201cMy quality of life has improved so much.\u201d\n\nThe question is for how long.\n\nScientists already know that targeting specific cells in the brain can minimize Parkinson\u2019s symptoms. But current treatments involve more aggressive tactics than the procedure doctors performed on Spletter.\n\nThe more common method is to cut a hole into a patient\u2019s head and put electrodes on a specific part of the brain. A stimulator implanted under the skin of a patient\u2019s collar bone transmits small electrical pulses to block symptoms.\n\nDoctors also can use radiation to destroy cells or insert a needle through the head and use radio frequency waves to heat the cells to destroy them.\n\nThere were no cuts made to Spletter\u2019s skull as part of her procedure. The most she felt was intense pressure from a metal frame and helmet tightened around her head to prevent it from moving.\n\nUltrasonic waves were directed through Spletter\u2019s skull, much like a magnifying glass aims sunlight at a certain spot. The waves provide energy that is low enough that they don\u2019t damage the brain as they pass through, but, where they meet at single point, the energy adds up, creating enough heat to kill the cells.\n\nThe procedure was done as Spletter lay in a MRI machine so doctors could watch what was happening. They would stop from time to time to see if she was having vision problems or other side affects that might signal they weren\u2019t targeting the correct part of the brain.\n\nOnce they had a target, doctors asked Spletter to perform certain exercises, such as touching her thumb to her finger or pretending to press a gas pedal with her foot, to see if the surgery was working.\n\n\u201cThe effects are immediate,\u201d said Dr. Paul Fishman, a professor of neurology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who has treated Spletter for several years and recommended she participate in the trial. \u201cWe saw improvement in her Parkinson\u2019s while doing her procedure.\u201d\n\nSpletter could not believe what was happening.\n\n\u201cIt was a miracle,\u201d she said.\n\nThe procedure performed on Spletter is one of many in the rapidly growing medical field of focused ultrasound. When the Focused Ultrasound Foundation was founded nine years ago, the therapy was being looked at to treat three conditions. Today, there are more than 58 ways the treatment is being used in various stages of research, development and commercialization.\n\nIt has been used to treat fibroid tumors, brain tumors and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are plans for a clinical trial to see it could be used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The Parkinson\u2019s study builds off a previous pilot trial that looked at focused ultrasound to treat essential tremor, another progressive movement disorder.\n\n\u201cThis is just one arrow in the quiver that neurosurgeons will have, if it works, to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. Neal F. Kassell, founder and chairman of the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, which is funding part of the study, and a professor of neurosurgery at the University of Virginia.\n\nKassell and the University of Maryland researchers caution that more research is needed to determine how effective the treatment is in treating Parkinson\u2019s. The study Spletter participated in will ultimately include 40 patients, who will be followed for a year.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we don\u2019t know is whether this is durable,\u201d said Dr. Howard M. Eisenberg, principal investigator and the Raymond K. Thompson Chair of Neurosurgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Spletter \u201cwas good today. She was seen a few days ago, and she was good. We don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be good in six months.\u201d\n\nA larger study will need to be done eventually.\n\n\u201cIt is in its early stages,\u201d Kassell said. \u201cIt remains to be proven definitively in a rigorous scientific trial whether it provides true value in terms of improving outcomes and reducing costs.\u201d\n\nThe study also is limited in scope. For instance, researchers are looking only at subjects with symptoms on one side of their bodies. Parkinson\u2019s only affects the left side of Spletter\u2019s body. Participants also must have had a negative reaction to levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson\u2019s that sometimes leads to a poor quality of life.\n\nSpletter was nervous about participating in the trial at first.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough information out there about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had been the 5,000th patient, I would be pretty calm about it. But fear of the unknown kept bothering me.\u201d\n\nBut Spletter\u2019s condition had become so bad that she was hoping for any relief. She couldn\u2019t walk anywhere and was almost always in pain. At restaurants, she sat on the inside of booths so people wouldn\u2019t stare at her trembling leg.\n\nShe knows there is a chance the effects of the procedure might not last long. For now, she is enjoying her new life _ and looking forward to those downtown walks.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you can\u2019t do it, it is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BALTIMORE \u2014 Kimberly Spletter\u2019s knee would pop backward involuntarily, or her leg would shake uncontrollably.
