The tax, projected to bring in $29 billion over 10 years, was considered a financial pillar of the Affordable Care Act but has been blamed for stifling medical innovation as R & D budgets were cut in response to the tax. A repeal of the tax is favorable to both the U.S. and the global MedTech industry with regard to optimized distribution channels.\n\nPartnerTech Inc., located in Atlanta, Georgia, presents the opportunity for manufacture of multiple products in their single facility now with the addition of ISO 13485.
