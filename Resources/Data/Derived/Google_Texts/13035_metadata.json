Because otherwise \u201cgovernment loses the ability to deliver for citizens and citizens lose respect for government. Our Democracy is the loser.\u201d\n\nMr. Summers uses the analogy of war. \u201cEveryone understands that when the country is at war, even a war they oppose, vigorous oversight is essential, but, in the end, there is an obligation to support American troops. In the same way, history will not judge kindly those who, having lost political debates, go beyond vigorous oversight and seek to subvert enacted programs. \u201c\n\nOpposing Bad Laws Does not Weaken Democracy\n\nLet\u2019s take some historical examples. In 1850, the U.S. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act. It stated that any runaway slave had to be returned to his master, even if he had escaped to what before the Civil War were the \u201cfree states\u201d in which human slavery was already prohibited. Indeed, any person harboring a fugitive slave was subject to a $1,000 fine and six months in prison.\n\nIt was argued at the time that the act was an attempt to calm the fears of the Southern slave states that the Northern states would try to undermine that \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d by offering refuge and protection to those who could successfully escape to one of the \u201cfree states.\u201d\n\nShould every American have done his best to track down and turn in runaway slaves, and inform on neighbors, friends, and even relatives who were hiding such slaves? After all, it was the law of the land; it was meant to maintain the \u201cunity\u201d of the country against the dangers of regional division.\n\nAbolitionists and other opponents of slavery considered it to be an abomination against morality and justice to make it a crime to give \u201caid and comfort\u201d to the fugitive slave. Of course, instead, there were many in the Northern states who assisted in what was known as the \u201cunderground railroad,\u201d which helped runaway slaves to illegally escape to Canada where slavery had long been abolished.\n\nWere these active opponents of slavery who had, up to that time, lost the \u201cpolitical debate,\u201d to now do nothing to challenge the law, lest Americans lose their respect for government, and weaken democracy?\n\nCriticizing Bad Wars is Not Unpatriotic\n\nLarry Summers uses the analogy of war, when he says, even if you have opposed a war, it is your duty as an American is to support the troops. But what if it is an unjust war? That is, a war that is not in defense of the nation in response to the aggressive attack of another country, or to any present and evidently clear \u201cdanger\u201d?\n\nInstead, it is a war in which your government is the aggressor against another nation. In which the soldiers of your country are violating the freedom and property of another people. Should the attitude be \u201cmy country, right or wrong,\u201d due to your government\u2019s military adventure placing the servicemen of your nation in \u201charm\u2019s way\u201d?\n\nThere was a small number of Germans who chose to oppose the Nazi regime during the Second World War. During about a six-month period in 1942-1943, a small group of German students known as the \u201cWhite Rose\u201d clandestinely distributed anti-Hitler leaflets and wrote anti-war graffiti on walls. Six of the most prominent members of the \u201cWhite Rose\u201d were captured by the Gestapo and shortly afterward beheaded.\n\nWere they young men and women of moral courage and character, or were they enemies of national unity preventing the government from \u201cdelivering\u201d on its promises, and therefore undermining \u201crespect\u201d for the Nazi German government?\n\nI am sure that Mr. Summers would accuse me of drawing upon two unfair examples that have nothing in common with implementing something as \u201cwell intentioned\u201d as ObamaCare.\n\nPolitical Paternalism versus Individual Liberty\n\nBut that is the point. Is ObamaCare a \u201cbenign\u201d and \u201csocially just\u201d piece of legislation that merely is intended to assure an equality of reasonable and \u201cfair\u201d access to health care for all in America?\n\nOr is it, instead, a threat to the traditional values and principles of a free society, in which it is neither the duty nor responsibility of the government to act as a paternalistic \u201cmaster\u201d dictating and imposing what those in the government consider \u201cgood\u201d for the people?\n\nFor the opponents of ObamaCare it is precisely an issue of personal liberty versus political servitude. That Mr. Summers and others who share his views on this and related policy issues cannot see how anyone can view it in such \u201cideologically extreme\u201d terms, merely shows the opponents of the Affordable Care Act how far the country has moved away from its founding understanding of the meaning of individual freedom and self-responsibility.\n\nOr as the famous 19th century German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, once expressed it, \u201cNone are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.\u201d\n\nMany of the consistent opponents of increasing government power and paternalism in American society are following in the footsteps of the 18th and 19th century classical liberals, who considered it their moral duty to defend personal, social and economic liberty.\n\nChanging Masters Still Equals Servitude\n\nBoth private slavery and political servitude in the form of government dependency were viewed as the enemy of the rights of the individual to his life, liberty and honestly acquired property. Such political paternalism stripped the individual of his personal dignity and his opportunity to be a self-governing, free human being.\n\nChanging \u201cmasters\u201d from the absolute king or the plantation owner to the \u201cwill of the majority\u201d in an election does not change the essence of servitude one bit. Thus, there is nothing \u201cunpatriotic\u201d or \u201cdisrespectful\u201d of government in a democracy when those who may have temporarily \u201clost the debate\u201d continue to insist that the \u201cdebate\u201d is not over.\n\nWrong-headed and misguided legislation has been overturned in the past. And such will be the case, no doubt, in the future again. For the critics and opponents of ObamaCare the issue of liberty versus political paternalism is not decided based on one vote. It is a battle of ideas and policy that is a continuous one.\n\nAnd if some members of Congress, expressing the will of their constituents, wish to use all lawful and Constitutionally permissible means to limit the damage of what they see as legislative threats to that liberty, then they are neither unpatriotic nor disrespectful of representative government.\n\nThey are merely defending the conception of liberty that inspired the Declaration of Independence and the writing of the United States Constitution.\n\n[Article originally published on Epictimes.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/11/opposing-bad-laws-like-obamacare-is-not-un-american/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare-logo_full.png", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Opposing Bad Laws Like ObamaCare is Not Un-American"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3100\"", "article_summary": "For the critics and opponents of ObamaCare the issue of liberty versus political paternalism is not decided based on one vote.\nSuch political paternalism stripped the individual of his personal dignity and his opportunity to be a self-governing, free human being.\n\u201cOpposing Bad Laws Does not Weaken DemocracyLet\u2019s take some historical examples.\nPolitical Paternalism versus Individual LibertyBut that is the point.\nFor the opponents of ObamaCare it is precisely an issue of personal liberty versus political servitude."}
