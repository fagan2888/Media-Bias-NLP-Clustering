In phase two, the investigators surveyed select second-year PA students who had completed at least four weeks in a primary care rotation.\n\nOf the 87 faculty who responded to the survey, more than 60% reported that they teach concepts related to physician-directed teams, principles of quality improvement, care coordination, and electronic health records in the didactic phase.\n\nWith regard to participation in quality improvement projects, 38% of faculty stated that their students do not participate in quality improvement projects, 26.7% stated that some students participate, and only 14.7% reported that all students participate. Of the respondent faculty, 20% answered that they did not know if their students participated in a quality improvement project.\n\nOnly 23% of responding students reported encountering quality improvement projects during their primary care rotation and only 9% reported that they participated in these projects.\n\n\u201cOur study suggests that many PA programs have started teaching some of the concepts of quality improvement during the didactic phase, but participation in quality improvement projects during clinical rotations remains limited,\u201d wrote the researchers.\n\n\u201cMany employers are now expecting PA graduates to have basic knowledge of quality improvement, a concerted effort is needed to better prepare PA students to function in these emerging quality care-driven environments.\u201d\n\nReferences", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,cancertherapyadvisor.com,chemotherapyadvisor.com,clinicaladvisor.com,clinicalpainadvisor.com,empr.com,endocrinologyadvisor.com,infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com,mycme.com,neurologyadvisor.com,oncologynurseadvisor.com,psychiatryadvisor.com,renalandurologynews.com", "news_keywords": "AAPA 2015, Physician Assistants, Students", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "Clinical Advisor", "description": "Less than 10% of physician assistant students reported participating in quality improvement projects during their primary care clinical rotations.", "title": "Quality improvement participation lacking among physician assistant students", "url": "http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/aapa-2015-annual-meeting/physician-assistant-students-quality-improvement-clinical-rotations/article/416712/", "image": "http://media.clinicaladvisor.com/images/2015/01/14/lifeasnursepractitionerstu_711956_711957.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Less than 10% of physician assistant students reported participating in quality improvement projects during their primary care clinical rotations.", "creator": "@@BrianneCliniAd", "image": {"src": "http://media.clinicaladvisor.com/images/2015/01/14/lifeasnursepractitionerstu_711956_711957.png"}, "title": "Quality improvement participation lacking among physician assistant students", "site": "@ClinicalAdvisor", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=560576498", "fb": {"app_id": 192680054084788}, "google-site-verification": "XulxkiFWEPyxheHjOZuqhAMgO-BVDn-SoydyqDALxeI", "article": {"section": "AAPA 2015 Annual Meeting", "tag": "Students", "published_time": "2015-05-26T13:39:10", "modified_time": "2015-05-26T14:59:21"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Less than 10% of physician assistant students reported participating in quality improvement projects during their primary care clinical rotations."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce496\"", "article_summary": "Quality improvement participation lacking among physician assistant studentsShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintQuality improvement participation lacking among PA studentsSAN FRANCISCIO \u2014 More needs to be done to improve physician assistant student participation in quality improvement projects during clinical rotations, results of a poster presented at the American Academy of Physician Assistants 2015 meeting indicate.\nWith regard to participation in quality improvement projects, 38% of faculty stated that their students do not participate in quality improvement projects, 26.7% stated that some students participate, and only 14.7% reported that all students participate.\n\u201cOur study suggests that many PA programs have started teaching some of the concepts of quality improvement during the didactic phase, but participation in quality improvement projects during clinical rotations remains limited,\u201d wrote the researchers.\nThe United States health care system has gone through many transformations to improve the quality of the patient experience, improve population health, and reduce health care costs.\nOf the respondent faculty, 20% answered that they did not know if their students participated in a quality improvement project."}
