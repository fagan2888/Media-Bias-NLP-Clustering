President Obama is hitting the links at the Woodmont Country Club in Maryland on Saturday after a week hosting foreign dignitaries at the White House.

The outing comes after a week in which Obama welcomed Pope Francis on his first trip the U.S. and received Chinese President Xi Jinping for an official state visit.

The president, who has never played at the Rockville club before, is being joined on the course by Joe Paulson, John Shulman, and former deputy secretary of State Tom Nides.

Obama has another busy week of diplomacy ahead. He's is slated to leave for New York City on Sunday for three days of talks at the United Nations, which is holding its 70th General Assembly.

On Monday, he's expected to sit down for side talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with Syria and Ukraine high on their agenda.

He will also attend a Democratic National Committee LGBT fundraiser in New York on Sunday evening. In attendance at the gala will be LGBT activist and former “Star Trek” actor George Takei and U.S. women’s national soccer team star Abby Wambach.
