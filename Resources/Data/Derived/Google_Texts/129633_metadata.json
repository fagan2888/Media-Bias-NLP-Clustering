Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nThe British Psychology Society (BPS) held its annual conference on the psychology of women last week in the UK, with themes ranging from gender and politics to feminist activism to domestic violence. The latter theme extended to the effects it has on children who witness it \u2014 and in one particular paper, researchers found a stronger social bond could counteract the adverse effects these children face when they grow up.\n\nDomestic violence has devastating effects on women, but also children, UNICEF reported. Children who have been exposed to violence in the home \u201cmay have difficulty learning and limited social skills, exhibit violence, risk, or delinquent behavior, or suffer from depression or severe anxiety.\u201d UNICEF added that children growing up in violent environments are also more likely to be victims of child abuse.\n\nGiven prior research has shown a strong social bond can \u201cact as a beneficial psychological resource, especially in times of need,\u201d Catherine Naughton, study author and doctoral candidate at the University of Limerick, teamed up with her colleagues to investigate whether these bonds could improve self-esteem and anxiety in young people who\u2019d been exposed to domestic violence when they were younger.\n\nResearchers questioned 465 young people aged 17 to 25 about their experiences with domestic violence, their family (parents or a caregiver), and their psychological well-being. The answers indicated exposure had a negative impact on their self-esteem, anxiety, and the bond they had with their family in comparisong to young people who grew up in non-violent homes.\n\nThe silver lining was that \u201cthe presence of strong family bonds\u201d worked as a sort-of buffer to the effects children often sustained from being exposed to violence. And yet, the majority of young people in this study reported more weaker bonds than stronger ones.\n\n\u201cAlthough strong family bonds can help raise self-esteem and reduce anxiety for some young people who grow up in homes affected by domestic violence, sadly, the majority are likely to report weak family bonds,\u201d Naughton said. \u201cTherefore they are unable to benefit from the psychological benefits strong family bonds provide.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important then, Naughton added, that parents understand the protective effects a stronger bond can have. Ultimately, this kind of bond provides an \u201cinherent sense of belonging within the extended family,\u201d providing positive psychological support.\n\nSource: British Psychological Society POWS Annual Conference, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "strong, family, ties, improve, self, esteem, anxiety, children, who, experienced, domestic", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "British researchers find strong bonds between children and their parents or caregivers can improve their mental health after growing up in a violent home.", "title": "Closeness To Family Makes Life Better For Kids Who Grow Up In Violent Homes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/strong-family-ties-improve-self-esteem-anxiety-children-who-experienced-domestic-342518", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/family-ties.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "British researchers find strong bonds between children and their parents or caregivers can improve their mental health after growing up in a violent home.", "title": "Closeness To Family Makes Life Better For Kids Who Grow Up In Violent Homes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/strong-family-ties-improve-self-esteem-anxiety-children-who-experienced-domestic-342518", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/family-ties.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/family-ties.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-07-11T12:32:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-11T12:31:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "British researchers find strong bonds between children and their parents or caregivers can improve their mental health after growing up in a violent home."}, "article_summary": "\u201cAlthough strong family bonds can help raise self-esteem and reduce anxiety for some young people who grow up in homes affected by domestic violence, sadly, the majority are likely to report weak family bonds,\u201d Naughton said.\nThe silver lining was that \u201cthe presence of strong family bonds\u201d worked as a sort-of buffer to the effects children often sustained from being exposed to violence.\nBritish researchers find strong bonds between children and their parents or caregivers can improve their mental health after being growing up in a violent home.\nResearchers questioned 465 young people aged 17 to 25 about their experiences with domestic violence, their family (parents or a caregiver), and their psychological well-being.\n\u201cTherefore they are unable to benefit from the psychological benefits strong family bonds provide.\u201dIt\u2019s important then, Naughton added, that parents understand the protective effects a stronger bond can have."}
