Rowe Price.\n\nBut the percentage of employees making Roth contributions remains low\u2014at around 10 percent\u2014research findings from consultancy Willis Towers Watson reveal. That's because many employers have yet to appreciate and, in some cases, communicate effectively the full potential of the Roth 401(k) option.\n\nIn Roth 401(k) plans, employees make contributions using after-tax dollars and are able to take tax-free withdrawals at retirement. Consequently, Roth contributions can offer tax diversification for retirees as they begin to take taxable distributions from regular 401(k) plans or receive taxable payments from defined benefit pension plans. And, unlike with regular or \u201ctraditional\u201d 401(k)s, contributions to a Roth 401(k) are not subject to minimum distribution requirements after age 70\u00bd if they are rolled over to a Roth\n\n\u201cA Roth 401(k) account can be a tremendously valuable vehicle for employees to save for retirement,\u201d said Marina Edwards, a senior retirement consultant at Willis Towers Watson in Madison, Wis.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, many employers have yet to appreciate and, in some cases, communicate effectively the full potential of the Roth option,\u201d added Kevin Wagner, a senior retirement consultant in the firm\u2019s Atlanta office.\n\nWhen the Roth 401(k) option was first allowed starting in 2006, under a provision in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, it was often viewed as administratively cumbersome, Edwards and Wagner said. Now, retirement plan providers and payroll companies have largely eliminated many of the hurdles.\n\n\u201cWhen employees bypass Roth 401(k) contributions, they unnecessarily narrow their tools for tax-effective retirement savings,\u201d said Wagner. \u201cRoth contributions can help some retirees keep their marginal tax rate low and avoid triggering taxes on their Social Security benefits,\u201d since money that comes out of a Roth is not considered taxable income, he pointed out. Another consideration is that for an employee who retires before age 65, \u201cRoth 401(k) distributions may enable them to qualify for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he added.\n\nTo help boost employees\u2019 understanding of the savings opportunity the Roth option provides, a recent report by Willis Towers Watson, Capturing the Opportunity of Roth 401(k) Contributions, suggests that organizations:\n\n\u2022 Communicate program features and benefits clearly and regularly. Because one size does not fit all, segment employees by identifying their various needs based on life stages, life events and other characteristics. Communications should be tailored to these segments, and messages should be short and action-oriented.\n\n\u2022 Use an interactive approach to reach employees. In addition to traditional retirement education tools such as newsletters, online webcasts and providing account statements, consider using mobile apps and digital technology to engage employees.\n\n\u2022 Provide effective retirement planning models to help employees better understand their retirement plan options. Models should include total estimated retirement income, pay growth, inflation, tax effects and health care costs.\n\n\u2022 Implement a process to monitor employee financial well-being on an ongoing basis. This can be achieved through plan-level analysis focused on when employees will be financially ready to retire.\n\nStephen Miller, CEBS, is an online editor/manager for SHRM.
