Conservatives have figured out a neat little rhetorical trick: One lie is easy for your opponents to debunk. Tell one lie after another, however, and your opponent\u2019s debunkings will never catch up. By the time the liberal opposition has debunked one lie, there\u2019s a dozen more to take its place.\n\nScience educator Eugenie Scott deemed the technique the \u201cGish Gallop,\u201d named for a notoriously sleazy creationist named Duane Gish. The Urban Dictionary defines the Gish Gallop as a technique that \u201cinvolves spewing so much bullshit in such a short span on that your opponent can\u2019t address let alone counter all of it.\u201d Often users of the Gish Gallop know their arguments are nonsense or made in bad faith, but don\u2019t particularly care because they are so dead set on advancing their agenda. Unfortunately, the strategy is so effective that it\u2019s been expanding rapidly in right-wing circles. Here are just a few of the most disturbing examples of the Gish Gallop in action.\n\n1. Creationism. It\u2019s no surprise creationists inspired the coining of the term Gish Gallop, as they have perfected the art of making up nonsense faster than scientists can refute it. The list of false or irrelevant claims made by creationists, as chronicled by Talk Origins, numbers in the dozens, perhaps even hundreds, and more are always being spun out. Trying to argue with a creationist, therefore, turns into a hellish game of Whack-A-Mole. Debunk the lie that the speed of light is not constant, and you\u2019ll find he\u2019s already arguing that humans co-existed with dinosaurs. Argue that it\u2019s unconstitutional to put the story of Adam and Eve in the science classroom, and find he\u2019s pretending he was never asking for that and instead wants to \u201cteach the controversy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeaching the controversy\u201d is a classic Gish Gallop apology. The conservative wants to make it seem like he\u2019s supporting open-minded debate, but instead he just wants an opportunity to dump a bunch of lies on students with the knowledge that they\u2019ll never have the time and attention to carefully parse every debunking.\n\n2. Climate change denialism.This strategy worked so well for creationism it makes perfect sense that it would be imported to the world of climate change denialism. Climate change denialists have many changing excuses for why they reject the science showing that human-caused greenhouse gases are changing the climate, but what all these reasons have in common is they are utter nonsense in service of a predetermined opposition to taking any action to prevent further damage.\n\nSkeptical Science, a website devoted to debunking right-wing lies on this topic, has compiled a dizzying list of 176 common claims by climate denialists and links to why they are false. Some of these lies directly contradict each other. For instance, it can\u2019t both be true that climate change is \u201cnatural\u201d and that it\u2019s not happening at all. No matter, since the point of these lies is not to create a real discussion about the issue, but to confuse the issue so much it\u2019s impossible to get any real momentum behind efforts to stop global warming.\n\n3. The Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s not just science where conservatives have discovered the value in telling lies so fast you simply wear your opposition out. When it comes to healthcare reform, the lying has been relentless. There are the big lies, such as calling Obamacare \u201csocialism,\u201d which implies a single-payer system, when in fact, it\u2019s about connecting the uninsured with private companies and giving consumers of healthcare a basic set of rights. In a sense, even the name \u201cObamacare\u201d is a lie, as the bill was, per the President\u2019s explicit wishes, written by Congress.\n\nBut there are also the small lies: The ACA funds abortion. Under the ACA, old people will be forcibly euthanized. Obamacare somehow covers undocumented immigrants. Congress exempted itself from Obamacare (one of the lies that doesn\u2019t even make sense, as it\u2019s not a program you could really get exempted from). Healthcare will add a trillion dollars to the deficit.\n\nThe strategy of just lying and lying and lying some more about the ACA has gotten to the point where Fox News is just broadcasting lies accusing the Obama administration of lying. When it was reported that the administration was going to hit its projections for the number of enrollments through healthcare.gov, a subculture of \u201cenrollment truthers\u201d immediately sprang up to spread a variety of often conflicting lies to deny that these numbers are even real. It started soft, with some conservatives suggesting that some enrollments shouldn\u2019t count or arguing, without a shred of evidence, that huge numbers of new enrollees won\u2019t pay their premiums. Now the lying is blowing up to the shameless level, with \u201ccooking the books\u201d being a common false accusation or, as with Jesse Watters on Fox, straight up accusing the White House of making the number up. Perhaps soon there will be demands to see all these new enrollees\u2019 birth certificates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right still somehow insists that climate change isn't real and that the ACA will euthanize old people", "title": "5 things conservatives lie about shamelessly", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The right still somehow insists that climate change isn't real and that the ACA will euthanize old people", "title": "5 things conservatives lie about shamelessly", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/05/5_things_conservatives_lie_about_shamelessly_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/Bill-Oreily-921-e1415888844596.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The right still somehow insists that climate change isn't real and that the ACA will euthanize old people", "title": "5 things conservatives lie about shamelessly", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/Bill-Oreily-921-e1415888844596.jpeg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Climate Change, Conservatives, Creationism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ff2\"", "article_summary": "Climate change denialism.This strategy worked so well for creationism it makes perfect sense that it would be imported to the world of climate change denialism.\nFor instance, it can\u2019t both be true that climate change is \u201cnatural\u201d and that it\u2019s not happening at all.\nConservatives have figured out a neat little rhetorical trick: One lie is easy for your opponents to debunk.\nHere are just a few of the most disturbing examples of the Gish Gallop in action.\nScience educator Eugenie Scott deemed the technique the \u201cGish Gallop,\u201d named for a notoriously sleazy creationist named Duane Gish."}
