Ryan has invited a group of nuns fighting Obamacare\u2019s \u201ccontraception mandate\u201d to be among his honored guests Tuesday at President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address to Congress.\n\nSisters Loraine Marie Maguire and Constance Veit will represent the Little Sisters of the Poor, a nonprofit that provides care for the elderly and has fought the administration\u2019s birth control rules all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nReligious nonprofits are pushing for a full exemption from the mandate, an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that requires employers to cover 20 types of FDA-approved contraceptives as part of their health plans.\n\nThe justices shielded certain corporations from the rules in 2014, citing protections within the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993.\n\nThis term, the court will look beyond the mandate itself and decide if the government\u2019s olive branch to the objecting nonprofits still imposes an undue burden.\n\nAn accommodation drafted by the Health and Human Services Department requires objecting nonprofits to opt out on paper, so a third party can manage and pay for the coverage.\n\nObjecting nonprofits say the rules still make them complicit in providing drugs and services they view as sinful.\n\n\u201cFor us, this has nothing to do with politics,\u201d Sister Constance told the National Review. \u201cWe just want to take care of the elderly poor without being forced to violate the faith that animates our work.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, and 206 other member of Congress filed a brief with the Supreme Court Monday that asks the justices to side with the nonprofits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul D.
