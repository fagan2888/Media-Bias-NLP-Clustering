I never called him and said, would you do it? In fact, the governor that was after him ultimately approved it. But I never spoke to Jeb. I never called up Jeb and said, \u2018Jeb, would you do me a favor and approve?\u2019 If I wanted it I would have done that.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos said, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying, you are accepting that you were trying to get casino gambling there?\u201d\u2018\n\nTrump answered, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at deals all over the world. I\u2019m doing deals all over the world. Yeah, we were looking at the Florida, but ultimately, Charlie Crist, the next governor, approved casino gambling right after Jeb. I never called Jeb. The question was, did I call Jeb? It was very premature. It was very early. There were other steps they would have to take. It was premature. I would have called Jeb and I think he might have done it for me, because I did help him. But I never called him and therefore I think I was 100 percent accurate in my answer.\u201d\n\nSee the video of the debate exchange below:\n\nFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump: I Was 100% Accurate on Jeb Casino Exchange", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump: I Was 100% Accurate on Jeb Casino Exchange", "title": "Trump: I Was 100 Percent Accurate on Jeb-Casino Exchange - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/trumps.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-20T08:20:50-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/20/trump-i-was-100-percent-accurate-on-jeb-casino-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump: I Was 100% Accurate on Jeb Casino Exchange", "title": "Trump: I Was 100 Percent Accurate on Jeb-Casino Exchange - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/trumps.jpg", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Trump: I Was 100% Accurate on Jeb Casino Exchange", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-20T08:20:20-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-09-20T08:20:50-07:00", "tag": "Jeb Bush", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I would have called Jeb and I think he might have done it for me, because I did help him.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSunday on \u201cThis Week,\u201d host George Stephanopoulos asked Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump about his exchange with his rival Jeb Bush about casino gambling in Florida Wednesday night at the Republican presidential debate.\nBut I never called him and therefore I think I was 100 percent accurate in my answer.\u201dSee the video of the debate exchange below:Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nI never called Jeb.\nYeah, we were looking at the Florida, but ultimately, Charlie Crist, the next governor, approved casino gambling right after Jeb."}
