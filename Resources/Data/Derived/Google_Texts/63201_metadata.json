(For 2015 that's up to $29,175 for a single person, $39,325 for a couple, and $59,624 for a family of four. Details here.)\n\nUnfortunately, many people eligible to buy these plans may never realize it because of the way HealthCare.gov, the site that sells health insurance to individuals in 38 states, displays plan results. Instead, they may end up with plans that, although their premiums are slightly lower, have extremely high deductibles that could put health care out of reach financially.\n\nThe plans they\u2019re missing are special versions of the mid-priced Silver plans, the most popular of the four \u201cmetal tiers\u201d\u2014Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum\u2014sold on the state Health Insurance Marketplaces.\n\nWhereas regular Silver plans cover about 70 percent of the average person\u2019s health care costs, the special Silver plans cover 73, 87, or 94 percent, depending on the person\u2019s income. That translates into much lower deductibles, copays and coinsurance. The Silver 87 plan is more generous than a regular Gold plan, and the Silver 94 plan is more generous than a Platinum plan. But the customer doesn't pay a higher premium for these plans than for the standard version of the plan. In other words, they\u2019re a fantastic deal.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. When people in the eligible income range window-shop on HealthCare.gov, the only clue they have that the special plans are available is the fine print on the initial eligibility page. It says, \u201cThis household may also be eligible for a cost-sharing reduction on a Silver plan that reduces the out-of-pocket expenses paid for deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.\u201d\n\nBut when the shoppers then click on the button that says \u201cContinue to plans,\u201d the plans with the lowest premiums are displayed first. These are the Bronze plans. But even though the Bronze plans may have somewhat lower premiums, they don\u2019t have the cost-sharing reductions and can have extremely high deductibles.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, HealthCare.gov, state health insurance marketplaces, state health exchanges, health exchange, ACA, Obamacare, affordable healthcare law, Medicaid, special Silver plans, metal levels, Silver plans, Gold plans, Platinum plans, Bronze plans, cost-sharing, out-of-pocket costs, actuarial value, Silver 87 plans, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Minnesota, Kentucky, Idaho, California, Hawaii, cost sharing subsidies, Consumer Reports, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance", "Title": "Why is HealthCare.gov Hiding Some of its Best Insurance Plans? - Consumer Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/11/why-is-healthcare-gov-hiding-some-of-its-best-insurance-plans/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/CRO_Health_BCBS_Blue_Choice_Silver_11-14.png", "type": "article", "title": "Why is HealthCare.gov Hiding Some of its Best Insurance Plans? - Consumer Reports"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2014-11-22T00:00Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2014-11-22T00:25Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: Why is HealthCare.gov Hiding Some of its Best Insurance Plans? - Consumer Reports", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, HealthCare.gov, state health insurance marketplaces, state health exchanges, health exchange, ACA, Obamacare, affordable healthcare law, Medicaid, special Silver plans, metal levels, Silver plans, Gold plans, Platinum plans, Bronze plans, cost-sharing, out-of-pocket costs, actuarial value, Silver 87 plans, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Minnesota, Kentucky, Idaho, California, Hawaii, cost sharing subsidies, Consumer Reports, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance", "contenttag": "Ask Our Health Insurance Expert", "description": "Lower-income consumers can buy some of the best insurance plans with ultra-low deductibles and copays, but Consumer Reports says you'd never know it from HealthCare.gov."}, "article_summary": "Whereas regular Silver plans cover about 70 percent of the average person\u2019s health care costs, the special Silver plans cover 73, 87, or 94 percent, depending on the person\u2019s income.\nThe plans they\u2019re missing are special versions of the mid-priced Silver plans, the most popular of the four \u201cmetal tiers\u201d\u2014Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum\u2014sold on the state Health Insurance Marketplaces.\nBut even though the Bronze plans may have somewhat lower premiums, they don\u2019t have the cost-sharing reductions and can have extremely high deductibles.\nWhen people in the eligible income range window-shop on HealthCare.gov, the only clue they have that the special plans are available is the fine print on the initial eligibility page.\nOne little-known feature of the Affordable Care Act is the availability of special health plans with low deductibles and copays to consumers whose incomes are low, but not low enough to be enrolled in Medicaid."}
