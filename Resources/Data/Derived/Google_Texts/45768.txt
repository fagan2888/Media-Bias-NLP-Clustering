Friday's first-ever Color Run saw participants passing through a purple haze as part of the Estes Park High School Homecoming activities.

The Estes Park High School cross country teams hosted the Oct.10 run. Participants raced, ran, or walked the 1 mile while the cross country team threw handfuls of purple and white color powder (cornstarch) at them, giving them that 'Bobcat' spirit color. Participants finished the race covered in school colors and ready to support the Estes Park homecoming festivities.

Proceeds from the ace entry of $15 went directly to the cross country teams.
