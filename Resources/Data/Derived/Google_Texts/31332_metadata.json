In mourning, my neighbor holed up at their second home\u2014his second home\u2014on Sutton\u2019s Bay at the tip of the ring finger on Michigan\u2019s mitten. While away, my neighbor asked if I\u2019d go next door to water his wife\u2019s African violets so they, too, wouldn\u2019t die.\n\nThat night, I got a frantic call. My neighbor had received word that, minutes earlier, someone had broken into his home. I thought he was delusional; as I\u2019d left his house, I\u2019d taken care to set the burglar alarm. To reassure him, and worried I might be a suspect, I dashed next door.\n\nTwo windows were busted out. The alarm wasn\u2019t tripped. I touched nothing but the ground beneath me, and just barely. When a pair of cops arrived, I let them in with my spare key. Once they secured the house, I checked the alarm.\n\nI\u2019d botched the setting of it. The robbery was my fault. At my admission of guilt, the cops shook their heads. The three of us stood on broken glass in my neighbor\u2019s kitchen while I gave a statement. If I\u2019d been a suspect in their eyes, I didn\u2019t see it.\n\nDone with formalities, the two cops told me stories. They recounted a spate of recent burglaries, and some tactics a homeowner can use to slow but not stop a robbery. I was struck by the words both cops used to talk about the burglars: idiots, bad guys.\n\n*\n\nShortly after the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner on Staten Island, and Tamir Rice in Cleveland, followed in rapid-fire succession by the assassinations of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, the New York Times ran an op-ed by Steve Osborn. A retired NYC cop, Lt. Osborn seeks to explain, and excuse, his former colleagues for turning their backs to their mayor. A parenthetical in the op-ed, what is presented as an afterthought, reads: \u201c(Mornings are the best time to catch bad guys.)\u201d\n\nThis straight talk is often represented as the counterbalance to the linguistic bloat of political correctness. It\u2019s cowboy banter, tough-guy American cant inspired by John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. This talk, like a lot about the eye-for-an-eye Wild West, can sound like the Old Testament as translated by President Reagan.\n\n*\n\nIn his bestselling autobiography, \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d Chief Petty Officer Chris Kyle details how he excelled at long-range killing, but make no mistake, CPO Kyle was no murderer, despite what Bill Maher might intimate. Murder, strictly speaking, is the crime of killing somebody. CPO Kyle operated in a moral no-man\u2019s-land where killing was sanctioned. Kyle\u2019s memoir\u2014his life and tragic death\u2014inspired Clint Eastwood\u2019s Academy Award-nominated biopic by the same name, and, taken together, these testaments\u2014book, movie\u2014have spawned a tremendous amount of comment.\n\nCNN confirmed that CPO Kyle\u2019s first kill was a woman cradling a toddler who, in the other hand, stood armed with a grenade, but Robert Ito recently contradicted this claim. The scene\u2014censored in Kyle\u2019s memoir by the Department of Defense or the United States Naval Special Warfare Command\u2014unfolds more true-to-life in Eastwood\u2019s adaptation: Kyle takes aim at a 10- or 12-year-old boy sprinting toward a Marine convoy. The boy carries a Russian-made grenade. When Kyle shoots and kills the boy with a single bullet\u2014his first kill\u2014a woman takes up the armed grenade in an attempt to finish the boy\u2019s suicide mission. Kyle then shoots and kills her. Welcome to war.\n\n*\n\nWhen the two cops left my neighbor\u2019s house, I waited for the crime-scene investigation unit to come dust for prints. As I did, I took inventory.\n\nThe house was a disaster, both bedrooms tossed entirely, an ocean of clothes and personal effects on the floor\u2014half belonging to a recently deceased woman. The biggest crime, it seemed to me, was not whatever the thieves made off with. The crime was the chaos. The mess left in their wake. The grim time it would take to reorder. But then there were the houseplants.\n\nThe robbers\u2014the cops suspected at least two\u2014took care with the plants. They thoughtfully set aside a thriving Easter cactus so that they could ransack a wedding chest.\n\nA third cop arrived to dust for prints. He showed me a smudge mark on the window. \u201cSee that,\u201d he said. \u201cBad guys wore gloves. When these idiots wear gloves, they don\u2019t take them off inside. Best bet now\u2019s to find some blood. Let\u2019s hope one of the idiots cut himself on the broken glass.\u201d\n\nAs this cop talked, I stared at the Easter cactus. A houseplant set neatly aside by a bad guy, an idiot. Again, I felt incriminated. As a teenager, I\u2019d been arrested for theft, among other crimes, some of them felonies. I\u2019d never broken into homes\u2014my friends and I broke into cars. I\u2019d been an idiot, a bad guy. As I stood there in that crime scene, one my idiocy helped bring about, I worried I was still a bad guy.\n\n*\n\nA large part of the American military machine is structured around training men\u2014and now women\u2014to kill, and to do so in the most efficient way possible. Military training is conditioning. This is no state secret. The world\u2019s largest employer of psychologists is the U.S. Army Research Bureau. The U.S. military is doing its damnedest to turn voluntary motor responses\u2014ready, aim, fire\u2014into a conditioned response.\n\nThe gap between aim and fire is substantial. During wartime, we place a moratorium on murder and a premium on killing. We\u2019re asking soldiers to violate what is arguably the greatest taboo of civil society: thou shalt not kill.\n\nEven under the most ideal military situation\u2014as in World War II, say, when the enemy was usually in uniform and the mission was plain if not simple\u2014the U.S. had a 20 percent firing rate for riflemen. You get that bad guy lined up in your sights, idiot or not, and it\u2019s tough to pull the trigger. But the U.S. military solved that quandary.\n\nBy Korea, the firing rate was up to 55 percent. Come Vietnam, it reached its historical peak: 95 percent. How was it accomplished? With words. The trick is to dehumanize the enemy before first encounter. Short-circuit the inherent sympathy most humans feel for one another. Among the infantry, the U.S. military seeks to encourage empathy failure.\n\nIn his groundbreaking book \u201cOn Killing,\u201d Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, a former U.S. Army Ranger who taught psychology at West Point, notes that during the Vietnam era, extreme cases became the near norm. \u201cOne [cadence call] that was only a little bit more extreme than the majority was a running chant (with the emphasis shouted each time the left foot hit the ground):\n\nIwanna\n\nRAPE,\n\nKILL,\n\nPILLAGE\u2019n\u2019\n\nBURN, annnnn\u2019\n\nEAT dead\n\nBAAA-BIES\u2026\n\nAmerican soldiers are no longer so savagely trained, but, as Lt. Col. Grossman notes, for decades this conditioning was a \u201ckey mechanism for desensitizing and indoctrinating adolescent males into a cult of violence in basic training.\u201d To this day, in the best-trained soldiers, there\u2019s little room for premeditation. Response is nearly autonomic. The paradox is that when the firing rate was at its height, in Vietnam, we lost the war. When it was lowest, in World War II, we won.\n\n*\n\nIn his memoir, CPO Kyle uses one phrase 33 times: \u201cbad guy.\u201d (Much has already been made of the use of \u201csavage,\u201d which appears 10 times.) But faced with an unflinching war story that details the tactical desperation inspired by asymmetrical warfare\u2014an overmatched enemy commanding and coercing the suicide assaults of women and children\u2014critics should be slow to fault CPO Kyle for the remorseless tone of his book.
