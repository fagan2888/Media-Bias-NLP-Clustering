Members of Congress are \u201cappalled\u201d says Bachmann.\n\nThis is what Bachmann, whose history of histrionic utterances shows that she hates all things Obama (to say the least), told Fox News\u2019 Martha MacCallum on Tuesday:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a king, you\u2019re not a dictator, you can\u2019t do whatever you want. Our Constitution limits the president\u2019s power, even though President Obama doesn\u2019t act that way.\u201d \u201cHe has rewritten the Constitution for himself as a part of his effort to fundamentally transform the United States of America. But we are a constitutional republic and members like myself are going to fight to keep that, for the people, a constitutional republic.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say that, \u201cThe Constitution says no man is above the law, including the president of the United States. And we, as members of Congress, are making sure we\u2019re going to remind our president, even if we have to do it through a lawsuit, he too, must obey the law.\u201d\n\nThis comes from a woman who is herself under investigating for not obeying the law. Just sayin\u2019. And never mind that the Supreme Court says Obamacare is constitutional. Never mind that it is not a bill under consideration but the law of the land.\n\nThe truth is, there is scant evidence that any Republican, least of all a tea party Republican, actually appreciates the U.S. Constitution, let alone supports and upholds it. The Constitution, after all, consists of more than the Second and Tenth Amendments and the First Amendment applies to everyone equally, not only right-wing extremists.\n\nOkay. The president\u2019s power is limited. We get that. President Obama gets that. But Bachmann cannot cite an instance in which the president has overstepped his constitutional authority. He might have violated her imaginary Constitution, that is, the Constitution according to David Barton, but that\u2019s like wanting to impeach the president for not believing in the tooth fairy.\n\nThis is not the first time Bachmann has sounded like a deranged harpy with a toothache. She earlier claimed Obama \u201ccommitted impeachable offenses\u201d and that he is acting like a dictator. \u201cWe see thuggery going on in the White House, we\u2019re not going to take it, we\u2019ve drawn a line in the sand,\u201d she said during a conference call in October.\n\nThe media, she said, for failing to indulge in voices only Republicans can hear, \u201ccould rightly be called \u2018Treason Media.'\u201d\n\nRemember when Meghan McCain called Michele Bachmann \u201ca poor man\u2019s Sarah Palin\u201d, a \u201crogue woman\u201d and somebody you cannot take seriously?\n\nJust keep in mind that what Meghan McCain said about Bachmann seems to apply to pretty much the entire Republican House of Representatives. They\u2019ve gone rogue, and having gone rogue, they want to take down our constitutionally-elected president on the sole grounds that they don\u2019t like that he got elected in the first place, and then elected again in the second.\n\nI would suggest that the Minnesota Republican devote more of her time to her own defense for violating election laws and to perhaps spend some time with her conflicted gay husband while she can, but what do I know?
