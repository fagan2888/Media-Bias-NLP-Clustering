Another is expected to open a week or two later, according to Jim Green, executive director of human resources at Lacks.\n\nThe clinics, at 826 Parchment Drive SE and 7101 Broadmoor Ave. SE, will be in close proximity to the majority of the company\u2019s factories, which are in the 44th Street and 52nd Street areas.\n\n\u201cWith those two sites, 80 percent of our work force will be within 20 minutes of a primary care office,\u201d said Green. Employees and their dependents together total about 5,600 people covered by the Lacks health care insurance benefits.\n\nCareATC of Oklahoma has been contracted by Lacks to set up the clinics and hire the staff for them, which will include one full-time primary care physician who already has been hired and a second who will work 30 hours a week.\n\nLacks, which has a self-insured health care plan for its employees, uses Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to administer its claims. As of Jan. 1, that role will be taken over by Priority Health, and Lacks is moving to a high-deductible insurance plan with a health savings account for each employee. Single employees will have an annual deductible of $1,250, and those with dependents, $2,500.\n\nThe company did not divulge how much it is investing in the clinics, but it figures there will be a combination of cost savings and increased opportunities for healthier employees.\n\nGreen said the Lacks on-site clinics \u201cwill be like a regular family practice doctor\u2019s office,\u201d offering primary care and minor emergency care up to and including stitches. Employees and their dependents with more serious problems will be referred to physicians who are members of the Priority Health network.\n\nGreen said clinics for a company Lack\u2019s size should be a minimum of 1,300 or 1,400 square feet. One of the sites Lacks is renting is a former chiropractic clinic of 2,300 square feet.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a lot of space in a waiting room,\u201d said Green, because employees will be able to call ahead for an appointment and they won\u2019t be kept waiting when they get there.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, because the clinic physicians are not being paid a separate fee for each thing they do, as are most physicians in private practice and hospitals, they are not under personal pressure to see as many patients as possible each day.\n\n\u201cIf our doctors need a half hour to talk to you, they\u2019ll spend a half hour to talk to you,\u201d said Green, and yet the actual cost of seeing a doctor will be less at the on-site clinics.\n\nWhen asked if the Affordable Care Act played any role in Lacks\u2019 decision to open on-site clinics for employees, Green said, \u201cWe were going down this path before the Affordable Care Act started.\u201d\n\nLacks launched a company-wide wellness and prevention program in 2010, offering incentives to employees who meet certain goals, such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular check-ups and tests, and monitoring/managing chronic conditions such as diabetes.\n\nEmployees who demonstrate their commitment to the wellness program can receive up to 25 percent more in company contributions to their health savings account.\n\n\u201cOur diabetes levels have dropped in the last two years,\u201d said Green. Employees who follow a Priority Health doctor\u2019s advice on control of diabetes and pre-diabetes can receive free supplies and prescriptions from Lacks, he noted.\n\nGreen said the basic intent is \u201cto keep the people who are healthy, healthy. And identify those with chronic problems\u201d who can be helped with a plan of action.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep health care affordable and accessible to our employees, with the highest quality of care,\u201d said Green.\n\nThe wellness campaign and on-site clinics will benefit the company\u2019s bottom line as well as the employees, because \u201cwe hire them to do a job. We want them here,\u201d said Green.\n\nThe rapidly increasing cost of health care in the United States has put a heavy burden on employers, especially those in manufacturing, who are often competing against foreign businesses that don\u2019t have to pay for their employees\u2019 health care. Green said Lacks will spend close to $22 million on employee health care in 2013; health care is the fourth largest expense at Lacks, after payroll, plastics for its automotive products and chemicals.\n\nGreen said one West Michigan employer with an on-site clinic is Perrigo in Allegan, which was also mentioned by A. Michael La Penna, principal of the La Penna Group health care consultants in Grand Rapids.\n\nLa Penna wrote enthusiastically about the Lacks clinics this summer in his On-Site Clinic Newsletter, published on onsiteclinics.org. La Penna Group has helped major corporations, including Toyota in Texas and BP in Louisiana, set up extensive on-site clinics for employees.\n\n\u201cJohnson Controls in Holland had something like this. Steelcase had it for a while,\u201d La Penna told the Business Journal. He added the Johnson Controls clinic was staffed by \u201cfee-for-service physicians, which is the wrong model.\u201d He said Steelcase had a \u201cvery well-defined clinic,\u201d but he does not know what led to its closing.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a clinic like this which should have been successful and it hasn\u2019t been, generally you\u2019re looking at somebody that started it for the wrong reasons, or didn\u2019t have the proper structure or the proper (care) providers. (Perhaps) they didn\u2019t follow through with restructuring the benefit programs. There are many different reasons why these things would fail,\u201d said La Penna.\n\n\u201cBadly done, this is no better than any other (corporate) project that is badly done. When properly done, these are very successful,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe were delighted to see Lacks doing this,\u201d said Le Penna. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be something other employers will take a look at.\u201d\n\nLa Penna said CareATC is \u201ca well-regarded firm in the industry.\u201d However, he noted that some health care systems in the U.S. are \u201cvery successful\u201d at setting up and running on-site clinics for employers and \u201ccompete with vendors like CareATC.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot here,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that in Racine, Wis., the county and city governments as well as the school district have dedicated clinics run by Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare, which also operates six hospitals.\n\nOn-site clinics present several advantages to employers, according to Le Penna. One is employee access to primary care \u2014 even as the shortage of primary care physicians grows and appointments are harder to get.\n\nAnother is the efficiency of access: Employees can get in right away and their travel time is less, so their time away from work is generally less.\n\nAn on-site clinic can focus on issues specific to the employee population, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. An employer can also do a more thorough job of managing the health of employees by offering flu shots or specific types of screening.\n\nLacks Enterprises, like other automotive suppliers, suffered in the recession, with the employee count dropping to 1,700. Since the worst of the recession, however, sales have doubled.\n\nLacks is a privately held company, the fourth largest privately held employer in West Michigan, according to Green, and among the top 10 employers in the Grand Rapids region among all employers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While some employers in West Michigan in recent years closed their on-site health care clinics for employees, Lacks Enterprises in Kentwood is moving in the other direction.
