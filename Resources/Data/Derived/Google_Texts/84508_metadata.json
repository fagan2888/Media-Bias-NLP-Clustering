This means fewer jobs in the auto and housing sectors of the economy, and the study suggests that student debt is probably causing lower levels of spending in other economic sectors as well.\n\nAnd on a micro level, more student debt means fewer options for graduates. If you have more debt, you are more likely to take a job with a steady employer than work at a new firm or start your own company.\n\nLess spending on a macro level, and less risk taking on a micro level, means less economic growth overall. In other words, student debt is a major drag on the economy.\n\nHow is this President Obama's fault?\n\nFor starters, Obama has presided over the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression. His Keynesian deficit spending failed to stimulate the economy, and instead of making it easier for businesses to hire people by lowering the cost of employment, he made hiring more expensive through a slew of new federal mandates and regulations, including Obamacare's employer mandate.\n\nSince employers are not hiring people, more high school and college graduates are choosing to go back to school instead of work. And they are borrowing a ton of money to do so.\n\nThis is why the unemployment rate keeps falling despite the fact that the number of Americans with jobs still has not recovered from pre-recession levels. Younger Americans are borrowing money to exit the job market and go back to school.\n\nLooking ahead, if our nation's colleges and graduate schools are teaching valuable and marketable skills, then maybe this generation of students will eventually recover.\n\nBut if young Americans are just sitting on the economic sidelines, and gathering a mountain of student debt in the process, then the Obama presidency will be a slow motion disaster for decades to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pushed back into school by a weak economy and pulled into debt by government subsidized loans, a generation of Americans is drowning in debt under President Obama..05/26/2016 19:14:55PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Pushed back into school by a weak economy and pulled into debt by government subsidized loans, a generation of Americans is drowning in debt under President Obama.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama's Legacy of Student Debt", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/05/14/obamas-legacy-of-student-debt-n1838185", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/5/14/37.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Pushed back into school by a weak economy and pulled into debt by government subsidized loans, a generation of Americans is drowning in debt under President Obama.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama's Legacy of Student Debt", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/05/14/obamas-legacy-of-student-debt-n1838185", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/5/14/37.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama's Legacy of Student Debt, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "As you can see from the chart, while mortgage, auto, and credit card debt still has not reached pre-financial crisis levels, student debt has exploded and now totals more than $1 trillion.\nAnd on a micro level, more student debt means fewer options for graduates.\nIn other words, student debt is a major drag on the economy.\nFor starters, as the Federal Reserve notes in a separate blog post, Americans with high levels of student debt are less likely to buy new cars or homes.\nLess spending on a macro level, and less risk taking on a micro level, means less economic growth overall."}
