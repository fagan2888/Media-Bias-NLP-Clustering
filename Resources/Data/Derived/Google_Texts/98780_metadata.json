You don't have to deal with other people, other shoppers, wait in line, navigate the mall. Stuff like that.\"\n\nSome campuses have seen such a shift in students' mail habits that they're taking drastic steps, including removing dorm mailboxes entirely and redesigning buildings to increase storage space for packages.\n\nIn the last two years, CU has seen a 15 percent increase in packages processed through Housing and Dining Services, which began contracting with UPS to handle all student mail services in 2013.\n\nAt Arizona State University, which contracts with the same UPS franchise owner, the number of packages processed grew from 60,614 in 2009-2010 to 113,140 in 2014-2015 \u2014 an 86 percent increase, according to Lauren Teich, general manager for UPS at the two campuses.\n\nTeich said the universities do not track letter volume, but the U.S. Postal Service reports that first-class single piece mail volume \u2014 mail bearing postage stamps such as bill payments, cards, letters and personal correspondence \u2014 declined 53 percent from 45.9 billion pieces in 2005 to 21.5 billion in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, package volumes grew 21 percent between 2008 and 2013, according to the postal service's statistics.\n\nLauren Teich, general manager for UPS at the University of Colorado, scans a package that arrived for a student on the Boulder campus on Dec. 9.

You can press a button on your phone and have something shipped to you,\" Teich said. \"The connection there has made it very instantaneous for students.\"\n\nMailroom as bookstore, shopping mall\n\nThe generation of undergraduates attending college today came of age at the same time as Netflix, GrubHub, Uber, Spotify and a host of other on-demand goods-and-services providers.\n\nThey check their bank balances with mobile apps and send important documents by email.\n\nWhy should shopping be any different?\n\nOnline retailers like Amazon are capitalizing on students' need for instant everything \u2014 from textbooks to mini-fridges \u2014 with programs such as Amazon Student, which gives them free two-day shipping for the first six months.\n\nThe online giant this year also opened three brick-and-mortar stores at Purdue University, the University of California Davis and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n\"The amount of Amazon tape I saw in our back room after Black Friday was just astonishing to me,\" Teich said. \"It's just like, 'Wow.' Students have such a hand in e-commerce it's crazy.\"\n\nStudents also are opting to rent their textbooks, rather than buy them, with help from online vendors such as Chegg \u2014 a company known among mailroom managers for its bright orange boxes \u2014 which means receiving and sending more packages at the start and end of each semester.\n\nParents are getting in on the online ordering game, too, by sending students items directly from retailers.\n\nCampuses are taking notice. They're installing more shelves, buying more package scanners, creating new sorting systems and rearranging mailrooms to make way for more packages and fewer letters.\n\n\"While students are getting fewer letters from home, bills and other traditional mail, they are indeed doing more online shopping that necessitates the handling of larger parcels,\" said James Baumann, a spokesman for the Association of College and University Housing Officers International. \"That means reconsidering the space set-ups of residence hall mailrooms and looking at policies and procedures about how students get notified about deliveries.\"\n\nMore packages, bigger space\n\nAt CU, package notification is as high-tech and instantaneous as the students' one-click ordering capabilities.\n\nWhen UPS employees scan an incoming package, students receive an email letting them know it's available for pick-up.\n\nDuring move-in days, CU brings in huge trailers to accommodate the uptick in large packages. More and more students are shipping themselves bedspreads and coffee makers directly from online retailers, rather than packing up mom and dad's car, Teich said.\n\nThe UPS stores at CU also offer summer storage for on- and off-campus students \u2014 they'll even deliver items to students' new addresses when they return from summer break.\n\nTeich said the campus plans to adapt as future changes are needed.\n\n\"We just evolve with the times,\" she said.\n\nWhen Indiana University in Bloomington, Ind., built Spruce Hall in 2013, campus officials thought long and hard about how the dorm's mailroom should function.\n\nThe university designed the dorm with roughly 25 percent more space for packages than other residence halls, said Patrick Connor, IU's executive director of residential programs and services for the last 15 years.\n\n\"In some of our older buildings, we had virtually no storage for packages,\" he said. \"When you have a building of 500 or 600 students, you can imagine the amount of packages you might get.\"\n\nNo more mailboxes\n\nStudents at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., were getting so few letters that campus housing officials removed all residence hall mailboxes this summer.\n\n\"The amount of traditional letter mail that wasn't junk mail had dropped significantly,\" said Aaron Lucier, East Carolina's director of housing operations. \"Students weren't checking them. The majority of their mail was packages that didn't fit in them anyway.\"\n\nNow, everything is treated like a package. If a letter is delivered, students get an email and can pick it up from their residence neighborhood's front desk.\n\nThe idea to remove campus mailboxes started percolating two years ago, when Lucier and his team realized how much time staffers were wasting stuffing mailboxes with junk mail, which students promptly recycled.\n\nAt the same time, there weren't enough employees around to handle an increasing number of packages, Lucier said.\n\nWhen crews removed the mailboxes, they turned that extra space into study lounges for students and made more room for packages by reconfiguring storage space and adding shelving.\n\n\"It's space and security,\" said Lucier, who has worked in student housing for 20 years. \"And being able to find stuff quickly. We don't have staff time for them to look for a package for three minutes.\"\n\nLucier said he believes East Carolina University is one of the first colleges to remove dorm mailboxes entirely, but he expects other campuses to follow suit sooner than later.\n\nCampus mailrooms largely go unnoticed \u2014 until they're no longer keeping up with students.\n\n\"It's one of those systems where, when it's running well and it's doing well, it's probably somewhat invisible,\" Lucier said. \"But when you notice changes like running out of space or needing to hire more staff to handle packages, then it brings attention to it.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_29312352/box-boom-cu-colleges-nationwide-adapt-students-changing", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29312352:view"}, "startDate": "2015-12-26T10:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Aside from some fliers, a magazine or two  and the paper slip that students must show a mailroom employee to retrieve a package, CU's student mailboxes are mostly empty these days, replaced instead by rooms full of boxes, many bearing", "title": "Box boom: CU, colleges nationwide adapt to students' changing mail habits", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_29312352/box-boom-cu-colleges-nationwide-adapt-students-changing", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1225/20151225__27DCAMAIw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-12-27T08:46:01-0700", "endDate": "2025-12-25T23:19:52-0700", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaStaff", "pubDate": "2015-12-25T23:24:32-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-26T10:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Box boom: CU, colleges nationwide adapt to students' changing mail habits", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "Aside from some fliers, a magazine or two  and the paper slip that students must show a mailroom employee to retrieve a package, CU's student mailboxes are mostly empty these days, replaced instead by rooms full of boxes, many bearing", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_29312352/box-boom-cu-colleges-nationwide-adapt-students-changing", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Aside from some fliers, a magazine or two  and the paper slip that students must show a mailroom employee to retrieve a package, CU's student mailboxes are mostly empty these days, replaced instead by rooms full of boxes, many bearing", "title": "Box boom: CU, colleges nationwide adapt to students' changing mail habits"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "When UPS employees scan an incoming package, students receive an email letting them know it's available for pick-up.\nSome campuses have seen such a shift in students' mail habits that they're taking drastic steps, including removing dorm mailboxes entirely and redesigning buildings to increase storage space for packages.\nPostal Service mail volume Total decrease: 53 percent 2014: 21.5 billion 2013: 22.6 billion 2012: 23.2 billion 2011: 25.8 billion 2010: 28.9 billion 2009: 31.6 billion 2008: 35.4 billion 2007: 42.3 billion 2006 : 44.4 billion 2005: 45.9 billion Source: U.S.\nMore packages, bigger spaceAt CU, package notification is as high-tech and instantaneous as the students' one-click ordering capabilities.\n\"The amount of traditional letter mail that wasn't junk mail had dropped significantly,\" said Aaron Lucier, East Carolina's director of housing operations."}
