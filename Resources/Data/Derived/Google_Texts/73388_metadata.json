Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, managed to tease former Rep. Anthony Weiner and slam former IRS official Lois Lerner in one zinger while speaking to an audience in New Hampshire on Thursday.\n\nThe onetime New York congressman was brought down by a phone sexting scandal, while Ms. Lerner\u2019s famously missing emails are at the center of the congressional probe into the tax agency\u2019s conservative targeting scandal.\n\n\u201cHow many people here have a cellphone?\u201d Mr. Paul asked the audience, according to Breitbart News, \u201cHow many people think it\u2019s none of the government\u2019s damn business what you have on your cellphone?\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Rand Paul: \u2018I might be pretty busy\u2019 next summer, fueling 2016 speculation\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Paul continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m really, really worried about Anthony Weiner. Because you know he likes to take his selfies, and he\u2019s had trouble finding a place to put them where the government can\u2019t find them. So I\u2019m thinking maybe Anthony Weiner should put his selfie in Lois Lerner\u2019s emails.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul was in New Hampshire, site of the nation\u2019s first presidential primary, for political events Thursday and Friday, only fueling speculation he is considering a 2016 White House run. The Kentucky Republican has said he will formally decide whether to run early next year, but admitted to local reporters that he \u201chasn\u2019t discouraged\u201d the presidential speculation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
