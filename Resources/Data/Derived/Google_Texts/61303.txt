Ronya Vereen & Albert Vereen Jr.

CONWAY, SC (WBTW) – An Horry County man died from a bedsore infection this week after police said his children neglected him.

According to a Horry County police report, Ronya Vereen, 41, and her brother Albert Vereen Jr, 38, of Longs were charged with neglect of a vulnerable adult resulting in death after their 63-year-old father Albert Vereen Sr. died at MUSC in Charleston.

Police say they were called to a local hospital to investigate a case of neglect of a vulnerable adult on August 6.

The victim was taken to the hospital by ambulance after complaining of abdominal pain.

When he was examined, they found a life-threatening bedsore covering most of the victim’s back.

The victim, who was living with and receiving care from two of his children, died at a hospital as a direct result of being neglected, the report said.

The Vereens are currently being held at the J Reuben Long Detention Center.
