Doctors should wash their white coats at least once a week in hot water and bleach, according to the article.\n\nAlthough there is no known direct link between the germs on healthcare workers' clothing and actual infections, it's best to take precautions, experts said.\n\n\"There's a theoretical basis that if you have clean clothes, you have less chance of transmitting a pathogen,\" Gonzalo Bearman, M.D., a hospital epidemiologist with the Virginia Commonwealth University System and a member of the SHEA guidelines committee, told NBC News.\n\nStudies on the subject suggest sleeves, pockets and other parts of healthcare workers' coats and scrubs can harbor germs like Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, NBC News reported. One study found that a third of doctors' neckties grew Staphylococcus aureus in the lab. Several found that the germs were often resistant to the top drugs used to treat them.\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to prevent germ spread through dress code. In 2011, New York state lawmakers proposed legislation that would bar physicians and hospital staff from wearing ties, and have them adopt a \"bare below the elbow\" policy--including forgoing long white lab coats in favor of short sleeves and refraining from wearing watches and jewelry, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the SHEA report\n\n- read the NBC News article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOutlawing ties and watches for the sake of patient safety\n\nHospital's strict dress-code policy helps patients identify clinical staff\n\nC. diff infections hit record high\n\nMRSA infections down in hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "To reduce the spread of\u00a0infections like\u00a0MRSA\u00a0and\u00a0C. diff,\u00a0hospitals should\u00a0encourage doctors to adopt a new\u00a0dress code, according a\u00a0report\u00a0published in\u00a0Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "To reduce the spread of\u00a0infections like\u00a0MRSA\u00a0and\u00a0C. diff,\u00a0hospitals should\u00a0encourage doctors to adopt a new\u00a0dress code, according a\u00a0report\u00a0published in\u00a0Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.", "title": "New dress code recommendations look to reduce spread of MRSA, C. diff", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/new-dress-code-recommendations-look-reduce-spread-mrsa-c-diff/2014-01-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "C. diff,Care Delivery,dress code,hospital infection control,MRSA,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To reduce the spread of infections like MRSA and C. diff, hospitals should encourage doctors to adopt a new dress code, according to a report published in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.\nThe Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommends physicians avoid wearing long sleeves, wrist watches, neck ties and jewelry, but encourages sturdy, closed-toed shoes.\nAlthough there is no known direct link between the germs on healthcare workers' clothing and actual infections, it's best to take precautions, experts said.\nDoctors should wash their white coats at least once a week in hot water and bleach, according to the article.\nThis isn't the first attempt to prevent germ spread through dress code."}
