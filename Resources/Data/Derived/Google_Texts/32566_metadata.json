In spite of a lack of modern medical equipment and financial resources, Cuba's healthcare system is a model for other nations in the region, according to a report from Yahoo! Health.\n\nCuba's government established a generation ago that access to quality healthcare is a universal human right and took steps to implement a system that emphasizes primary care and prevention, the article noted.\n\nNow, in the wake of a lifting of decades-old trade and diplomatic embargoes against Cuba, American medical schools are sending students to study the Cuban healthcare system.\n\n\"Cuba has always had scarce resources but they started out with the foundation that everyone has a right to basic, necessary healthcare,\" William Cunningham, assistant dean for the College of Osteopathic Medicine in West Michigan and interim director of Michigan State University's Institute of International Health, told Yahoo!
