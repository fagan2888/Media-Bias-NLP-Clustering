Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British Empire, of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender,\" Johnson wrote in the mass-market Sun tabloid.\n\n\"APPALLING\"\n\nObama's father was Kenyan but the president does not hold Kenyan citizenship and has never lived in Kenya.\n\nJohnson is not the first political opponent of Obama to try to make capital out of his family background. U.S. Republicans have done so for years, and the front-runner to win the party's nomination for this year's presidential race, Donald Trump, has been doing so during the campaign.\n\nJohnson's comment drew criticism from across the political spectrum in Britain, including from Conservative lawmaker Nicholas Soames, Churchill's grandson, who called Johnson's article \"appalling\" and \"wrong on almost everything\".\n\n\"Inconceivable WSC (Churchill) would not have welcomed President's views,\" said Soames, who favors remaining in the European Union.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the opposition Labour Party's finance policy chief who also favors an \"In\" vote in the referendum, said Johnson's comments contained an underlying hint of racism.\n\n\"Mask slips again. Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog-whistle racism from senior Tories (Conservatives). He should withdraw it.\"\n\nAsked during his news conference with Cameron to react to Johnson's article, Obama drew laughs from reporters when he replied: \"Let me start with Winston Churchill.\"\n\nHe said his predecessor, George W. Bush, had kept a second bust of Churchill in the White House, this one in the Oval Office, but Obama had removed it to make space for one of Martin Luther King.\n\n\"I thought ... that as the first African American president it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr Martin Luther King in my office to remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office.\"\n\nJohnson responded to the criticism of his article by British politicians by saying he was \"a big fan\" of Obama.\n\nIn a statement sent by a spokesman, Johnson said the issue was the \"weird paradox\" of the president of a country that jealously guards its sovereignty urging Britain to surrender some of it by embedding itself further in the EU.\n\n(Writing by Estelle Shirbon and David Milliken; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "Obama says loves Churchill in British row over 'part-Kenyan' remark", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/Part-Kenyan-Obama-comment-demeans-EU-debate-Brexit-heavyweight-Johnson-told", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/britain-eu-obama_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/22/Part-Kenyan-Obama-comment-demeans-EU-debate-Brexit-heavyweight-Johnson-told", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/britain-eu-obama_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"I love Winston Churchill, I love the guy,\" Obama said when asked at a news conference about Johnson's article.\nAsked during his news conference with Cameron to react to Johnson's article, Obama drew laughs from reporters when he replied: \"Let me start with Winston Churchill.\"\nJohnson responded to the criticism of his article by British politicians by saying he was \"a big fan\" of Obama.\nLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama told Britons on Friday he loved Winston Churchill, rebuffing suggestions that he had disrespected the wartime leader because of a grudge against Britain linked to his Kenyan ancestry.\nJohnson is not the first political opponent of Obama to try to make capital out of his family background."}
