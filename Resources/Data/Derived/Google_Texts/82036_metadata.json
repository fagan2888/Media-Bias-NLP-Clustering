This often misunderstood quality can and does define some rather successful corporate leaders, according to a study recently released by Arizona State University.\n\nResearchers from the university\u2019s W.P. Carey School of Business were curious how humility at the CEO level might impact top- and mid-level managers and entire workforces as a result. With a desire to learn more about this trait\u2019s impact on CEOs and those around them, Arizona State\u2019s Anne S. Tsui, Angelo Kinicki and David Waldman worked with National University of Singapore professor Amy Y. Ou to conduct the study.\n\nResearch focused on this personality trait and its impact on the CEOs of 63 privately held businesses in China. They also conducted surveys of 1,000 middle and top-level managers who work closely with those CEOs to see how humility from above impacted their daily routine.\n\nResearchers selected Chinese companies for the study because they say it provided the right context for ensuring CEOs would display a variety of humility levels. The focus on humility was prompted by an increased interest in this trait among researchers in the area of business and psychology.\n\nAlthough once mistaken for low self-esteem and a lack of confidence, Arizona\u2019s study team says this personality trait has a number of positive components in it that can help those in leadership roles thrive.\n\nHumility itself is often associated with empowering, virtuous, moral, ethical and participative leadership. Results of the study indicate that may be the case.\n\nResearchers concluded that CEOs who are humble tend to make strong leaders because they empower others around them and foster a greater sense of ownership among mid- and top-level managers.\n\nThis sense of empowerment trickles from the top down, creating organizations that are poised for success because employees are committed, they\u2019re not afraid to share ideas and they enjoy greater job satisfaction as a result.\n\nHumble CEOs also tend to be more open to making joint decisions. They are often mindful of their own strengths and weaknesses and those of others around them.\n\n\u201cOur study suggests the \u2018secret sauce\u2019 of great, humble managers,\u201d Kinicki told Arizona State News. \u201cThey are more willing to seek feedback about themselves, more empathetic and appreciative of others\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, and more focused on the greater good and others\u2019 welfare than on themselves.\u201d\n\nHumility in leaders isn\u2019t a sign of weakness, study authors conclude. Rather, this trait has benefits that can trickle from the top down, creating positive impacts for employees and a company as a whole.\n\nGet Free Updates!
