This means no Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or Martin O\u2019Malley for the Democrats and none of the bajillion Republicans who are seeking the nomination. No Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, or Rand Paul. It\u2019s an interesting theory and one that might be shaping up to become true with all the recent rumors Mitt Romney is considering trying to \u201csave\u201d the GOP with a third presidential run. Gabriel Sherman at New York magazine wrote yesterday Romney is really bothered by Trump, and just not impressed with the other candidates.\n\n\u201cThese guys like [[ Scott ]] Walker and [[ Rick ]] Perry, they were big deals in their states, but you get them onto the national stage and it\u2019s a different story,\u201d a former Romney adviser told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were in middle school, and now they\u2019re freshmen in high school and they\u2019re getting their faces slammed in the toilets.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just unnamed, anonymous former Romney folks who are openly pining for him to return. Top Romney donor David Van Slooten told Boston Herald there are other donors who are starting to show buyer\u2019s remorse on candidates and gaze longingly towards the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\n\u201cThings are really playing out in a perfect fashion for him to come in and wrap this thing up\u2026The party really needs someone like Mitt. I think there\u2019s a real opportunity for him. \u2026 The people I\u2019ve spoken to, many of them feel the same way I do, and the sentiment has been increasing. There are those that backed Jeb Bush who are regretting that decision. There are those that backed Scott Walker and others who are regretting that decision. If (Romney) indicated he\u2019d make a run at it, I think many people would peel off and back a run \u201c\n\nUh huh. AP has already written why Mitt 3.0 is a bad move, but that\u2019s not going to cause any speculation to come to a screeching halt. Even if Romney were to hold a news conference today and say \u201cRead my lips, no 2016 run,\u201d his bundlers and some in the Establishment would just die for a chance to see if third time would be a charm. But others say no, Romney won\u2019t try it again because he prefers being the elder statesman and an adviser to those seeking the White House.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a counselor to these candidates,\u201d says a veteran of Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, who noted that Kasich speaks with Romney as well. \u201cNo one has gone wire to wire, beginning to end two cycles in a row. He has a lot of knowledge to share.\u201d\n\nRomney may have a lot to share, but the question is whether candidates should do the exact opposite. He\u2019s has already admitted the 47% comment hurt his chance in 2012 and the \u201cI like to be able to fire people\u201d comment wasn\u2019t a good idea either. He also inarticulately explained \u201cbinders full of women,\u201d which should have shown how he looks at women as equals to men in business, not just something on a checklist to be marked off. Those comments are just going to come back to haunt Romney if he decides to give it a go again.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is Bernie Quigley at New York Observer suggests Romney is too good for the Republican Party and the 2016 election.\n\nHe brings a somewhat different political ethic and conservative moral base to the Republican Party, in my opinion, a heightened, seasoned and more mature sensibility and Republicans should be delighted to have him\u2026They will not get Mr. Romney now. Because Mr. Romney actually is \u201cexceptional.\u201d\n\nIs Mitt 3.0 really a smart move? Not really. He did get more votes in 2012 than John McCain did in 2008, but is that enough to be \u201cthe one?\u201d The last person to win a presidential election after losing one was Richard Nixon. But he did it in 1968, eight years after losing to JFK. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Grover Cleveland also lost presidential elections before winning four years later. But it\u2019s just unlikely Romney is the one to ride in on a white horse to save the GOP. Some of Romney\u2019s supporters have pointed out he was well-liked by both Tea Party and Establishment individuals. But being \u201clikeable\u201d doesn\u2019t mean jack when it comes to winning an election, even if the presidency is just a popularity contest. There were times Romney really came off as untrustworthy to the conservatives and libertarians who wanted Obama out of office. His proclamation to NBC News that he was able to get everyone insured under Romneycare, plus his desire to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare (instead of just getting rid of it) never set well with some of the electorate. The GOP Establishment would probably love to have Romney save them. But there\u2019s a big difference between the Establishment and the rest of the party. The GOP is allegedly the party of freedom and liberty. Romney 3.0 would really just be more of the same ol\u2019 same ol\u2019. It\u2019s time to look elsewhere and find someone who actually stands for the values the GOP claims to stand for.\n\nThe question, of course, is who?\n\nEdit (Taylor): as pointed out in the comments it was eight years not four for Nixon.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Save us Mitt 3.0?", "title": "Rumors start again on another Romney run", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/02/rumors-start-again-on-another-romney-run/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-02T17:21:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T19:35:56+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7eb\"", "article_summary": "There were times Romney really came off as untrustworthy to the conservatives and libertarians who wanted Obama out of office.\nIf (Romney) indicated he\u2019d make a run at it, I think many people would peel off and back a run \u201cUh huh.\nThe GOP Establishment would probably love to have Romney save them.\nIt\u2019s an interesting theory and one that might be shaping up to become true with all the recent rumors Mitt Romney is considering trying to \u201csave\u201d the GOP with a third presidential run.\nRumors start again on another Romney runposted at 1:21 pm on September 2, 2015 by Taylor MillardA friend of mine has a theory that none of the current declared presidential candidates will actually secure the nomination."}
