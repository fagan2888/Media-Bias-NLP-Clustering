During the last century, immigration was controlled and at times stopped altogether. But wherever Chinese arrived, Chinatowns developed as ethnic enclaves making a valuable contribution to cultural richness in city centers across the U.S., often providing services local governments overlooked by way of jobs, health services, and education.\n\nDefining Chinatowns in the United States and elsewhere\n\nAndrew Leong is co-author of the study, which is the first to examine land-use of Chinatowns in the Northeast and detail block-by-block changes in Chinatowns in Boston, New York and Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cChinatown is an essential part of the Asian-American identity, but very much part of the American identity,\u201d Leong told MintPress. \u201cIf you take Little Italy right now in New York, there is not much left now; it has shrunk into a tourist destination, which is the same danger that we don\u2019t want Chinatown to become. We care about any ethnic enclave that dies because of gentrification.\u201d\n\nAccording to the study, universities and colleges in Boston have expanded into Chinatown. In Philadelphia, casinos and luxury condominiums are encroaching. And in New York, because of re-zoning changes and taxation, hotels have pushed into areas where affordable housing and small business support is most needed. From 2000 to 2010, Asians in all three Chinatown cities went from being more than half the population to less than half.\n\nA stark example of the effects of government policy on a Chinatown is in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIf anyone has visited Washington D.C.\u2019s Chinatown \u2013 it used to be called Chinatown. Ten, 15 years ago, they started to call it China block; now they\u2019re calling it China corner. And what used to Chinatown is now populated by national chains stores,\u201d Leong told MintPress. \u201cLocal government attempts to save it resulted in a city ordinance that all business are required to have bilingual signage. But what good is it to identify Hooters in Chinese?\u201d\n\nLeong says that although these centers have been dubbed Chinatowns, they form an essential part of the identity of Vietnamese, Japanese, and Filipino-Americans.\n\n\u201cThey all say to me when they go into Chinatown, any Chinatown, there is a mental relaxation that happens \u2014 that on a color basis, you are among your own,\u201d Leong said.\n\nJan Lee traces his ancestry back to New York in the early 1880s.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather was among the small number of families that founded Chinatown,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe core families are seven or eight names that keep recurring, and some of them are still here \u2014 the family names are Chin, Lee, Wong, Moi and Leung. Just like in any small town, you see the same names recurring; you will see that here in Chinatown.\u201d\n\nLee has visited Chinatowns around the world and has noticed the changes. Singapore in the mid 1990s was quaint, full of chop houses and ceiling fans; a Chinatown you would expect in Southeast Asia, he said.\n\n\u201cA decade later, local government had decided the real estate was valuable; it should be developed, hung with paper lanterns in the streets at night; close the streets and turn it into a carnival \u2013 a bastardized version of a very beautiful thing,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAlthough officials and city planners use the word \u201cimprovement\u201d to changes of Chinatowns, Lee said it\u2019s only made a mockery of the culture.\n\n\u201cTo say all non-Chinese people want a television version of what Chinatown should be, and that is an unfortunate, ignorant view not shared just by non-Chinese but propagated by some Chinese themselves,\u201d Lee said. \u201cA Chinese looking arc, pagoda looking buildings, people walking around in costume and playing music on the corner. That\u2019s happening all over. Imagine if you were to make Harlem a theme park?\u201d\n\nThe Shrinkage Strategy\n\nPlanned Shrinkage was a public policy term coined back in the 1970s by New York Housing Commissioner Robert Starr in which the city would stop investing in troubled neighborhoods and divert funds to communities that could still be saved. The policy was applied to the South Bronx and Harlem by closing subway stations, firehouses and schools. Without adequate firefighting service and police protection, residents faced waves of crime and fires that left much of those areas devastated. The policy was decried at the time as \u201cinhuman, racist and genocidal.\u201d\n\nPlanned Shrinkage has been replaced by new words like gentrification, diversity and improvement. Lee told MintPress that these are dangerous ideas.\n\n\u201cIt is not what new immigrants or residents want or how they live in the 21st Century. Instead missing is the celebration and preservation of what is actually there,\u201d Lee said.\n\nPeople come to Chinatown not just to shop but to see their Asian doctors, lawyers and optometrists, Lee said.\n\nChinatown \u201cis an economy based organically on what the Chinese people actually want,\u201d Lee added.\n\nNew York\u2019s City Council member Margaret Chin, a Chinese American who represents Chinatown, pushed hard to get a business improvement district in Chinatown. BIDs are purported to be good for the community.\n\n\u201cThis effort is the product of years of community engagement and constructive dialogue between property owners, residents, local business owners and government officials,\u201d Chin told Crain\u2019s New York Business, adding that BIDs \u201ccreate a much-needed enhancement of services.\u201d\n\nBut Lee says they\u2019re merely vehicles for promoting old racist policy ideas.\n\n\u201cWhat you have in BIDs are quasi-governmental private entities that speak for a large tract of land in the community, Lee said. \u201cWhen you get all the executives directors of all the BIDs together in New York City, it\u2019s frightening the amount of decisions they can make concerning enormous acreage of the most expensive real estate in the world. Devoid of any discussion about what residents want or how the parks are going to be used.\u201d\n\nWhat BIDs have done, he said, particularly in ethnic communities, is created a dangerous precedent in allowing one person or one group to represent all the interests in a community.\n\n\u201cAnd this means you are going back to colonial times,\u201d Lee said.\n\nFighting back from gentrification\n\nThe Bloomberg administration has unfairly taxed rental properties as opposed to homeowner properties and individual condos and co-ops, according to the recent study\n\n\u201cMaking Property Taxes Fairer: Ideas for the Next Administration,\u201d by New York University\u2019s Furman Center. The study indicates that a $10 million single unit condo is taxed at a fraction of what a $5 million tenement building is taxed. That disparity puts an enormous burden on property owners who are trying to maintain a safe building that meets codes and has stabilized rent.\n\nAs a property owner, Lee argues that until people understand the disparity and do something about it, they have nothing to say about how an neighborhood organically starts to evolve.\n\nAlready people are calling for less hotels in Chinatown, but the reason landlords are building hotels is the city has made it prohibitive to owning rental property. Lee says people need to realize that the city\u2019s policies have created the egregious imbalance.\n\nHe added that in his conversations with other second and third generation property owners, the vast majority do not want to lose their commercial tenants but want to preserve Chinatown for what it is and for what they remember.\n\n\u201cThey want to keep their building because it is a family legacy, and whether or not they now live in Chinatown they have great pride in Chinatown,\u201d Lee said.\n\nJosephine Lee is an organizer with the Chinese Staff Workers\u2019 Association, an organization that represents workers and residents. She said in the past few years they\u2019ve been coming together with Latino residents to demand more power over the decision making process.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not just one person but that more the community voice be included, that was why the Chinatown working group was formed,\u201d Josephine Lee told MintPress. \u201cIn the past the city would go through Asian Americans for Equality and they would use a token Chinese person, and they would say this person says all Chinese people love tall buildings and like to live in dense environments, trying to control Chinatown or justify.\u201d\n\nNew Yorkers have just voted in a new mayor, Bill de Blasio, whose campaign ran on the idea of an equal city. Josephine Lee is hoping Chinese residents and small business owners will be included in any discussions about Chinatown.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gentrification threatens Chinatowns thriving commercial activities, affordable homes for generations of immigrant families, and a legacy of Asian-American history.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Rebecca Myles", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Gentrification threatens Chinatowns thriving commercial activities, affordable homes for generations of immigrant families, and a legacy of Asian-American history.", "title": "The Gentrification Of The American Chinatown", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/gentrification-american-chinatown/175663/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/122613_Chinatown_-690x389.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-31T10:59:13-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gentrification threatens Chinatowns thriving commercial activities, affordable homes for generations of immigrant families, and a legacy of Asian-American history.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/122013_Chinatown_4x3.jpg", "title": "The Gentrification Of The American Chinatown", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "property values", "published_time": "2013-12-27T05:00:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-31T10:59:13-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey want to keep their building because it is a family legacy, and whether or not they now live in Chinatown they have great pride in Chinatown,\u201d Lee said.\nNew York\u2019s City Council member Margaret Chin, a Chinese American who represents Chinatown, pushed hard to get a business improvement district in Chinatown.\n\u201cChinatown is an essential part of the Asian-American identity, but very much part of the American identity,\u201d Leong told MintPress.\nJosephine Lee is hoping Chinese residents and small business owners will be included in any discussions about Chinatown.\n\u201cMy grandfather was among the small number of families that founded Chinatown,\u201d Lee said."}
