He still had to ride the 10 laps to complete the full race distance, but could do so without nerves, knowing the title was his. He didn\u2019t have to panic when a paper bag got stuck in his back wheel. He simply stopped and changed bikes.\n\nFroome and his teammates finished together linked in a line, their arms over each other\u2019s shoulders, with the yellow jersey winner grinning in the middle.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chris Froome wins second Tour de France; Andrei Greipel wins final sprint in Paris", "title": "Chris Froome wins second Tour de France; Andrei Greipel wins final sprint in Paris", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/26/chris-froome-wins-second-tour-de-france-andrei-greipel-wins-final-sprint-in-paris/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726_121843_chris-froome-tour-de-france-win.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150726_121843_chris-froome-tour-de-france-win.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T12:10:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T16:33:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Just as when Froome first won in 2013, Quintana was again runner-up, although the margin between them is much smaller this time.\nTo minimize the risk of crashes, Tour organizers stopped the race clock early, on the first of 10 laps up and down the Champs-Elysees\u2019 slick cobblestones.\nFroome and his teammates finished together linked in a line, their arms over each other\u2019s shoulders, with the yellow jersey winner grinning in the middle.\nThat locked in Froome\u2019s Tour lead to guarantee his victory, generating a broad smile as he rode up the avenue lined with flag-waving spectators.\nThird-placed Alejandro Valverde, Quintana\u2019s Movistar teammate from Spain, made the podium for the first time, moving up from fourth last year."}
