The study also found that only 16 percent of all physicians surveyed were willing to accept the financial risk \u2013 a key element of many value-based relationships sought by insurers. This lack of trust will be a huge hurdle for payers to overcome as they often cite physician buy-in and engagement as critical to the success of any value-based arrangement.\n\nThis topic is addressed and potential solutions are provided in an report published this week in the FTI Journal, titled \u201cThe Great Divide: How Payers and Physicians View Value-Based Arrangements.\u201d The report summarizes the results of the 2014 FTI Consulting Payer-Provider survey, conducted by the FTI Consulting Strategic Communications and Health Solutions team and led by Dorothy DeAngelis, Senior Managing Director, and Mark Fish, Managing Director, of the FTI Consulting Health Solutions team.\n\nSince the 2010 Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), healthcare payers and providers, both in concert and independently, have been preparing for value-based reimbursement programs in which meeting quality-of-care and cost-reduction targets would result in benefits for both groups and the nation as a whole. This has manifested itself in the growth of Accountable Care Organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d), bundled arrangements and new relationships that have blurred the lines between insurers and providers.\n\nSome of the key findings from the survey include:\n\n\u2013 The gap between the two groups continues to widen. Payers believe that a mere 5 percent of providers are willing to accept the downside risks necessary for value-based models to work.\n\n\u2013 Payers want providers to invest in healthcare IT. Especially in systems and software supporting clinical integration and population health management.\n\n\u2013 Wellness programs are becoming a bigger priority. Most payer respondents say their organization is attempting to create wellness programs as an integral part of value-based care and to reduce preventable hospital admissions.\n\n\u2013 It\u2019s all about the physicians. 53 percent of payers consider the quality and degree of physician engagement a critical factor in making the decision to approach a potential provider partner, and payers rank physician support as the second most important capability required for future value-based success.", "article_metadata": {"description": "41 percent of physicians not currently in a value-based arrangements say their biggest obstacle to entering into one is their distrust of payers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"description": "41 percent of physicians not currently in a value-based arrangements say their biggest obstacle to entering into one is their distrust of payers.", "title": "Value-Based Arrangements: 41% of Physicians Distrust Payers", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Value-Based-Arrangements.jpg", "height": 860}, "updated_time": "2014-09-25T20:31:14-04:00", "url": "http://hitconsultant.net/2014/09/26/value-based-arrangements-41-of-physicians-distrust-payers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "41 percent of physicians not currently in a value-based arrangements say their biggest obstacle to entering into one is their distrust of payers.", "title": "Value-Based Arrangements: 41% of Physicians Distrust Payers", "image": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Value-Based-Arrangements.jpg", "creator": "@hitconsultant", "site": "@hitconsultant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/HIT-Consultant-Media/302199219847409", "section": "ACO", "tag": "Value-Based Health Care", "published_time": "2014-09-26T00:00:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-25T20:31:14-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "ZfA9TYzJhTo4Qq5hZKk2GVBYHj0-7Bu73PO0P5jbDaI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf87a\"", "article_summary": "Thought you might find this interesting SubmitAccording the recently conducted 2014 FTI Consulting Payer-Provider Survey, 41 percent of physicians not currently in a value-based arrangements say their biggest obstacle to entering into one is their distrust of payers.\nPayers believe that a mere 5 percent of providers are willing to accept the downside risks necessary for value-based models to work.\nThe study also found that only 16 percent of all physicians surveyed were willing to accept the financial risk \u2013 a key element of many value-based relationships sought by insurers.\nThis lack of trust will be a huge hurdle for payers to overcome as they often cite physician buy-in and engagement as critical to the success of any value-based arrangement.\n\u2013 Payers want providers to invest in healthcare IT."}
