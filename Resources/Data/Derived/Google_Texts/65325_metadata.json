Russia is in violation of its international obligations; Russia\u2019s in violation of its obligations under the U.N. charter, under the Helsinki Final Act. It\u2019s in violation of obligations under the 1994 Budapest agreement. You just don\u2019t, in the 21st century, behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pretext. So, it is a very serious moment, but it\u2019s serious not in the context of Russia-U.S., it\u2019s serious in terms of sort of the modern manner in which nations will resolve problems,\u201d said Kerry.\n\nKerry\u2019s comments came during an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d He also appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d to discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has now called Russia\u2019s actions a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d and the Ukrainian State Security Council has ordered military reservists to \u201creport immediately to their mobilization stations.\u201d\n\nAs tensions escalate, U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle publicly condemned Russia\u2019s actions, while some Republican lawmakers criticized the president\u2019s reaction.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) urged President Barack Obama to \u201cstop going on television and trying to threaten thugs and dictators.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time the president goes on national television and threatens Putin or anyone like Putin everybody\u2019s eyes roll, including mine,\u201d Graham explained on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a weak and indecisive president that invites aggression. President Obama needs to do something. How about this: Suspend Russian membership in the G8 and the G20, at least for a year, starting right now. And for every day that they stay in the Crimea, add to the suspension. Do something.\u201d\n\nKerry outlined a potential list of repercussions should Russia remain in Crimea.\n\n\u201cThey are inviting the possibility of very serious repercussions on trade, on investment, on assets, asset freeze, visa bans, the potential of actions by the global community against this unilateral step,\u201d Kerry said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hope of the U.S. and everybody in the world is not to see this escalate into military confrontation. That does not serve the world well, and I think everybody understands that.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the actions by the administration to date have been inconsequential.\n\n\u201cIf any of that would have gotten [Putin\u2019s] attention, he wouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place,\u201d said Rogers.\n\n\u201cThis is not an isolated incident. \u2026 This is direct relation to what\u2019s happened in Syria, the negotiations there. They thought they did well. They\u2019re holding their position. So, if you look at a series of events, Russia believes that there is nothing going to stop them, which is why they\u2019ve been so aggressive in Crimea.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R., Fl.) appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and noted he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by what Secretary Kerry said.\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cI think our policy towards Russia under this administration deserves heavy criticism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere already things I would like to see us do in addition to the steps [Kerry] outlined,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cIt\u2019s important to learn from the errors of the last few years where I think we have not accurately, or through this administration, assessed clearly what Russia\u2019s goals are under Vladimir Putin. They\u2019re not interested in building an international norm that nations conduct themselves under, like what Secretary Kerry was just describing a moment ago. They\u2019re interested in reconstituting Russian power and Russian prestige, and often at the expense of U.S. national interests.\u201d\n\nWhile Rubio called for stronger pushback, he cautioned he was not advocating for military action, and Rogers echoed that sentiment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fairly hawkish guy, sending more naval forces to operate in the Black Sea is not a good idea given that we know that that day has long passed. Unless you\u2019re intending to use them, I wouldn\u2019t send them,\u201d said Rogers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got now only economic options through the E.U. I would use those.\u201d\n\nRogers argued it would be wise to pull out of the G8 summit now and \u201cgo into a very aggressive posture on how we help the Ukraine financially.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kerry on Sunday called Russia\u2019s military movements in Crimea \u201ca stunning willful choice by President Putin to invade another country.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea \u201ca stunning willful choice by President Putin to invade another country.\u201d    \u201cRussia is in violation of the sovereign", "title": "Sunday Show Round Up", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/sunday-show-round-up-17/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/John-Kerry-Meet-the-Press-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea \u201ca stunning willful c", "creator": "@ellisonbarber", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/John-Kerry-Meet-the-Press-150x150.png", "title": "Sunday Show Round Up", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec8e\"", "article_summary": "Ukraine has now called Russia\u2019s actions a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d and the Ukrainian State Security Council has ordered military reservists to \u201creport immediately to their mobilization stations.\u201dAs tensions escalate, U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle publicly condemned Russia\u2019s actions, while some Republican lawmakers criticized the president\u2019s reaction.\nRussia is in violation of its international obligations; Russia\u2019s in violation of its obligations under the U.N. charter, under the Helsinki Final Act.\nBY: Follow @ellisonbarberSecretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea \u201ca stunning willful choice by President Putin to invade another country.\u201d\u201cRussia is in violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine.\nHow about this: Suspend Russian membership in the G8 and the G20, at least for a year, starting right now.\nYou just don\u2019t, in the 21st century, behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pretext."}
