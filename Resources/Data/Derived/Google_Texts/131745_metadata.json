Softheon's expertise and track record of success with Edge Server and Baseline Reporting has been commended since receiving pass rates for 99% of carriers for 2015; a significant improvement in comparison to previous years. In fact, most CMS exceptions have been appealed by the carrier due to Softheon's data accuracy. In addition, Softheon's data reconciliations stretch beyond that of just enrollment data received from the insurance exchange marketplaces. Daily bank reconciliations are performed to ensure that transactions within Softheon's system successfully match up to funds deposited into clients' custodial accounts, both through lockbox and merchant service processing channels. Automated processes have been put in place to assist in daily reconciliations, which encompass over 200,000 members.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides reduced cost-sharing for eligible individuals who purchase health insurance from a qualified Marketplace Plan. As a result, CSRs are paid by issuers to lower the out-of-pocket cost to enrollees - making health care more accessible and affordable to those in need.\n\nAlong with strict deadlines, CMS requires all QHPs to:\n\nDetermine advance payments to approximate the value of the cost-sharing subsidy. Softheon can determine these payments based on the CSR stored within the enrollment spans or premiums table.\n\nReconcile all advance payment and actual subsidies at the end of the year.\n\nComplete an actuarial validation process and certify all results (required for the Simplified Method).\n\nRe-adjudicate 100% of claims (required for the Standard Method).\n\n\"Every year, health plans see new guidelines and complexities put forth by CMS during Open Enrollment.\n\nSoftheon's CSR solution was developed to aid health plans in projecting cost-sharing exposures, validating payments, and reconciling year-end results. It is our passion to combine knowledge, expertise, and experience to produce outstanding results,\" said Eugene Sayan, Softheon CEO & Founder.\n\nThis year, CMS will require all health plans to submit their CSR calculations by April 30, 2016, for 2014 and 2015 plan years. By January 1, 2016, a reconciliation method, either Simplified or Standard, must be chosen.\n\nAbout Softheon\n\nEmpowering the nation's first state health benefit exchange since 2008, Softheon's vision and strategic direction address healthcare payer, provider, and government agencies' goal of meeting Affordable Care Act (ACA) milestones.
