Hoffman and the state Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor.\n\nIn a statement, Hoffman said Naum Lavnevich, 57, of Oakland, pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree health care claims fraud before Bergen County Superior Court Judge Edward A. Jerejian. As part of the plea agreement, the state recommended that he serve three years in state prison and pay restitution in the amount of $5,614. His sentencing is scheduled for April 10.\n\nAccording to attorney general\u2019s office, Lavnevich admitted that between January 2008 and October 2010, he caused 178 claims to be submitted to Medicaid for services that were not provided.\n\nLavnevich was employed by Confident Care Corp., which did not respond to a request to comment on the case.\n\nAccording to the attorney general\u2019s office, Lavnevich is one of six current or former employees of Confident Care to be charged by the OIFP for fraudulent Medicaid billing.\n\nActing Insurance Fraud Prosecutor Ronald Chillemi said there have been major fraud cases that started with anonymous tips. He encouraged anyone with information about a possible fraud to report it anonymously by calling the toll\u2011free hotline at (877) 55\u2011FRAUD, or visiting the website NJInsurancefraud.org. Chillemi said state regulations permit a reward to be paid to an eligible person who provides information that leads to an arrest, prosecution and conviction for insurance fraud.\n\nIn its latest annual report, the OIFP reported that, in 2012 and 2013 combined, the False Claims Act group in its Medicaid Fraud Control Unit recouped about $72 million for the state\u2019s Medicaid program: \u201cby far the highest two-year total for this program since it was formed in 2008.\u201d The report said the results point to the OIFP\u2019s ability \u201cto successfully handle large cases against more sophisticated adversaries.\u201d\n\nLinda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, said, \u201cWhen providers charge for things that aren\u2019t really being done or shouldn\u2019t be done or overcharge, they not only cheat the taxpayers, but they are depriving honest patients and providers of resources that are desperately needed.\u201d\n\nSchwimmer added: \u201cThis is especially true as the number of beneficiaries in Medicaid expands, and we try to keep people in their homes as long as possible. High quality home care is essential and fraud diminishes the ability to support it. Patients and their caregivers should make sure that they do not sign documents stating that they received care that they did not really receive.\u201d\n\nSchwimmer urged individuals who have any fraud concerns to contact the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nChrissy Buteas, chief executive and president of the Home Care Association of N.J., said her organization applauds the work of the Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor. She said Confident Care is not an association member.\n\n\u201cOur association lobbied for and won passage of a state law that will require all health care service firms to not only receive accreditation, but to undergo an annual financial audit,\u201d Buteas said. \u201cWe will not allow unscrupulous agencies to profit from families who are only looking to ensure proper care for a loved one and will continue to work with the administration to protect the public by ridding the industry of bad actors.\u201d\n\nShe said her members \u201care committed care providers who put the needs of the patients in their care above all else and ascribe to the highest level of professionalism and ethics. The families across the state who rely on our member agencies and home health aides for care should rest assured that we have safeguards in place to protect against fraud.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nState of the State: Christie praises incentives, omits Transportation Trust Fund\n\nExclusive: One of state's top marketing firms buying one of its biggest creative agencies\n\nGeorgia offered Mercedes more than $23M in incentives to move, report says", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "A Medicaid fraud guilty plea announced this week by the state attorney general's office highlights an emerging issue: As Medicaid coverage in New Jersey is expanded under the Affordable Care Act, vig", "title": "As Medicaid coverage increases in N.J., concern about fraud grows, too | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20150114/NJBIZ01/150119908/as-medicaid-coverage-increases-in-nj-concern-about-fraud-grows-too", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "A Medicaid fraud guilty plea announced this week by the state attorney general's office highlights an emerging issue: As Medicaid coverage in New Jersey is expanded under the Affordable Care Act, vig", "title": "As Medicaid coverage increases in N.J., concern about fraud grows, too | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg"}, "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A Medicaid fraud guilty plea announced this week by the state attorney general's office highlights an emerging issue: As Medicaid coverage in New Jersey is expanded under the Affordable Care Act, vigilance is needed to avoid an increase in fraud.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1a9\"", "article_summary": "Acting Insurance Fraud Prosecutor Ronald Chillemi said there have been major fraud cases that started with anonymous tips.\nA Medicaid fraud guilty plea announced this week by the state attorney general's office highlights an emerging issue: As Medicaid coverage in New Jersey is expanded under the Affordable Care Act, vigilance is needed to avoid an increase in fraud.\nIn a statement, Hoffman said Naum Lavnevich, 57, of Oakland, pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree health care claims fraud before Bergen County Superior Court Judge Edward A.
