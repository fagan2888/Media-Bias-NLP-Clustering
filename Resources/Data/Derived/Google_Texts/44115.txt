In either a truly embarrassing attempt at humor or yet another display of the inner workings of his profoundly imbalanced and unpleasant mind, radio star and conspiracy theory enthusiast Alex Jones announced on Thursday that comedienne Joan Rivers was right to call President Obama the first gay president, because first lady Michelle Obama is a “tranny.”

“Well, Joan Rivers talked about it the other day, and now it’s an international news story,” Jones said on-air. “The question is, ‘Who is Michelle Obama? Is she really a woman? Is she a man?’”

Jones went on to say he was “not drawing any conclusions” but that “it’s fair to question anything and everything this administration says” because no other administration in American history has “been caught with such a perfect record of everything they say and do being a lie or a fraud.”

Because the Obama administration is so dishonest, Jones concluded — what with its refusal to acknowledge chem trails, and how 9/11 was an inside job, and FEMA concentration camps, and Agenda 21, and the lizard-men who are secretly trying to harvest our precious bodily fluids — it is entirely understandable that “the public doesn’t believe anything they’re saying.”

“[E]specially,” Jones added, “when every time I look at ‘Michelle’ or ‘Michael’ Obama — the first lady, or first tranny — something doesn’t look right.”
