In their January 2009 policy paper, the two economists claimed that the unemployment rate would not exceed 7.9% with the stimulus bill, while it would reach 8.8% without it. Because, you know, counterfactual.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nEven with the $831 billion stimulus bill, the unemployment rate rose from 7.8% in January 2009 to 10% in October of that same year, at which point Romer declared that the measure had already had its greatest impact. In fact, unemployment didn\u2019t fall below 9% until October 2011.\n\nThe infamous Romer-Bernstein chart shows the unemployment rate falling to 5% in December 2013. In reality, the December 2013 unemployment rate was 6.7%, nearly 2 points higher.\n\nHardcore Keynesian economists, including Paul Krugman, insist the stimulus bill didn\u2019t work because it wasn\u2019t large enough. Then again, Krugman has written fondly of death and destruction because he believes it will drive economic output.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) marked the anniversary of the stimulus bill by declaring it to be a complete failure and urged Washington tackle pro-growth economic policies.\n\n\u201cIf you recall five years ago, the notion was that if the government spent all this money \u2014 that, by the way, was borrowed \u2014 that somehow the economy would begin to grow and create jobs,\u201d Rubio said in a YouTube video. \u201cWell, of course, it clearly failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive years later,\u201d he continued, \u201cunderemployment is still too high, the number of people that have dropped out of the workforce is astounding, unemployment remains stubbornly high and our economy isn\u2019t growing fast enough \u2014 proof that massive government spending, particularly debt spending, is not the solution to our economic growth problems.\u201d\n\nRubio says that a \u201cvibrant free enterprise economy and a people with the skills and the education needed to take up those jobs that a vibrant free enterprise economy would create\u201d is what the White House and Congress should promote.\n\nIf there is anything that the stimulus bill has taught us it\u2019s that the behavior of people cannot be so easily determined by economic models and forecasts. This isn\u2019t necessarily a new lesson. Friedrich Hayek wrote in his 1988 book, The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism, \u201dThe curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, President Obama and congressional Democrats continue to push an agenda \u2014 including Obamacare, billions in tax hikes, and new regulations \u2014 that has hampered the economic recovery.\n\nAfter five years of doing the same thing over and over again, one would think that a new course would be mapped out. But rather than trying something different, President Obama and his cohorts in Congress have become the very definition of insanity.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,Barack Obama,Christina Romer,deficit spending,Democrats,economic recovery,Friedrich Hayek,Great Recession,infrastructure,Marco Rubio,national debt,recovery,stimulus,Stimulus Bill,Unemployment", "DC.Title": "Failed $831 billion stimulus bill signed five years ago today", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "Believe it or not, folks, it&#8217;s been five years since President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the 2009 stimulus measure spent $831 billion on infrastructure, tax credits, and other policies that largely served"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee16\"", "article_summary": "Hardcore Keynesian economists, including Paul Krugman, insist the stimulus bill didn\u2019t work because it wasn\u2019t large enough.\nBut rather than trying something different, President Obama and his cohorts in Congress have become the very definition of insanity.\nIn their January 2009 policy paper, the two economists claimed that the unemployment rate would not exceed 7.9% with the stimulus bill, while it would reach 8.8% without it.\nEven with the $831 billion stimulus bill, the unemployment rate rose from 7.8% in January 2009 to 10% in October of that same year, at which point Romer declared that the measure had already had its greatest impact.\nSen.
