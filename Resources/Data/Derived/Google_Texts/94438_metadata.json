Berg, who last week became DU\u2019s all-time leading scorer, finished with a team-high five points.\n\nBaptiste \u2014 who entered with an NCAA-leading .706 success rate \u2014 was nearly perfect on restarts to move into fourth place in single-season wins (202) by a Pioneer. He is on pace to break Geoff Snider\u2019s 2006 record of 242.\n\nWithout Baptiste\u2019s dominance at the \u201cX,\u201d Denver (10-2, 4-0 Big East) would have been in trouble against the Friars (4-8, 0-4).\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about Trevor. Thank God we have him, because the rest of the game wasn\u2019t very pretty,\u201d DU coach Bill Tierney said.\n\nThe Pioneers trailed 2-0 early and 5-3 at halftime but outscored the Friars 6-1 in the third quarter. DU improved to 4-0 when playing from behind at the break, including late rallies over highly-touted Duke and Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cThis team has been on a roller-coaster ride all year,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cWe think everything is fine, and the minute we start thinking that, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s practice, mentality, (lack of) focus \u2014 and then you come out against a really well-coached team with a bunch of good athletes with their backs against the wall and excited to play at our place.\n\n\u201cWe missed the first shot of the game, get stuffed on the crease, and everybody for a half decides to do it on their own. That\u2019s not how they\u2019re built. The message at halftime was, \u2018We\u2019re built to do it together, not alone.\u2019 And you saw what we could do in the first five minutes of the third quarter.\u201d\n\nDU came closer to playing its first two NCAA Tournament games in the Mile High City. The preseason No. 1 Pioneers, who conclude the regular season next Saturday at Marquette before beginning the Big East Tournament on April 30 in Villanova, Pa., are on pace to host a first-round NCAA game and, with a victory, assured of playing a May 16 quarterfinal game at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nDenver has advanced to the NCAA Final Four in three of the past four years.\n\nUnexpectedly, Baptiste is the biggest reason the Pioneers could advance to the national semifinals May 23-25 in Philadelphia. The true freshman from Denville, N.Y., scored his fifth goal of the season off one of his 22 faceoff wins Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll my coaches and teammates say they have my back,\u201d Baptiste said of the mounting pressure he feels. \u201cI was in talking to Coach T and said all the press and everything is a lot. How do I live up to that? As long as I\u2019m not giving up fast breaks, I\u2019m good. Obviously we\u2019d love to have possession every time and I had a good day today. But on the broader picture, we have to continue to work hard and work as a team.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Baptiste\u2019s dominance in faceoffs carries Denver past Providence", "title": "Baptiste\u2019s dominance in faceoffs carries Denver past Providence", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/18/baptistes-dominance-in-faceoffs-carries-denver-past-providence/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150418__DU-PROVIDENCE-LACROSSEp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150418__DU-PROVIDENCE-LACROSSEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-18T16:06:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:52:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1ea\"", "article_summary": "Without Baptiste\u2019s dominance at the \u201cX,\u201d Denver (10-2, 4-0 Big East) would have been in trouble against the Friars (4-8, 0-4).\nDU improved to 10-0 all-time in Big East Conference play and extend its NCAA-leading active home winning streak to 15 games.\nDenver has advanced to the NCAA Final Four in three of the past four years.\nSenior Wes Berg and sophomores Tyler Pace and Connor Cannizzaro had hat tricks and sophomore Zach Miller had two goals and four points.\nDU improved to 4-0 when playing from behind at the break, including late rallies over highly-touted Duke and Notre Dame."}
