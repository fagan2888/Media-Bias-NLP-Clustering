Fun piece from Sarah Kliff on shopping for Obamacare with Ted Cruz:

Cruz previously had a health plan through his wife Heidi's job at Goldman Sachs. But the family will lose that coverage when Heidi takes a leave of absence to campaign full-time. And this will put the Cruz family into a situation familiar to millions of Americans: figuring out what to do when you can no longer get coverage through work.

Now, Cruz's situation is a little bit different â€” he's a member of Congress, so he will have a job even after his wife Heidi leaves hers. But under Obamacare, legislators can only get their coverage through the law's insurance marketplaces rather than the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, which covers other federal workers.

This means Cruz will likely spend some time shopping on Healthcare.gov. And because of the new window-shopping options the website added this year, we can actually see the plans the senator will choose from. But first, we have to enter in some information about the Cruz family.
