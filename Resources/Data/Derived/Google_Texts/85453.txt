After asking Cruz about his campaign, the reporter peppered the GOP presidential candidate with a series of trivia questions.

ADVERTISEMENT Some of them centered on politics — Cruz knew that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is the youngest current member of the U.S. Senate, but did not know that Henry Clay was elected to the Senate at the unconstitutional age of 29 in 1806.

Cruz also faced questions about pop music and football.

Asked who was the first sitting U.S. president to travel abroad, Cruz quipped: “No idea, though I will say this, I wish the current president would travel abroad much more often.”
