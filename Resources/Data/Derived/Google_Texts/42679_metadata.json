researchers at least $1 million to uncover the identities of dark Web users as part of a sweeping criminal investigation.\n\nEarlier this week, the Tor Project, which oversees the leading online anonymity software Tor, said it had evidence the FBI had made a massive payment to Carnegie Mellon University in an attempt to out the personal details of a wide swath of Tor users.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat allegation is \u201cinaccurate,\u201d an FBI representative told The Hill.\n\nThe Tor Project claim spurred widespread anger in the security research and digital rights community.\n\nNot only would such a collaboration have represented an ethically questionable tactic, Tor Project Director Roger Dingledine argued, it may also have violated the Fourth Amendment if the FBI did not obtain a warrant.\n\n\u201cCivil liberties are under attack if law enforcement believes it can circumvent the rules of evidence by outsourcing police work to universities,\u201d Dingledine said in a blog post. \u201cIf academia uses \u2018research\u2019 as a stalking horse for privacy invasion, the entire enterprise of security research will fall into disrepute.\u201d\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the unmasking efforts came during the FBI\u2019s investigation into Silk Road 2.0, the major dark Web market that, like its notorious predecessor, enabled more than 100,000 people to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously over the Internet, according to the Justice Department.\n\nIn the bust last November, authorities took down the central marketplace and dozens of other similar dark Web sites while arresting a handful of people in connection with Silk Road 2.0.\n\nAt the time, Tor acknowledged it wasn\u2019t sure exactly how investigators had cracked the anonymity of the Tor users, and many worried Tor might have been widely compromised.\n\nThe FBI on Friday did not provide any additional details as to how it did uncover those dark Web users during the Silk Road 2.0 sting.\n\nThe bureau does maintain public research partnerships with Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The agency said that's not how it
