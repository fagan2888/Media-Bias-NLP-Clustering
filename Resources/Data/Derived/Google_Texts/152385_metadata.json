Which is why these days the recovering cocaine addict and barbershop owner spends his time helping others in need in an effort to pay his good fortune forward.\n\n\u201cI love it so much, it\u2019s like my new way of getting high \u2026 It\u2019s like my new drug,\u201d Sobhani, a Canadian who lives in Melbourne, Australia, tells a customer in an online video posted by PLGRMAGE.\n\nSobhani, 26, used to spend up to $400 per day on cocaine before getting clean, blaming his addiction on a deep-seated self-hatred. He was able to overcome his addiction through a stint in rehab and shifting his focus to his religious convictions. Sobhani was raised in the Baha\u2019i faith, a monotheistic religion originally founded in Persia that he says is more about \u201caction\u201d and \u201cserving people\u201d than strict beliefs.\n\nThe barber also credits his family with sticking by him and encouraging him to pursue his passion for hair-cutting. Thanks to their support, he was able to move to Melbourne three years ago and make an entirely fresh start. He realizes that not everyone has such a support system.\n\n\u201cI used to see a homeless person and give them loose change think, \u2018I\u2019ve done my part for the day,\u2019\u201d he tells PLGRMAGE. \u201cBut I realized that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nHe started doling out free cuts to needy individuals in his area one year ago, aptly naming the effort \u201cClean Cut, Clean Start.\u201d Now, on his one free day a week, he rides his skateboard through the streets of Melbourne and neighboring Footscray, seeking out anyone who may be in need of a touch up.\n\n\u201cYou already have a new-found confidence when you get a haircut, and now imagine what it\u2019s like for someone who\u2019s really been in a bad place in their life,\u201d Sobhani tells The Herald Sun.\n\nSobhani hopes that the time he spends with his clients will have a mental as well as physical impact. He encourages the men and women he works with to open up about their struggles, and hosts a weekly devotional meeting in his home that he invites clients to attend. At the meeting, he asks guests to share insights, Bible scriptures, song lyrics, or other words that hold special meaning to them.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what walk of life you\u2019re from, what religion you\u2019re confined to, what beliefs or philosophies you may have,\u201d Sobhani says. \u201cThere\u2019s only one rule and that is respect one another.\u201d\n\nHis efforts haven\u2019t gone unnoticed. Sobhani, who goes by the name \u201cThe Streets Barber\u201d on social media, has nearly 30,000 followers on Instagram alone, posting photos throughout the day of his various clients and interactions.\n\n\u201cPeople ask what\u2019s the craziest thing that\u2019s happened to me in the streets while cutting,\u201d Sobhani writes underneath one such photo. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to answer that because every time is just as memorable as the last.\u201d\n\n(Warning: Video contains graphic language)\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "He decided to change his life.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He decided to change his life.", "title": "Meet the Former Addict Who Now Cuts Homeless People\u2019s Hair", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150702_barbershop.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-02T15:07:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NzyAsp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "He decided to change his life.", "title": "Meet the Former Addict Who Now Cuts Homeless People\u2019s Hair", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150702_barbershop.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "welfare", "published_time": "2015-07-02T13:57:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T15:07:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "the streets barber, nasir sobhani, addict, homeless, hair, cut"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI used to see a homeless person and give them loose change think, \u2018I\u2019ve done my part for the day,\u2019\u201d he tells PLGRMAGE.\nSobhani, 26, used to spend up to $400 per day on cocaine before getting clean, blaming his addiction on a deep-seated self-hatred.\n\u201cPeople ask what\u2019s the craziest thing that\u2019s happened to me in the streets while cutting,\u201d Sobhani writes underneath one such photo.\n\u201cYou already have a new-found confidence when you get a haircut, and now imagine what it\u2019s like for someone who\u2019s really been in a bad place in their life,\u201d Sobhani tells The Herald Sun.\nHe was able to overcome his addiction through a stint in rehab and shifting his focus to his religious convictions."}
