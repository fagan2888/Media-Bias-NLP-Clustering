The self-employed would have to fork over the entire 10 percent by themselves.\n\nOnly a few years ago, it would have seemed inconceivable that a major political party would endorse such a tax, let alone the largest tax increase in Colorado history. But Colorado Democrats did just that at their state convention on April 16.\n\nEither the party activists were so enthralled with the very idea of universal health care \u2014 socialized medicine, to be blunt \u2014 that they didn\u2019t notice the $25 billion cost. Or they purposely left the cost out of their endorsement from fear it would turn hard-working taxpayers against Democrats heading into a very partisan election.\n\nFor the record, Gov. John Hickenlooper and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet are two prominent Democrats opposing Amendment 69.\n\nNote that the federal government\u2019s payroll withholding tax for Medicare is 2.9 percent (1.45 percent employer, 1.45 percent employee) \u2014 less than one-third of ColoradoCare\u2019s 10 percent hit on our pay.\n\nBesides, Americans\u2019 experience with government-run health care has not been so good with Obamacare \u2014 the misnamed Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmendment 69 would grant a board of trustees \u2014 initially appointed, but then elected \u2014 the awesome power to increase the 10 percent, if in the previous year ColoradoCare ran a budget deficit as many of the Obamacare exchanges have. How soon would it be before the tax rose to 15 percent, 20 percent or more?\n\nAmendment 69 would exempt ColoradoCare from Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights limits. It does say the 10 percent tax could be raised only by approval of a majority of ColoradoCare members. That may mean all taxpayers, although it doesn\u2019t say so.\n\nWe strongly suspect an exodus of the private health insurance industry and businesses, both small and large, from Colorado if Amendment 69 passes.\n\nWe also wonder how many Coloradans \u2014 including the labor unions and most public employees \u2014 would take having to pay more for less than their present health care plans.\n\nAmendment 69 appears to be the biggest threat to Colorado\u2019s economy and general welfare ever to make the ballot. The $25 billion tax is a bitter pill to take.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/opinion/4739096-120/percent-tax-amendment-colorado", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://forms.chieftain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pueblo-chieftain-1200x630.png", "type": "article", "title": "Politics: $25 billion tax"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "article_summary": "The $25 billion tax is a bitter pill to take.\neditorialschieftain editorialAN UNPRECEDENTED $25 billion tax increase hasn\u2019t deterred the Colorado Democratic Party from endorsing Amendment 69 on the state\u2019s Nov. 8 ballot.\nEither the party activists were so enthralled with the very idea of universal health care \u2014 socialized medicine, to be blunt \u2014 that they didn\u2019t notice the $25 billion cost.\nAmendment 69 appears to be the biggest threat to Colorado\u2019s economy and general welfare ever to make the ballot.\nBesides, Americans\u2019 experience with government-run health care has not been so good with Obamacare \u2014 the misnamed Affordable Care Act."}
