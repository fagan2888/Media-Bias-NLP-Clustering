The New York Times has a devastating new report out about how the law\u2019s high deductibles have given Americans \u201csticker shock.\u201d\n\nIn many states, more than half the plans offered for sale through HealthCare.gov, the federal online marketplace, have a deductible of $3,000 or more, a New York Times review has found. Those deductibles are causing concern among Democrats \u2014 and some Republican detractors of the health law, who once pushed high-deductible health plans in the belief that consumers would be more cost-conscious if they had more of a financial stake or skin in the game.\n\nHere are just a couple of the health law\u2019s unfortunate users.\n\n\u201cThe deductible, $3,000 a year, makes it impossible to actually go to the doctor,\u201d said David R. Reines, 60, of Jefferson Township, N.J., a former hardware salesman with chronic knee pain. \u201cWe have insurance, but can\u2019t afford to use it.\u201d Josie Gibb of Albuquerque pays about $400 a month in premiums, after subsidies, for a silver-level insurance plan with a deductible of $6,000. \u201cThe deductible,\u201d she said, \u201cis so high that I have to pay for everything all year \u2014 visits with a gynecologist, a dermatologist, all blood work, all tests. It\u2019s really just a catastrophic policy.\u201d\n\nThese confessions come after President Obama touted the ACA as a law that would put more money in peoples\u2019 pockets.\n\n\"I bet if you took a poll, most folks wouldn\u2019t know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare (laughter) -- that they got this extra money in their pockets. But that's what's happening,\" he said.\n\nHe felt emboldened to make such a claim because of the supposed lower premiums families would be paying. However, for Americans like Karin Rosner and Kevin Fanning, the low premium does little to offset their high deductible costs.\n\n\u201cWhile my premiums are affordable, the out-of-pocket expenses required to meet the deductible are not,\u201d said Ms. Rosner, who makes about $30,000 a year. Mr. Fanning, the North Texan, said he and his wife had a policy with a monthly premium of about $500 and an annual deductible of about $10,000 after taking account of financial assistance. Their income is about $32,000 a year.\n\nThe prices are convincing some that they would be better off rejecting the insurance plan and paying the $695 penalty, according to the Times.\n\n\"After a century of talk, after decades of trying, after a year of sustained debate, we finally made affordable health care here in America a reality.\" \u2013 President Obama", "article_metadata": {"description": "We cannot afford it. .05/26/2016 20:28:07PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "We cannot afford it.", "title": "Consumers: Obamacare's High Deductibles Makes it 'Impossible' to Go to the Doctor", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/16/consumers-obamacares-high-deductibles-makes-it-impossible-to-go-to-the-doctor-n2081590", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/176/c7f3214b-c138-45ae-885e-13bbf435605c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "We cannot afford it.", "title": "Consumers: Obamacare's High Deductibles Makes it 'Impossible' to Go to the Doctor", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/16/consumers-obamacares-high-deductibles-makes-it-impossible-to-go-to-the-doctor-n2081590", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/176/c7f3214b-c138-45ae-885e-13bbf435605c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Consumers: Obamacare's High Deductibles Makes it 'Impossible' to Go to the Doctor, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "However, for Americans like Karin Rosner and Kevin Fanning, the low premium does little to offset their high deductible costs.\n\u201cWe cannot afford it\u201d seems to be the common complaint among consumers who signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\"After a century of talk, after decades of trying, after a year of sustained debate, we finally made affordable health care here in America a reality.\"\n\u201cWhile my premiums are affordable, the out-of-pocket expenses required to meet the deductible are not,\u201d said Ms. Rosner, who makes about $30,000 a year.\n\u201cThe deductible, $3,000 a year, makes it impossible to actually go to the doctor,\u201d said David R.
