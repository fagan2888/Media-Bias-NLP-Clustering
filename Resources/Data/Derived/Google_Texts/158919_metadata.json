Two different people facing backlash for running health-related crowdfunding campaigns are renewing some controversy over the practice, which has been on the rise over the past several years.\n\nAda Guan didn\u2019t realize she was pregnant until she gave birth while she was on an airplane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Now that the 23-year-old Canadian and her boyfriend have a healthy baby girl, they\u2019ve asked the internet to help chip in for their medical costs, explaining that Guan is currently unemployed.\n\nBut they were surprised by the negative reaction provoked by their site, which initially asked for $50,000 \u2014 many commenters called them \u201cgreedy\u201d and accused them of attempting to profit off their unexpected situation. Some angry people told them they should have been using birth control, while others complained that Guan should get a job. The couple ended up scaling back their ask to $5,000.\n\nSouth Carolina resident Luis Lang, meanwhile, is sparking a political debate over health care reform with his own crowdfunding site, which is asking people to help cover the costs of a surgery that will help save his eyesight.\n\nThe 49-year-old Republican is self-employed and opted not to purchase health insurance under Obamacare; he says he\u2019s always prided himself in being able to pay for his own medical bills. But now that he\u2019s facing a health emergency stemming from his chronic diabetes, it\u2019s too late to sign up for a plan, and Lang is struggling to come up with the thousands of dollars he needs to treat the bleeding in his eyes. He told the Charlotte Observer that he thought President Obama\u2019s health law would still be able to offer him help in an emergency.\n\nAfter Lang\u2019s story was covered in the Charlotte Observer, his crowdfunding page was flooded with Obamacare supporters urging him to change his mind about health care policy. \u201cI wish you all the best. I hope you\u2019ll come to see ACA and health care for all as a basic right,\u201d one donor, who gave $5, wrote. Lang has since complained that he didn\u2019t want his crowdfunding effort to be politicized. \u201cBut how could it not be political?\u201d Leonard Pitts, an opinion columnist for The Miami Herald, wrote on Monday. \u201cNow, the bill comes due, and whatever he thought of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 as a model for financing health care, surely Lang must concede that GoFundMe is even worse.\u201d\n\nGuan and Lang are hardly alone. Faced with rising health costs, thousands of people are turning to online crowdfunding sites \u2014 like Kickstarter, GoFundMe, or GiveForward \u2014 to ask people on the internet to help them raise money for their medical bills. For health experts, the trend raises some troubling questions about whether it\u2019s appropriate for websites to function as desperate Americans\u2019 safety net.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a concern that it will become a pop-off valve for a health care system that\u2019s not doing its job,\u201d Margaret Moon, a bioethicist and professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, told the Atlantic earlier this year for a piece on medical crowdfunding. \u201cIf someone\u2019s raising money to cover the cost of cancer treatment, the question that raises on the other side is, why is our health care system not paying for necessary care?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly no solution, and it\u2019s probably not even a solution for the person raising the money \u2014 it just might help with this week\u2019s bill,\u201d Dr. Ida Hellander, the director of health policy for Physicians for a National Health Program, an U.S. organization that advocates for universal health care, told the Canadian Medical Journal for a similar piece published in 2012. \u201cIt shows how desperate people are, and it shows the magnitude of the crisis and the fact that the political will is not there to help people.\u201d\n\nMedical expenses are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, and Americans who require expensive medications for unexpected illnesses like cancer and are especially vulnerable to being forced to completely drain their bank accounts.\n\nThanks to the expansion of insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s some evidence that the health law is slowly starting to tackle this issue. A recent survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund found that, for the first time in a decade, the number of Americans struggling to pay their medical bills started to decline as the ACA went into effect. \u201cThis is a first indication that people are affording care that they weren\u2019t able to get in the past,\u201d one of the Commonwealth researchers told the New York Times at the time.\n\nHowever, the problem hasn\u2019t been solved across the board. Commonwealth also found that about 66 million adults are still having trouble paying for their care. Perusing sites like GoFundMe, where the largest percentage of all campaigns are health-related, that reality becomes all too evident. Over the past several years, people have set up crowdfunding sites to raise money for everything from lung cancer treatment to in vitro fertilization to gene sequencing.\n\nBut for one particular medical procedure, the internet draws the line: GoFundMe won\u2019t allow people to raise money to pay for abortion, saying that the company got complaints after one Illinois woman attempted to crowdfund to terminate a \u201crough, unplanned and unexpected pregnancy.\u201d The move sparked criticism from reproductive rights supporters. And the controversy over abortion fundraisers provides another example of the potential pitfalls of turning to crowdfunding sites: When the internet becomes the social safety net, who sets the terms?", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Should Americans be turning to the internet as their social safety net?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Should Americans be turning to the internet as their social safety net?", "title": "The Complicated Ethics Of Using The Internet To Fund Your Medical Bills", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/05/19/3660352/crowdfunding-medical-bills-ethics/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_256649947.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Should Americans be turning to the internet as their social safety net?", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_256649947-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Complicated Ethics Of Using The Internet To Fund Your Medical Bills", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_256649947.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_256649947.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-19T09:47:53+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health The Complicated Ethics Of Using The Internet To Fund Your Medical Bills CREDIT: ShutterstockIf you\u2019re faced with unexpected medical expenses that threaten to bankrupt your family, should you turn to the internet for help?\nI hope you\u2019ll come to see ACA and health care for all as a basic right,\u201d one donor, who gave $5, wrote.\nSome angry people told them they should have been using birth control, while others complained that Guan should get a job.\nAfter Lang\u2019s story was covered in the Charlotte Observer, his crowdfunding page was flooded with Obamacare supporters urging him to change his mind about health care policy.\nNow that the 23-year-old Canadian and her boyfriend have a healthy baby girl, they\u2019ve asked the internet to help chip in for their medical costs, explaining that Guan is currently unemployed."}
