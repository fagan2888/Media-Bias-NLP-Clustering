And under the Affordable Care Act \u201cfull time\u201d is any employee who works more than 30 hours a week. Senator Lisa Murkowski is sponsoring legislation that would change that threshold to 40 hours. Many restaurants owners in Anchorage are watching the legislation closely.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nIt just after the lunch rush at Crossbar in midtown Anchorage and Sous Chef Roy Martinez is grilling steak, plating french fries and trying to make out a confusing order slip. He wonders out loud if \u201con side add B\u201d means bacon. A server tells him it\u2019s actually code for brown gravy.\n\nMartinez does not get health insurance through work. But his boss, Crossbar owner Ken Ryther would like to change that:\n\n\u201cI would love to offer my employees that benefit.\u201d\n\nRyther worked at the Bear Tooth Theaterpub & Grill for 12 years, where he had employer sponsored health insurance. He knows health insurance helps retain employees and that in turn improves service and food quality. He also thinks it\u2019s the right thing to do. So when he opened Crossbar a year ago health insurance was on his radar, but he says it just wasn\u2019t feasible:\n\n\u201cThere was no way we could afford healthcare in the beginning given start up costs and a new business and managing cash flow.\u201d\n\nStarting next January, Ryther may no longer have a choice. That\u2019s when the Affordable Care Act will require businesses with more than 50 full time employees who work over 30 hours per week to provide insurance. Ryther says he\u2019s close to that threshold right now.\n\nThe legislation Senator Murkowski\u2019s proposing would bump the definition of \u201cfull time\u201d to 40 hours per week. That would make a big difference for Ryther:\n\n\u201cIt would definitely make life easier.\u201d\n\nMurkowski\u2019s office has heard from more than two dozen Alaska businesses who are concerned about the requirement, from restaurants, school districts and plumbers. Murkowski says the full time definition is forcing businesses to cut employee hours to under 30 hours per week to avoid paying the penalty for not providing insurance. She says it doesn\u2019t make sense:\n\n\u201cIf you ask most Americans, if you ask most Alaskans, what they consider full time to be, they\u2019ll say 40 hours.\u201d\n\nSome local restaurants already do provide health insurance. Moose\u2019s Tooth Pub and Pizzeria, which owns the Bear Tooth and Broken Tooth Brewing has offered employees health insurance for more than a decade. Brooke VanVeckhoven is the human resources manager for the company, which has about 500 employees in Anchorage. VanVeckhoven says the owners who started Moose\u2019s Tooth in 1996 considered health insurance an important benefit and offered it within a few years of opening. But she understands why other businesses, especially restaurants, struggle to do the same:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been contacted by a lot of small local restaurants who would love to offer health insurance to their employees, even before the requirement by the government, and it\u2019s just hard for them to find something that\u2019s affordable that doesn\u2019t eat every bit of their profits.\u201d\n\nThat concern for the bottom line is very real for Crossbar owner Ken Ryther. As he considers potentially having to provide health insurance, he is also worrying about the minimum wage increase, which will take effect next month. He says at a certain point, the impact on his business becomes unsustainable:\n\n\u201cFolks are going to be having to pay a whole lot more to go out to eat, which then they\u2019re probably not going to go out to eat, and if people don\u2019t go out to eat you don\u2019t have restaurants if you don\u2019t have restaurants you lose a lot of jobs.\u201d\n\nRyther would like to see his business grow enough so that he can offer his employees health insurance. But he says he would rather have that be a choice than a government imposed requirement.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership between APRN, NPR and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.alaskapublic.org/2015/01/15/small-businesses-struggle-to-comply-with-health-insurance-requirement/", "site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "type": "article", "description": "Starting this month, businesses in Alaska with more than 100 full time workers have to provide health insurance.
