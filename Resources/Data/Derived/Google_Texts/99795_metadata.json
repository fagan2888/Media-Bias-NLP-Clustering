The trend is likely to continue, Ms. Watts said, as 27% of employers are considering some type of spousal exclusion or surcharge in 2015.\n\nAnother way employers hope to lower costs is promoting healthy living through wellness programs, experts said during the WorldatWork 2014 Total Rewards Conference in Dallas.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\nAccording to Mercer's survey, 35% of employers have already implemented a wellness program and 47% are considering doing so.\n\nThe Home Depot Inc. and Caris Life Sciences Ltd. are among employers that already offer wellness programs \u2014 from health risk assessments, fitness challenges and lifestyle coaching to disease management and smoking-cessation programs, their representatives said during the conference.\n\nHome Depot began offering health risk assessments to employees in 2008, said Lesley Leiserson, the retailer's Atlanta-based director of benefits planning, design and communications. Its wellness initiative has expanded since then to spouses, and includes a tobacco-free incentive of $10 per biweekly paycheck, an annual health challenge, designated wellness champions and screenings for hidden health risks.\n\nMs. Leiserson said Home Depot works with Quest Diagnostics Inc. to screen employees and their spouses for \u201cmetabolic syndrome,\u201d which occurs when an individual has high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high glucose levels and excess body fat around the waist.\n\nPeople who have metabolic syndrome cost $5,732 in medical care each year, whereas those without the syndrome cost $3,581, according to an independent 2009 study, \u201cHealth Care Utilization and Costs by Metabolic Syndrome Risk,\u201d said Wendi Mader, senior manager of product development for Quest.\n\nHome Depot is considering moving to an outcomes-based ap-proach of rewarding employees for being in good health, improving their health over time or completing healthy activities, Ms. Leiserson said. The challenge is that people may not participate if they think they won't get the results they want, she said.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\nCaris also is hesitant to transform its successful wellness program into a results-based model, said Angela Martinez, human resources manager at the Irving, Texas, biosciences company.\n\nSome employees have said, \u201c\"You're trying to track how much weight I gain,'\u201d Ms. Martinez said. They're concerned that unhealthy behavior could increase their health insurance costs. \u201cIt's just like with car insurance. If you have multiple accidents, the rates go up,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the Mercer study, 20% of employers have moved to outcomes-based incentives. But Ms. Watts said it takes at least three years to make the shift. Employers need to ease workers into the idea by offering a health risk assessment and a biometric screening and providing education about outcomes, she said.\n\nSome question wellness programs' return on investment, especially when it takes two to five years to see significant improvement, according to a recent survey by Buck Consultants L.L.C.\n\nHowever, other conference speakers said the real payback is immediate in terms of increased productivity and engagement among workers.\n\n\u201cIt's very hard to make a business case around investing in wellness and health improvement looking at short-term health care costs as the single goal,\u201d said Integrated Benefits Institute President Thomas Parry.\n\nEmployers should pay attention to the broader outcomes of having a health-focused culture, \u201cthings like absence from work, disability, performance at work and ... productivity,\u201d Mr. Parry said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "DALLAS \u2014 To combat rising health care costs and prepare for the 2018 health care reform law excise tax, many employers are changing their health plans and either implementing or experimenting with wellness programs.The 40% excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage scheduled to go...", "title": "Health reform law's excise tax drives employer interest in wellness - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20140525/NEWS03/305259983", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20140525/NEWS03/305259983/AR/0/AR-305259983.jpg", "type": "article"}, "title": "Health reform law's excise tax drives employer interest in wellness - Business Insurance", "description": "DALLAS \u2014 To combat rising health care costs and prepare for the 2018 health care reform law excise tax, many employers are changing their health plans and either implementing or experimenting with wellness programs.The 40% excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage scheduled to go...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1693\"", "article_summary": "DALLAS \u2014 To combat rising health care costs and prepare for the 2018 health care reform law excise tax, many employers are changing their health plans and either implementing or experimenting with wellness programs.\n\u201cIt's very hard to make a business case around investing in wellness and health improvement looking at short-term health care costs as the single goal,\u201d said Integrated Benefits Institute President Thomas Parry.\nBut Ms. Watts said it takes at least three years to make the shift.\nSome employers will attempt to keep costs under the limit by leveraging voluntary benefits, offering high-deductible health plans and limiting eligibility for coverage, Ms. Watts said.\nThe trend is likely to continue, Ms. Watts said, as 27% of employers are considering some type of spousal exclusion or surcharge in 2015."}
