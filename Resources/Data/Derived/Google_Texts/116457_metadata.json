(Photo: Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nWielding a small frozen turkey, Kirsten Monroe, 9, found her mark and took careful aim before stepping out and hurling the icy missile across the floor where it collided with 10 plastic bowling pins.\n\nTurkey Bowling was just one of the competitions at the Gobbler Games, the Clarksville Parks Department\u2019s annual event held Saturday at Clarksville Middle School.\n\nAs some kids worked on their turkey tossing skills, others made their wobbly way across the floor with a balloon clenched between their knees and an egg balanced on a spoon in their hand attempting to earn the fastest time.\n\nFive seasonally-themed competitions were held by age group before the final mass mini-marshmallow relay in which everyone formed two lines and raced to transfer the marshmallows from one end of the line to the other using plastic spoons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun for the kids,\u201d said Amanda Monroe of Jeffersonville. She brought her daughter, Kirsten, and son, Caden, 6, for the first time. \u201cI\u2019d do the turkey bowling. It looks like a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nMore than 50 kids competed in the annual Gobbler Games, all vying for one of the 10 large frozen turkeys awarded as prizes. One bird went to the winner in each age group, from ages 5 through 12, and a random drawing awarded two.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really popular event,\u201d said Ken Conklin, director of marketing and programs for the parks department. \u201cThis is our biggest turnout yet.\u201d\n\nThe turkeys each year are purchased by the Optimist Club of Clarksville, which also provided some volunteers to run the games for the event.\n\nBeverly Knight brought her grandchildren, Nicholas Gaither, 7, Ashwin Sohi, 7, and Zephyr Sohi, 5. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coming to parks department activities all year,\u201d she said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a better program. That people that run it are just fabulous.\u201d\n\nFor more information on upcoming parks department events, including Saturday children\u2019s activities starting in January, visit www.clarksvilleparks.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1HeKVnk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "More than 50 kids competed in the annual Gobbler Games, all vying for a large frozen turkey.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "More than 50 kids competed in the annual Gobbler Games, all vying for a large frozen turkey.", "title": "Clarksville kids compete in Gobbler Games", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/11/21/clarksville-kids-compete-gobbler-games/76072558/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 50 kids competed in the annual Gobbler Games, all vying for a large frozen turkey.", "title": "Clarksville kids compete in Gobbler Games", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2d9af8150c48a53580d3699505cac5b5237c50ed/c=0-134-533-667&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/B9319782509Z.1_20151121142916_000_G0ECKOBQL.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/ROTC", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/ROTC", "title": "Clarksville kids compete in Gobbler Games", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7f817ca4c8c32cec505f78cd11905b148095741/c=0-44-533-755/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/B9319782509Z.1_20151121142916_000_G0ECKOBQL.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4d515b0c8deaed8453000d4a979d42a0b7d875e/c=0-134-533-667/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/B9319782509Z.1_20151121142916_000_G0ECKOBQL.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/238cec65d24aab57b58e38065f14a3694efc17a2/c=0-200-533-600/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/B9319782509Z.1_20151121142916_000_G0ECKOBQL.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f439328f485e11d08c1ce7a3673201aa52191673/c=0-250-533-550&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/B9319782509Z.1_20151121142916_000_G0ECKOBQL.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-21T23:58:29.633000-05:00", "shorthed": "Clarksville kids compete in Gobbler Games", "articleid": 76072558, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cde18d4982d7587d856a4f6a8de8e0a0a5a009e1/c=0-250-533-550/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/B9319782509Z.1_20151121142916_000_G0ECKOBQL.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5f7fe2183cceef19c6568fa65f7b63cbecb05c7e/c=42-0-492-800/local/-/media/2015/11/21/Louisville/B9319782509Z.1_20151121142916_000_G0ECKOBQL.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "clarksville, clarksville parks department, gobbler games, jenna esarey,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe023e\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Miles Conner, 5, passes a miniature marshmallow to Zephyr Sohi, 5, during the annual Clarksville Parks Department Gobbler Games at Clarksville Middle School on Saturday.\nTurkey Bowling was just one of the competitions at the Gobbler Games, the Clarksville Parks Department\u2019s annual event held Saturday at Clarksville Middle School.\nIt looks like a lot of fun.\u201dMore than 50 kids competed in the annual Gobbler Games, all vying for one of the 10 large frozen turkeys awarded as prizes.\nThat people that run it are just fabulous.\u201dFor more information on upcoming parks department events, including Saturday children\u2019s activities starting in January, visit www.clarksvilleparks.com.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really popular event,\u201d said Ken Conklin, director of marketing and programs for the parks department."}
