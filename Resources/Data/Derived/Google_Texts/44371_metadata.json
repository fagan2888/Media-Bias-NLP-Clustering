Dr. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the health-care reform laws in Massachusetts and the American Affordable Care Act. (REUTERS/Dominick Reuter)\n\n4375291\n\nObamacare architect Jonathan Gruber said that lack of transparency was a major part of getting Obamacare passed because \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d would have killed the law if more people knew what was in it.\n\nGruber, the MIT professor who served as a technical consultant to the Obama administration during Obamacare\u2019s design, also made clear during a panel quietly captured on video that the individual mandate, which was only upheld by the Supreme Court because it was a tax, was not actually a tax.\n\n\u201cThis bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay, so it\u2019s written to do that. In terms of risk rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in \u2014 you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed\u2026 Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass\u2026 Look, I wish Mark was right that we could make it all transparent, but I\u2019d rather have this law than not.\u201d\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Obama consultant reveals how the administration used lack of transparency to its advantage", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber said that lack of transparency was a major part of getting Obamacare passed because \"the stupidity of the American voter\" would have killed the law if more people k", "title": "Obamacare Architect: Lack of Transparency Was Key Because \u2018Stupidity Of The American Voter\u2019 Would Have Killed Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/09/obamacare-architect-lack-of-transparency-was-key-because-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-would-have-killed-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gruber.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage'", "title": "Obamacare Architect: Lack of Transparency Was Key Because \u2018Stupidity Of The American Voter\u2019 Would Have Killed Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/09/obamacare-architect-lack-of-transparency-was-key-because-stupidity-of-the-american-voter-would-have-killed-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gruber.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-09 22:30:38", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare Architect: Lack of Transparency Was Key Because 'Stupidity Of The American Voter' Would Have Killed Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "jonathan gruber,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber said that lack of transparency was a major part of getting Obamacare passed because \"the stupidity of the American voter\" would have killed the law if more people k", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gruber.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb611\"", "article_summary": "(REUTERS/Dominick Reuter)4375291Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber said that lack of transparency was a major part of getting Obamacare passed because \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d would have killed the law if more people knew what was in it.\nEconomist Jonathan Gruber speaks at a conference of the Workers Compensation Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, March 12, 2014.\nDr. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the health-care reform laws in Massachusetts and the American Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThis bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.\nIf CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies."}
