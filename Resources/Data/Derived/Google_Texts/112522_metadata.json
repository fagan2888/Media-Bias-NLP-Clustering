Each time I moved, my home got a little bigger, a little grander. In that uniquely American way, it felt like progress.\n\nA growing young family and a rising housing market whisked those moves along in just the way a strong ocean tide can take a soda can miles down shore.\n\nAnd while I still love a big ol\u2019 gallivanting house on an acre or more, it just doesn\u2019t call to me as it used to, especially now that the kids are off to college and my full-time job means I\u2019m home a lot less.\n\nSo lately \u2014 while I\u2019m between permanent homes, serving as a foster parent for homes seeking permanent owners \u2014 I\u2019ve been thinking about what sort of place does call to me.\n\nThe best part about thinking is, it\u2019s free.\n\nBesides, I can\u2019t buy a new home until my home on an acre in Colorado is sold, a plan for next year. That\u2019s called market protection. It protects me from myself.\n\nMeanwhile, my housing fantasies know no bounds: city or country? Modern or vintage? House or townhome? No yard, big yard, room for a barn?\n\nMost days, I envision an intimate home, but not a broom closet. I want an easy keeper, with enough usable canvas for me to imprint my soul in three dimensions. I want a place where my growing-up girls, guests and the dog I plan to have can live in comfort and style. I want to be close to some city life, but not so close that I can\u2019t see the stars. I want gracious but not grand, lovely but not lavish, pretty, not pretentious.\n\nAnd this for sure: I want to \u201cdownsize up.\u201d\n\nAs I mull all this, I\u2019m taking notes and watching how those a few giant steps ahead of me are doing just that.\n\nLori Brown, a talent-acquisition executive in Chicago, is saying good-bye to her 4,000-square-foot home in a lovely suburb to move with her husband to something smaller, but in many ways better. This month the Browns \u2014 she is 55, he is 70 \u2014 will move from their single-family home of 12 years to a luxury condo in a high-rise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to leave,\u201d said Lori. \u201cWe have a lot of great memories there, but it seems like it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nLeaving got a whole lot easier when they found their new place. The full-service lake-front condo is about 25 percent smaller, with no yard duties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d said Brown. \u201cBefore, when I thought of people downsizing, I\u2019d think they were compromising, but that\u2019s not it at all. We have so many new places to explore. There\u2019s nothing sad about it. We\u2019re making an upgrade.\u201d\n\nThe new place, which overlooks Lake Michigan, is a quick walk to restaurants, shops and public transportation. \u201cThat will make life easier. We\u2019ll walk more and get out more.\u201d\n\nLike the Browns, Lizanne Bomhard and her husband, who live outside Orlando, are also plotting a move to a smaller place to live larger.\n\nThe Bomhards have downsized a few times since they married 20 years ago, mostly so they could be closer to family. Now, at ages 65 and 69, they are looking to move from their 1,600-square-foot cottage on five acres to \u201ca new house closer to town and the grandkids with sidewalks and neighbors,\u201d she wrote me in an e-mail.\n\nEach time they downsized, she said, \u201cWe celebrated more freedom from taking care of unnecessary space and stuff.\u201d\n\nSounds like right-sizing to me.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).

They definitely wanted an urban lifestyle, with an easy walk to the action. A big eating area was also a must. \u201cWhen our family gets together for Sunday dinner, there are 14 of us,\u201d said Lori Brown. \u201cOn holidays there can be up to 22.\u201d She wanted enough room to gather, eat, watch football, and have the grandkids sleepover.\n\n\u201cWill sacrifice.\u201d Though Brown wanted an outdoor space where she could put couches and a fire pit, \u201cthat\u2019s not what we bought,\u201d she said. However, the condo complex has a pool, which wasn\u2019t on their wish list. Their seven grandchildren, ages to 4-18, are excited about that. \u201cThey will be here every weekend. Now watch our grocery bills soar,\u201d she jokes.\n\nBottom-line gains. Among these for the Browns: Lower overhead. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for ways to cut our overhead, and find better ways to spend our money and time, so we can do more traveling,\u201d she said. After the move, their house-related expenses will go down by half, she estimates. Property taxes alone will be one-fourth what they were for their former home.\n\nOne level. The house the Browns are leaving is three stories. The new condo is on one level. \u201cWe are getting older,\u201d she said. \u201cThis seemed like a good time to plan for that.\u201d\n\nLess driving. For her work downtown, Brown spends close to $4,000 a year on parking. Now she can easily take public transportation.\n\nMore convenience. Because their current home is just outside the city, \u201conce we\u2019re home, we\u2019re home. We don\u2019t go out. That will change,\u201d she said.\n\nA view. Brown likes that her new place is on the third floor with lots of windows, so she can see the treetops as well as Lake Michigan.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cDownsizing up:\u201d More homeowners looking for less space, more meaning", "title": "\u201cDownsizing up:\u201d More homeowners looking for less space, more meaning", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/13/downsizing-up-more-homeowners-looking-for-less-space-more-meaning/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131213__20131214_C3_FE14AHMARNIp2.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131213__20131214_C3_FE14AHMARNIp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-14T03:36:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:48:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWill sacrifice.\u201d Though Brown wanted an outdoor space where she could put couches and a fire pit, \u201cthat\u2019s not what we bought,\u201d she said.\nNo yard, big yard, room for a barn?\nEach time they downsized, she said, \u201cWe celebrated more freedom from taking care of unnecessary space and stuff.\u201dSounds like right-sizing to me.\nWe\u2019re making an upgrade.\u201dThe new place, which overlooks Lake Michigan, is a quick walk to restaurants, shops and public transportation.\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press)."}
