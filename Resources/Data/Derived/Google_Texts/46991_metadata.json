The long-postponed trial is expected to begin next month, once again focusing national media attention on Colorado.\n\nIn advance of the biggest criminal trial here since the Timothy McVeigh Oklahoma City bombing trial in 1997 and the Kobe Bryant sexual assault case in 2004, newsrooms are confronting logistical challenges.\n\nNews consumers should prepare, too: the trial will be live-streamed.\n\nLive streaming from inside the courtroom, not a factor in those earlier trials, will mean constant access, constant updates.\n\nLive tweeting won\u2019t be allowed inside the courtroom, but anyone monitoring the live feed (back in the newsroom, for instance) will be free to use social media. Observers won\u2019t be allowed to bring phones or laptops into the courtroom.\n\nBecause of the number and randomness of the deaths in the theater massacre and the intense national interest, the case is expected to draw even more saturation coverage than those previous trials.\n\nExpect a flood of retraumatizing graphic images.\n\nUnlike major trials before, a fixed camera in the courtroom will offer an unblinking eye on the proceedings, although not as emotionally charged a vision as might have been provided, under a rejected request by an alliance of local media. There will be no zooming in on anguished faces, no shots of the jury, no panning to the action.\n\nA few technical challenges:\n\nThe rules are different for TV versus digital coverage.\n\nReporters who have seen the setup say the position of the fixed camera in the courtroom won\u2019t provide an unobstructed view of the defendant, James Holmes.\n\nNews outlets have already secured seats inside the courtroom for primary reporters and spaces for trailers with technical and support staff outside.\n\nLocal TV station staffs have been holding meetings for months to address the upcoming coverage.\n\nCarl Bilek of KMGH-Channel 7 said the logistics are still being confirmed but, \u201cwe will have one guaranteed seat in the courtroom itself with access to an additional overflow room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can directly compare the trial of James Holmes to the trial of Timothy McVeigh,\u201d he said by e-mail. \u201cRegardless, the challenges of covering the trial are completely different. We live in an age of immediacy in which our viewers get their news on many different platforms, not just television. This is truly \u201creal time\u201d news.\u201d\n\nTo that end, national networks, local stations and online competitors including The Denver Post are committed to providing constant updates on the Aurora theater shooting trial, across platforms.\n\n\u201cThis means having the staff in place to monitor all testimony and to update key elements as they happen (on the Internet and social media rather than waiting for scheduled newscasts),\u201d Bilek said.\n\nLocal stations are planning to live-stream the trial, and to interrupt regular programming on broadcast TV should the situation warrant.\n\nThe single static camera provided by the court won\u2019t offer cutaways of the defendant or closeups of the evidence. \u201cThat makes it doubly important that our reporter in the courtroom be able to provide context to what the camera doesn\u2019t show, such as the defendant\u2019s reaction to testimony,\u201d Bilek said.\n\nHolly Gauntt, recently installed VP for news at KDVR-KWGN, acknowledged the trial will spark \u201ca great deal of interest and coverage from media outlets across the nation and the world. I believe it\u2019s our responsibility as local journalists to be respectful of the impact our coverage will have on the families and survivors. Sadly, I highly suspect we will see some over the top, sensationalized coverage by media outlets outside of our community. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nWhile her stations will live-steam courtroom coverage on the web, \u201cour goal will be to cover every aspect of the trial professionally and thoroughly while keeping in mind that many watching our coverage were traumatized by the events of that horrible day. As a whole, I believe the Denver media takes the high road and will again with this big story.\u201d\n\nEach station has legal experts on retainer, to be debriefed at the courthouse or on the set as anchors solicit reactions. CBS4 has longtime prosecutor Karen Steinhauser on hand; 9News will rely on Scott Robinson. 7News has retained Dan Recht, David Beller, and Rick Kornfeld of Recht and Kornfeld. Fox31 will use criminal defense attorney Chris Decker.\n\nThe networks plan to have on-air talent and staff present. CNN will have \u201ca team there that will report across all of our networks and platforms,\u201d according to a spokeswoman. CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera, based in Denver, will be the network\u2019s lead correspondent. CBS will rely on correspondent Barry Peterson. ABC has yet to finalize plans.\n\nOn its website, CNN asked rhetorically whether the Holmes trial will garner more attention than the trials of Jodi Arias or the Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev simply because it\u2019s going to be televised? Just posing the question seems to answer it.\n\nThe electronic media\u2019s request for a camera in the courtroom (operated remotely) was granted while the print media\u2019s request for a still camera in the courtroom (operated by a photographer present in the room) was denied.\n\nThe camera is mounted to a pillar in the courtroom, angled toward the judge\u2019s bench, the witness stand, the prosecution table and the defense table. It doe not have a view of the jury box. Holmes will be seated at the defense table, the farther of the two tables from the camera, and specifically on the far corner of that table, so his attorneys sitting next to him often partially block the camera\u2019s view of him.\n\nThat rules out a Jodi Arias-type frequent, extended closeups of the defendant.\n\nBesides the single fixed camera, no other video recording will be allowed in the courtroom, and no still photography. \u201cWhite noise\u201d will cover any bench conferences.\n\nThe court order acknowledged it\u2019s not what the media requested but said it will have to do: \u201cAny desire to make the broadcast more interesting or entertaining, while understandable, is not relevant to the Court\u2019s determination.\u201d\n\nColorado has traditionally recognized public access to criminal trials as healthy. In fact, Colorado became the first state to allow cameras in the courtroom in 1956 and remains one of the more open states in terms of expanded media coverage in courts.\n\nModern media technology presents new challenges. Might glimpses of the trial turn up as memes on Twitter, pollute the nation\u2019s Facebook timelines or otherwise become fodder for social media entertainment, as opponents of expanded media coverage claimed? Perhaps. But the court found no reason that should limit the public\u2019s right to see the judicial system in action.\n\nHashtags are a reality of the modern era but they pose no threat to the proceedings inside the courtroom, the ruling said. The intense and widespread publicity of this trial, the large number of victims and the expected length of the trial make expanded media coverage less likely to have an adverse effect than traditional media coverage, the judge concluded.\n\nViewers will be the judge of that.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "National media prepare to cover the Aurora theater shooting trial in Colorado", "title": "National media prepare to cover the Aurora theater shooting trial in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/13/national-media-prepare-to-cover-the-aurora-theater-shooting-trial-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314_015949_James-Holmes-Trial-File-Art-4.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314_015949_James-Holmes-Trial-File-Art-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-13T21:08:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T02:03:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Aurora Theater Shooting trial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd126\"", "article_summary": "The intense and widespread publicity of this trial, the large number of victims and the expected length of the trial make expanded media coverage less likely to have an adverse effect than traditional media coverage, the judge concluded.\nSadly, I highly suspect we will see some over the top, sensationalized coverage by media outlets outside of our community.\nNews outlets nationally and locally are preparing to cover the James Holmes theater shooting trial, now on a hastened schedule.\nThe long-postponed trial is expected to begin next month, once again focusing national media attention on Colorado.\nMight glimpses of the trial turn up as memes on Twitter, pollute the nation\u2019s Facebook timelines or otherwise become fodder for social media entertainment, as opponents of expanded media coverage claimed?"}
