Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio returned to the scene of the Staten Island Zoo Monday, where he watched a groundhog from afar a year after dropping the ceremonial rodent, which later died.\n\nThis year the groundhog, known as Staten Island Chuck, predicted an early spring from behind the safety of a new plexiglass enclosure, a new arrangement that ended years of tradition, but that the mayor said was for the best.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a popemobile!\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, referring to the enclosure. \u201cThis new approach will be safer for both species involved.\u201d\n\nIn a brief ceremony Monday morning, the mayor, zoo officials and a large group of excited children looked on as the groundhog emerged from its miniature home and zoo officials declared that the rodent hadn\u2019t seen his shadow, meaning the city is in for an early spring. In a bit of stagecraft, the rodent appeared on a moving platform that rose as an orchestra sometimes does in a musical.\n\nAt no point did the mayor, or any other city officials, handle the groundhog, a change Staten Island Zoo Executive Director Ken Mitchell said would make for \u201ca progressive, new and exciting Groundhog Day.\u201d\n\nIt was a year ago that another groundhog known as Staten Island Chuck was not so lucky. Mr. de Blasio dropped that groundhog, which sailed to the ground beneath the mayor\u2019s feet in front of dozens of shocked school children and later died.\n\nZoo officials didn\u2019t make the death public for more than six months. When they did, the officials said the groundhog died of internal injuries consistent with a fall, but blamed a second tumble they said took place after the mayor\u2019s fumble.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the mishap, Deputy Staten Island Borough President Ed Burke tried to keep the mood light.\n\n\u201c2015 is not a leap year!\u201d Mr. Burke said to groans and giggles.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture issued the Staten Island Zoo a notice in November warning that it had violated the Animal Welfare Act with last year\u2019s ceremony. USDA officials cited the use of an \u201cuntrained handler\u201d to cradle the groundhog.\n\nPeople take photos of Staten Island Chuck during The Staten Island Zoo\u2019s annual Groundhog Day ceremony in Staten Island, NY on Monday. Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMany in attendance at this year\u2019s event said the last year\u2019s mishap was still on their minds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d said Peter Schultheis, 58, who wore a groundhog-themed hat he said he bought in Punxsutawney, Pa., home of another famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil.\n\nMr. Schultheis, of the St. George area of Staten Island, said he was happy Mr. de Blasio was hands-off this year.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even vote for him,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio returned to the scene of the Staten Island Zoo Monday, where he watched a groundhog from afar a year after dropping the ceremonial rodent, which later died.", "title": "Staten Island Chuck Predicts Early Spring and Lives to Tell the Tale", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/02/02/staten-island-chuck-predicts-early-spring-and-lives-to-tell-the-tale/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GT232_NYGROU_P_20150202101009.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Staten Island Chuck Predicts Early Spring and Lives to Tell the Tale", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio returned to the scene of the Staten Island Zoo Monday, where he watched a groundhog from afar a year after dropping the ceremonial rodent, which later died.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Mara Gay", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio returned to the scene of the Staten Island Zoo Monday, where he watched a groundhog from afar a year after dropping the ceremonial rodent, which later died.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-02-02T15:18:25-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/02/02/staten-island-chuck-predicts-early-spring-and-lives-to-tell-the-tale/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22478", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio returned to the scene of the Staten Island Zoo Monday, where he watched a groundhog from afar a year after dropping the ceremonial rodent, which later died.", "title": "Staten Island Chuck Predicts Early Spring and Lives to Tell the Tale", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/02/02/staten-island-chuck-predicts-early-spring-and-lives-to-tell-the-tale/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GT232_NYGROU_P_20150202101009.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22478", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-02-02T18:50:59-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf42b\"", "article_summary": "People take photos of Staten Island Chuck during The Staten Island Zoo\u2019s annual Groundhog Day ceremony in Staten Island, NY on Monday.\nMayor Bill de Blasio holds a proclamation reading \u201cSpring is Coming\u201d after Staten Island Chuck emerges during The Staten Island Zoo\u2019s annual Groundhog Day ceremony in Staten Island, NY on Monday.\nOn the first anniversary of the mishap, Deputy Staten Island Borough President Ed Burke tried to keep the mood light.\nMr. Schultheis, of the St. George area of Staten Island, said he was happy Mr. de Blasio was hands-off this year.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture issued the Staten Island Zoo a notice in November warning that it had violated the Animal Welfare Act with last year\u2019s ceremony."}
