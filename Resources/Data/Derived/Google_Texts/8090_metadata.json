Carlos Gonzalez might be next. Maybe even just-acquired Jose Reyes.\n\nThe Colorado Rockies are overhauling their roster in the midst of another dreadful summer, and this time nobody is off-limits.\n\nFor years, Tulowitzki was considered untouchable, especially in the eyes of owner Dick Monfort. That changed when the Rockies sent the face of their franchise along with 42-year-old reliever LaTroy Hawkins to the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday for Reyes and three pitching prospects.\n\nReyes is scheduled to join the team Wednesday, but even he may be available to the right bidder, Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich acknowledged.\n\n\u201cOur eyes and ears are open. We\u2019re open-minded. It\u2019s how we are operating,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we have some huge elaborate plan to sell the farm and completely start from scratch.\u201d\n\nBefore the 2011 season, Colorado signed Tulowitzki to a deal that added $132 over seven seasons through 2020. Combined with his previous contract, it meant the Rockies agreed to pay Tulowitzki $157.75 million over 10 years.\n\nThe concept was to build around him and Gonzalez, who signed an $80 million, seven-year contract about the same time.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work.\n\nColorado has a 319-426 record since 2011, and a good portion of that time, the sluggers weren\u2019t in the lineup together because of injuries.\n\n\u201cRebuild \u2026 it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a word we use around here,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cA rebuild connotes that we\u2019re going to go and sell off what we have, whatever assets we have at the major league level. That\u2019s not part of our process. It\u2019s more nuanced than that.\u201d\n\nFor now, the notion is to keep the 32-year-old Reyes, a four-time All-Star who\u2019s signed through 2017 on a $106 million, six-year contract he received from Miami that includes a $4 million buyout in \u201818.\n\nThat could change.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to have him be part of the team,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cBut I guess anything is possible, certainly.\u201d\n\nAs for Gonzalez, interest is increasing for the Gold Glove outfielder, especially after his recent power surge. Gonzalez has six homers in his last four games. His average has climbed all the way up to .278 as he finds his groove. He missed significant time last season after undergoing surgery to remove a tumor from his left index finger and then another operation to repair a tear in his left knee.\n\n\u201cCarlos, save for the last three weeks of the season, it\u2019s been somewhat of a rocky road. It\u2019s been some good, some bad up to this point of the season,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like people have been banging down the door early and often on him leading up to this deadline. His improved play over the last couple of weeks has changed that a little bit.\u201d\n\nGonzalez is trying to keep his attention on the field amid speculation.\n\n\u201cMy No. 1 motivation is to play good for this team and whatever happens in the future is up to them - it\u2019s not up to me,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIf I\u2019m playing for the Rockies, I\u2019m going to play as hard as I can.\u201d\n\nBridich was surprised at how fast negotiations heated up for Tulowitzki on Monday, going from \u201czero to 60 in a matter of minutes\u201d and leading the Rockies to pull Tulowitzki out of their game against the Chicago Cubs in the ninth.\n\nTulowitzki spent his entire 10-year career with the Rockies but has been the subject of trade talk for some time - at least when he was in the lineup. Staying healthy has been his biggest challenge. During his career, he\u2019s had stints on the disabled list for a quadriceps tendon tear, lacerated right hand, broken left wrist and a groin injury.\n\nLast season, Tulowitzki played in 91 games before undergoing hip surgery. This year, he\u2019s been injury free, with manager Walt Weiss resting him on occasion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on us the type of impact and type of effect Troy\u2019s had on this organization,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet.\u201d\n\nNot for teams within the division.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely nice to get him out of the NL West,\u201d Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford said.\n\nThe Rockies also get right-handers Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro and Jesus Tinoco.\n\nHoffman was a first-round pick in 2014 who\u2019s coming off elbow surgery. He\u2019ll report to Double-A New Britain. Castro will pitch out of the bullpen at Triple-A Albuquerque and Tinoco will likely start at Single-A Asheville.\n\nDown the road, Bridich can envision a rotation that includes Jon Gray, the third overall pick in 2013, Eddie Butler (No. 46 in 2012), Kyle Freeland (No. 8 in 2014) and Hoffman.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley and sports writers Ronald Blum and Arnie Stapleton contributed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Troy Tulowitzki is gone.
