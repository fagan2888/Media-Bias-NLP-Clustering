She said could never cover the cost of her treatments herself.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a great plan,\u201d Lamphere said.\n\nShe offered that assessment before she heard the details of the health care plans for administrative assistants at the Hartford School District, where workers pay less toward their premiums and significantly less out-of-pocket.\n\nThat two groups of publicly funded workers \u2014 who do similar work for similar pay \u2014 have such different health care plans was a surprise to Lamphere.\n\n\u201cI would have thought it would be comparable,\u201d she said.\n\nHartford hardly is unique in that regard \u2014 across Vermont, even as school officials argue that they can\u2019t meet state targets for limiting spending increases because of increasing health care costs, school districts continue to offer more generous plans than their municipal counterparts.\n\nCritical Care\n\nNearly all Vermont\u2019s public schools pool their purchasing power through the Vermont Education Health Initiative, a nonprofit that announced in September that health care costs would go up almost 8 percent for the 2016-17 school year. Also in that year, school districts may, for the first time, face significant financial penalties if their spending exceeds targets set by Act 46, a major legislative reform bill passed last year to control per-pupil spending. The amount of increase allowed varies by school, but the average is 2 percent, and many schools are held to increases of less than that.\n\nBrad James, education finance director at the Vermont Agency of Education, said the most common complaint from school boards about Act 46 has been having to simultaneously deal with spending caps and increasing health care costs.\n\nAt Rivendell Interstate School District, for example, the $80,000 in growth allowed under the law is entirely wiped out by the insurance increase, School Board member David Ricker said.\n\nDavid Baker, superintendent of the Windsor Southeast Supervisory Union, said the Legislature was caught off guard by the increase.\n\n\u201cWhat else has gone up by over 8 percent this year?\u201d he said.\n\nThe backlash led many, including Gov. Peter Shumlin, to call for the Legislature to back down on the spending thresholds, at least temporarily. Lawmakers in the House and Senate are considering two proposals \u2014 one to ease the caps, and one to abolish them.\n\nDramatic Difference\n\nIn Hartford, school and town employees are both covered under Blue Cross Blue Shield, but the fiscal year 2017 plans are starkly different.\n\nFor education support staff workers who put their families on the dual option plan (the most common plan used in the district), the school district pays for 94 percent of a $23,800 premium.\n\nBy contrast, for town employees on the family plan, the town pays 85 percent of a smaller $13,800 premium.\n\nThe difference in premiums can be seen across the board for the various school and town plans, though the percentage shouldered by the school varies from as low as 75 percent for some workers, to as much as 100 percent for others.\n\nAlong with the higher, taxpayer-supported premiums, school workers also have much lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nLamphere and her town co-workers have a $6,550 deductible, though the town covers much of that with a health reimbursement arrangement. In the school district, the most popular plan, the Vermont Health Partnership, has no deductible.\n\nMace said her association funded a study last year that found that moving all Vermont\u2019s school employees to the state exchange \u2014 where Hartford municipal workers now find themselves \u2014 would save what she called \u201creal money,\u201d $38.8 million.\n\nThe high-premium health care plans enjoyed by school employees across the state are an artifact of a time when premiums as a whole were much less expensive, she said.\n\n\u201cAt the time that the benefits were bargained, health care was pretty cheap,\u201d Mace said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Yeah sure, we\u2019ll add this benefit.\u2019 But the cost has grown exponentially and yet the benefit has been maintained.\u201d\n\nMace said the gap should be narrowed.\n\n\u201cWe need to make progress in aligning school employee health plans with what\u2019s available to the rest of Vermonters,\u201d she said.\n\nMark Hage, director of benefit programs for the Vermont Education Health Initiative, agreed that the generous benefits are a holdover from a different time.\n\nBut the benefits help to offset wages that are, Hage said, beneath the market value for skilled, degreed education workers.\n\n\u201cI have no qualms saying I think my members deserve the plans they have,\u201d Hage said. \u201cA lot of my members, they have sacrificed salary gains in order to hold onto what they felt were fair and comprehensive health care benefits. Oftentimes, we would say, we will take less in money in order to hold onto the health care benefit.\u201d\n\nChanges in Motion\n\nIn Hartford, health care costs have also moved in dramatically different directions in recent years \u2014 costs have gone down for the town, and up for the school.\n\nThe school district\u2019s total price tag for premiums \u2014 a projected $3.4 million in the 2016-17 school year \u2014 is up by more than $400,000 from the 2014-15 fiscal year, when health insurance cost about $3 million. The costs have also increased as a percentage of the total school budget, from 11.5 percent in fiscal 2015 to 12.1 percent in fiscal 2017.\n\nThe town is not as employee-heavy an organization as the school, and so the percentages of the budget spent on health care premiums are understandably smaller.\n\nBut they also improved significantly between 2015 and 2016, when costs dropped from $1.1 million, or 7.6 percent of the fiscal year 2015 budget, to $741,000, or 4.7 percent of the fiscal year 2016 budget.\n\nThose percentages don\u2019t include the roughly $380,000 the town of Hartford is budgeting to reimburse municipal workers for much of their deductibles and to subsidize employees who opt to obtain their health coverage elsewhere.\n\nThe town\u2019s costs for premiums came down this year because Hartford joined the state health exchange created under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nMeanwhile, schools have continued to stay off the exchange, at least for now.\n\nMace said non-union employers, including many towns, were able to react to rising health care costs by cutting back on benefits, but that such reductions have been staunchly opposed by teachers unions.\n\n\u201cThe union has been unwilling to move to the exchange, because plans on the exchange have a higher out-of-pocket cost,\u201d she said.\n\nHage said such sentiments have only begun to emerge as spiraling health care costs have brought tension to the bargaining table for teacher unions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a school employee benefit problem. We have got an affordability crisis in health care,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of our inability to guarantee that every citizen has access to health care plans, you end up fighting each other and having these debates that \u2018your health care plan should be like mine.\u2019 \u201d\n\nStatewide, Mace said, school districts pay for an average of 86 percent of the premium costs of their employees\u2019 health plans.\n\n\u201cThey were trying to get it to more of an 80-20 split,\u201d Mace said. But, she said, because the Affordable Care Act guarantees that people can maintain their existing coverage, \u201cthey\u2019ve been locked in at that 86 percent for the last six or seven years now.\u201d\n\nChange was also delayed in Vermont, Mace said, because VEHI and other providers waited to see what might happen with Shumlin\u2019s drive for a single-payer health plan, which ultimately failed.\n\nHage said that the 36,000 school employees in the system have done well under VEHI since first pooling their purchasing power in 1993, with an average rate increase of about 4.5 percent. He said the plans for educators have changed with the times.\n\n\u201cThe plans are not the same as they were in 1980,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see higher premiums, but also higher out-of-pocket costs.\u201d\n\nHage also said that, in the context of an ongoing shifting landscape, the plans are about to be replaced by a new generation of offerings.\n\n\u201cThose plans are closing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nThe reason for the increases, Hage said, can be tracked back to providers. The projected 7.8 percent increase in education health care premiums was driven by a dramatic increase in pharmaceuticals, with specialty drug costs going up by 22 percent.\n\nOne option open to school districts is to simply leave VEHI and enter the state exchange, but they would need to negotiate those switches with their worker unions. Hage says that\u2019s not happening.\n\n\u201cVirtually all public schools are still in VEHI,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had one public school leave to go to the exchange.\u201d\n\nOne of the appeals of VEHI has been relative stability in the rates, protecting schools from the kind of swings that prompted the town of Hartford to enter the state exchange, School Board Chairwoman Lori Dickerson said in an email on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe town plan had some extraordinary premium increases and has had to change carriers due to those cost increases,\u201d she said, referring to 2013 and 2014, years when Hartford\u2019s health insurance rates, purchased through the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, went up by more than 50 percent.\n\nThe Future Of Health Care\n\nWhen it comes to health care, different stakeholders agree on the problem \u2014 spiraling costs \u2014 even as they have different ideas about the solution to that problem.\n\nState Rep. Sarah Buxton, D-Tunbridge, who sits on the House Committee on Education, said she would like to bring the state\u2019s school employees into a single health care plan.\n\n\u201cI think this really comes down to a value judgment,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t want to propose that our teachers be valued less than they are, because they do so much in this new education world that they deserve generous compensation.\u201d\n\nHowever, she said, \u201cI think we need to have some equity that recognizes the risks we run with unpredictable health care costs.\u201d\n\nBuxton said she would seek to amend the laws so that stakeholders would be required to \u201cmake some proposals about how we specifically begin to get a handle on health care spending in the education world.\u201d\n\nHage said VEHI is planning big changes to be more competitive with the exchange.\n\n\u201cVEHI is undergoing a transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a whole new slate of plans coming on January 1, 2018. They\u2019ll have higher out-of-pocket costs. They\u2019ll have lower premiums.\u201d\n\nThe group, Hage said, \u201cis moving now in a direction that reflects the realities of the post-Affordable Care Act world.\u201d\n\nDickerson said it could be time for the town and the school to work together to possibly narrow the gap between the two spheres of the public sector.\n\n\u201cOur negotiations with our bargaining units have never been in concert with the town and their bargaining, but I\u2019m not saying that there might not be some benefit to starting conversations with them,\u201d she said.\n\nDickerson referenced her own efforts to establish a regional bargaining council that would help school districts in the state to pool their knowledge about negotiations with teacher unions on wages and benefits, including health insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cI am a proponent of starting conversations with other school districts on collective bargaining and I would see value in the municipal-school conversation as well,\u201d Dickerson said.\n\nUltimately, Hage said, as long as health care costs continue to be unreasonable, the types of coverage that individuals get will continue to be held up to scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI hope that, as a society, we\u2019re going to address those bigger structural issues,\u201d he said.\n\nMatt Hongoltz-Hetling can be reached at [email protected] or 603-727-3211.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "public schools, vermont health connect, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "A study last year found that moving all Vermont\u2019s school employees to the state exchange would save $38.8 million.", "title": "Valley News: Big differences in Vermont town, school insurance plans | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Students-computers-education-technology-Union-Elementary-.jpg", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2016/01/24/valley-news-big-differences-in-vermont-town-school-insurance-plans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A study last year found that moving all Vermont\u2019s school employees to the state exchange would save $38.8 million.", "creator": "@vtdigger", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Students-computers-education-technology-Union-Elementary-.jpg?fit=1024%2C720", "title": "Valley News: Big differences in Vermont town, school insurance plans | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "public schools, Vermont Health Connect, health insurance", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont Health Connect", "published_time": "2016-01-24T06:27:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That two groups of publicly funded workers \u2014 who do similar work for similar pay \u2014 have such different health care plans was a surprise to Lamphere.\n\u201cWe need to make progress in aligning school employee health plans with what\u2019s available to the rest of Vermonters,\u201d she said.\nDramatic DifferenceIn Hartford, school and town employees are both covered under Blue Cross Blue Shield, but the fiscal year 2017 plans are starkly different.\nHage said such sentiments have only begun to emerge as spiraling health care costs have brought tension to the bargaining table for teacher unions.\nMark Hage, director of benefit programs for the Vermont Education Health Initiative, agreed that the generous benefits are a holdover from a different time."}
