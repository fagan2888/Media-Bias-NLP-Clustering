Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) and Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA) jointly proposed the measure, which is likely to find substantial support in the House, where members have already voted in favor of providing military assistance to the government in Kiev.\n\nAlthough he may hesitate to arm Ukraine, Obama is unequivocal about giving any credence to Moscow\u2019s claims that it is not involved in the Ukrainian conflict. In remarks Monday, he said that Russian troops and arms are already in Ukraine and continue to flow there. \u201cThese are the facts,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Obama \u2013 If Putin Really Wanted Ukraine, He Could Take It\n\nIn negotiations that dragged into early Wednesday morning European time, representatives of Russia, Ukraine, the separatists and European powers struggled to come to terms on a ceasefire that would allow Wednesday\u2019s planned discussion to take place without ongoing bloodshed. Despite multiple reports to the contrary, at well past midnight in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, where the negotiations are taking place, officials said no deal had been reached.\n\nThe possibility that the U.S. might provide arms to the Ukrainian army has prompted promises of retaliation from the Russian government. Russian media have, in the past 24 hours, been reporting increasingly aggressive responses from the Kremlin to the possibility that the U.S might give Ukraine military support.\n\nRelated: Putin Won\u2019t Commit to Peace Talks on Ukraine\n\nOn Monday, an anonymous member of the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s advisory board promised \u201casymmetric\u201d responses against U.S interests worldwide.\n\nBy Tuesday, Russian officials were no longer demanding anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe Americans are trying to draw the Russian Federation into an interstate military conflict, to achieve regime change through the events in Ukraine and to ultimately dismember our country,\u201d said Nikolai Patrushev, who heads the Kremlin\u2019s security council.\n\nWednesday\u2019s talks in Minsk look increasingly like the last chance to avoid all-out war in Europe for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday personally warned Russian President Vladimir Putin about the danger of further Russian aggression in Ukraine.
