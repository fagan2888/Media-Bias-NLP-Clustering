At his regular Capitol briefing Thursday, he complained about his enrollment experience publicly for the first time, telling reporters he actually considered skipping the exchanges, paying a penalty and holding out for Medicare when he turns 65 next year. The buggy D.C. exchange website and premium increase were so frustrating that he almost decided to go without insurance. It turns out one of the few things Republicans like less than Obamacare is being uninsured themselves.\n\nAnyhow, last week the whining reached pandemic proportions. The symptoms of this bug include tweeting about website glitches, complaining about prices without actually disclosing prior premiums, and \u2014 oh, right \u2014 being a Republican.\n\n\u201cI want to talk about my personal experience with the D.C. exchange,\u201d groused Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, on the House floor Friday. \u201cThe president said you can keep your health care plan. That your premiums will go down. Mr. Speaker, I lost my health care plan. I have five kids. My premiums have gone up significantly. And I don\u2019t know if I can keep all the same doctors that I have to treat my kids.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with McCaul\u2019s initial complaint: that he can\u2019t keep his existing coverage. Like millions of other Americans, his plan is being canceled because of Obamacare. But unlike every other person in the country who\u2019s received a cancelation letter, McCaul and other members and aides are receiving them because of a GOP-authored amendment to the health care law prohibiting them from remaining in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. He should take this up with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much McCaul paid for his old FEHB plan. But I do know that the D.C. market generally offers pretty decent deals, even for 51-year-olds like McCaul. As a general rule, young aides will have a better experience than old members because on the D.C. exchange they will be subject to a 3:1 age band \u2014 insurers can charge older beneficiaries up to three times as much as younger beneficiaries for the same plan. FEHBP isn\u2019t age rated at all. Everyone pays the same premiums for the same plan no matter how old or young. So Obamacare\u2019s a better deal for McCaul\u2019s staff, who will no longer be over-subsidizing their boss, than it is for McCaul himself.\n\nThe fact that McCaul is the second richest member of Congress, worth over $100 million, should help him finance the difference.\n\nMost Hill operatives probably aren\u2019t as rich as McCaul, but they\u2019re coming down with the bug too.\n\nAmanda Carpenter \u2014 Ted Cruz\u2019 speechwriter and senior communications adviser \u2014 has been tweeting about her woes, including website problems and supposedly higher premiums, for days.\n\nMy premiums are more than a hundred dollars more a month and the coverage is much crappier. \u2014 Amanda Carpenter (@amandacarpenter) December 3, 2013\n\nAt the start of her adventure she claimed she was enduring Obamacare \u201cas required by law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's good Obamacare is launching, because Republicans urgently need treatment.
