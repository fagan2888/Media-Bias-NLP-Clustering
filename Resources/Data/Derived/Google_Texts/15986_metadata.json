Medica proposed a 16.5% and Time Insurance proposed a 22%.\n\nValley News Live wanted to know if the increase on individual plans would translate to higher cost if you purchase insurance through an employer?\n\n\"Employer sponsored coverage will have a wide varying degree of increase and decreases based somewhat on your utilizations and then on overall trends and other impacts to those plans,\" explained Stueland.\n\nStueland says your rates really depend how much of your plan is used in your company. It can vary for each company.\n\nNorth Dakota is not the only state seeing premium hikes. On Thursday we reported if you live in Minnesota, eight health plans are looking to increase their rates. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota requested a 54% increase.\n\nEach state approves how much the rates may increase and that is announced in October if you live in Minnesota and November if you live in North Dakota.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Some Blue Cross Blue Shield customers in North Dakota and Minnesota may soon see significant rate increases on their premiums.", "language": "english", "author": "Ashley Bishop", "og": {"description": "Some Blue Cross Blue Shield customers in North Dakota and Minnesota may soon see significant rate increases on their premiums.", "title": "BCBS ND Proposes 18% Rate Increase For Individual Health Plans", "url": "http://www.valleynewslive.com/home/headlines/BCBS-ND-Proposes-18-Rate-Increase-For-Individual-Health-Plans--306339621.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E9F/0CB/E9F0CB1DDBC54793B0868D4BA5488C9F", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BD0/4D9/BD04D976591140A58330084274A2C071.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.valleynewslive.com", "description": "Some Blue Cross Blue Shield customers in North Dakota and Minnesota may soon see significant rate increases on their premiums.", "creator": "@valleynewslive", "url": "http://www.valleynewslive.com/home/headlines/BCBS-ND-Proposes-18-Rate-Increase-For-Individual-Health-Plans--306339621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/health+insurance22.jpg", "title": "BCBS ND Proposes 18% Rate Increase For Individual Health Plans", "site": "@valleynewslive", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "BCBS ND Proposes 18% Rate Increase For Individual Health Plans", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "O9T1EEnMthBcl7RceC90xBgHQXUsnIogkGQoXawOoqI", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "BCBS ND Proposes 18 Rate, Increase For Individual Health Plans"}, "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield North Dakota (BCBS ND) proposed an 18% increase for their individual plans.\nBCBS ND officials say now that the healthcare reform has been in effect for a year, this is the first time they know the actual cost for providing care on individual plans.\nSome Blue Cross Blue Shield customers in North Dakota and Minnesota may soon see significant rate increases on their premiums.\nMedica Health Plans and Time Insurance Company also proposed rate increases in North Dakota.\nValley News Live wanted to know if the increase on individual plans would translate to higher cost if you purchase insurance through an employer?"}
