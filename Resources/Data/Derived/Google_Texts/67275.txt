Incoming NSW governor David Hurley will be paid an annual salary of $445,100 – more than double that of his respected predecessor, Dame Marie Bashir, who earned $195,515.

But it is not that he is more valued by the government; unlike Dame Marie, General Hurley will have to pay income tax.

The salaries of governors and governors-general were tax exempt before the Australian Parliament passed the Governor General Legislation Amendment Act 2001, which removed their tax-free status.

Incumbent governors including Dame Marie, who was appointed in March 2001 – three months before the act was assented – were not affected.

Because General Hurley is the first NSW governor to be appointed under the new rules, he will pay income tax on his salary.

General Hurley's net salary is likely to be in the order of $257,000, which is still significantly higher than that of Dame Marie.

But a NSW government spokesman said Dame Marie was supplemented by a tax-free annual administration payment in the order of $60,000.

As defence force chief, General Hurley was paid a base annual salary of $535,100 and total annual remuneration of $764,420.

Premier Mike Baird wrote to the NSW remuneration tribunal on June 2 requesting it make a determination for the salary of the office of NSW governor.

The tribunal's determination noted that in setting the remuneration for the NSW governor it "has had regard to relevant comparators".

In Queensland, the Governor's salary last financial year was $371,000 while in South Australia it was $309,000. Both are set as percentages of the salaries paid to Supreme Court judges.

In Western Australia, the Governor's salary was set at $400,000 in 2011 and indexed each year.

The base salary for the Australian Governor-General last financial year was $526,070, but General Peter Cosgrove is paid $425,000 each year to take into account his Commonwealth-funded military pension.
