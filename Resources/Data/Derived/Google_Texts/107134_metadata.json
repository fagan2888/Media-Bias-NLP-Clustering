One of the reasons for their pessimism is Sanders\u2019 political ideology: He\u2019s a self-described \u201cDemocratic Socialist.\u201d\n\nAnd the S-word frightens a lot of Americans.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted in December 2011, shortly after the Occupy Wall Street protests, which highlighted the growing wealth gap between the rich and the poor, found half of all Americans still had a positive view of capitalism, while 60 percent had a negative perception of socialism.\n\n\u201cSocialism is a far more divisive word (than capitalism), with wide differences of opinion along racial, generational, socioeconomic and political lines,\u201d Pew said.\n\n\u201cFully nine-in-ten conservative Republicans (90 percent) view socialism negatively, while nearly six-in-ten liberal Democrats (59 percent) react positively. Low-income Americans are twice as likely as higher-income Americans to offer a positive assessment of socialism (43 percent among those with incomes under $30,000, 22 percent among those earning $75,000 or more).\u201d\n\nA Gallup survey this summer found similar anti-socialist views among American voters, half of whom said they wouldn\u2019t vote for a socialist candidate.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why this is. For many Americans the word \u201csocialism\u201d still carries the associations with authoritarianism that it acquired during the Cold War. That explains why some opponents of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act were calling it the same thing Ronald Reagan called Medicare in 1961: \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d Combine those negative Cold War associations with the fact that a significant portion of the American electorate wants to shrink government, limit spending, and cut taxes, and you realize that Bernie Sanders has his work cut out for him if he\u2019s going to proudly wave the socialist flag.\n\nOne thing Sanders has on his side: social welfare policies enacted overseas in nations that consistently rank more highly than the United States in terms of happiness and prosperity. If Sanders can convince Americans voters that this is what he\u2019s talking about when he talks about \u201csocialism,\u201d maybe he\u2019ll have a shot.\n\nHere are five things other countries do that could change American minds about socialism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The S-word scares a lot of Americans, but its presence in Europe shows just how beneficial it is VIDEO", "title": "5 things that could change American minds about socialism", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The S-word scares a lot of Americans, but its presence in Europe shows just how beneficial it is VIDEO", "title": "5 things that could change American minds about socialism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/17/5_things_other_countries_do_that_could_change_american_minds_about_socialism_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/AP77174442780-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The S-word scares a lot of Americans, but its presence in Europe shows just how beneficial it is VIDEO", "title": "5 things that could change American minds about socialism", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/AP77174442780-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Allison Jackson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Europe, GlobalPost, Health Care, healthcare, lists, Socialism, universal health care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6d3\"", "article_summary": "Here are five things other countries do that could change American minds about socialism.\n\u201cFully nine-in-ten conservative Republicans (90 percent) view socialism negatively, while nearly six-in-ten liberal Democrats (59 percent) react positively.\nFor many Americans the word \u201csocialism\u201d still carries the associations with authoritarianism that it acquired during the Cold War.\nOne of the reasons for their pessimism is Sanders\u2019 political ideology: He\u2019s a self-described \u201cDemocratic Socialist.\u201dAnd the S-word frightens a lot of Americans.\nIf Sanders can convince Americans voters that this is what he\u2019s talking about when he talks about \u201csocialism,\u201d maybe he\u2019ll have a shot."}
