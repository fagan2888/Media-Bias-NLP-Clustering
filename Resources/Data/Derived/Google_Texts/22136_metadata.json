Here\u2019s How His 2012 Agenda Would Have Devastated The Poor. CREDIT: AP Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney\n\nTwo-time presidential candidate Mitt Romney is gearing up for a third run at the Oval Office, aides close to the former Massachusetts governor tell reporters, busily courting donors and laying out a message that will convince voters that the third time really is the charm.\n\n\u201cRomney, who made a fortune in the financial sector and was cast by Democrats in 2012 as a heartless businessman, wants to make tackling poverty \u2014 a key issue for his 2012 vice presidential running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan \u2014 one of the three pillars of his campaign,\u201d Politico\u2019s Maggie Haberman and James Hohmann write.\n\nA senior adviser to Romney explained that a third Romney campaign will likely adopt a more populist economic tone focusing on \u201cupward mobility and opportunity,\u201d themes that Congressional Democrats touted, largely unsuccessfully, during the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nFor Romney, the new focus is jarring. After all, he ran his 2012 campaign on policies that would have disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans and regularly argued that poor people didn\u2019t need his help.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the very poor,\u201d Romney explained to then-CNN host Soledad O\u2019Brien in February 2012. \u201cWe have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d\n\nDuring a high-dollar fundraiser in September 2012, Romney infamously wrote off 47 percent of voters who he claimed didn\u2019t pay taxes and are \u201cdependent upon government,\u201d arguing that it\u2019s not his job to \u201cworry about those people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nEven after losing the election, Romney attributed Obama\u2019s re-election to the \u201cthe gifts\u201d his administration had distributed to African Americans, Hispanics, and young voters. \u201cThe President\u2019s campaign focused on giving targeted groups a big gift\u2014so he made a big effort on small things. Those small things, by the way, add up to trillions of dollars,\u201d he said, referring to Obama policies that allowed young people to stay on their parents\u2019 health care plans, offered contraception at no additional cost, and deferred deportation for undocumented youth.\n\nFormer Romney supporters \u2014 including the director of Hispanic outreach for the campaign \u2014 quickly distanced themselves from those remarks, but neither they nor Romney ever abandoned the policies behind the sentiment.\n\nIn 2012, Romney\u2019s tax plan \u2014 a 20 percent reduction in all marginal income tax rates \u2014 would have delivered half of its benefit to the richest 5 percent of Americans, with more than 25 percent of the benefit going to the richest 1 percent. According to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center, Romney would have increased after-tax income for those making more than $200,000 annually, while lowering it for everyone else.\n\nRomney also called for repealing an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, policies that that were included in the 2009 Recovery Act and disproportionately benefited families in the lowest income quintile.\n\nThese tax changes were part of his larger economic pledge to balance the budget by 2020. Romney promised to impose a cap of 20 percent on all federal spending as a percentage of GDP to help him achieve that goal.\n\nBut as an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated, such budget constraints would have spelled large cuts to programs that benefit lower-income Americans.\n\nThirteen million people would have lost access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or food stamps, compensation payments for disabled veterans and Supplemental Security Income benefits for poor seniors and people with disabilities would have both been cut by more than 25 percent, along with other benefits like school lunches and unemployment compensation.\n\nRomney also campaigned on cutting Medicaid funding by converting the health care program \u2014 a joint funding venture between the states and the federal government \u2014 into a block grant to the states that caps funding regardless of rising need. Such policy would have reduced health care enrollment by 14 to 27 million people.\n\nLike most Republicans running for office, Romney also promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act on his \u201cfirst day\u201d in office, a goal that is at odds with alleviating poverty. The law has lowered the uninsured rate among Americans earning less than $36,000 in annual household income by 6.9 points since it went into effect one year ago.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Is Mitt Romney the savior of the poor?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Is Mitt Romney the savior of the poor?", "title": "Romney Wants To Fight Poverty.
