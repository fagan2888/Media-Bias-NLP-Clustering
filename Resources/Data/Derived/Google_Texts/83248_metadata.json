She served as Spokeswoman for the historic Colorado recalls, as Spokeswoman for the California Republican Party, twice as an Appointee of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and as Spokeswoman for Prop. 8 which went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. During her career as a GOP strategist, she has been described as one of \u201cthe most relevant Press Secretaries in the West\u201d -- winning every major newspaper endorsement for her candidates. Proud of her ability to win over tough liberal reporters and coalitions, she made her mark by being the first known Press Secretary in history (Republican or Democrat) to win 52 unanimous endorsements from such liberal publications as the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and the Spanish-language La Opinion \u2013 arguably among the toughest Press Corps, in the most populous State in the nation.\n\nA showdown in the U.S. Senate over the extension of the Patriot Act this week revealed divisions among the GOP on a core policy issue of national security \u2013 in particular, the collection and storage of bulk cellphone data.\n\nIt also revealed a troubling picture of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2018s leadership \u2026 or lack thereof.\n\nSources on Capitol Hill, including lobbyists and top attorneys, have been saying for weeks that Sen. McConnell (R-Ky.) is a \u201ctimid\u201d leader who is flailing in his new role.\n\nThis week\u2019s showdown within his own caucus underscores that point after an issue that could have been resolved with the simple adoption of a House bill, instead turned into a national media circus and sparked an embarrassing debate between GOP members on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\nWhile the newly-named USA Freedom Act has now been passed and quickly signed into law by President Barack Obama, this week\u2019s free-for-all reveals serious concerns about McConnell\u2019s judgment.\n\nFirst, the showdown illustrates that McConnell is woefully out of touch with his own party and his own country. Anyone who picks up a newspaper or logs onto the Internet knows that the American public is growing more Libertarian on the issues of personal liberty and government overreach. In fact, Americans hold the lowest level of trust for their government than at any other time in American history. A CNN poll shows that only 13 percent of Americans believe their government can be trusted.\n\nIt stands to reason.\n\nMitch McConnell is woefully out of touch with his own party and his own country. Share:\n\nThe IRS spent years harassing law-abiding Tea Party members; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked, \u201cWhat difference\u2026 does it make?\u201d after four U.S. personnel members died on her watch\u2019 and Obama\u2019s White House turned out to be the least transparent in American history despite pledging it would be the most.\n\nTherefore, it is no wonder that Americans have heartburn over the 14-year-old Patriot Act that is now in the hands of a government that has perpetrated the above.\n\nSecond, as a fellow Kentuckian, McConnell has forged an interesting, strange-bedfellows, Bluegrass-State alliance with Rand Paul for president in 2016. Meaning, McConnell should have seen this coming.\n\nA fierce Libertarian, Paul has made no secret of his disdain for the Patriot Act - even before Edward Snowden exposed the National Security Administration\u2018s program aimed at spying on Americans. The privacy issue is not new for Rand and quite frankly, the only surprise here is that it came as such a surprise to McConnell.\n\nThird, McConnell does not yet appear to be owning his power. As leader, he had the prerogative and perhaps even the duty to hold the Senate into the Memorial Day weekend until the issue was resolved, but instead allowed members to head home where the sore spot over national security was allowed to fester in the media.\n\nMcConnell appears to be underestimating the younger members of his caucus such as Ted Cruz and Paul. These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are more prone to filibuster, form their own special-interest caucuses, and unlike members of Congresses past aren\u2019t going to \u201csit down and shut up\u201d just because their leader told them to \u2014 most certainly not during a presidential election year where GOP candidates are faced with the largest presidential field in American history vying for content and yes, relevance in the media cycle.\n\nLastly, unfortunately for McConnell the Patriot Act showdown supports the suggestion from sources on Capitol Hill that Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) still, in effect, runs the day-to-day operations in the U.S. Senate. If true, this would explain the mechanics of last week\u2019s disastrous vote. If true, it would also be a crushing disappointment to the millions of Americans who voted for and rightfully expected fresh leadership in the upper chamber of Congress.\n\nWhatever the reason for his miscalculation over the Patriot Act, McConnell would be wise to learn a thing or two from this week\u2019s lessons because new battles are already looming.\n\nAs America tries to figure out how to fight Islamic State overseas, as the U.S. Supreme Court appears poised to potentially overturn portions of Obamacare (leaving millions without health care plans), and as the now-injured, perennially-milquetoast Secretary of State John Kerry attempts to negotiate a high-stakes nuclear deal with Iran, the American people both expect \u2013 and deserve \u2013 to have a U.S. Senate on top of its game.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
