× Gov. Walker teams up with Sesame Street to promote healthy habits

MADISON (WITI) — In partnership with the National Governors Association, Governor Scott Walker recently teamed up with Rosita and Abby Caddaby from Sesame Street to promote healthy habits among children.

“Rosita and Abby have a great message for kids—eat right, and get some exercise, every day. A healthy body supports a healthy mind. It’s the key to a bright and happy future,” Gov. Walker said.

In two separate PSAs, Gov. Walker appears with Abby and Rosita to talk about the importance of healthy eating and exercise.

“It is important to start teaching healthy habits from a young age. When you eat healthy, you feel healthy,” Gov. Walker says in the PSAs.
