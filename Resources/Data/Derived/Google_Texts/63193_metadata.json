Ad Policy\n\nBack when I was a much younger man, I worked briefly for a Democratic member of Congress from my home state. (This was when West Virginia still had Democratic members of Congress.) I performed the sorts of duties still executed by eager young things today, unglamorous tasks but nevertheless important ones to the good taxpaying people back home: answering constituent mail, helping widows get their husbands\u2019 black-lung benefits and so on.\n\nOne morning, a union man from my hometown called the office. There was a painting job being done at a Department of Energy facility somewhere in the district. The company that won the contract to do the painting, my union man explained, was trying to pay less than the \u201cprevailing wage,\u201d the typical hourly wage for the area as determined by the government. In fact, considerably less\u2014enough that these workers were going to feel it. Could I help? I had no idea what to do. But the labor leader said he had a contact at the Department of Labor who might be of use.\n\nThis was in 1984\u2014in other words, Ronald Reagan\u2019s Department of Labor. So it was with considerable trepidation that I began punching in the phone number, but it turned out that my union man did not steer me wrong. The fellow I spoke with was a Carter holdover who actually believed in enforcing labor law. I explained the situation. Though the conversation was long ago, I do remember him whispering to me that not everyone recently installed in the nearby cubicles shared his old-fashioned views, and I was lucky I\u2019d found him. He said he\u2019d hop right on it, and a couple days later, my union man called back to say all was well and thank me.\n\nWhen we on the broad liberal-left have one of our quadrennial debates about whether to support the sellout Democratic presidential nominee or cast a \u201cstrategic\u201d vote of protest for a Green or other third-party candidate, the debate is almost entirely about the personal and political merits and demerits of the two individuals. And the two usual tentpoles of the conversation are that the putative nominee is a timorous corporate hack who won\u2019t come anywhere near bringing about the needed fundamental change, and that, yes, the nominee may well be that, but he or she is in numerous ways far better than the Republican alternative and thus the \u201clesser of two evils,\u201d in the argot.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ballot_ap_img_4-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Michael Tomasky", "description": "Should we put government in the hands of a party determined to subvert it, or a party\u2014however flawed\u2014that believes it still has a role to play in securing the common good?", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Should we put government in the hands of a party determined to subvert it, or a party\u2014however flawed\u2014that believes it still has a role to play in securing the common good?", "title": "Lesser-Evilism We Can Believe In", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/lesser-evilism-we-can-believe/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ballot_ap_img_4.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 410}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T06:06:23+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Should we put government in the hands of a party determined to subvert it, or a party\u2014however flawed\u2014that believes it still has a role to play in securing the common good?", "title": "Lesser-Evilism We Can Believe In", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/lesser-evilism-we-can-believe/", "image": {"height": 410, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ballot_ap_img_4.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ballot_ap_img_4.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "March 23rd, 2015", "sailthru.title": "Lesser-Evilism We Can Believe In", "keywords": "feature, elections, politics, the left", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 117185, "sailthru.tags": "Elections,Politics,The Left,Feature", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "the left", "published_time": "2015-03-23T11:01:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T06:06:23+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/smccroskey/"}, "sailthru.description": "Should we put government in the hands of a party determined to subvert it, or a party\u2014however flawed\u2014that believes it still has a role to play in securing the common good?", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ballot_ap_img_4.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One morning, a union man from my hometown called the office.\nHe said he\u2019d hop right on it, and a couple days later, my union man called back to say all was well and thank me.\nSo it was with considerable trepidation that I began punching in the phone number, but it turned out that my union man did not steer me wrong.\nBut the labor leader said he had a contact at the Department of Labor who might be of use.\nAd PolicyBack when I was a much younger man, I worked briefly for a Democratic member of Congress from my home state."}
