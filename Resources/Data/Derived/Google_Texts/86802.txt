"It's relatively easy to see that something is going on because the flesh eating bacteria seems to be more prevalent this year," said John Scott with the Clean Water Initiative of Florida.



Scott points the blame on the fresh water releases from Lake Okeechobee.



"It's just not right, it's not normal," said Scott.



The beaches along Sanibel Causeway are not the only ones raising eyebrows. They claim there are several others in Lee, Collier, and Charlotte Counties researches say could make you sick.



"I've always known that there is bacteria in sea water, you just have to be careful with that," said beach goer Janelle Shivers.



Researchers with the Natural Resources Defense Council have released the names of the beaches they say had more than normal levels of bacteria last year. There are seven beaches in Collier County, five in Lee County and 6 in Charlotte County raising concern.





They expect the bacteria levels to be up this year and they want to hear from the EPA now to force a clean up.



"They need to do that for our tourists," said McFall.



Until that happens, McFall says she will take extra safety measures to stay healthy. For example, Lee County health leaders recommend plugging your nose when you are in the water. Stay out of the water altogether if you have an open wound.





Charlotte County Health Department responded to say their latest reports as of July 21 show all beaches in their coverage area in good standing without problem water samples.

Researchers are concerned that more than a dozen Southwest Florida beaches are infested with bacteria. That day of fun could be hazardous.Some swimmers say it is already too late to do something about it. They have had health problems recently after going to the beach.One boater noticed the potential dangers around her."I noticed places breaking out on my legs," said Teresa Mcfall. "Now, I hear there is bacteria in the water, I'm like oh great."Now the researchers want the EPA to step up their patrols. Health leaders say it is normal to share our beaches with bacteria, but the threat comes when it is too much and some bacteria can be deadly.
