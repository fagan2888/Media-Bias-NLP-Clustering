The pollster wonders if voters agree with MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, a key pointman behind the health care law, caught on video saying that lack of transparency is \u201ca huge political advantage\u201d and suggesting the cumbersome law itself was too complex for \u201cstupid\u201d Americans. The Republican National Committee immediately produced their own parody video tiled \u201cGrubering.\u201d President Obama distanced himself, then reframed the moment, telling reporters, \u201cThe fact that an adviser who was never on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is not a reflection on the actual process that was run.\u201d\n\nDitto from Secretary for Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell who told NBC on Sunday that she fundamentally disagreed with Mr. Gruber\u2019s comments and that her department focused on transparency and accuracy. And from former White House adviser David Axelrod came this tweet a few hours later, homing in on the Affordable Care Act: \u201cAs one who worked hard to make ACA and its benefits clear, let me say: if you looked up \u2018stupid\u2019 in dictionary, you\u2019d find Gruber\u2019s picture.\u201d\n\nWell, OK. But what did the Rasmussen survey reveal? There\u2019s a complicated divide at work among \u201cstupid\u201d Americans. The survey found that 32 percent of likely voters agree with Mr. Gruber. It also found that 52 percent disagree with the idea while 16 percent are not sure. Among voters who favor the health care law, 18 percent say Americans are too dumb to understand it. \u201cThose who oppose the law, however, by a 46 percent to 42 percent margin do think the American people are that stupid,\u201d states the poll of 1,000 likely U.S. voters, conducted on Nov. 12-13.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber suddenly recast as bit player after uproar\n\nTHE GRUBERISMS\n\nGrubergate, gruberish, grubered, grubermania, moneygrubering and gruberpalooza are among the new terms that have sprung into public use, these inspired by the aforementioned Mr. Gruber. All the new nouns and verbs \u2014 some capitalized, some not \u2014 are now appearing in multiple print and online reports from Time, Bloomberg, Fox News, Powerline, Lucianne.com and many other sources. The usage has been spirited in recent days.\n\n\u201cHow about you man up, Stewart, and admit you were \u2018Grubered\u2019 into selling that Obamacare [expletive],\u201d Fox News host Eric Bolling advised Jon Stewart, a rival host on Comedy Central.\n\nSEE ALSO: McConnell rules out government shutdown to block Obama immigration moves\n\n\u201cI think that no other word describes what we have seen in the climate debate quite as well as Grubering. The Climategate emails are full of discussions about how to \u2018sell\u2019 the public on catastrophic anthropogenic global warming through a campaign of lies and exaggerations. There are many discussion about how the public could not possibly understand such a complex subject. \u2018Climate Grubering\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s a powerful new word that can help us to describe what\u2019s been going on,\u201d notes Watts Up With That, a popular blog covering climate change and global warming.\n\n\u201cSo now there are denialists, skeptics, warmists, alarmists and Gruberists,\u201d responded one reader on Sunday.\n\nIMMIGRATION REFORM, PART 2\n\n\u201cUnrestrained, unaccountable, and unhinged\u201d is how Judicial Watch director Tom Fitton describes President Obama\u2019s approach toward immigration policy, and the potential 10-point overhaul of the system rumored to take shape later this week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a largely unreported element of this story that deserves greater attention and scrutiny as it provides insight into the administration\u2019s aims and ambitions \u2014 and reveals the backroom conniving and outright duplicity inherent in the entire Obama amnesty scenario,\u201d Mr. Fitton advises. \u201cOn January 29, 2014, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security posted a \u2018Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought: Escort Services for Unaccompanied Alien Children.\u2019 \u201d Among the services to be provided:\n\n\u201cThe Contractor shall provide unarmed escort staff, including management, supervision, manpower, training, certifications, licenses, drug testing, equipment, and supplies necessary to provide on-demand escort services for non-criminal/non-delinquent unaccompanied alien children ages infant to 17 years of age, seven (7) days a week, 365 days a year,\u201d according to the request.\n\nMr. Fitton says Judicial Watch has already filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the federal agency seeking \u201cany and all records\u201d relating to the plan.\n\nVOTER OUTREACH STARTS EARLY\n\n\u201cHillary, The Coloring Book\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cHand-drawn images ready to be colored \u2014 including the iconic \u2018Texts from Hillary\u2019 moment \u2014 are accompanied by fascinating facts about the history of America\u2019s Madam President-in-waiting,\u201d advises publisher Ulysses Press, which has priced the 64-page book at $10.\n\nTHE TRAVELS OF MR. HAGEL\n\nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel will soon finish up a five-day trip around the nation gauging \u201cfirst-hand some of the critical training the force receives to maintain readiness across a range of challenges,\u201d this according to Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby. He toured the 91st Missile Wing Operations Center at Minot Air Force Base on Friday. On Saturday, Mr. Hagel delivered the keynote address at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California \u2014 as well as the perfectly splendid \u201cPeace Through Strength\u201d dinner that followed to honor former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Republican Sen. John McCain. Those events, incidentally, are dear to the heart of Nancy Reagan.\n\n\u201cRonnie\u2019s proudest moments as president involved the men and women who wear the uniform of our country and defend us around the world every day. He would have been so pleased to know that his presidential library is now hosting important and relevant events like these,\u201d Mrs. Reagan observes.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Hagel journeyed to observe U.S. Army \u201cDecisive Action\u201d readiness training at Fort Irwin, California \u2014 this involving 4,700 soldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. DOD describes this as a test of \u201clarge-scale, offensive and defensive operations against a near-peer enemy\u201d and to \u201csupport an embattled host nation government and fight an insurgency.\u201d On Monday, he\u2019s off to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to thank families of U.S. military service members deployed to West Africa, then it\u2019s on to Camp LeJeune on Tuesday to observe a phenomenon of interest to fans and critics alike at his final stop.\n\n\u201cHe will observe training conducted by the men and women of the Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force. This training will help the Marine Corps facilitate standards base assessments of physical performance to help integrate female Marines into ground combat arms occupational specialties,\u201d DOD advises.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 79 percent support policies that balance the federal budget; 95 percent of Republicans, 71 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 73 percent overall support policies that toughen border security; 93 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 71 percent overall support policies lowering individual taxes; 90 percent of Republicans, 63 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of independents agree\n\n\u2022 49 percent overall support policies that would \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d; 84 percent of Republicans, 19 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 39 percent overall support providing illegal immigrants with a \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d; 22 percent of Republicans, 52 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of independents agree.\n\nSource: An Economist/YouGov poll of 995 U.S. adults conducted Nov. 8-10.\n\n\u2022 Smart remarks and polite applause to jharper@washingtontimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Are the American people too stupid to understand the true costs associated with Obamacare?\" asks a point blank survey question from Rasmussen Reports.
