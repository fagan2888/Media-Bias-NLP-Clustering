In other words, a policy of concentration may inadvertently help to create the kind of hierarchical organisation that the terrorists found it impossible to create outside.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.K.'s government is seriously considering placing all convicted Islamist terrorist prisoners in the country in a single secure super jail, but the idea is raising red flags among counterterrorism experts.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.K.\u2019s government is seriously considering placing all convicted Islamist terrorist prisoners in the country in a single secure super jail, but the idea is raising red flags among counterterrorism experts.", "title": "U.K. government mulling \u2018British Guantanamo\u2019 for Islamist terrorists", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/13/uk-government-mulling-british-guantanamo-for-islam/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/Europe_EU_Summit.JPEG-08ca1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/Europe_EU_Summit.JPEG-08ca1.jpg", "description": "The U.K.'s government is seriously considering placing all convicted Islamist terrorist prisoners in the country in a single secure super jail, but the idea is raising red flags among counterterrorism", "card": "summary", "title": "U.K. government mulling \u2018British Guantanamo\u2019 for Islamist"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "In other words, a policy of concentration may inadvertently help to create the kind of hierarchical organisation that the terrorists found it impossible to create outside.\u201d\nHowever, counterterrorism experts worry that bringing all convicted Islamist terrorists together in one facility could create a focal point for public protests.\nThe U.K.\u2019s government is seriously considering placing all convicted Islamist terrorist prisoners in the country in a single secure super jail, but the idea is raising red flags among counterterrorism experts.\nWe will not stand by and watch people being radicalised like this while they are in the care of the state.\n\u201cThe second point is now more important than ever,\u201d Mr. Neumann said."}
