Very difficult. And in a sense, there are no \"real\" numbers.\n\nBut the official measures of inflation, gross domestic product (GDP), or employment aren't the result of some conspiracy agenda. And a close look at GDP data confirms the economy is still slowly recovering from the financial crisis.\n\nToday, I'm going to take a deeper look into the \"official\" story on inflation. And more specifically, I'm going to see if one of the most controversial government statistics \u2013 the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \u2013 is telling us the full story.\n\nLet's get started...\n\nInflation is supposed to reflect the overall change in consumer prices. But it depends on your perspective whether you think the number is \"real.\"\n\nThe number most people refer to when discussing inflation is the CPI, calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI is designed to reflect the price of a basket of goods and services, including transportation and housing.\n\nSome people claim that the CPI has been systematically altered to make it seem tamer than it is.\n\nWell, the Billion Prices Project \u2013 an economic research initiative from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) \u2013 took an entirely new approach and tried to get a \"better\" picture of the price of nearly everything. Its results matched the CPI almost perfectly. (Take a look here .)\n\nNo one is monkeying with these numbers...\n\nThe real challenge when talking about inflation is trying to figure out how much more expensive it is for people to live. That's a hard question to answer.\n\nFor instance, a home computer in the mid-1990s cost $3,000. Today, you can get one that is 50 times faster for one-sixth the price. Is that deflation? How do you account for the progress in technology?\n\nOr let's say that beef prices rise and shoppers switch to chicken. Is that a rise in the cost of living? (The Bureau of Labor Statistics tries to account for these things with one of my favorite economic numbers... what's known as a \"hedonistic adjustment.\")\n\nBut no matter how you slice it, inflation today remains extraordinarily low.\n\nDon't believe me? Here's a chart bank of different inflation-related numbers. For each, we'll provide a long-term view so that you can see what used to happen when inflation was at normal levels...\n\nWe've already discussed the CPI... Here you can see it's at its lowest point since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. You can see the index declined 0.7% in January.\n\n\n\nNow, take a look at what commodities prices are doing...\n\nHere's a chart of the All Commodities section of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Producer Price Index. As you can see, commodity prices also fell \u2013 the growth rate dropped below zero \u2013 in January...\n\n\n\nYou can see the same trend in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' index of the prices of goods (other than fuel) coming into the U.S. Again, the prices fell in January...\n\n\n\nThese inflation stats show that things are not heating up.\n\nOverall, no inflation means no intervention from the Fed. Which means cheap money and continued rising asset prices. That's why I'm still confident this bull market isn't over yet... and why I'm recommending that my readers continue to buy quality blue-chip, income-producing stocks.\n\nTomorrow, we'll look at another hotly contested government statistic... unemployment. We'll see if the official employment numbers are to be trusted... and check in with my \"Cabbie Index\" for a real-world view on the job market.\n\nHere's to our health, wealth, and a great retirement,\n\nDr. David Eifrig", "article_metadata": {"verify-v1": "XfYM/3eBj/ANMeDGeiesIipt833UTM8Gs+tkuwRZZ7o=", "ROBOTS": "ALL", "copyright": "\u00a92016 Stansberry Research"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb55\"", "article_summary": "The number most people refer to when discussing inflation is the CPI, calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAnd more specifically, I'm going to see if one of the most controversial government statistics \u2013 the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \u2013 is telling us the full story.\nFor each, we'll provide a long-term view so that you can see what used to happen when inflation was at normal levels...We've already discussed the CPI...\nHere's a chart of the All Commodities section of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Producer Price Index.\nThe CPI is designed to reflect the price of a basket of goods and services, including transportation and housing."}
