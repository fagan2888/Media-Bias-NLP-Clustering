I have no idea what that piece is trying to say, just in terms of the on-the-record facts about the band's history. It's like the last three or four decades of debate about what is, and what is not, \"Christian\" music never happened. It's like Johnny Cash, Bruce Cockburn, T-Bone Burnett, Mark Heard, Charlie Peacock, etc., etc., never happened.\n\nHere are the opening paragraphs, including the buzz term that everyone is discussing -- \"secretly Christian.\"\n\nA few years ago, I was caught up in a big research project about contemporary hymns (or \u201chymnody,\u201d as they say in the trade). I listened to hundreds of hymns on Spotify; I interviewed a bunch of hymn experts. What, I asked them, was the most successful contemporary hymn -- the modern successor to \u201cMorning Has Broken\u201d or \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d? Some cited recently written traditional church hymns; others mentioned songs by popular Christian musicians. But one scholar pointed in a different direction: \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to construe the term \u2018hymn\u2019 liberally, then the most heard, most successful hymn of the last few decades could be \u2018I Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For,\u2019 by U2.\u201d\n\nClick pause for a moment. I love \"Still Haven't Found,\" and it's crucial to discussions of the band's offerings on faith, but U2 has released songs like \"Magnificent\" that only make sense -- as coherent statements -- when viewed as hymns. More on this later. Moving on to the key paragraph.\n\nMost people think of U2 as a wildly popular rock band. Actually, they\u2019re a wildly popular, semi-secretly Christian rock band. In some ways, this seems obvious: a song on one recent album was called \u201cYahweh,\u201d and where else would the streets have no name? But even critics and fans who say that they know about U2\u2019s Christianity often underestimate how important it is to the band\u2019s music, and to the U2 phenomenon. The result has been a divide that\u2019s unusual in pop culture. While secular listeners tend to think of U2\u2019s religiosity as preachy window dressing, religious listeners see faith as central to the band\u2019s identity. To some people, Bono\u2019s lyrics are treacly platitudes, verging on nonsense; to others, they\u2019re thoughtful, searching, and profound meditations on faith.\n\nSo is this a piece about Bono and crew being confused about what they do or do not believe, or is it about the fact that some people on the secular side of the cultural aisle are -- after three-plus decades -- still struggling with their grief because one of the planet's most popular and important bands is, well, meaningfully Christian?\n\nOn the other side, of course, there are plenty of Christians arguing about whether U2 is, as a band, \"Christian\" enough. I understand that argument, because it's linked to the tragic art vs. evangelism divide in modern Protestantism. (Over to you, Charlie Peacock, in 1999.)\n\nI also understand (in fact, I wrote my Universal syndicate column on this topic this week) that some people simply like to argue about U2 lyrics -- period.\n\nBut \"secretly Christian\"? Say what? It's like that Huffington Post take on the \"surprising\" friendship between Bono and Billy Graham.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not a news piece, but there is a lot of chatter out in mainstream \r\nmedia right now about that Joshua Rothman essay in\u00a0The New Yorker\u00a0that ran \r\nunder the headline\u00a0\"The Church of U2.\"\r\n\r\nI'll be honest.
