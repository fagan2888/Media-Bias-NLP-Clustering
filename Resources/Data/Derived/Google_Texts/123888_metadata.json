A common perception depicted by the media is that women are turned off by porn that is made for men, by men. Advocates for so-called female-friendly pornography\u2014that is, porn founded on mutual respect where the female subject demonstrates true agency in her sexuality\u2014believe that if there were more emotive-driven, personality-based storylines in porn, more women would watch it. However, surprising research on porn patterns suggests otherwise.\n\nNeuroscientists Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam, co-authors of the book, A Billion Wicked Thoughts, conducted research on visual pornography in relation to female sexual desire in an attempt to unlock the secret of our sexual habits. The results of their study found that while most women don\u2019t watch porn, those who do are not watching female-friendly porn but rather the same mainstream, male-targeted, hardcore sites that men view.\n\n\u201cThere is a real interesting phenomenon in women\u2019s sexuality\u2014not seen in men\u2019s\u2014and that is this divide between what eroticashouldbe and what actually turns women on,\u201d Ogas told AlterNet. \u201cStudies show that what turns women on is different to what they wish turned them on or how they politically feel about it. There is a paradox in the brain that women have to wrestle with. Men like what they like sexually. But with women, we see political manifestos embedded in their sexuality, with just as much emphasis on whether or not we\u2019re discriminating on any particular gender or race. Whereas, for a man that just doesn\u2019t occur.\u201d\n\nAn interesting correlation is found between women who like hardcore porn and certain personality traits, Ogar explains.\n\n\u201cWomen who like hardcore porn tend to be more aggressive, more socially assertive and more comfortable taking risks. They are comfortable playing both roles sexually, they like being dominated and being submissive. They possess a constellation of personality traits that you would normally associate with men. It is reasonable to imagine then that for a minority of women, their sexual brain develops in a masculine way,\u201d he said.\n\nAngie Rowntree, the founder of Sssh.com, offers a different explanation for the trafficking trends.\n\n\u201cIf the vast majority of porn on the market is made by and for men\u2014and it is\u2014is it any wonder that a relatively small portion of women wants to watch it? To me, that number just speaks to the opportunity on the market for porn made with a female viewership in mind. It\u2019s just a function of the numbers and what has been available on the market, historically speaking,\u201d she told AlterNet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most women don\u2019t watch it.
