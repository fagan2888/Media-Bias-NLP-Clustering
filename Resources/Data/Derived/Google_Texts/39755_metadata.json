Alexander, the former welfare chief in Pennsylvania who was criticized for policy initiatives that dramatically cut the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls, eliminating health care coverage for 89,000 children.\n\nDHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew said in a media statement that Alexander\u2019s firm brings much-needed expertise to evaluating social services that cost Maine $3.4 billion a year.\n\nDemocrats viewed the contract with suspicion, saying Alexander\u2019s record shows that his review will not be impartial and will serve only to justify divisive initiatives favored by the LePage administration.\n\nAlexander\u2019s hiring may also spur more partisan fighting over Medicaid expansion. The issue is highly political in Maine and other states because broadening the public health insurance program is a key component of the federal health care law. Republican governors, including Maine Gov. Paul LePage, have resisted Medicaid expansion, while the Obama administration has launched a public push to pressure states to participate.\n\nThe hiring of The Alexander Group will likely feed into that debate, which dominated a large part of this year\u2019s legislative session in Maine and is expected to resume when lawmakers reconvene in January.\n\nThe firm is led by Alexander, who was welfare chief for Republican Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania. Alexander left Pennsylvania in February after becoming a lightning rod over proposals that cut public assistance programs in the course of an aggressive anti-fraud initiative.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Alexander\u2019s Medicaid cuts prompted a review by the Obama administration after 130,000 people, including 89,000 children, lost health care coverage.\n\nAlexander\u2019s initiatives drew criticism from Democrats and advocacy groups for the poor. He also came under fire for issues unrelated to welfare reform, including instituting a dress code for female employees that prohibited open-toe shoes and required tights or panty hose.\n\nAlexander, who previously headed the welfare division in Rhode Island, also was criticized for keeping his home in Rhode Island while working in Pennsylvania, billing the state for travel expenses and launching a real estate company while still working for the welfare department.\n\nEarlier this year, Arkansas hired Alexander\u2019s firm for $220,000 to do a four-month review of its welfare system, according to news reports. The extensive report, completed in July, recommended an array of changes, including beefing up fraud detection through all public assistance programs. Other recommendations included:\n\n\u2022 Identifying and \u201cintensively\u201d managing the top 100 high-cost Medicaid recipients and potentially restricting benefits paid to designated care providers and emergency services.\n\n\u2022 Reviewing hospitals\u2019 claims for \u201cupcoding\u201d \u2013 schemes to overcharge for service.\n\n\u2022 Scrutinizing state employees\u2019 health benefit plans.\n\n\u2022 Reducing \u201chigh-end residential placement\u201d for people with developmental disabilities through shared-living programs.\n\n\u2022 Cutting hospice costs with more aggressive authorization procedures.\n\nAlexander\u2019s recommendations in Arkansas appear to align with the LePage administration\u2019s policy initiatives, particularly for welfare fraud. The administration has beefed up the DHHS fraud unit with a $700,000 annual investment to pay the salaries of new investigators. Democrats and advocacy groups for the poor have questioned whether the investment is politically driven.\n\nThe emphasis on fraud has increased the number of prosecution referrals to the state Attorney General\u2019s Office, from 10 cases in 2010 to 45 in 2012. The number of successful prosecutions has increased more gradually, from eight in 2010 to 15 in 2012. The amount of restitution that courts have ordered increased from $92,339 in 2010 to $104,341 in 2012.\n\nThe administration is also pursuing anti-fraud initiatives that it hasn\u2019t publicly disclosed. Documents obtained by the Portland Press Herald show that the state has launched a special investigation that targets Maine\u2019s approximately 500 licensed elver fishermen. Other initiatives outlined in the documents focus on out-of-state beneficiaries and data-driven methods to quantify benefits that were denied by eligibility specialists.\n\nAlexander included similar initiatives in his report for Arkansas.\n\nSome elements of Alexander\u2019s Maine contract appear to be under way already, including a feasibility study of Medicaid expansion. That initiative is scheduled to be complete by Dec. 1, according to the contract. A \u201csystem-wide program integrity action plan\u201d is due May 15.\n\nAccording to the contract, about $455,000 will be paid from the state\u2019s general fund, and about $276,000 is \u201cspecial revenue.\u201d About $193,000 is federal matching funds.\n\nIn her media statement, Mayhew said the DHHS is \u201cexcited about the opportunity to work with such a knowledgeable group of experts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the constantly shifting landscape of the Affordable Care Act and ever-changing rules from Washington, it will be extremely helpful to have someone with significant Medicaid experience lending a hand to our program reform efforts,\u201d she said.\n\nAlexander did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nMayhew said in a phone interview that Alexander\u2019s expertise will be valuable as the state considers additional public assistance reforms.\n\nAccording to the DHHS, Alexander\u2019s group will examine the state\u2019s \u201cwelfare to work\u201d initiative while heading \u201can enterprise-wide program integrity improvement effort to ensure those on welfare programs are truly eligible.\u201d\n\nThe release said Alexander and members of his team led a similar initiative in Pennsylvania, winning the 2012 Innovations Award from the Council of State Governments.\n\nDemocrats expressed skepticism.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to see is another gimmick to deny and delay health care for tens of thousands of Mainers, including nearly 3,000 veterans,\u201d said Rep. Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, the assistant House majority leader. \u201cThis is a million-dollar contract to pay someone whose controversial policies have failed struggling families in other states. Worse, it\u2019s had no public review.\u201d\n\nMayhew did not answer directly whether the contract was subject to a request-for-proposals process or competitive bidding, saying only that Alexander\u2019s firm was uniquely qualified for the analysis.\n\nAlexander\u2019s work has been hailed by conservatives who have called for a reduction in Medicaid rolls and a crackdown on fraud. He was the host of a conference call sponsored by the Foundation for Government Accountability, a Florida-based conservative advocacy group founded by Tarren Bragdon, former chief executive officer of the Maine Heritage Policy Center, another conservative advocacy group.\n\nSam Adolphsen, a former policy analyst for the Maine Heritage Policy Center, will oversee \u201cprogrammatic aspects\u201d of the contract. Adolphsen works for the DHHS as the strategic development director.\n\nRepublicans applauded the contract. House Minority Leader Kenneth Fredette, R-Newport, said in a prepared statement that he is glad to see the LePage administration \u201ctake yet another important step in bringing accountability and cost savings to Maine\u2019s welfare system by initiating this third-party review.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to seeing the results of this partnership because for too long, past administrations let welfare waste and spending grow to an unsustainable level,\u201d he said.\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @stevemistler", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state will pay $925,000 to The Alexander Group to help with fraud detection and assess the potential cost of expansion.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The state will pay $925,000 to The Alexander Group to help with fraud detection and assess the potential cost of expansion.", "title": "Maine hires controversial Medicaid reformist - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 246, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/501120-alexander.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2013/11/19/maine_hires_controversial_figure_to_evaluate_medicaid_program_and_expansion_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state will pay $925,000 to The Alexander Group to help with fraud detection and assess the potential cost of expansion.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/501120-alexander.jpg", "title": "Maine hires controversial Medicaid reformist - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2013-11-19T12:00:11-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc61d\"", "article_summary": "Some elements of Alexander\u2019s Maine contract appear to be under way already, including a feasibility study of Medicaid expansion.\nThe issue is highly political in Maine and other states because broadening the public health insurance program is a key component of the federal health care law.\nDocuments obtained by the Portland Press Herald show that the state has launched a special investigation that targets Maine\u2019s approximately 500 licensed elver fishermen.\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Alexander\u2019s Medicaid cuts prompted a review by the Obama administration after 130,000 people, including 89,000 children, lost health care coverage.\nSam Adolphsen, a former policy analyst for the Maine Heritage Policy Center, will oversee \u201cprogrammatic aspects\u201d of the contract."}
