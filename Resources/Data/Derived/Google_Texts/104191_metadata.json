F. Kennedy looks into the sky as planes from the Carrier Enterprise maneuver in a demonstration off the east coast on April 14, 1962.\n\nAs Democrats begin maneuvering for the 2016 presidential race, there isn\u2019t one who would think of disparaging John F. Kennedy\u2019s stature as a Democratic Party hero. Yet it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that none would dream of running on Kennedy\u2019s approach to government or embrace his political beliefs.\n\nToday\u2019s Democratic Party \u2014 the home of Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Al Gore \u2014 wouldn\u2019t give the time of day to a candidate like JFK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 35th president was an ardent tax-cutter who championed across-the-board, top-to-bottom reductions in personal and corporate tax rates, slashed tariffs to promote free trade, and even spoke out against the \u201cconfiscatory\u201d property taxes being levied in too many cities.\n\nHe was anything but a big-spending, welfare-state liberal. \u201cI do not believe that Washington should do for the people what they can do for themselves through local and private effort,\u201d Kennedy bluntly avowed during the 1960 campaign. One of his first acts as president was to institute a pay cut for top White House staffers, and that was only the start of his budgetary austerity. \u201cTo the surprise of many of his appointees,\u201d longtime aide Ted Sorensen would later write, he \u201cpersonally scrutinized every agency request with a cold eye and encouraged his budget director to say \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn the other hand, he was a Cold War anticommunist who aggressively increased military spending. He faulted his Republican predecessor for tailoring the nation\u2019s military strategy to fit the budget, rather than the other way around. \u201cWe must refuse to accept a cheap, second-best defense,\u201d JFK said during his run for the White House. He made good on that pledge, pushing defense spending to 50 percent of federal expenditures and 9 percent of GDP, both far higher than today\u2019s levels. Speaking in Texas just hours before his death, he proudly took credit for building the US military into \u201ca defense system second to none.\u201d\n\nSince that terrible day in Dallas 50 years ago, popular mythology has turned Kennedy into a liberal hero. Some of that mythmaking, as journalist and historian Ira Stoll argues in a new book, \u201cJFK, Conservative,\u201d was driven by Kennedy aides, such as Sorensen and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who had always wanted their boss to be more left-leaning than he was. Some of it was fueled by the Democratic Party\u2019s emotional connection to the memory of a martyred president, and its understandable desire to link their priorities to his legacy.\n\nBut Kennedy was no liberal. By any reasonable definition, he was a conservative \u2014 and not just by the standards of our era, but by those of his era as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStoll draws on an embarrassment of riches to make his case.\n\nWhen the young JFK launched his first political campaign for the US House in 1946, a profile in Look magazine homed in on his conservatism:\n\n\u201cWhen young, wealthy, and conservative John Fitzgerald Kennedy announced for Congress, many people wondered why,\u201d it began. \u201cHardly a liberal even by his own standards, Kennedy is mainly concerned by what appears to him as the coming struggle between collectivism and capitalism. In speech after speech he charges his audience \u2018to battle for the old ideas with the same enthusiasm that people have for new ideas.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t changed his political stripes by the time he ran for the Senate in 1952, challenging incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. Stoll notes that Massachusetts newspapers wanting to back a liberal in that race came out for the Republican \u2014 the Berkshire Eagle, for example, endorsed Lodge as \u201can invaluable voice for liberalism.\u201d When his reelection in 1958 made it clear that Kennedy would be running for the Democratic presidential nomination, Eleanor Roosevelt was asked in a TV interview whom she would support if forced to choose \u201cbetween a conservative Democrat like Kennedy and a liberal Republican [like] Rockefeller.\u201d FDR\u2019s widow, then as now a progressive icon, answered that she would do all she could to make sure Kennedy wouldn\u2019t be the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nMany on the left felt that way about JFK. When he decided to resume nuclear testing in 1962, Bertrand Russell attacked him as \u201cmuch more wicked than Hitler,\u201d and Linus Pauling, who would receive that year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, predicted that he would \u201cgo down in history as . . . one of the greatest enemies of the human race.\u201d Left-wing intellectuals raged against Kennedy\u2019s failed attempt to topple Fidel Castro (the renowned sociologist C. Wright Mills said the administration had \u201creturned us to barbarism\u201d). Liberals within the administration expressed dismay for Kennedy\u2019s unwavering support for tax cuts. Schlesinger called one of Kennedy\u2019s exhortations \u201cthe worst speech the president had ever given.\u201d\n\nNearly 30 years ago, an essay in Mother Jones magazine asked: \u201cWould JFK Be a Hero Now?\u201d If the answer wasn\u2019t obvious then, it certainly is now. In today\u2019s political environment, a candidate like JFK \u2014 a conservative champion of economic growth, tax cuts, limited government, peace through strength \u2014 plainly would be a hero. Whether he would be a Democrat is a different matter altogether.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "2.2.26487138", "eomportal-id": 1303217, "description": "As Democrats begin maneuvering for the 2016 presidential race, there isn\u2019t one who would think of disparaging John F.
