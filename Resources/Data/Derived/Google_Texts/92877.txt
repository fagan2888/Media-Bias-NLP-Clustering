Uh-oh: New York seems set for a ride on the ObamaCare death spiral.

Word came Wednesday that Empire State health-care insurers plan huge hikes in premiums for individual ObamaCare policies — 17.3 percent, on average, but up to 89 percent in at least one case.

That’s going to hurt: Wages have been growing by just a bit over 3 percent a year.

It’s a national trend: Plans in several other states also face double-digit bumps.

Why such steep spikes? Like others, Oscar Insurance cites rising medical costs, expiring government subsidies and customers who need “more care than we expected.”

And that last cost-driver — sicker-than-expected patients — is a built-in, fatal flaw.

Under the ObamaCare law, healthy patients must pay as much as sick ones. That pushes healthy folks to skip insurance altogether and pay the penalty instead.

Upshot? Insurers get sicker, costlier customers and have to — yep — push up rates.

“If these requests [to charge more] aren’t approved, you are going to see more carriers leaving the market,” says CareConnect CEO Alan Murray. Nationwide, scores of insurers have already called it quits: UnitedHealth is fleeing 27 states, including New Jersey.

Companies that stick it out will have to pick up the costlier patients other insurers drop — and the death spiral will take another turn. And all through ObamaCare’s slow implosion, Americans will pay ever-stiffer costs — for lousy insurance, with high deductibles and limited choices.

That leaves a decision for the next White House occupant: Pull the plug on ObamaCare and usher in something that works — or just let Americans keep on suffering.
