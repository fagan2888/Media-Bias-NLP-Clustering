Greg Abbott.\n\n\u201cWe live in a nation governed by a system of checks and balances, and the president\u2019s attempt to bypass the will of the American people was successfully checked today,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe 123-page judgment ruled that Obama\u2019s November amnesty violated the Administrative Procedure Act by ignoring Congress\u2019s laws.\n\nThe amnesty also improperly imposed burdens on the states, ruled Judge Andrew S. Hanen, of the Federal District Court in Brownsville. \u201cThe court finds that the government\u2019s failure to secure the border has exacerbated illegal immigration into this country. \u2026 The record supports the finding that this lack of enforcement, combined with the country\u2019s high rate of illegal immigration, significantly drains the states\u2019 resources.\u201d\n\nHanen was nominated in 2002 by then-President George W. Bush.\n\nThe injunction is needed, Hanen declared, to stall the amnesty while the lawsuit is debated by various appeals courts.\n\n\u201cThe court agrees \u2026 any subsequent ruling that finds DAPA unlawful after it is implemented would result in the states facing the substantially difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 task of retracting benefits or licenses already provided\u201d to beneficiaries, he wrote.\n\nObama\u2019s executive order is intended to award work permits, tax rebates, Social Security cards, and a quick route to citizenship to four million of the 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. The process would have helped the four million \u2014 and their children and spouses \u2014 gain deeper roots in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security was supposed to begin the amnesty process on Feb. 18.\n\nThe decision also blocked Obama\u2019s announced expansion of his 2012 policy of awarding work permits to younger illegal immigrants. So far, Obama\u2019s 2012 amnesty has allowed almost 700,000 illegals to compete against Americans for jobs in a lagging economy.\n\nBut the judge\u2019s decision didn\u2019t reverse Obama\u2019s effort to largely end repatriation of illegal immigrants. The decision \u201cdoes not enjoin or impair the [Department of Homeland Security] secretary\u2019s ability to marshal his assets or deploy the resources of the DHS,\u201d wrote the judge.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision could scramble the political standoff over the 2015 budget for the DHS.\n\nA January bill passed by the House has funded the agency from Feb. 27 to October. But Democratic senators are blocking the funding bill because it also includes text that bars any spending on Obama\u2019s unpopular amnesty.\n\nIf not reversed, the Democrats\u2019 filibuster will prevent any spending by the agency after Feb. 27, and will force many border and customs officials to work without pay.\n\nDemocrats and their media allies, plus some liberal Republicans, say the GOP\u2019s anti-amnesty language is causing the disagreement over the DHS budget, and the judge\u2019s decision will help GOP leaders to argue that the budget language merely implements the court\u2019s decision.\n\nThat decision also will increase pressure on Democrats from GOP-leaning states, plus Democrats who face the voters in 2016, to stop the filibuster and fund the DHS employees\u2019 checks.\n\nBut Senate GOP leaders have been reluctant to fight hard against the amnesty, and the Senate Democrats may continue to block the budget in the hope that the judge\u2019s decision will be reversed by an appeals court.\n\nSince 2009, existing immigration laws and Obama\u2019s decisions have added roughly 11 million foreign workers to the U.S. labor force, despite stalled wages and high unemployment.\n\nIn November 2014, foreign-born workers held one in every five U.S. jobs, up from one-in-six jobs in January 2010, according to federal data highlighted by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nEach year, four million young Americans begin competing for jobs against at least 10 million unemployed Americans, two million annual new immigrants, and a resident pool of roughly two million guest workers.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "President doesn't get to rewrite the nation's laws, for now", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A federal judge in Texas has blocked President Barack Obama's unilateral and unpopular November plan to award work permits to four million illegal immigrants, starting this week.
