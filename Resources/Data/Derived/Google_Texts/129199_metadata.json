But thanks to that last-minute budget agreement in Congress, our little plan is out the window.\n\nMostly, I think that's a good thing.\n\nBecause the coverage swirling around the federal budget compromise was all about party politics, you might have missed the tiny alarms about language slipped into the bill -- tightening a \"loophole\" in Social Security claiming rules that could cost the program money it can't really afford to lose.\n\nWarning: This discussion is going to get complicated fast. The intricacies of this octogenarian rulebook are not for the attention-span-challenged.\n\nIn 1935, this marvelous system was set up to save us from ourselves, and force us to sock away money for our old age and our dependents. Because it was not intended as a \"relief\" program, every worker would pay in, and everyone could get back. Its formula reflected the template of its times: a family with one earner -- usually known as \"Dad\" -- and a dependent spouse and children.\n\nIn this era of two-income couples, and serial marriages, ways to maximize payouts have proliferated like kudzu. A millionaire's several ex-wives could all claim spousal benefits -- as long as they could stick with the guy for 10 years or more. And more commonly, through a strategy called \"file-and-suspend,\" one spouse could wait until age 70 to start collecting higher benefits, while the lower-earning spouse could claim support based on the higher wages.\n\nOr, anyone of full retirement age could file a restricted application, and collect spousal benefits up until age 70, waiting until then to claim full benefits at the higher rate.\n\nThis sort of gamesmanship, while certainly all-American, is not what the designers of the system had in mind. And -- this won't surprise you -- those who know about these kinks in the rules generally have plenty of money already. Recipients whose Social Security checks keep them hovering right around the poverty line somehow managed to miss the strategy seminars.\n\nIt's been estimated that if everybody who could execute these fancy claiming strategies did so, it could cost the program more than $10 billion a year. Not much, in the scheme of things.\n\nBut -- although this budget deal could cost families like mine tens of thousands we won't love losing -- it's hard to argue against the fairness of closing a loophole that a clever minority has been slipping through, and that violates the equal-opportunity spirit of the Social Security program itself.\n\nAARP took some heat for supporting the change, and a last-minute clamor apparently succeeded in \"grandfathering in\" everyone already benefiting from the strategies. But the swiftness of this legislative accord, with scant public debate, means we should all keep a close watch on the next wind shifts in Social Security \"reform.\"\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Recipients whose Social Security checks keep them hovering right around the poverty line somehow managed to miss the strategy seminars.\nWell, my husband and I had a strategy for how we would claim our Social Security benefits when the time comes.\nBut the swiftness of this legislative accord, with scant public debate, means we should all keep a close watch on the next wind shifts in Social Security \"reform.\"\nBut -- although this budget deal could cost families like mine tens of thousands we won't love losing -- it's hard to argue against the fairness of closing a loophole that a clever minority has been slipping through, and that violates the equal-opportunity spirit of the Social Security program itself.\nBecause the coverage swirling around the federal budget compromise was all about party politics, you might have missed the tiny alarms about language slipped into the bill -- tightening a \"loophole\" in Social Security claiming rules that could cost the program money it can't really afford to lose."}
