St. Charles Parish Council Chairman Larry Cochran of St. Rose defeated former Councilman Terry Authement of Boutte to be elected parish president Saturday (Nov. 21). Cochran will succeed V.J. St. Pierre Jr., who was ineligible to run again because of term limits.

Cochran is a Democrat, Authement is a Republican. Each said he would prioritize the funding and building of a west bank storm protection levee.
