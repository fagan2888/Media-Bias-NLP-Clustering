Third- to eighth-grade test scores will be released in December.\n\nAcross the state, students scored better in English than in algebra, but that was expected because the state\u2019s old English curriculum more closely matched the new standards than did the math standards.\n\nNearly half of the 32,000 students who took the English 2 state test scored at least a Level 4 on the test, a mark that equates with them having a strong understanding of the subject. About 27 percent of students reached that mark on the algebra test, which was taken by about 40,000 students.\n\nThe tests were scored from Level 1 to Level 5. Scores of Level 4 and above roughly equate to the level of \u201cproficient or advanced\u201d on the former test. They are students who met or exceeded expectations.\n\nEducators had expected scores to drop on the new test because it was much harder than what students took in the past. That decline was less than what was anticipated, education leaders said. Last year, 76 percent of Mississippi students were proficient or advanced in algebra and 56 percent reached that mark in English 2.\n\n\u201cI see this test as hitting the reset button and giving us a new baseline,\u201d said State Superintendent of Education Carey Wright. \u201cWe expected an implemental dip, and there was a dip, but it wasn\u2019t as big as we thought it would be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only going up from here. These scores show our children are just as capable or more capable of performing than students across the nation. That is very encouraging.\u201d\n\nThe scores were approved on Thursday morning during a special-called meeting of the Mississippi Board of Education.\n\nMany Northeast Mississippi districts exceeded state and even national averages on the PARCC test. On the English 2 test, the New Albany, Union County and Amory school districts had the top three scores in the state, in terms of percentage of students who scored a Level 4 or better.\n\n\u201cWe are satisfied with the results, but we could always do better,\u201d said New Albany Superintendent Jackie Ford, whose district had 80.6 percent of its students reach at least Level 4 in English, the most in the state. \u201cThe students did a great job, and I think it\u2019s a reflection of good teaching.\u201d\n\nBooneville, Baldwyn, Prentiss County, Oxford, Tupelo and Monroe County all ranked in the top 20 in the state on the English test.\n\nMeanwhile, Itawamba County had the state\u2019s sixth-highest percentage of students to score at least a Level 4 on the algebra test, with 57.2 percent.\n\n\u201cWe tried our best to educate our kids as best we can,\u201d said Itawamba County Superintendent Michael Nanney. \u201cThey work hard, our teachers work hard, and we\u2019re glad that came through in the results.\u201d\n\nUnion County, Lafayette County, Booneville, Oxford and Amory were all among the top 20 districts in the state on the algebra test.\n\nThe tests were developed by the PARCC, a multiple-state consortium formed to create a common test to measure how well students understood the new Common Core State Standards.\n\nIn Mississippi, those standards have morphed into the current Mississippi College and Career-Ready Standards.\n\nAlthough it was the first year Mississippi students took the PARCC test, it also will be the last. The state pulled out of the PARCC consortium last year because of political controversy.\n\nThis year, students will take a test developed by Minnesota-based Questar.\n\n\u201cEven though the PARCC assessment is only going to be used one year, we encourage schools to use their results because the standards will still be the standards,\u201d Wright said.\n\nUnion County Assistant Superintendent Windy Faulkner said the PARCC test was different than past tests, with a lot more application and writing. Even though there will be a different test this year, she said these results will help the district in its preparation.\n\n\u201cFrom what we are hearing, the new test, the Questar test, will be very similar to the PARCC test,\u201d Faulkner said. \u201cWe will definitely look at the data and will improve areas that were weak.\u201d\n\nMississippi eventually will be able to compare its scores to other states in the PARCC consortium. It won\u2019t know that for sure until PARCC officially releases scores from all states, but Wright said based on what she has read in newspapers from other states in the PARCC group, Mississippi\u2019s scores may rank second to only Ohio.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mississippi Department of Education is putting a lot of emphasis on aiming teacher training specifically at student deficiencies to bump students who scored Level 1-3 into the 4-5 range, Wright said.\n\nchris.kieffer@journalinc.com\n\nriley.manning@journalinc.com\n\nzack.orsborn@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Chris Kieffer, Riley Manning and Zack Orsborn Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Mississippi high schools received official results Thursday of the first tests their students took on the new, more rigorous, Mississippi College and Career-Ready Standards.
