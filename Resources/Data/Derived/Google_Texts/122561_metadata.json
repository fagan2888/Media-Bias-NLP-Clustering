That is a $1,488 premium compared to this year\u2019s $1,060 and last year\u2019s $976 premium.\n\nHealth Services Director Christine Grady said while the increase is significant, steps were taken to assure students are going to get the biggest bang for their buck.\n\n\u201cHealth Services and the university get nothing out of this,\u201d Grady said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for students if they don\u2019t have other insurance or they\u2019re not on their parents\u2019 insurance.\u201d\n\nAffordable Care Act mandates will bring in a host of benefits for next year, including preventative medicine and immunizations, birth control, the elimination of the preexisting condition clause, a no-limit maximum benefit (compared to this year\u2019s $500,000 limit), pediatric dental and vision and a $25,000 accidental death benefit.\n\nThe Annual Student Health Insurance Fee Committee, of which Grady is a voting member, negotiated a quote from a pool of carriers through a designated broker.\n\nThe committee is composed of Health Services employees and representatives from Student Association and the Student Health Advisory Council.\n\nThe committee\u2019s broker, Academic HealthPlans, chose to remain with Blue Cross Blue Shield and was able to bring the increase in cost down from as high as $275 per semester to $214. The committee then approved next year\u2019s premium cost of $1,488 and sent its proposal to the Board of Trustees, which approved the change at its March 27 meeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased that we didn\u2019t go any higher than the premium they gave us, and they were willing to work with us,\u201d Grady said.\n\nDaihee Cho, former SA director of Student Life and voting member of the Annual Student Health Insurance committee when it was in session, said he agrees with the committee and board\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cTo me, it feels like it was reasonable,\u201d Cho said. \u201cI felt that they were taking in how students are sensitive to all the prices, for tuition and other fees. I believe they did a great job.\u201d\n\nSenior history major Mike Kaczmarek said there will be benefits to the health insurance changes despite the cost.\n\n\u201cTo be honest for me it\u2019s just going to be an increase in cost, but overall it\u2019s valuable to have this,\u201d Kaczmarek said. \u201cFor someone who is young and healthy, it\u2019s not going to help that much, but for people who need those things, it is.\u201d\n\nAs a part of the Affordable Care Act mandates, students can stay under their parents\u2019 health insurance until they are 26 years old. Because of this, students choose to remain covered while in school and are unaffected by the cost increase on campus.\n\nZach Baker, junior mechanical engineering major, said he chose to remain under his parent\u2019s insurance because of the lower cost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my parents\u2019 plan because it covers more things. I\u2019ve already been a part of it before I came here and will still be on it after I leave,\u201d Baker said. \u201cSwitching and possibly paying an extra premium didn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://northernstar.info/campus/niu-health-insurance-cost-rises/article_16ec2716-bf9d-11e3-8bda-001a4bcf6878.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Northern Star Online", "description": "As the cost of student health insurance is set to rise next year, so are the benefits.", "title": "NIU health insurance cost rises"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NIUNorthernStar", "card": "summary"}, "description": "As the cost of student health insurance is set to rise next year, so are the benefits.", "fb": {"app_id": 102865023105995}, "keywords": "keith hernandez,board of trustees,health insurance,affordable care act,daihee cho,zach baker,mike kaczmarek,christine grady,blue cross blue shield,academic healthplans,health services,student association,student health advisory council,annual student health insurance fee committee,campus,news,board_of_trustees", "news_keywords": "keith hernandez,board of trustees,health insurance,affordable care act,daihee cho,zach baker,mike kaczmarek,christine grady,blue cross blue shield,academic healthplans,health services,student association,student health advisory council,annual student health insurance fee committee,campus,news,board_of_trustees"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e17\"", "article_summary": "As the cost of student health insurance is set to rise next year, so are the benefits.\nThe committee is composed of Health Services employees and representatives from Student Association and the Student Health Advisory Council.\nI believe they did a great job.\u201dSenior history major Mike Kaczmarek said there will be benefits to the health insurance changes despite the cost.\nZach Baker, junior mechanical engineering major, said he chose to remain under his parent\u2019s insurance because of the lower cost.\nDaihee Cho, former SA director of Student Life and voting member of the Annual Student Health Insurance committee when it was in session, said he agrees with the committee and board\u2019s decision."}
