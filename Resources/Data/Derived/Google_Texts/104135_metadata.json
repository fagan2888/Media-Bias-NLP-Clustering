How about on jewelry-related trips to India?\n\nThese might seem like unusual questions for the Pentagon, but lawmakers at a hearing Wednesday were trying to figure out how, exactly, a task force spent about $638 million on economic development in Afghanistan.And more importantly, as Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., put it: \u201cWas it worth it?\u201d\n\nRelated: We Built a $335 Million Power Plant in Afghanistan that Can Barely Turn on Lightbulb\n\nThe readiness subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee didn\u2019t get many answers. \u201cThat\u2019s the big question, and it\u2019s the right one,\u201d was all Brian McKeon, principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, could offer.\n\nDuring two hours of questioning, he provided few specifics, allowing, \u201cIt\u2019s a little early to say\u201d whether the now-defunct Task Force for Business and Stability Operations had been successful.\n\nThe task force \u2014 a \u201cvery unusual animal\u201d McKeon called it \u2014 was led by civilian business experts and aimed to develop the Afghan economy by jumpstarting the private sector.\n\nThe committee called the hearing after the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, published several damning reports about wasteful spending by the task force. It operated mostly outside the traditional bounds of government bureaucracy \u2014 and, SIGAR said, without much oversight.\n\nJohn Sopko, the inspector general, testified that, so far, his agency has found that the Pentagon\u2019s task force had a \u201cscattershot approach to economic development\u201d and there was no \u201ccredible evidence showing\u201d that its efforts worked.\n\nRelated: U.S. Still Giving a Corrupt Afghanistan a Blank Check\n\nThe task force was initially launched in Iraq before moving to Afghanistan in 2010. But even in Iraq, it was beset with problems, Sopko told the subcommittee. These issues were detailed in at least three official reports. The Pentagon and task force members should have learned from their experience in Iraq, he said, but they repeated the same mistakes.\n\nHis conclusions echo a yearlong ProPublica investigation into Afghanistan reconstruction that found a widespread failure to apply lessons from Iraq was in part to blame for upwards of $17 billion in waste.McKeon put up little defense of the task force beyond disputing SIGAR\u2019s estimated $43 million cost of a controversial natural gas station and claims that his office had been uncooperative.\n\nHe said he was \u201cskeptical that the Department of Defense is the natural home\u201d for economic development efforts.\n\nLawmakers agreed. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the ranking minority member on the subcommittee, said it was a job better suited for the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMcKeon said his office was struggling to come up with answers about the task force\u2019s activities, because it shut down in March and most of its employees left the Defense Department \u2014 an argument the lawmakers found unpersuasive.\n\nMcKeon was unable to answer even the most basic questions about how all the money was spent.\n\nThe Pentagon, for the most part, had records for how money was spent by industry sector, but not necessarily for how support costs broke down for all the individual projects, he said. (Although, those goats? The task force spent $6 million bringing in nine blond ones from Italy and building a farm in an attempt to launch a thriving cashmere industry, according to SIGAR. This project hasn\u2019t been evaluated yet for effectiveness.)\n\nQuestioning at the hearing didn\u2019t get any easier from there, and, McKeon had, at times, an almost painful lack of information. Clearly uncomfortable and stuck with a limited script, he reiterated several times that he hadn\u2019t been in charge of the task force, since he only took over the job in 2014.\n\nAyotte, who chairs the subcommittee, asked if there were metrics to judge the projects.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen metrics,\u201d McKeon said.\n\nThen Ayotte asked why the task force eschewed living on a military base and opted instead for private villas and security that cost $150 million \u2014 a decision that ate up nearly 24 percent of all the money spent?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still digging\u201d for an answer on that, McKeon said, but he added that he thought those arrangements were necessary to show businesses that they could operate safely in Afghanistan.\n\nRelated: $45 Billion in Tax Dollars Goes Missing in Afghanistan\n\nSo, Ayotte asked, did any contracts result \u201cbecause we spent $150 million on villas?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t make that claim,\u201d McKeon said.\n\nLater in the hearing, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said the entire concept behind the villas defied common sense. The need to spend millions on security just to keep employees safe couldn\u2019t possibly entice businesses to set up shop.\n\n\u201cDo you see the fallacy of the logic there?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe subcommittee asked SIGAR to do a full financial audit of all the task force activities since the Pentagon could provide so few details. The senators were also concerned with how the Pentagon stonewalled SIGAR\u2019s inquiries on the task force.\n\nSIGAR and the Pentagon had been in a public tiff over access to records and the Pentagon\u2019s insistence that documents be reviewed in a special \u201creading room.\u201d Despite claiming the reading room was required to safeguard information in general, the Pentagon in that way.\n\nBut ahead of the hearing, the Pentagon reversed course and handed over a 100-gigabyte hard drive last week that it said contained all the task force information SIGAR had requested.\n\nHowever, Sopko said \u201cthe data provided is substantially inadequate\u201d and forensic accountants are examining it to see if anything was manipulated. McKeon said he was committed to providing SIGAR with all they needed.\n\nRelated: U.S. Spent $2B on 'Hearts and Minds' in Afghanistan\n\nMuch of the hearing was spent bickering about the actual cost of the compressed natural gas station, which has few customers and is barely being used. Part of the problem: The average Afghan would have to spend more than a year\u2019s salary to convert a car to run on compressed gas.\n\nMcKeon did not defend the gas station as a concept, but rather the reported cost.\n\nLast year, SIGAR said it cost $43 million, including $30 million on overhead. This week the Pentagon disputed that number, saying the real cost was under $10 million.\n\nThe question comes down to overhead cost, which the Pentagon has been unable to accurately calculate because of poor recordkeeping, Sopko said. He defended SIGAR, saying it reported the best number it had at the time, which came from the Pentagon itself and hadn\u2019t been disputed by the Defense Department until the day before the hearing.\n\nIt was unclear by the end of the hearing how much the gas station actually cost or whether anyone would be able to make that determination.\n\nMcCaskill had little patience for the cost debate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it was $2.9 million or $200 million,\u201d she said. The project was \u201cdumb on its face.\u201d\n\nShe said she wanted to know who had \u201cmade the brilliant decision that this was a good idea to put a natural gas station in Afghanistan,\u201d so she could \u201cfind out what the person was on that day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Is it true that rare Italian goats were airlifted to Afghanistan?", "title": "As the Military Cries Poor, It Wastes Billions in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/21/Military-Cries-Poor-It-Wastes-Billions-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Sigar.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/21/Military-Cries-Poor-It-Wastes-Billions-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Sigar.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Is it true that rare Italian goats were airlifted to Afghanistan?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1df6\"", "article_summary": "Still Giving a Corrupt Afghanistan a Blank CheckThe task force was initially launched in Iraq before moving to Afghanistan in 2010.\nThe Pentagon and task force members should have learned from their experience in Iraq, he said, but they repeated the same mistakes.\nDuring two hours of questioning, he provided few specifics, allowing, \u201cIt\u2019s a little early to say\u201d whether the now-defunct Task Force for Business and Stability Operations had been successful.\nThe committee called the hearing after the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, published several damning reports about wasteful spending by the task force.\nThe senators were also concerned with how the Pentagon stonewalled SIGAR\u2019s inquiries on the task force."}
