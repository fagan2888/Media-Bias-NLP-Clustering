Collins made history in April 2013 when he became the first professional basketball player to come out as gay.\n\nAlso seated in the first lady's guest box will be Carlos Arredondo and Jeff Bauman, survivors of the Boston Marathon attack in April; Gary Bird, a fire chief from Moore, Okla., which was hit by a devastating tornado last year; Joey Hudy, a 16-year-old entrepreneur and intern at Intel; and Kathy Hollowell-Makle, who was named District of Columbia Public Schools' Teacher of the Year.\n\nThe White House will announce more guests in the lead-up to the president's address.\n\nOther notables heading to the State of the Union include conservative radio show host Sean Hannity, a guest of Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), and Chad Henderson, a guest of Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas). Henderson caused a stir in October when, amid problems with Obamacare's federal website, he told reporters that he successfully signed up for health care, only to reveal later he did not.\n\nThe president's policy teams have been meeting since Thanksgiving to talk through policy ideas for the address, according to background materials provided by the White House, and they have held more than a dozen meetings with academics, policy experts, elected officials and members of Congress. Obama typically works on the speech at night, and his top speechwriter Cody Keenan works on it during the day.\n\n\n\nWhite House officials noted that Keenan started growing a beard at Thanksgiving and won\u2019t shave it until after the State of the Union.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obama With Celebrities Obama With Celebrities\n\n1 of 13 George Clooney & President Obama Actor George Clooney leaves after he spoke to the media March 15, 2012 at the White House in Washington, DC.
