On December 3 the Senate rejected Senator Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) push to expand background checks nationally in the wake of the attack in San Bernardino, California.

According to The Washington Post, Manchin attempted to add his expanded background check bill as an amendment to the “Obamacare repeal package currently making its way through Congress.” The Amendment was voted down 50 to 48.

He introduced his amendment by saying:

It’s for law-abiding gun owners and it’s a good piece of legislation and it’s most reasonable and it’s been accepted by people around the gun community. We have an opportunity to do it now with the height of everything happening. For us not to do anything, just sit here and be mum would be just as bad.

Manchin did not mention that California already has expanded background checks, and those were impotent against Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik.
