A manhunt is underway in northern Kansas after a convenience store clerk was shot during an attempted robbery early Sunday morning.

The Rooks County Sheriff's Office said a man entered the Plainville Short Stop convenience store just before 4:30 a.m. and pointed a gun at the clerk. When the clerk reached for the suspect's gun, he shot the clerk in the right hip.

The clerk, identified as 40-year-old Michael Downing, was taken to a local hospital. His is currently in stable condition.

An officer said the suspect ran west across Highway 183 and continued into a residential area. A K-9 unit was able to pick up the suspect's scent, the sheriff's office reports, but the man still has not been found.

The suspect was described only as a man dressed in all black, standing between 5-foot-6 and six feet tall.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is assisting in the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Rooks County Sheriff's Office at (785) 425-6312.
