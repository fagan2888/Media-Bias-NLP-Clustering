(LeFevre's story is told in my book Radicals for Capitalism.)\n\nYou might or might not agree with the specific tenets and techniques of the school. They involve:\n\nstudents start with few privileges but gain more and more as they demonstrate commitment and personal responsibility. That little twist from entitlement and punishment to earning and reinforcement rekindles motivation in FMA\u2019s students. The curriculum reinforces this approach by rewarding students\u2019 efforts....When students first arrive, they forfeit their electronic devices....\n\nand:\n\nThe first book they read is Viktor Frankl\u2019s Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, which chronicles Frankl\u2019s struggle to find purpose in his life as an Auschwitz prisoner. Students discuss the book\u2019s theme of suffering and how it relates to their own feelings. At this point they go on their first expedition into the wilderness, where they live off the land for 10 days, learning to work with and rely on one another. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out in the wilderness you really can see how we\u2019re all connected to each other,\u201d said former FMA student Travis Ackerman. \u201cThey teach you how to grow up and take care of yourself. They don\u2019t just teach you to memorize facts but they push you to think of new ways to solve problems,\u201d he said.....\n\nThe level of regimentation they put the kids through isn't something I'd be comfortable with, but then again I don't have \"troubled kids\" (or any). The students also work on the farm connected to the school, which provides most of their own food. The article gives at least some anecdotal evidence that the structure helps some kids who needed self-discipline.\n\nThe quality of the education itself is libertarian-flavored, even if the relationship between the school and its students is not:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t teach political history,\u201d Kevin Cullinane said. \u201cInstead we teach the history of human progress....\" \u201cThe classes don\u2019t just teach you what a public school would teach you. He teaches the truth about things the government might conceal,\u201d [one student] said, noting that class discussions about the Waco siege and the confrontation in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, opened up her mind. But rather than just take his word for it, Mr. Kevin instructs students to do their own research, she said.\n\nBenes draws the lesson that, whether or not the FMA methods are good for everyone, its existence is:\n\nan example of how independent philosophies can be more effective in helping troubled young people than any uniform system or standardized regime. If Cullinane had to follow rules from a higher district or board, he would not have been able to create his unique program. And his students would likely not have found a program that worked for them.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The Freeman has an interesting account of a specialized school for troubled teens&nbsp;called \"Freedom Mountain Academy,\" written by Ross Benes.
