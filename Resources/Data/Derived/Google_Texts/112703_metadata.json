The Chicago rally came ahead of five primary elections on Tuesday, including contests in Ohio and Illinois.\n\nTrump rival, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, cast wide blame for what he called \"third world\" images out of Chicago, from the protesters to the media, with his harshest criticism directed at Trump.\n\n\"This is a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics,\" he said, speaking to reporters before a rally in Pinellas County, Florida.\n\nJohn Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio who is also running for president, told journalists before a campaign event in Cincinnati on Saturday that Trump has created a \"toxic environment\".\n\n\"And that toxic environment has allowed his supporters, and those who seek confrontation, to come together in violence,\" he said. \"There is no place for a national leader to pray on the fears of the people who live in our great country.\"\n\nIn a statement, Republican candidate, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, called the incident \"sad\" and said the protesters should have let the rally happen.\n\nTrump has drawn fervent support as well as criticism for his calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\nHis rallies often attract small groups of protesters, but Friday's was the first at which there may have been as many protesters as supporters.\n\nAsked by CNN interviewer Don Lemon if he would take back anything he had said, Trump said: \"Now, getting back to before tonight, when I talked about illegal immigration, I have no regrets whatsoever.\"\n\n\"If I didn't bring up illegal immigration, it wouldn't even be a subject of the campaign,\" he added.\n\nAt the University of Illinois-Chicago stadium rally the two sides shouted at each other until a Trump staffer appeared and said the event would be put off until an unspecified date for security reasons.\n\nPolice said five people were arrested, including CBS News reporter Sopan Deb. Two officers were injured, with one requiring stitches, police said.\n\nThe cancellation followed an appearance by Trump in St. Louis on Friday during which protests forced him to halt his speech repeatedly.\n\nTrump has a significant lead in primary contests over the three remaining Republicans vying for the White House. He is looking to cement it on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "trump, blame, sanders, chicago", "pubdate": "2016-03-12T13:30:33", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday blamed supporters of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders for protests that shut down his Chicago rally, calling the U.S. senator from Vermont \"our communist friend.\"", "title": "Trump Blames 'Our Communist Friend' Sanders for Chicago Clashes", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/trump-blame-sanders-chicago/2016/03/12/id/718796/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=665aea3e-0fc2-4b90-a1e1-7860ad810d15&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/trump-blame-sanders-chicago/2016/03/12/id/718796/", "description": "Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday blamed supporters of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders for protests that shut down his Chicago rally, calling the U.S. senator from Vermont \"our communist friend.\"", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Trump Blames 'Our Communist Friend' Sanders for Chicago Clashes"}, "epoch": 1457789433, "keywords": "trump, blame, sanders, chicago", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Headline", "published_time": "2016-03-12T13:30:33"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/trump-blame-sanders-chicago/2016/03/12/id/718796/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Trump Blames 'Our Communist Friend' Sanders for Chicago Clashes"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday blamed supporters of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders for protests that shut down his Chicago rally, calling the U.S. senator from Vermont \"our communist friend.\"\nThe Chicago rally came ahead of five primary elections on Tuesday, including contests in Ohio and Illinois.\nEarlier on Saturday Trump called the protesters thugs.\nThe clashes follow a slew of recent incidents of violence at Trump rallies, in which protesters and journalists have been punched, tackled and hustled out of venues, raising concerns about degrading security leading into the Nov. 8 election.\nHe said his own fans \"were taunted, they were harassed by these other people, these other people by the way, some represented Bernie, our communist friend.\""}
