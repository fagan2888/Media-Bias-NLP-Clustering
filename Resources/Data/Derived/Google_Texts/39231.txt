Somehow Mike Huckabee’s “12 Days of Obamacare” has not yet achieved instant-classic status. But that didn’t stop Stephen Colbert from releasing his own slate of Obamacare-themed Christmas carols under the title “Now That’s What I Call Christmas Healthcare Parodies, Vol. One.”

Featuring hits like…

“Hark The Herald Kathleen Sebelius”:

“Obamacare Is Beginning To Look A Lot Like Socialism”:

And “Frosty the Biden”:

Act now, “before another million people sign up for Obamacare,” and you’ll also receive “Jingle Obamacare Dogs.”
