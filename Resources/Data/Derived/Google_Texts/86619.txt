Congressional leaders have reached a tentative consensus on a budget deal that will fund the government through "most of 2016," an agreement that includes tax-limiting measures favored by Republicans but is free of the kinds of hard-line provisions that have pushed legislators and President Obama to and past the brink of shutdowns in recent years. In 2013 a shutdown was triggered by some GOP legislators' demands to defund Obamacare; similar threats were made, but not ultimately pursued, this year over issues such as Planned Parenthood and Syrian refugee admission. From the New York Times:

Throughout Tuesday, major components of the spending legislation appeared to be falling into place, including a tentative agreement to alter major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, delaying a planned tax on high-cost health insurance plans and suspending a tax on medical devices for two years.

(The high-cost health insurance tax that will be delayed is often called the "Cadillac tax.")

On the issue of refugees, the Washington Post says that "new security requirements for a visa waiver program" will be included but that "the legislation does not include new restrictions that would prevent Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the country, a provision House Republicans had pushed to get in the bill."
