A maintenance worker was killed Friday night after falling down an elevator shaft in a downtown parking garage.

The accident happened at 1515 Elm Street, a 10-story garage next to a high-rise condo building. Police said that the man, a 45-year-old Mesquite resident, was working in the mechanical room that is adjacent to the shaft. He fell just after 8 p.m. and paramedics declared him dead at the scene.

It’s not immediately clear what caused him to fall or how many floors he fell. Dallas homicide detectives and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are working together on the investigation.

Dallas police currently list the case as an unexplained death in their records. The worker’s name is being withheld because authorities have not yet been able to reach his family.
