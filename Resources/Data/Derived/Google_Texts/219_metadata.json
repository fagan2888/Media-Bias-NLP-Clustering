Today, however, wearable technologies and QS tools are also used for improving workplace productivity. The toll of chronic diseases on workplace productivity is high, with seven major diseases accounting for a substantial amount of \u201cpresenteeism\u201d \u2014 that is, workers performing less due to the effects of sickness and absenteeism. Depression alone accounts for nearly one third of productivity losses. And one study demonstrated that productivity losses due to chronic diseases amount to over $84 billion annually.\n\nThe growth of wearable computing, tracking, social-network analysis, and data analytics is opening up new ways of addressing both the wellness of employees as well as understanding the underlying social dynamics of any given firm that may also contribute to less stress and better health. These two areas are often treated separately. But their intersection offers the potential to build both healthier and more productive companies if the early generations of programs using these tools can prove their effectiveness and sustainability in the coming years.\n\nKey findings in this report include:\n\nWhile the U.S. Affordable Care Act creates incentives for employers to offer rewards to employees who practice healthy lifestyles, that driver is counterbalanced by inhibitors, including employee privacy concerns, minimal proof of ROI, and a backlash against badly designed behavioral incentives like gamification.\n\nEmployers are finding that wellness plans can suffer from lack of employee engagement, participation, and adherence. They should evaluate the results and potential solutions from programs such as Humana Vitality, Keas, Hubbub, and Jiff.\n\nTracking data on \u201cpeople dynamics\u201d will be a critical addition to employee wellness and productivity. The combination of monitoring internal work networks complements wellness programs to deliver an effective quantified workplace.\n\nThumbnail image courtesy of flickr user Nicola.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Tracking health, wellness, and productivity in the quantified workplace", "application-name": "Gigaom", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-22", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "dcterms.creator": "Jody Ranck", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-01", "keywords": "fitbit, future of work, health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act, humana, incapital, jawbone, misfit, mit media labs, mobile health, moves, nike, quantified-self, runkeeper, social networks, sociometer, sociometric solutions, wearable computing, wellness, withings", "news_keywords": "future of work, jawbone, misfit, mobile health, nike, quantified-self, runkeeper, social networks, wearable computing, withings", "author": "Jody Ranck", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ecebe6", "dcterms.publisher": "Gigaom", "description": "The growth of wearable computing, tracking, social-network analysis, and data analytics can help build both healthier and more productive companies.", "robots": "NOODP", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/themes/go-ossein/library/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "6AFF4FA8C591A576B80A612AF591A343", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-12-01", "og": {"image": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-01-at-1.31.19-PM-680x422.png"}, "dcterms.subject": "fitbit; future of work; health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act; humana; incapital; jawbone; misfit; mit media labs; mobile health; moves; nike; quantified-self; runkeeper; social networks; sociometer; sociometric solutions; wearable computing; wellness; withings", "google-site-verification": "qCPIC6UK_23CR6SxLn2bCjE-Ow0OSYoDExoi699IE98", "y_key": "a09dd3172406080e"}, "article_summary": "1 SummaryThe Quantified Self (QS) is typically a personal approach to tracking data about health, wellness, and daily activities.\nTracking data on \u201cpeople dynamics\u201d will be a critical addition to employee wellness and productivity.\nThe combination of monitoring internal work networks complements wellness programs to deliver an effective quantified workplace.\nToday, however, wearable technologies and QS tools are also used for improving workplace productivity.\nThe toll of chronic diseases on workplace productivity is high, with seven major diseases accounting for a substantial amount of \u201cpresenteeism\u201d \u2014 that is, workers performing less due to the effects of sickness and absenteeism."}
