But it\u2019s supposed to be entertaining and upbeat. I didn\u2019t think the shutdown was entertaining or upbeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in the past, you\u2019ve had a political impact,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cDuring campaigns, you\u2019ve had presidential candidates on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not a political show. It was never meant to be. The fact that you can have a daytime show and do newsworthy subjects\u2014that is what was new,\u201d Walters said. \u201cThe fact that you can have primarily women discussing, arguing, disagreeing, live, that\u2019s what was new about this show.\u201d\n\nWalters also defended new cast member Jenny McCarthy, who came under fire upon joining the show for her widely-discredited views on vaccines.\n\n\u201cI think the criticism about her was unfair, and it was criticism that had to do with her personal views,\u201d Walters said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a subject that we have discussed on The View.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the people\u201d on the show, Walters continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t create them. Did I help to launch them? Yeah, and that makes me feel good. I have always been a big booster of other women. I\u2019ve always worked with otehr women. If I have any legacy, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nWatch the full clip below, via Fox News:\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Upon her last season on the popular daytime talk show The View, Barbara Walters spoke to Media Buzz's Howard Kurtz about her wide-ranging career as a news and", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/walters.jpg", "title": "Barbara Walters Discusses The View\u2019s Political Impact, Defends Jenny McCarthy to Kurtz"}, "twitter": {"description": "Upon her last season on the popular daytime talk show The View, Barbara Walters spoke to Media Buzz's Howard Kurtz about her wide-ranging career as a news and entertainment anchor, the changes to TV-based journalism, and how The View has created a new format for television discussion, especially for both female voices and female viewers.", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/walters.jpg", "title": "Barbara Walters Discusses The View's Political Impact, Defends Jenny McCarthy to Kurtz", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "tv", "date": "2013-11-03T15:47:42+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf87d\"", "article_summary": "I didn\u2019t think the shutdown was entertaining or upbeat.\u201d\u201cBut in the past, you\u2019ve had a political impact,\u201d Kurtz said.\n\u201cI think the criticism about her was unfair, and it was criticism that had to do with her personal views,\u201d Walters said.\nKurtz asked Walters why a show like The View, which has never shied away from political topics in the past, ignored the government shutdown and the drama over Obamacare.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a subject that we have discussed on The View.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the people\u201d on the show, Walters continued.\nThe fact that you can have a daytime show and do newsworthy subjects\u2014that is what was new,\u201d Walters said."}
