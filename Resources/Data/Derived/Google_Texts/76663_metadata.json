It is the final budget for this administration entering a lame duck year.\n\nThe budget reveals some of the administration\u2019s regulatory plans. Curiously, the funding requests for the usual major regulatory priorities (Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and EPA) seem remarkably similar to last year\u2019s budget proposal. The most interesting new funding requests largely center on labor regulations.\n\nLooking at the major regulatory priorities, it seems the administration is looking to cement its already extensive legacy. The only notable thematic request is a call to double funding for SEC and CFTC by 2021. Despite the request to eventually double the funding for SEC and CFTC, this year\u2019s budget appears to be copy-and-pasted text from last year\u2019s proposal:\n\nRegulatory Program FY 2016 Request FY 2017 Request Affordable Care Act \u201cThe Budget fully funds the ongoing implementation of ACA\u2019s health insurance coverage improvements through the operation of Health Insurance Marketplaces and the premium tax credits and cost sharing assistance to help make coverage affordable, drive down long-term health care costs, and improve care for millions of citizens.\u201d \u201cThe Budget fully funds the ongoing implementation of the ACA and makes a number of improvements to the health care system.\u201d Dodd-Frank \u201cThe Budget continues to support Wall Street Reform implementation across agencies, including $1.7 billion for the Securities and Exchange Commission and $322 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), representing increases over the 2015 enacted level of 15 percent and 29 percent, respectively.\u201d \u201cThe Budget\u2019s 2017 down payment toward the five-year doubling target includes $1.8 billion for the SEC and $330 million for the CFTC.\u201d EPA Climate Plan \u201cThe Budget includes $239 million to support EPA efforts to address climate change through commonsense standards, guidelines, and voluntary programs, including $25 million to help States develop their Clean Power Plan strategies.\u201d \u201cThe FY 2017 Budget prioritizes climate action by providing $235 million to support EPA efforts to address climate change through commonsense standards, guidelines and voluntary programs.\u201d\n\nOther notable regulatory requests include:\n\nLabor Regulations: The budget proposal calls for \u201c$1.9 billion in discretionary resources to ensure that DOL\u2019s worker protection agencies can meet their responsibilities to defend the health, safety, wages, working conditions, and retirement security of American workers.\u201d Of that, it dedicates $277 million towards minimum wage enforcement and \u201calmost $1 billion for the Occupational and Mine Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA and MSHA).\u201d\n\nFood Safety: \u201cThe Budget includes $1.6 billion, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, to support FDA and CDC activities that will develop and strengthen an integrated and prevention-based food safety system. The FY 2017 Budget includes $1.5 billion for FDA to support implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act, including increasing state capacity to implement the produce safety rules, implementing the Foreign Supplier Verification Program, and ensuring consumers are able to make healthy food choices.\u201d\n\nTransportation Safety: \u201cIntegrating surface transportation technologies safely into the transportation system with $400 million per year in investment\u2026the FY 2017 Budget requests $295 million for PHMSA, including more than $176 million for pipeline safety and more than $68 million to sustain essential safe and efficient movement of hazardous materials across the country and respond to emerging threats\u2026The Budget requests $213 million to support FRA\u2019s rail safety and development programs, an increase of $14 million from FY 2016 enacted. Funding will support railroads\u2019 implementation and enforcement of PTC, in addition to track and bridge safety activities.\u201d\n\nThis final budget proposal, like so many others, seems to just appeal to progressives. Yet, one can still draw some implications from it: billions in government outlays to fund the formation of rules that will impose billions in costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The budget reveals some of the administration\u2019s regulatory plans.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AAF", "description": "The budget reveals some of the administration\u2019s regulatory plans.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Last Budget: A Look at Remaining Regulatory Priorities - AAF", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/obamas-last-budget-a-look-at-remaining-regulatory-priorities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The budget reveals some of the administration\u2019s regulatory plans.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s Last Budget: A Look at Remaining Regulatory Priorities - AAF"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#323b4d", "robots": "noodp", "theme-color": "#323b4d", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/themes/aaf/images/fav-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "41969DB57D11BA64AEE68EAB043A3E25", "article": {"section": "Budget"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Curiously, the funding requests for the usual major regulatory priorities (Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and EPA) seem remarkably similar to last year\u2019s budget proposal.\nLooking at the major regulatory priorities, it seems the administration is looking to cement its already extensive legacy.\nInsightDan GoldbeckToday, the White House released its budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2017.\nIt is the final budget for this administration entering a lame duck year.\nThe budget reveals some of the administration\u2019s regulatory plans."}
