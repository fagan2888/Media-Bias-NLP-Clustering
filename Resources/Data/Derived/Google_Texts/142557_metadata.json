The RCOs will be managed by local providers, and upon approval by the state will deliver healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries at a fixed cost.Under state law, the RCOs are divided into five regions of Alabama. Eleven local providers have been approved by the state so far to participate, with at least two providers per region. The participants include community hospitals and clinics that will provide primary and specialty care, as well as behavioral health services. They include Centene, Triton, St. Vincent's Health System, and Jackson Hospital.Danne Howard, Alabama Hospital Association executive vice president, applauded the CMS' approval, and added that through RCOs, \u201cMedicaid recipients will receive better coordinated care in a more efficient way, and the state budget will benefit from ongoing efforts to bend the future cost curve.\u201dIn December 2015, the Alabama Hospital Association defended participating RCO hospitals after the state received reports that some hospitals did not follow up with beneficiaries after inpatient stays, a violation of an aspect of the program.Sara Rosenbaum, professor of health policy at George Washington University, said RCO hospitals should be able to implement the program efficiently because they will have insurance risk management in place. She added the RCO model is a \u201cstep forward\u201d for Alabama and will provide a healthy framework for the state if it were to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in the future. More than 650,000 (PDF) of Alabama's one million Medicaid recipients will receive their care through an RCO. The elderly, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, children under 19 and caretakers will receive benefits.The agreement with the CMS begins April 1. Medicaid recipients will choose an RCO by August.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Alabama is moving from the traditional fee-for-service delivery model to a managed-care model under a new regional care organization waiver.", "title": "Alabama moving to managed-care model for Medicaid", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Alabama is moving from the traditional fee-for-service delivery model to a managed-care model under a new regional care organization waiver.", "title": "Alabama moving to managed-care model for Medicaid", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160216/NEWS/160219930", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Alabama is moving from the traditional fee-for-service delivery model to a managed-care model under a new regional care organization waiver.", "title": "Alabama moving to managed-care model for Medicaid", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160216/NEWS/160219930", "published_at": "2016-02-16", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "More than 650,000 (PDF) of Alabama's one million Medicaid recipients will receive their care through an RCO.\nMedicaid recipients will choose an RCO by August.\nThe participants include community hospitals and clinics that will provide primary and specialty care, as well as behavioral health services.\nEleven local providers have been approved by the state so far to participate, with at least two providers per region.\nThe elderly, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, children under 19 and caretakers will receive benefits.The agreement with the CMS begins April 1."}
