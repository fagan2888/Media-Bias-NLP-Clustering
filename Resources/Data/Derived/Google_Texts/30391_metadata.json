Russell Prescott, who topped a list of early supporters for the former Florida governor on the first full day of his official campaign. Prescott said Bush has \u201cthe character, resolve and inner strength to take on this tough challenge.\u201d\n\nHe touted what he considers his conservative credentials, but also tried to show a passionate side and a willingness to reach out to Democrats.\n\nAnswering a question on how to address the financial issues faced by the Social Security and Medicare systems, Bush said his brother, former President George W. Bush, tried to address it and \u201cgot totally wiped out. Both Republicans and Democrats were against it. The next president is going to have to try again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the environment we have today where the political partisanship is just so poisonous, we have to re-weave a web of civility,\u201d Bush said.\n\n\u201cI have deep disagreements with liberal Democrats and their policies, but I don\u2019t\u2019 assume that they have bad motives. That kind of puts me like in a different place, apparently, in the political world today. I don\u2019t\u2019 assume bad motives of people. I just disagree with them.\u201d\n\nBush was asked why Republicans are so often accused of providing tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\n\u201cI do think that our tax code is rife with exemptions that wealthier people take more advantage of,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut many of those tax revisions have been authored and supported by Democrats, not necessarily Republicans.\u201d\n\nHe called for a simpler tax code, and \u201cnot have the government be the arbiter of what line you get into to get your benefit. The best way to sustain growth is for the government to take a step back, to simplify the tax code.\u201d\n\nHe said he is working on an \u201cintellectually honest\u201d tax code revision proposal \u201cthat will be part of a high growth strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will lower rates, eliminate as many exemptions as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had reform in our tax code since 1986. It created big time economic growth, and it helped us balance the budget.\u201d\n\nBush said Republicans should not shy away from a pro-growth philosophy based on cutting government spending, and he insisted such an approach can win over voters who have not in the past supported GOP candidates.\n\nThe crowd that attended his announcement in Miami, was \u201ca different kind of crowd,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was reflective of the diversity of the state (Florida), because they know that I care because I was a governor who cared.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe progressive agenda may sound good, and it\u2019s alluring, but now we see what it looks like, and it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Bush said. He called for a \u201cdifferent approach and then go campaign in places where Republicans haven\u2019t been seen for a while.\u201d\n\nBush opposed a suggestion that tax credits be given for campaign contributions. He said the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case made it difficult to replace the current system. He called instead for the ability for candidates to receive unlimited contributions as long as there is \u201ctotal transparency.\u201d\n\nHe said it is unlikely a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United will be passed.\n\n\n\nFiscal restraint can be brought to Washington, he said, in the same way that he brought \u201ceight years of consistent belief in limiting government and personal responsibility\u201d to Florida from 1999 to 2007.\n\nHe said the U.S. economy can, and should, grow at the rate of 4 percent a year, which, he said, would result in \u201chigh wage jobs for people who have not gotten a raise in a long, long while. We would lift people out of poverty, and we would no longer be as pessimistic as a nation as we are today.\u201d\n\nHe said he created a \u201chigh growth strategy\u201d as governor, creating 1.3 million jobs in eight years.\n\n\u201cWho is going to be the president who will make it possible to grow at 4 percent a year over the next decade?\u201d Bush asked. \u201cI believe I have the skills from experience, from trial and error, from taking incoming along the way, from being a governor that had to balance budgets eight years in a row, who had to make people upset once in a while and make a decision and not hide behind the collectiveness of the legislative body.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t file an amendment and call that success,\u201d Bush said, in a veiled reference to the lawmakers who are also running for the GOP presidential nomination. \u201cI actually did things as governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time to stop talking about things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of people who are really good at talking. Much better than me. It\u2019s time for someone to be president to fix a few big things so that this nation takes off.\u201d\n\nBush called for more choices for veterans, \u201cso you could go, whether you have a clinic or a hospital in your vicinity, to take advantage of it.\n\nHe also called for a changes in the secondary and higher education to better match graduates to existing job opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe ought to have more choices in high school as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with someone getting a college degree that will make them more college-ready or career ready. The skills they require are both the same.\u201d\n\nBush called for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act with a program that does not include employer or employee mandates. He called the ACA \u201cthe number one thing that suppresses job growth and take home pay.\u201d\n\nBush hugged a special needs woman in the audience, saying that in Florida, \u201cWe took one of the worst programs for the developmentally disabled and made it one of the best.\u201d\n\nCaring for the disabled and the needy \u201cis not a value we should shy away from as Republicans.\u201d\n\nOverseas, he said, the U.S. needs a clear strategy to defeat Islamic terrorist groups, such as the Islamic State group (ISIS).\n\n\u201cThis president has said two times in the past year that we don\u2019t have a strategy,\u201d said Bush. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\nHe said the approach should be, \u201cCreate a strategy, and, second, be all in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while, but take them out,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to Bush\u2019s announcement and appearance in the Granite State, New Hampshire Democratic Party spokesman Raymond Buckley said, \u201cJeb Bush is back in New Hampshire trying to convince us he has something new to say. He doesn\u2019t. Over the past month we\u2019ve seen him try to figure out what his position is on Iraq, changing his mind seemingly every day. We\u2019ve seen him defend his book that supports shaming single mothers. We\u2019ve seen him try out the same failed policies of the past, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s where Jeb Bush is stuck. Jeb Bush isn\u2019t interested in leveling the playing field for Granite Staters. He\u2019s out to do what he\u2019s done his whole career, put himself and people like him over everyday Granite Staters.\u201d\n\nAfter the event, Bush headed to Iowa and then will go to the other early voting states, South Carolina and Nevada. New Hampshire is viewed as key to chances of winning the GOP presidential nomination because Granite State Republicans have often favored candidates viewed as appealing to the party establishment.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 18:45:11 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Jeb Bush, a converted Catholic, said at a town hall meeting on Tuesday that while Pope Francis is a \u201cmost extraordinary leader,\u201d he would be better off staying out of the debate over climate change.", "title": "Bush: Pope should stay out of climate change debate", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/bush-pope-should-stay-out-of-climate-change-debate/33616376", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/33616600/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/ct8tdiz/-/JebBushDerry-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/bush-pope-should-stay-out-of-climate-change-debate/33616376", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/33616376", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/33616376", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/33616376"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/33616376", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/33616376", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/bush-pope-should-stay-out-of-climate-change-debate/33616376"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Jeb Buish, NH Primary", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JohnDiStasoWMUR"}, "news_keywords": "Jeb Buish, NH Primary", "description": "Jeb Bush, a converted Catholic, said at a town hall meeting on Tuesday that while Pope Francis is a \u201cmost extraordinary leader,\u201d he would be better off staying out of the debate over climate change."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda162\"", "article_summary": "New Hampshire is viewed as key to chances of winning the GOP presidential nomination because Granite State Republicans have often favored candidates viewed as appealing to the party establishment.\nJeb Bush, a converted Catholic, said at a town hall meeting on Tuesday that while Pope Francis is a \u201cmost extraordinary leader,\u201d he would be better off staying out of the debate over climate change.\n\u201cI do think that our tax code is rife with exemptions that wealthier people take more advantage of,\u201d Bush said.\n\u201cThis president has said two times in the past year that we don\u2019t have a strategy,\u201d said Bush.\nWe\u2019ve seen him try out the same failed policies of the past, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s where Jeb Bush is stuck."}
