She is now an anti-nuclear-proliferation activist and espionage novelist, as well as the author of the bestseller \u201cFair Game,\u201d which was turned into a major motion picture.\n\nChris Pavone, a longtime New York City book editor, never had a thing to do with the CIA until his wife got a job in Luxembourg, at which point he, too, began writing spy novels. His first two books, \u201cThe Expats\u201d and \u201cThe Accident,\u201d were both New York Times bestsellers, and \u201cThe Travelers\u201d has just published. Here they discuss the challenges of writing espionage fiction and being a real spy versus a fake one.\n\nFirst things first, something I worry about constantly: When you read espionage novels written by amateurs like me, what mistakes do we make that drive you absolutely crazy?\n\nChris, you\u2019re doing a hell of a good job for being an \u201camateur\u201d \u2014 lots of bestsellers! But, to your question, there are no \u201clone wolves\u201d in the CIA. A successful ops officer is part of a highly skilled team: analysts, targeting officers, surveillance, tech geniuses. I know having a Jason Bourne all alone in a field firing at bad guys is much more dramatic, but it\u2019s not real. Second, hate to burst your bubble, but the CIA is expressly prohibited from political assassinations per the 1979 Executive Order 11905. That said, use of drones certainly kills \u2014 intended targets as well as unintended civilians. Finally, a pet peeve is overreliance on guns. Again, very visual but not much intelligence gets collected when there is a gun in the room. Am I correct that there are no guns in \u201cThe Travelers\u201d?\n\nYes. The only time a gun is mentioned is when the protagonist \u2014 just recruited to be an intelligence asset \u2014 asks his new handler when he\u2019ll be getting a weapon, and she tells him never, there are already too many guns in the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them. That\u2019s also the way I feel about it, both in real life and in fiction: there are too many guns where they don\u2019t belong. I\u2019m gratified to know that real-world intelligence gathering is relatively firearms-free. Speaking of the real world, do CIA officers have book clubs? Do you all cycle through the same authors, sit around in Beirut and Prague, passing paperbacks back and forth? Are some authors well known for their verisimilitude?\n\nIf there is a book club, I wasn\u2019t asked to join it \u2026 I feel left out. I think CIA officers particularly like John Le Carr\u00e9 for the existential dread he is able to convey in his gray world. Of course, we all watch James Bond with envy \u2014 knowing the U.S. government would never pay for the lifestyle he enjoys.\n\nA few years ago, I was signing books at Shakespeare and Co. in Paris when an American man handed me his State Department business card. He was in Paris on a special delegation, lived mostly in Washington, invited me to contact him with any questions. Was this guy with the CIA?\n\nMaybe. Or a kook. The world is full of them. Didn\u2019t you call him?\n\nNo, I never did. When I returned home after that long book tour across America and Europe, I was already well past the research stage on a new project, and I really just wanted to sit down and write. I also wanted to stay in New York with my wife and children; I was the parent who was supposed to be at school pickup every day. A few years ago, one my kids wanted to read my first book, and I allowed it. But I thought my second novel was a bit too racy, so I forbid it, temporarily. Your kids are a bit older than mine. What\u2019s your policy? And when you\u2019re writing, do you ever consider what your children will think of the book?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In conversation about spy novels with Chris Pavone, she says \"gender bias is built into the system\" at the CIA", "title": "Valerie Plame has one regret: \u201cI wish I had the maturity and courage to have pushed back more\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In conversation about spy novels with Chris Pavone, she says \"gender bias is built into the system\" at the CIA", "title": "Valerie Plame has one regret: \u201cI wish I had the maturity and courage to have pushed back more\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/09/valerie_plame_has_one_regret_i_wish_i_had_the_maturity_and_courage_to_have_pushed_back_more/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/plame_pavone.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In conversation about spy novels with Chris Pavone, she says \"gender bias is built into the system\" at the CIA", "title": "Valerie Plame has one regret: \u201cI wish I had the maturity and courage to have pushed back more\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/plame_pavone.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Pavone and Valerie Plame", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, bush administration, Chris Pavone, CIA, David Foster Wallace, Editor's Picks, Government, John Le Carre, Valerie Plame, Writers on writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Speaking of the real world, do CIA officers have book clubs?\nI think CIA officers particularly like John Le Carr\u00e9 for the existential dread he is able to convey in his gray world.\nHere they discuss the challenges of writing espionage fiction and being a real spy versus a fake one.\nHis first two books, \u201cThe Expats\u201d and \u201cThe Accident,\u201d were both New York Times bestsellers, and \u201cThe Travelers\u201d has just published.\nSecond, hate to burst your bubble, but the CIA is expressly prohibited from political assassinations per the 1979 Executive Order 11905."}
