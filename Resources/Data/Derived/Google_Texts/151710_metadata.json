One group of dancers sang their own soundtrack, as another followed a faint beat from laptop speakers. A performer whipped out a neon vest, and his squad, clad in gold spandex, followed him into the room. In one corner, a flutist practiced; in another, a host\u2019s turquoise dress was wrapped slowly around her. Two masters of ceremonies practiced their routine. \u201cIt\u2019s three hours of overly done clich\u00e9s about South Asia,\u201d one quipped. \u201cWell, when you put it that way, this is a Bollywood movie,\u201d shouted the other.\n\nThe scenes on Thursday were from the opening night of Ghungroo, a celebration of South Asian dance, music, and heritage \u2014 and the largest student-run production on campus.\n\nFor audience members, Ghungroo means flashing colors and a soundtrack that integrates the stylings of Bhangra with Rihanna. But with 400 undergraduates involved, the performances, which ran through Saturday, also are a tremendous feat of coordination. Ghungroo is the only show on campus too big for the building in which it is held \u2014 only 110 performers fit in the Horner Room \u2014 so a flurry of coordinators with microphones must shepherd groups from holding area to holding area as they prepare to take the stage.\n\nAcross the street in the basement of the First Church in Cambridge, performers in later acts arrived, changed, and warmed up. There, Vinay Iyengar \u201918 had set up a live feed from the theater to coordinate when the next mass of dancers should be shepherded across Mason Street to Agassiz. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a conveyer belt from here to the two rooms inside the Ag,\u201d he said, both harried and exhilarated by the buzzing microphone and the green-gold costumes flying by.\n\nThe coordination begins long before opening night. The South Asian Association books the theater, paints the set, recruits choreographers, assembles programs, auditions and orders the acts. This year, with 300 applications, the association selected 150 dancers to appear in everything from \u201cDandiya Raas,\u201d a folk dance from Gujarat, India, to \u201cFusion,\u201d which the program bills as \u201cChicken Tikka Masala \u2014 not quite purely found in South Asia, but a sumptuous meal that leaves you ready for more.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing in the cultural mix that defines Ghungroo, it\u2019s the senior dance. A rite of passage for some, a bucket-list item for most, the number lasts for 25 minutes. It includes nine sections and 140 participants, many of whom have never danced before in college productions, and even more of whom have never studied the South Asian-inspired stylings featured in Ghungroo. The only qualifications are zeal and proficiency with online sign-ups.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not technique-oriented,\u201d explained Radhika Rastogi \u201915, the dance director. \u201cWe\u2019re not out to impress the audience. It\u2019s always more about energy and enthusiasm.\u201d Her main concern \u2015 moving dancers on- and offstage without anyone falling from the platform \u2014 did nothing to displace her joyous grin. Indeed, it was hard to spot a single case of backstage nerves in any of the holding areas. Ghungroo, a choreographer said, is a performance for performers, not the audience, and the euphoria of that shows.\n\nAudience members are not left behind, though, particularly when it comes to seniors. Opening night is also \u201csenior night,\u201d and a section of Agassiz was reserved for the Class of 2015. It was wasted effort, though. Seating and tickets became increasingly flexible as the night progressed. At first, a few performers lurked behind the balcony seats to watch their friends. By the end of the night, a constant stream of seniors and dancers surged in and out to catch their roommates and friends in action. A venue manager recounted how last year she had barred 12 seniors sneaking in, only to catch them trying to sprint up the stairs when she looked away. She gave up when they slipped in a third time.\n\nBack in the Horner Room, the energy of the senior dance was picking up, the conveyer belt running full-throttle. Sets of jingling dancers returned from the stage, squealing delightedly, just as new groups arrived from the church. Underclassmen had to depart at this point; there simply was not enough room for everyone. Someone peeked in to blow his friend a kiss. A student in athletic shorts followed; after a workout, he\u2019d arrived two hours late to catch the last 15 minutes of the show. \u201cThis is what I came here for,\u201d someone said. \u201cThis is the most important part of my night.\u201d\n\nTwo leaders stood on a riser with signs hushing the backstage performers and announcing the next section to go on, but their written words carried little conviction. Venue managers had joined the whooping seniors in the balcony, and the strict coordination deteriorated as the night came to a close. After three hours of manning the conveyer belt, the directors were ready for flashing colors and Bhangra-Rihanna. They need not have worried; no one seemed to be falling off the stage.\n\nColton Valentine \u201916 is a literature concentrator.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#99283c", "news_keywords": "Agassiz Theatre, Colton Valentine, Ghungroo, South Asian Association, Student Voice,", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Gazette", "description": "The Harvard South Asian Association\u2019s annual arts showcase, called Ghungroo, is a complex coordinated production that draws hundreds of student performers and delighted classmates in the audience.", "title": "The spectacle of Ghungroo", "url": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/03/the-spectacle-of-ghungroo/", "image": "http://media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/022615_Ghungroo_060_605_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harvard", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harvard"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Harvard Gazette", "robots": "all", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": 593072576, "page_id": 105930651606, "app_id": 135898969862440}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/themes/gazette20/a/i/appletouch.gif", "keywords": "Agassiz Theatre, Colton Valentine, Ghungroo, South Asian Association, Student Voice,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "description": "South Asian Association\u2019s annual arts showcase is a complex production, with hundreds of student performers | The Harvard South Asian Association\u2019s annual arts showcase, called Ghungroo, is a complex coordinated production that draws hundreds of student performers and delighted classmates in the audience."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca767\"", "article_summary": "Opening night is also \u201csenior night,\u201d and a section of Agassiz was reserved for the Class of 2015.\nThe scenes on Thursday were from the opening night of Ghungroo, a celebration of South Asian dance, music, and heritage \u2014 and the largest student-run production on campus.\nFor audience members, Ghungroo means flashing colors and a soundtrack that integrates the stylings of Bhangra with Rihanna.\nGhungroo, a choreographer said, is a performance for performers, not the audience, and the euphoria of that shows.\nBack in the Horner Room, the energy of the senior dance was picking up, the conveyer belt running full-throttle."}
