Say what? Cn we say desperation?\n\nThis reveals the crack in the dam against which no finger of a little boy will suffice to hold back the tide of angry Americans who have finally been liberated from the chains of GOP party enslavement by Donald Trump because they now know they have constantly been betrayed by the party for the past twenty or more years, most certainly the last eight, and want no more of it. The party\u2019s breaking up on the rocks and shoals of their own deception and incompetence.\n\nMr. Hayes, whether he acknowledges it or not, spoke clearly on behalf of the RNC, as an anti-Trump\u2019r, who cannot believe what he is witnessing, the loss of the party\u2019s authority over its minions, and their money. Oh, the thought is too horrible to bear! Interestingly, his comment opened a crack in the door allowing us to peek into the party\u2019s meltdown and view its desperation over events they no longer control but of their own making. Is a divorce eminent? Of course it is. It\u2019s already started. The party\u2019s over!\n\nAfter the recent five north-east states primary delegate selection, that Trump swept in all categories, Newt Gingrich told the party it was time to accept the Trump phenomena because his nomination is now a done deal and anything that remotely had GOP fingerprints on it as altering the course of what conservatives voters want, i.e.: Trump, and a new course for America, will be the kiss of death for the GOP. They know this, that\u2019s why the third party nonsense. This happened before in our early history to the \u201cBull Moose\u201d party and the \u201cCopperheads\u201d but, they weren\u2019t the main parties and all but died at birth.\n\nThe \u201celite,\u201d \u201cestablishment,\u201d career,\u201d GOP politicians, however you wish to identify them, have demonstrated a gross mismanagement of conservative politics by abandoning the principles upon which conservatism was originally founded and, instead, joined hands with the corrupt Progressives (democrats) in gleefully looting the treasury. It continues to this day. What could be a grosser violation of the public trust than a vote for the Omnibus Spending Bill? Nothing else matters. Only America\u2019s survival, as America, matters and yet the GOP have failed us.\n\nNow, at election time, we must listen to the varied excuses of our failed politicians tell us why they thought it necessary to abandon their public trust, spend money we don\u2019t have, further our country\u2019s path to financial Armageddon, while hoping, nay, pleading that we return them to office because they now see the light and they\u2019re really good guy\u2019s.\n\nTrump started the ball rolling. This election provides a great opportunity to continue the changes in our political representation. Nine of our GOP representatives (from Georgia) voted for the Omnibus Spending Bill. They did so because, like Obamacare, it was thrust upon them without discussion or time to read it and just a day or two before it had to be voted on. They opted to \u201cgo along.\u201d That\u2019s not the way to spend the peoples money. That\u2019s not why they\u2019re there. They made a bad decision and must pay for it. None of these people are entitled to keep their jobs. They have to earn them to keep \u2018em. I haven\u2019t seen that happening, have you? So now do your duty and throw the bums out.\n\nRemember, freedom is the goal, the Constitution is the way. Now go get \u2018em!, (27 April 2016)", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "w8ZeLIpWJAqhs8H4YoLdSztNwsCyC5trtddKrRKDxJ8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": ": Trump, and a new course for America, will be the kiss of death for the GOP.\nThe party\u2019s breaking up on the rocks and shoals of their own deception and incompetence.\nNine of our GOP representatives (from Georgia) voted for the Omnibus Spending Bill.\nOnly America\u2019s survival, as America, matters and yet the GOP have failed us.\nInterestingly, his comment opened a crack in the door allowing us to peek into the party\u2019s meltdown and view its desperation over events they no longer control but of their own making."}
