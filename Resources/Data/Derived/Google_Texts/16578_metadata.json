WADE\n\nArizona has a bill that would force docs to claim abortions can be reversed\u2014just one of the lies they have to tell pregnant women.\n\nIf the bill sitting on Republican Governor Doug Ducey desk is signed today, doctors in Arizona will be required to tell a patient receiving a medical abortion that she can change her mind, even after the abortion is underway.\n\nIt\u2019s the first reversal language of its kind to make it through a state legislature, and should it become law, will join a long list of information that doctors in The Grand Canyon State are forced to relay to patients seeking an abortion\u2014much of which providers know to be misleading and aimed less at informed consent and more at dissuading women from choosing the procedure.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, women in 17 states must be counseled on points that are wholly unsupported by the medical and scientific community at large, like the link between abortion and breast cancer (five states), fetal pain (12 states), or long-term mental health risks from abortion like depression and suicide for women (eight states).\n\nThe provision in Arizona\u2019s SB 1318 states that at least 24 hours before a woman takes Mifepristone\u2014the first of two medications taken to complete a medical abortion\u2014a doctor must inform a patient \u201corally and in person\u201d that \u201cit may be possible to reverse the effects of a medication abortion if the woman changes her mind but that time is of the essence.\u201d\n\nThe clause was added to what was initially just a ban for abortion coverage through the Affordable Care Act, after testimony from Dr. Allan Sawyer, a pro-life advocate and obstetrician practicing in Glendale, Arizona. Dr. Sawyer testified before the legislature that he had personally reversed a woman\u2019s abortion by administering a high dosage of the hormone Progesterone. Sawyer stated then, as he has before, that women undergoing the elective procedure of abortion \u201cdo not understand the true nature of the risks\u201d and \u201coften change their minds.\u201d\n\nWith bill sponsor Senator Nancy Barto, Phoenix Republican, smiling in agreement behind him, Sawyer told a House panel this month, \u201cabortion is not health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen who have initiated a medical abortion process and who change their minds for whatever reason should not have their babies stolen from them because Planned Parenthood or any abortionist withheld life-saving facts or withheld information,\u201d he said.\n\nOne committee member asked whether in addition to his anecdote, there existed any medical research to back up his claim or any studies testing the safety of Progesterone for the mother and fetus when the drug is used to reverse the effects of Mifepristone.\n\n\u201cThese studies are ongoing,\u201d Sawyer replied. \u201cThose numbers are being tallied.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of scientific support, the measure passed both chambers.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d said Dr. Anne Davis, an abortion provider in New York and advocate with Physicians for Reproductive Health, who also noted Dr. Sawyer\u2019s anecdote on the Progesterone reversal was misleading, as about half of women who take only the first pill, but skip the second\u2014a dose of Misoprostol which causes the uterus to contract\u2014will continue to be pregnant anyway.\n\n\u201cWe have a mountain of good scientific evidence showing us how to practice the best way [to perform an abortion] and we\u2019re told that legally we can\u2019t provide the best care we know how to,\u201d Davis said, pointing at another 2014 Arizona law blocked by the Supreme Court that restricted the off-label use of RU-486, a law that would sidestep medical research and innovation made in the 14 years since the medication was approved.\n\n\u201cAnd on the other hand we are being forced to tell patients about a treatment that is untested, unproven, for something that addresses a created need,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf you had told me 10 years ago people would have to practice like this I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u201d\n\nDr. Leah Torres is an OB-Gyn in Salt Lake City, and outspoken critic of the anti-abortion movement. Torres said the waiting periods, the forced ultrasounds, and the undermining and unproven state-mandated counseling that abortion providers must read to their patients, convey two things: Pregnant people are stupid and doctors who perform this procedure can\u2019t be trusted.\n\nTorres practices in Utah, a state where 97 percent of Utah\u2019s counties are without an abortion clinic and patients must wait 72 hours (the longest period in the nation) after mandated counseling before their doctors can perform the procedure. Physicians there must inform abortion patients about what state legislators have determined are the procedure\u2019s mental and physical health risks.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

That\u2019s very disturbing for me to have to say, and I have to follow it up with \u2018This does not exist.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be confusing for the patient.\u201d\n\nThat jarring experience, she said, is specific to doctors who provide abortion.\n\n\u201cNo one has to go through state-mandated information for a colonoscopy. No one has to go through state-mandated information for a prostate removal surgery. No one has to go through state-mandated information for breast augmentation. None of these other procedures require a physician to read inaccurate information to their patients. It doesn\u2019t happen anywhere else in medicine,\u201d she said.\n\nShould the Arizona bill become law, the American Civil Liberties Union will be among the groups opposing its enactment. \u201cWe are fighting this bill as we are fighting all abortions restrictions that inappropriately interfere with women\u2019s access to safe, legal health care,\u201d said Hayley Smith, an advocacy and policy associate with the ACLU.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "BrandyZadrozny"}, "keywords": "abortion, U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201503270925, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/us-news", "description": "Arizona has a bill that would force docs to claim abortions can be reversed\u2014just one of the lies they have to tell pregnant women.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Abortion Lies Doctors Are Forced to Tell", "tags": "entity:medicaltreatment/abortion,topic:us-news", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Abortion Lies Doctors Are Forced to Tell\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/27/abortion-lies-doctors-are-forced-to-tell.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/abortion-lies-doctors-are-forced-to-tell/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47581532.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/abortion-lies-doctors-are-forced-to-tell\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-27T09:25:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. News\",\"author\":\"Brandy Zadrozny\",\"tags\":[\"abortion\",\"us-news\"]}", "news_keywords": "abortion, US News", "sectionTaxanomies": "us-news", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Brandy Zadrozny", "article": {"section": "us-news", "published_time": "2015-03-27T09:25:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/brandy-zadroznyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/abortion-lies-doctors-are-forced-to-tell", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Arizona has a bill that would force docs to claim abortions can be reversed\u2014just one of the lies they have to tell pregnant women.", "title": "Abortion Lies Doctors Are Forced to Tell", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/27/abortion-lies-doctors-are-forced-to-tell.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/abortion-lies-doctors-are-forced-to-tell/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1427445987413.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/brandy-zadrozny", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c46\"", "article_summary": "Physicians there must inform abortion patients about what state legislators have determined are the procedure\u2019s mental and physical health risks.\nIf the bill sitting on Republican Governor Doug Ducey desk is signed today, doctors in Arizona will be required to tell a patient receiving a medical abortion that she can change her mind, even after the abortion is underway.\nROE V.
