Splash News: Dick Van Dyke says he is Scared for his life if United States attacks Syria. The Hollywood legend was leaving The 32nd Annual Malibu Kiwanis Chili Cook-Off, Carnival and Fair Sept 1, 2013 in Malibu, CA, United States. His wish is for Congress to vote No on the proposal from President Obama because he thinks that if United States attacks Syria, then Iran will attack Israel and hence creating World War 3. And that the Majority of the Arab nations will retaliate against USA and its Allies.
