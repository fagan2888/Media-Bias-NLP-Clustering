Wimmer.\n\nLung cancer causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths in America. It kills 150,000 people a year. The survival rate for lung cancer is lower than for any other common cancers, such as breast, colon and prostate.\n\n\u201cStudies have clearly shown that individuals at high risk for lung cancer should receive this low-dose CT scan every year because it can help catch lung cancer in the earliest stages,\u201d said Dr. Peter Sachs, associate professor of radiology at the University of Colorado Hospital.\n\nThe hospital is now offering screening for early-stage lung cancer to high-risk patients referred by their physicians who have no personal history of lung cancer.\n\nMedicare proposes requiring facilities performing CT scans to submit initial screen findings, follow-up and the patient\u2019s ultimate health outcomes.\n\nRadiologists serving Medicare patients must have significant experience in reading CT scans for possible lung cancer and the radiology imaging centers must have significant experience in advanced diagnostic imaging.\n\nMany private insurance plans already pay for lung cancer screening.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Dose", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services this week announced a proposal to cover an annual low-dose CT scan for Medicare beneficiaries at high risk for developing lung cancer.", "title": "Medicare proposes coverage of annual CT scan for people at high risk for lung cancer", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/11/14/lung-cancer/4630/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/11/smoking-495x407.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services this week announced a proposal to cover an annual low-dose CT scan for Medicare beneficiaries at high risk for developing lung cancer.", "title": "Medicare proposes coverage of annual CT scan for people at high risk for lung cancer", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/11/14/lung-cancer/4630/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/11/smoking-495x407.jpg", "creator": "@electadraper", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "American Lung Association,CT scan,lung cancer,University of Colorado Hospital"}, "article_summary": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services this week announced a proposal to cover an annual low-dose CT scan for Medicare beneficiaries at high risk for developing lung cancer.\nThe hospital is now offering screening for early-stage lung cancer to high-risk patients referred by their physicians who have no personal history of lung cancer.\nMany private insurance plans already pay for lung cancer screening.\nLung cancer causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths in America.\nThe survival rate for lung cancer is lower than for any other common cancers, such as breast, colon and prostate."}
