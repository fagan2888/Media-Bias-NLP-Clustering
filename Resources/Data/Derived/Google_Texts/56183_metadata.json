Volunteer rescuers aboard a nearby boat hoisted a banner that read: \"Ferries for safe passage, not for deportation.\"\n\nEach migrant was accompanied on Lesbos by a plainclothes Frontex officer. They had been transported in a nighttime operation from the island's holding center to the port. Greek riot police squads also boarded the boats.\n\nMoncure said there were plans to return migrants from the nearby island of Chios as well but did not say when.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and rights groups have said the deal between the European Union and Turkey lacks legal safeguards.\n\nAmnesty International has called it \"a historic blow to human rights\", and was sending monitors to Lesbos and Chios on Monday.\n\nMore than 3,300 migrants and refugees are on Lesbos. About 2,600 people are held at the Moria center, a sprawling complex of prefabricated containers, 600 more than its stated capacity. Of those, 2,000 have made asylum claims, UNHCR said.\n\n(Editing by Nick Tattersall; Editing by Tom Heneghan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DIKILI, Turkey/LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Migrants sent back from the Greek island of", "title": "Migrants sent back from Greece arrive in Turkey under EU deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Two-boats-returning-migrants-Greece-Turkey-set-sail-Lesbos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-greece-returns_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Two-boats-returning-migrants-Greece-Turkey-set-sail-Lesbos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-greece-returns_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "DIKILI, Turkey/LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Migrants sent back from the Greek island of", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DIKILI, Turkey/LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Migrants sent back from the Greek island of Lesbos began arriving in Turkey on Monday under a European Union deal aimed at stopping the influx of migrants and refugees into Europe since last year.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and rights groups have said the deal between the European Union and Turkey lacks legal safeguards.\nUnder the EU-Turkey deal, Ankara will take back all migrants and refugees who enter Greece illegally, including Syrians, in return for the EU taking in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey and rewarding it with more money, early visa-free travel and progress in its EU membership negotiations.\nMoncure said there were plans to return migrants from the nearby island of Chios as well but did not say when.\nMore than 3,300 migrants and refugees are on Lesbos."}
