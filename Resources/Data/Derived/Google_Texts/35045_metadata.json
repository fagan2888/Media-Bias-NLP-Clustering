Last week, the actress who played her, Shannen Doherty, revealed she had breast cancer and alleged that the cancer spread undetected when her managers failed to renew her health insurance policy.\n\nDoherty, 44, is suing her manager, Tanner Mainstain Glynn & Johnson, TMZ first reported. She alleges that the firm ignored an invoice for the premium in 2014, and that she couldn\u2019t re-enroll in coverage until 2015. In the suit, Doherty said she didn\u2019t visit the doctor regularly while she was uninsured and thus her breast cancer wasn\u2019t caught until it had become invasive, TMZ reported.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Randall Dean, an attorney for Tanner Mainstain, wished Doherty a full recovery but said, \u201cThe claim that Tanner Mainstain caused her to be uninsured, prevented her from seeking medical care, or somehow contributed to her cancer is patently false. Tanner Mainstain will aggressively defend all of Ms. Doherty\u2019s claims in court.\u201d\n\nWhatever the circumstances, finding yourself suddenly uninsured is scary, whether you\u2019re a Hollywood actress or an average Jane. Experts say Doherty\u2019s celebrity might have worked against her in this case\u2014if she didn\u2019t handle her own correspondence and was indeed in danger of being dropped, she might have missed warnings from the carrier to that effect.\n\nInsurance carriers generally offer patients a grace period before dropping them from their rosters. Under the Affordable Care Act\u2014otherwise known as Obamacare\u2014patients who have paid at least one month\u2019s full premium for the year and who receive premium subsidies have a 90-day grace period for nonpayment of insurance premiums.\n\nDoherty did not have Obamacare\u2014she reportedly had coverage through SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union. Yet her policy likely offered some grace period, which would have allowed her to maintain her coverage and pay her premium if the alleged lapse had come to her attention in time.\n\nWorkers with group health coverage through their employer typically won\u2019t need to worry about losing their coverage for nonpayment, since employees\u2019 share of the premium payment is deducted from their paychecks. But those on the individual insurance market\u2014or those who lose their job-based coverage\u2014should know their options if they find themselves uninsured:\n\nCheck out special enrollment periods\n\nFor 2016 coverage, Obamacare open enrollment runs from Nov. 1 2015 through Jan. 31, 2016. During this time, people with coverage through their state Obamacare marketplace can switch plans or enroll for the first time in a plan.\n\nThose who want to enroll in coverage or change their plan outside this period must qualify for a special enrollment period. Eligibility criteria include major life changes such as marriage, the birth of a child, and moving.\n\nLosing job-based insurance can also qualify you for a special enrollment period. Losses include if your employer stops offering coverage, if you leave your job by choice, get laid off or fired, or if you lose coverage through divorce.\n\nOn the other hand, losing coverage for nonpayment of premium will not qualify you for a special enrollment period, nor will voluntarily dropping coverage before the end of your policy\u2019s plan year.\n\nConsider a short-term policy\n\nBrian W. Liechty, an independent insurance agent in Plymouth, Ind., doesn\u2019t see many clients lose their coverage through nonpayment of premium. But if a client somehow becomes uninsured and doesn\u2019t qualify for a special enrollment period, he always recommends a short-term policy.\n\nShort-term health plans can generally be bought in one-month increments up to a maximum of 12 months. Short-term premiums are lower than those for major medical coverage: an average of $110 a month for individual coverage and $262 monthly for family coverage, versus $286 and $727, respectively, for major medical policies, according to eHealth, parent company of brokerage company eHealth.com.\n\nThese plans come with some big caveats. Unlike major medical plans\u2014which since 2014 can no longer discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions\u2014most short-term plans are still underwritten. That means that applicants can be denied for having chronic conditions such as Type II diabetes or cancer. (If these conditions are diagnosed when the policy is in effect, however, treatment costs will generally be covered for the duration of the policy.) Applicants on prescription drugs will usually face more scrutiny during the application process, and not all short-term plans offer drug benefits, said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth.\n\nBecause of these coverage limitations, short-term insurance generally does not fulfill the Affordable Care Act provision that requires most Americans have health insurance. That means those who buy it will still face a penalty at tax time for being uninsured.\n\nDespite these caveats, a short-term policy is better than no policy for those who find themselves in a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to be a stop-gap,\u201d Liechty said.\n\nWork with the doctor\u2019s office\n\nWe\u2019re used to negotiating at the used car lot or the garage sale, but not at the doctor\u2019s office. Yet we should change our mentality, experts say. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any office that\u2019s not willing to set up payment plans,\u201d said Laura Palmer, a senior fellow at MGMA, the largest membership association for medical practice managers in the U.S.\n\nThose who are uninsured should tell their doctor\u2019s billing office upfront, either when they book the appointment or when they arrive at the office, Palmer said. Some offices offer \u201cprompt-pay\u201d discounts if patients pay at the time of service, and many will offer to stretch a big payment out over time.\n\nSuch payment arrangements aren\u2019t just for the uninsured. As high-deductible plans become more common, many patients are responsible for paying thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs each year before their insurance coverage kicks in, and they can also benefit from making a deal at the doctor\u2019s.\n\nBartering for doctor\u2019s services might not be standard practice, but Palmer heard of a case where a patient bartered security monitoring for his rural orthopedist\u2019s services. Someone short of funds with a skill that a doctor\u2019s practice might need\u2014such as IT, landscaping or marketing\u2014could give it a try, Palmer said.\n\nThose who receive a devastating diagnosis while uninsured should seek out the patient advocate at their hospital, Palmer said. That person will be aware of community resources, such as clinics where treatment is free or discounted.\n\nBecause the Affordable Care Act banned major medical carriers from discriminating on the basis of pre-existing conditions, a sick patient will be able to sign up for coverage during the next open enrollment period.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Grace periods and short-term policies are among the tools available", "creator": "@elizobrien", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DT178_uninsu_ZG_20150827130416.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Elizabeth O'Brien", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Grace periods and short-term policies are among the tools available", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-cope-when-youre-suddenly-uninsured-2015-08-27", "author": "Elizabeth O'Brien", "parsely-title": "How to cope when you\u2019re suddenly uninsured", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-27T13:06:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Grace periods and short-term policies are among the tools available", "title": "How to cope when you\u2019re suddenly uninsured", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-cope-when-youre-suddenly-uninsured-2015-08-27", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DT178_uninsu_ZG_20150827130416.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DT178_uninsu_ZG_20150827130416.jpg"}, "article.id": "4EAF622A-4C15-11E5-9208-60125047CA27", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda83f\"", "article_summary": "Tanner Mainstain will aggressively defend all of Ms. Doherty\u2019s claims in court.\u201dWhatever the circumstances, finding yourself suddenly uninsured is scary, whether you\u2019re a Hollywood actress or an average Jane.\nBut if a client somehow becomes uninsured and doesn\u2019t qualify for a special enrollment period, he always recommends a short-term policy.\nThose who want to enroll in coverage or change their plan outside this period must qualify for a special enrollment period.\nBecause of these coverage limitations, short-term insurance generally does not fulfill the Affordable Care Act provision that requires most Americans have health insurance.\nUnlike major medical plans\u2014which since 2014 can no longer discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions\u2014most short-term plans are still underwritten."}
