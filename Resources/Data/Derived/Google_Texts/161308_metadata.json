But consumer advocates and health policy experts say the groups\u2019 proposed solution doesn\u2019t adequately protect consumers.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, plans generally can\u2019t charge higher co-payments for out-of-network emergency departments. So if the plan charges a flat co-payment of $500, for example, or co-insurance totaling 30 percent of the cost of services for an emergency department visit at an in-network hospital, it can\u2019t charge more than that rate if patients get emergency services at an out-of-network facility. The only plans that are exempt from this provision are those that have grandfathered status under the law.\n\nHowever, the law doesn\u2019t prohibit doctors and hospitals from \u201cbalance billing\u201d consumers for out-of-network emergency care if their insurers don\u2019t pay the full amount charged. That practice is what really harms consumers, say advocates.\n\n\u201cOur main interest is getting the consumers out of the middle,\u201d said Chuck Bell, programs director at Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group that has been involved in state efforts to prohibit balance billing. \u201cEven if (the federal government) had written the regulation the way (emergency physicians) advocate, we would likely see balance bills going to consumers.\u201d\n\nEmergency services providers say they are in a tough spot because federal law requires them to treat anyone who comes through their doors, whether or not they have insurance or can afford to pay.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: When health plans contract with physicians to be part of a provider network, the doctors agree to accept a certain amount for their services as payment in full. But if doctors or other providers don\u2019t have a contract with the patient\u2019s insurer, they are not bound to accept only the insurer\u2019s reimbursement and may bill patients for unpaid balances.\n\nThe health law doesn\u2019t change that. Rather, it says that insurers must pay a \u201creasonable amount\u201d before a patient can be billed for the rest. The new federal rule, released in November, defines \u201creasonable\u201d as the greatest of these three options:\n\n\u2014The median amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service.\n\n\u2014An amount calculated using the same method the plan would generally pay for other out-of-network services.\n\n\u2014The amount paid for the service by Medicare.\n\nThe final regulation was not significantly different from the standards spelled out in the interim regulation that was issued in 2010 after the ACA passed.\n\nThe American College of Emergency Physicians and the Emergency Department Practice Management Association maintain that the regulation\u2019s first two options allow insurers to essentially pay whatever they want because their payment data is proprietary. Medicare reimbursement rates are generally lower than those of private plans.\n\nWithout a transparent, objective standard in place, the emergency-care providers say, insurers will pay them less and providers may in turn try to collect unpaid balances from consumers, unless they live in one of the dozen or so states that prohibit balance billing by out-of-network providers.\n\n(EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\nInsurers have already been reducing their payments to emergency physicians for out-of-network services since the interim rule was released, said Dr. Jeffrey Bettinger, who heads ACEP\u2019S task force on alternative payment models. For example, two insurers have reduced out-of-network payments to emergency physicians by $600 million annually, Bettinger said.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\nThe emergency physicians want the payment standard to be \u201cusual and customary charges,\u201d adjusted for geographic variations, using a transparent, independent claims database such as that provided by the nonprofit group Fair Health.\n\nInsurers, however, say providers\u2019 charges are too high and the process by which they are set is often opaque. A study last fall by America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, used Fair Health data to examine the charges billed by out-of-network providers in 2013 and 2014 and compared them to the average fees paid by Medicare in 2014. Analyzing 1.16 million emergency department visits of high severity, the insurers\u2019 group found the average Medicare payment was $176, while the average out-of-network charge was significantly higher \u2013\u2013 $971.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to the prices emergency doctors are charging, which are often far higher than what Medicare pays,\u201d said Clare Krusing, an AHIP spokeswoman. \u201cSo the question really is, \u2018Are these fair prices in the first place?\u2019\u201d\n\n(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)\n\nKrusing said insurers aren\u2019t suggesting that Medicare be used as the benchmark, but that average charges for many services are excessive.\n\nConsumer advocates, such as Bell, and some researchers who have studied consumers\u2019 billing issues, say the government could take a more consumer-friendly approach by eliminating balance billing for emergency care altogether. New York did that with a law that took effect in April. Under that law, insured consumers generally can\u2019t be billed for out-of-network emergency care. (The law doesn\u2019t apply to employers that pay their workers\u2019 claims directly.) The law also sets up a dispute resolution process for insurers and providers to determine payments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s promising what New York did, because they extract the consumer so they can\u2019t be used as leverage between the providers and insurers,\u201d said Kevin Lucia, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, who co-authored a study examining state efforts to protect consumers from balance billing.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Health, Michelle Andrews", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "Two organizations warn that a new federal rule could lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for patients who need emergency care outside their health plan\u2019s network.", "title": "ER doctors say federal rules could raise patients\u2019 out-of-network bills", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/health/2015-12-27/er-doctors-say-federal-rules-could-raise-patients%E2%80%99-out-network-bills", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/hospital_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "Under the Affordable Care Act, plans generally can\u2019t charge higher co-payments for out-of-network emergency departments.\n\u2014An amount calculated using the same method the plan would generally pay for other out-of-network services.\nInsurers, however, say providers\u2019 charges are too high and the process by which they are set is often opaque.\nHowever, the law doesn\u2019t prohibit doctors and hospitals from \u201cbalance billing\u201d consumers for out-of-network emergency care if their insurers don\u2019t pay the full amount charged.\nThat practice is what really harms consumers, say advocates."}
