Britain’s National Health Service has been derided in the United States as the future of Obamacare and the government-run health service in England is about to get another international black eye due to a scathing new report issued by the London Telegraph.

According to the newspaper, a whistleblower alleges that a British hospital routinely locks up elderly and vulnerable patients to their beds and confining them to their rooms when they get upset that the understaffed medical facility doesn’t help them walk the hallways or go outside.

John Marchant, the former head of security at Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, told the newspaper that staff routinely does this when patients are being a “nuisance.”

“In many cases we are talking about patients known as ‘bed blockers’, elderly people unable to return home or with no residential care unit to go to,” Marchant said. “In these cases detention is being used simply because the patient become so frustrated at not even being able to go out for a walk in the hospital grounds because there are no staff to accompany them.”

“Some would go back to their rooms if you asked them, but others would have to be closed in and it would be very distressing for them,” he added.
