(KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nTo sell policies next year on the health law\u2019s exchanges, also called marketplaces, insurers must apply within the next few weeks and get state approval this summer.\n\nThis KHN story also ran in USA Today . It can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nTwo counties in southwest Florida \u2014 Lee and Collier \u2014 will be most affected. With UnitedHealthcare\u2019s departure, the 80,000 consumers in those counties could be left with only one option: plans offered by Florida Blue, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield company. Two counties in Oklahoma \u2014 Oklahoma and Tulsa \u2014 which had about 60,000 enrolled on exchanges this year, could be left with only the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma, the Kaiser analysis found.\n\nLynne Thorp, regional director of the Health Planning Council of Southwest Florida, which helps consumers enroll in plans, said the impact depends on how Florida Blue handles its monopoly. While most enrollees get subsidies that keep their monthly premium low, many are concerned about possible increases in copayments and other cost-sharing on physician visits and drugs. Florida Blue offered the plans with the lowest premiums in the region last year.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely there are concerns with United leaving,\u201d said Andrea Stephenson, executive director of Health Council of Southeast Florida, which also assists consumers with enrollment. \u201cHaving another big carrier pull out of the market will be a real challenge,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Florida Blue has a strong reputation, her group did hear complaints that the insurer did not offer enough choice of specialists. Without having a company compete against Florida Blue for exchange customers, Stephenson worries those networks could remain tight or get even narrower. If customers can\u2019t find a robust choice of doctors, they may decide to remain uninsured. \u201cEven with the individual mandate, the value proposition has to be there,\u201d she said.\n\nUnitedHealth Group cited escalating losses on the Obamacare plans \u2014 $475 million in 2015 and $650 million expected this year \u2014 as a reason the company planned to quit most marketplaces. United operated in 34 states this year but has committed to staying only in New York, Virginia and Nevada for 2017. United\u2019s independent subsidiary, Harken Health, is expected to continue operating in Atlanta and Chicago.\n\nSo far, UnitedHealthcare is the only large carrier to announce it was quitting the marketplaces in multiple states.\n\nWhile UnitedHealth is the nation\u2019s largest health insurer overall, most of its business historically has not been in the individual market, which the exchanges serve.\n\nJodi Ray, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families, which has the largest federal navigator contractor in the state to conduct enrollment assistance, played down the impact of UnitedHealthcare leaving. \u201cUnited is not a low-premium issuer \u2026 and most consumers are price driven,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers will adjust accordingly no matter who the issuer is.\u201d\n\nDenise Cyzman, executive director of the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, said UnitedHealthcare will be missed even though it only had about 10 percent of marketplace enrollees. She said she hopes another carrier comes in to give the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan some competition. \u201cIt\u2019s good for consumers to have choice,\u201d she said.\n\nKansas Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer is meeting with companies to try to entice one into the marketplace, a spokesman said.\n\nHaving just one insurer left in counties near Winston-Salem and Wilmington is concerning, said Sorien Schmidt, North Carolina director for Enroll America, but she\u2019s confident another player will step in. She said marketplace enrollment was still strong last year even after the Blue Cross plan raised rates an average of 32 percent. But she said the more companies in the marketplace, the better chance to drive down premiums and get the word out about options under the health law.\n\nIn Florida, Thorp said, the biggest challenge is still educating people that many can get government assistance to buy coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s still surprising how many people we find who don\u2019t know that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida and Oklahoma counties are among the hardest hit by UnitedHealthcare's pullout from health law exchanges.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Kaiser Health News", "description": "Florida and Oklahoma counties are among the hardest hit by UnitedHealthcare\u2019s pullout from health law exchanges.", "title": "United\u2019s Departure From Marketplaces Could Impact Consumers\u2019 Costs, Access", "url": "http://khn.org/news/uniteds-departure-from-marketplaces-could-impact-consumers-costs-access/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/unitedhealthcare-hq_770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/unitedhealthcare-hq_770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@khnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@khnews"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Kaiser Health News", "google-site-verification": "El-hccfbhMd9lv-h8wAfp8Qu5KhqI8hjJMi1-CefIoQ", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-04-26T09:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T12:48:06+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khn.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Without having a company compete against Florida Blue for exchange customers, Stephenson worries those networks could remain tight or get even narrower.\nWhile Florida Blue has a strong reputation, her group did hear complaints that the insurer did not offer enough choice of specialists.\nWith UnitedHealthcare\u2019s departure, the 80,000 consumers in those counties could be left with only one option: plans offered by Florida Blue, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield company.\nLynne Thorp, regional director of the Health Planning Council of Southwest Florida, which helps consumers enroll in plans, said the impact depends on how Florida Blue handles its monopoly.\nFlorida Blue offered the plans with the lowest premiums in the region last year."}
