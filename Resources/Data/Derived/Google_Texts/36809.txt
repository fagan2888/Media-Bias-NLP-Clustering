On Tuesday, January 28, please join me and the D.C.-based staff of Reason at a party for former Reason Editor Virginia Postrel’s new book, The Power of Glamour: Longing and the Art of Visual Persuasion.

Virginia’s latest work is a meditation on how our perception of glamour shapes our culture, determines the choices we make, and reveals our inner-selves. The book is an entertaining romp, analyzing the deeper significance of the glamorous people and places that have shaped the last century of American culture.

The Power of Glamour will be available for sale and signing by Virginia, a columnist for Bloomberg View who has been called "a master D.J. who sequences the latest riffs from the hard sciences, the social sciences, business, and technology, to name only a few sources."

We're also welcoming the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) to Washington, D.C., as the group sets up its first office in the Capital City (conspiracy theorists, please note that Postrel is on FIRE's board of trustees).

FIRE’s President Greg Lukianoff, whose own great book Unlearning Liberty: Campus Censorship and the End of American Debate is coming out in paperback, will outline the group’s goals in D.C.

Light snacks, wine, beer, and soft drinks will be served.

What: Happy Hour with Virginia Postrel, FIRE, & Reason When: Tuesday, January 28th from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM Where: Reason DC headquarters, 1747 Connecticut Ave. NW (map)
