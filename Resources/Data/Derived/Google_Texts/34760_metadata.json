Scott Walker, appearing on the Sean Hannity radio show, turned up his criticism of Republican Congressional leaders for their lack of progress on any issue front. \u201cAmericans, especially Republican voters, are frustrated and upset with Washington,\u201d Walker said. \u201cMy wife and I are just as frustrated.\u201d\n\nIn a new twist in his campaign pitch, Walker pointed out to Hannity that he had to take on his own Republican party establishment when he first took office. To pass his ambitious agenda, Walker had to overcome the complaints of long-time Republican legislators who were hesitant to push reforms.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe interview shows that Walker\u2019s campaign is absorbing the latest polling data. Beneath the super-nova that is the Donald Trump campaign, candidates are moving in the polls based on their relative distance from Republican leadership in Washington.\n\nThe candidates doing best in the polls, beyond Trump, are Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Walker and Ted Cruz. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a late entry into the race, is gaining strength, but his rise likely has more to do with his tenure as a successful Governor of a swing state than any nuance in his policy positions. Although he was been in politics for decades, Kasich has a very non-politician, authentic demeanor.\n\nAs Walker discussed American\u2019s frustration with Washington, he barely mentioned President Obama. Instead, he criticized the changing goal-lines of Republicans in Congress, saying first they needed the House, then the Senate to affect real change.\n\n\u201cOkay, they have the Senate now,\u201d Walker said, \u201cand the Iran deal is about to go through.\u201d He continued the critique of Republican leadership, \u201cThere is no excuse why Washington can\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood or get rid of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nWalker noted that he defunded Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin, a state that \u201chadn\u2019t gone Republican for President since 1984.\u201d\n\nThe interview with Hannity, and the list of Walker\u2019s accomplishments in the purple state of Wisconsin was a reminder of what makes him a formidable candidate. He seems to understand that any problems in Washington are partly the fault of Republicans in Congress. Walker stressed several times that Republicans in Washington need to \u201cfight.\u201d\n\nFor Walker, the interview with Hannity ought to preview a different approach in the upcoming debate on September 16th. Walker has an impressive record, but underwhelmed in the first debate.\n\nThere is a very weird disconnect between Walker\u2019s record and governing philosophy with the candidate who often appears on stage. He seems to shrink into the background and look more like a very adept candidate for state and local office rather than the federal and world stage.\n\nIf the Walker in the interview, with the groundbreaking record as Governor, can make an appearance in the next debate, he too will be able to tap into the anger that is dominating the early primary race.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Americans, especially Republican voters, are frustrated and upset with Washington,\" Scott Walker said. \"My wife and I are just as frustrated.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "\"Americans, especially Republican voters, are frustrated and upset with Washington,\" Scott Walker said. \"My wife and I are just as frustrated.\"", "title": "Scott Walker: Republican Voters Frustrated, Upset With Washington - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Walker-Getty1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/14/scott-walker-republican-voters-frustrated-upset-with-washington/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Americans, especially Republican voters, are frustrated and upset with Washington,\" Scott Walker said. \"My wife and I are just as frustrated.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Walker-Getty1.jpg", "title": "Scott Walker: Republican Voters Frustrated, Upset With Washington - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,Scott Walker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-08-14T06:57:32-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8058\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAmericans, especially Republican voters, are frustrated and upset with Washington,\u201d Walker said.\nScott Walker, appearing on the Sean Hannity radio show, turned up his criticism of Republican Congressional leaders for their lack of progress on any issue front.\nThere is a very weird disconnect between Walker\u2019s record and governing philosophy with the candidate who often appears on stage.\nWalker stressed several times that Republicans in Washington need to \u201cfight.\u201dFor Walker, the interview with Hannity ought to preview a different approach in the upcoming debate on September 16th.\nTo pass his ambitious agenda, Walker had to overcome the complaints of long-time Republican legislators who were hesitant to push reforms."}
