Pete has stood firmly against Obamacare and he was a successful leader in removing Nancy Pelosi from power. Folks in the district know this very well and are appreciative of his conservative leadership that gets results.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The tea party group FreedomWorks showcased Katrina Pierson on Monday along with other challengers for House and Senate seats around the country.\n\nMatt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks PAC, called her \u201cone of the best activists in Texas who has been working overtime trying to help Pete Sessions find his way back home.\u201d\n\nSessions, R-Dallas, a member of the House GOP leadership, is seeking a 10th two-year term. He has raised $1.3 million compared to Pierson\u2019s $76,000. Neither she nor FreedomWorks officials would specify the support\u2014funding or volunteers \u2014the group and its affiliates is providing to her. Time is running low, with the primary looming in 22 days.\n\nPierson expressed frustration that Sessions has kept a low profile, avoiding joint appearances (other than a joint meeting with this newspaper\u2019s editorial board last month).\n\n\u201cFor someone who is such a `strong conservative, man of the people, he should defend himself and tell people why I\u2019m wrong, and he won\u2019t do that,\u201d she said.\n\nPierson singled out Obamacare as her top issue and accused Sessions of not working hard enough to block it at the outset or to repeal it in the last three years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been shifty. The Obamacare situation has been a perpetual shift,\u201d she said, asserting that while Sessions championed repeal during the 2010 elections, \u201che didn\u2019t really actively engage\u201d by taking the case to the public in the way that Sen. Ted Cruz did last summer.\n\n\u201cThey sat in Washington, DC, with the bureaucrats and kicked the can down the road,\u201d she said, accusing Sessions of seeking \u201cBand-Aids\u201d rather than full repeal.\n\n\u201cAt what point are we going to say that this lawlessness has to stop. We are essentially running this country ad hoc. There are zero checks and balances,\u201d she said. \u201cObamacare should be the tool that we use moving forward to govern all policy considering how, not only does it affects our debt, it affects the Constitution and it affects the citizens, considering how my state finds the amnesty discussion to be pretty darn important, and the simple fact that these folks are exempt from any of these fees is going to cause a humungous burden on our state even further.\u201d\n\nFreedomWorks invited reporters to its headquarters near the U.S. Capitol to meet with several House candidates and two Senate candidates, including Matt Bevin, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMi9waWVyc29uLWNhbGxzLXNlc3Npb25zLXNoaWZ0eS1vbi1vYmFtYWNhcmUuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
