WASHINGTON – Rep. Pete Sessions, chairing a House hearing on Wednesday, assured a Democratic colleague that Republicans aren’t trying to repeal Obamacare anymore.

Some Democrats apparently missed the humor.

Sessions’ comments came during a hearing of the powerful Rules Committee. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., a big fan of Obamacare, was testifying against a bill to require notification when consumers’ privacy is breached – part of a new GOP tactic to chip away at the health care law.

“I’m not as unhappy as I have been in the past, because at least you’re not trying to repeal the whole bill,” Pallone said.

The chairman shot back, “Bah humbug, those days are past us, Mr. Pallone.”

The delivery was deadpan. It seemed pretty clear Sessions was kidding, though you can judge for yourself. The hearing video is here. Scroll to the 21 minute mark for the relevant exchange.

Afterward, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi issuing a taunting statement that juxtaposed Sessions’ remarks with comments from other GOP leaders reaffirming their commitment to repeal.

“Has the GOP leadership finally come to its senses and decided to stop trying to undermine the patient protections and budget savings in the Affordable Care Act? For the sake of the American people, we hope so,” her statement said.

Sessions spokeswoman Torrie Miller said it should have been obvious he was joking.

“In case Chairman Sessions’ sarcastic comment (i.e. – bah humbug!) was misunderstood as a policy shift, let there be no doubt – he supports a full repeal of ObamaCare,” she said.

Sessions, a 17-year House veteran, faces a challenge in the March primary from tea party activist Katrina Pierson.
