Police used pepper balls to arrest a man early Monday who they say refused to get out of a car reported stolen in Claremore.

Officers checking on a car parked in the 6400 block of East Admiral at about 1 a.m. found Blake Settlemires, 23, slumped over the steering wheel. After finding out the car was stolen, they asked him to step out.

When Settlemires refused to show his hands, officers fired pepper balls through the back window. After arresting him, officers searched the car and found a bayonet under the driver's seat.

Police booked Blake Settlemires into the Tulsa County jail on complaints of possession of a stolen vehicle and interfering with a police officer as well as several outstanding warrants. Jail records show he has a court hearing set for December 21.
