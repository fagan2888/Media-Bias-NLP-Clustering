(Photo: SUBMITTED IMAGE)\n\nIt\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas around Salisbury, especially with the return of the Winter Wonderland of Lights at the Salisbury City Park.\n\nMore than a dozen light displays will light up the night, with some recognizable Christmas characters and some local flair thrown into the mix.\n\nSanta, snowmen and Christmas trees are mainstays of the display, but red, yellow and white lights will also illuminate the Maryland flag accompanied by the cherished Wicomico Woody.\n\nWoody also has a new friend this year in a light-up display of Sammy the Sea Gull. Together the tandem of birds, along with the other light displays, aim to put a smile on the faces of community members and infect them with the ever-contagious holiday spirit.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cool is you can drive by any time and see the lights and walk through the park,\u201d Winter Wonderland of Lights committee chairwoman Kim Hudson said. \u201cPeople are very appreciative, and when the lights go away sometimes they don\u2019t know how much they enjoyed them until they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nThe lights will be on display from Saturday, Nov. 28, to Jan. 1, and the committee is having a lighting ceremony Saturday to kick it all off.\n\nThe ceremony begins at 5 p.m., and Santa Claus will be in attendance along with Q105 doing a live broadcast on site.\n\nOne lucky child will have a chance to get their name drawn to help turn on the lights at about 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cJust come and enjoy the holiday spirit and be a part of your community,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those events that just warms your heart, and kids are always so excited to see the lights.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/2015/11/22/city-park-winter-wonderland/76236106/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "More than a dozen light displays will light up the Salisbury City Park before Christmas.", "og": {"site_name": "Delmarva Daily Times", "description": "More than a dozen light displays will light up the Salisbury City Park before Christmas.", "title": "Walk in a Winter Wonderland at City Park", "url": "http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/2015/11/22/city-park-winter-wonderland/76236106/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delmarvanow.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than a dozen light displays will light up the Salisbury City Park before Christmas.", "title": "Walk in a Winter Wonderland at City Park", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/22/Salisbury/B9319813948Z.1_20151122200135_000_G64CKTG2G.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "site": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858745131", "fb": {"app_id": 179822335370394}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "walking in a winter wonderland, winter wonderland, salisbury city park"}, "article_summary": "Santa Claus will of course be part of the fun when Winter Wonderland once again lights up the Salisbury City Park.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cool is you can drive by any time and see the lights and walk through the park,\u201d Winter Wonderland of Lights committee chairwoman Kim Hudson said.\n(Photo: SUBMITTED IMAGE)It\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas around Salisbury, especially with the return of the Winter Wonderland of Lights at the Salisbury City Park.\nMore than a dozen light displays will light up the night, with some recognizable Christmas characters and some local flair thrown into the mix.\nThe ceremony begins at 5 p.m., and Santa Claus will be in attendance along with Q105 doing a live broadcast on site."}
