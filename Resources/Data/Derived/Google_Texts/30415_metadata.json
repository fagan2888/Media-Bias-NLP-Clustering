The state finished with about 1.2 million people enrolled in private healthcare plans after a surge of applicants in March and April.\n\nThe state still has a long way to go to reach its overall goal of 1.7 million enrolled by Feb. 15, when the sign-up period ends.\n\nMore immediately, existing policyholders face a Monday deadline if they want to change coverage for Jan. 1.\n\nFor most consumers, existing policies will be automatically renewed if they do nothing. However, exchange officials are urging people to shop around because their premiums may be going up and their network of doctors and hospitals might be changing.\n\nLee said the state won't release details on renewals and how many people switched healthcare plans until next month.\n\nAs expected, Lee said, there have been some bumps in the road as people try to make changes to their coverage.\n\nConsumers and insurance agents have complained about long wait times with the state's call center and technical problems with online enrollment.\n\n\"I would not say it's been a glitch-free renewal process,\" Lee said on a conference call Wednesday. \"But by and large, this process is going smoothly.\"\n\nMedi-Cal has encountered its own service issues as more than 2 million people joined the program this year as part of the healthcare law expansion.\n\nEnrollment is open year round for Medi-Cal, which has 11 million enrolled overall.\n\nOne of the biggest problems has been a backlog of applications, leaving thousands of people waiting months to get coverage confirmed. In May, the number of bottlenecked applications hit 900,000.\n\nToby Douglas, director of the state Department of Health Care Services, said Wednesday that the backlog has been reduced to less than 100,000. He also said about 75% of the latest applicants have been immediately cleared for coverage.\n\n\"We have been making significant progress on the pending cases,\" he said.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "New Obamacare enrollment in California nears 49,000", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's insurance exchange said 48,950 new people signed up for Obamacare coverage during the first three weeks of open enrollment.", "title": "New Obamacare enrollment in California nears 49,000", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-california-enrollment-20141210-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5488953e/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-california-enrollment-20141210", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california, medi-cal", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82247022", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-10", "Description": "California's insurance exchange said 48,950 new people signed up for Obamacare coverage during the first three weeks of open enrollment.
