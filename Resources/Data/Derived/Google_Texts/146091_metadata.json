The health system dramatically improved its financial performance, turnover rates and employee morale, saving $240 million and increasing profits more than 1,200 percent.\n\nThe case study examines the techniques Van Gorder used to turn his health system around, including:\n\nFilling the information gap. Scripps provided its leaders and employees with transparent and comprehensive information so they could see and understand why decisions were made.\n\nPartnering with physicians. Van Gorder created a Physician Leadership Cabinet that had a say in recommendations to the board about strategy and other issues. This let the board work with physicians rather than against them.\n\nDeveloping leaders. Van Gorder implemented the Scripps Leadership Academy, which met monthly, allowed middle managers to ask questions about any topic, and fostered an environment of responsibility, authority on issues and accountability, according to the report.\n\nInvesting in human capital. Van Gorder insisted there would be no layoffs--instead he repurposed and positioned people to do a job that better suited their individual skills. That made hiring more selective and based on the needs of the organization.\n\nImplementing a horizontal management structure. Van Gorder moved the COOs at each hospital to the corporate level and gave them responsibilities for services across the system, which resulted in savings through standardization practices. \"Our operating margin right now is around $300 million. Had we not created the horizontal structure and taken out this non-value added variation, we would be at a point where we don't have an operating margin,\" Van Gorder said.\n\nThe American College of Healthcare Executives awarded Van Gorder the Gold Medal Award for excellence in healthcare leadership at this year's ACHE conference in Chicago, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report (membership required)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nACHE Congress: Leaders must innovate and adapt to changing healthcare industry\n\nHealthcare execs forced to cut operating budgets\n\nHospital executives can lead transparency movement\n\n3 healthcare leader strategies", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Governance Institute released a new multimedia\u00a0case study\u00a0analyzing the leadership decisions Chris Van Gorder made during his 14 years as CEO of\u00a0Scripps Health\u00a0in San Diego--and how they helped save the struggling system.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Governance Institute released a new multimedia\u00a0case study\u00a0analyzing the leadership decisions Chris Van Gorder made during his 14 years as CEO of\u00a0Scripps Health\u00a0in San Diego--and how they helped save the struggling system.", "title": "How Chris Van Gorder turned Scripps Health around", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-chris-van-gorder-turned-scripps-health-around/2014-06-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Chris Van Gorder,hospital culture,hospital leadership,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,physician engagement,Scripps Health", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd656b\"", "article_summary": "The case study examines the techniques Van Gorder used to turn his health system around, including:Filling the information gap.\nVan Gorder insisted there would be no layoffs--instead he repurposed and positioned people to do a job that better suited their individual skills.\nVan Gorder implemented culture-changing strategies within the system to engage physicians and middle management and operate it as an integrated system.\nVan Gorder created a Physician Leadership Cabinet that had a say in recommendations to the board about strategy and other issues.\nThe American College of Healthcare Executives awarded Van Gorder the Gold Medal Award for excellence in healthcare leadership at this year's ACHE conference in Chicago, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
