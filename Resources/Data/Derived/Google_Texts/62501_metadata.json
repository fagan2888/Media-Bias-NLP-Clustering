A grant to the Oregon Health and Science University examined the effect of ethanol on the singing ability of Zebra finches. Apparently birds start slurring a bit after they\u2019ve had a few drinks. Who\u2019d have guessed?\n\n*The Agriculture Department is giving a number of vineyards, breweries and distilleries about $3.5 million in grants designed to boost business in rural areas, but McCain concluded that they \u201cdo little to stimulate growth anywhere except the awardee\u2019s bank account.\u201d He highlights one company in Michigan that used the money to build tasting rooms, even though the enterprise already had one capable of hosting 100 people.\n\nRelated: Monkeys Running on Treadmills: Hairy Tales of Government Waste\n\n* The Pentagon handed over roughly $1.1 million to a researcher to conduct MRIs of dogs, ostensibly to glean some kind of insight into the human brain. After training and scanning a dozen dogs, the researcher found scientific reaction to his efforts were \u201ckind of dismissive\u201d and concluded that \u201cdogs are people, too.\u201d\n\n* The National Science Foundation gave more than $872,000 to University of Iowa researchers to study how children cross the street. The results concluded that children tend to take greater risks when crossing the street compared to adults -- \u201csomething generations of American parents already knew,\u201d according to McCain\u2019s report.\n\n* The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded Filmmakers Collaborative $600,000 to oversee the \u201cproduction of a two-hour film on the life and work of Walt Disney that focuses on his innovations as an entertainment entrepreneur and his relationship to crucial 20th Century events.\u201d Just in case anyone needed a reminder?\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Paid Millions to Pro Sports Teams for Military Tributes\n\n* The Education Department doled out $5,000 to the University of Hawaii to fund research of a book on Hello Kitty. McCain\u2019s report cites a summary of the book that says the author credits the Japanese icon\u2019s popularity to the \u201c\u2018the blankness of her design\u2019\u2026 People see the possibility of a range of expressions. You can give her a guitar, you can put her on stage, you can portray her as is. That blankness gives her an appeal to so many types of people.\u201d\n\n* The Education Department also spent over $2.2 million to send text messages to high school students to remind them to enroll in college courses.\n\n* The National Endowment for the Arts awarded a $25,000 grant to the Denmark Arts Center in Denmark, Maine, to support \u201cSomething Rotten, an artist residency program that takes local artists to area landfills to inspire them to make works from trash.\n\n* In 2014, the Army National Guard spent $13,500 for soldiers to play bubble soccer. The contests in 30-pound plastic orbs were supposed to get enlisted soldiers in Wisconsin ready for basic training with minimal risk. This at a time when the Badger State\u2019s Guard was experiencing a $101 million budget shortfall and had to delay some drill weekends, McCain notes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "John McCain has released the first government wastebook of 2016.", "title": "From Drunk Birds to Trash Art: McCain Finds Billions in Government Waste", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/07/Drunk-Birds-Trash-Art-McCain-Finds-Billions-Government-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/07/Drunk-Birds-Trash-Art-McCain-Finds-Billions-Government-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "John McCain has released the first government wastebook of 2016.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Here are some examples of what McCain and his staff dug up:* The National Institutes of Health spent $51,000 to study drunk birds.\n* In 2014, the Army National Guard spent $13,500 for soldiers to play bubble soccer.\nThis at a time when the Badger State\u2019s Guard was experiencing a $101 million budget shortfall and had to delay some drill weekends, McCain notes.\nThe contests in 30-pound plastic orbs were supposed to get enlisted soldiers in Wisconsin ready for basic training with minimal risk.\nA grant to the Oregon Health and Science University examined the effect of ethanol on the singing ability of Zebra finches."}
