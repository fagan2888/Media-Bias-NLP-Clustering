Rogers finished the night with four runs allowed, three earned, on five hits, a walk, and four strikeouts.\n\nKevin Kaczmarski got the parade going by beating out an infield single to short with one out. The Fireflies second baseman Vinny Siena followed with a walk. After a flyout to left, David Thompson jumped on the fastball to deep left giving the Fireflies the three run advantage early.\n\nRogers did find his groove allowing just 2 hits through the next 3 innings, but was lifted giving way to Claudio Custodio, who made his first appearance of the season. Custodio lasted just an inning, giving up a run on two hits, a walk, and a wild pitch.\n\nDavid Palladino toed the rubber for Charleston entering in the seventh and that was the only inning of work he would see. The 6\u20198\u201d 235 pounder suffered control problems rendering two wild pitches, two walks, a hit-by-pitch, and two hits, leading to three Columbia runs to make it 8-0.\n\nColumbia\u2019s starter, Thomas McIlraith was dialed in from the start, facing only one over the minimum through the sixth.\n\nIn the top of the fifth a couple of miscues got the best of the RiverDogs. With one out, Kaczmarski stroked a single into right field, but Jhalan Jackson couldn\u2019t quite get a handle of the ball, which allowed Kaczmarski to advance to second on the error. On the ensuing pitch, Charleston\u2019s catcher Radley Haddad had one spit off of the mitt to the backstop, moving Kaczmarski to third on a passed ball. Siena then lifted one to right for a sacrifice fly, pushing the fourth run (unearned) across for the Fireflies, Kaczmarski\u2019s second run scored of the game.\n\nThe Fireflies pushed their fifth run over home plate in the top of the sixth on fielder\u2019s choice groundout to second by Milton Ramos.\n\nAgain Columbia would buzz home plate, this time for three runs in the seventh. Eight fireflies hitters came to bat in the inning, with three of them scoring on only two hits. Palladino couldn\u2019t find his rhythm from the get go. Columbia got the inning going with a leadoff double to left off the bat of Kaczmarski, followed by a passed ball to put the runner on third, a walk issued to Siena, and a hit by pitch of Dash Winningham. After an RBI ground out to second from Thompson, a strike out of Jeff Diehl, and an RBI single from Joe Tuschak, Palladino issued the second walk of the inning before getting out of it with a fielder\u2019s choice.\n\nWith an eight run lead heading into the ninth, Columbia scored its ninth run of the evening.\n\nWillie Gabay, a right-handed pitcher out of Mahopac, NY, worked the final two frames, letting up no hits, but a run, three walks, and two strikeouts.\n\nIn the ninth Gabay walked the first three batters he faced, while throwing two wild pitches. Tuschak, with the bases loaded, grounded out into a shortstop-to-first double play, allowing Winningham to score from third.\n\nMcIlraith picks up his first win of the season (1-0, 0.00), while waking two and striking out six.\n\nThe Fireflies bullpen came through for the latter third of the game giving up no hits, no walks, and seven strikeouts, leading to Columbia\u2019s first-ever combined no-hitter.\n\nBallpark Fun\n\nThe Charleston faithful stuck around after the game to witness the incredible Human Cannonball, \u201cDavid The Bullet\u201d Smith, soar from centerfield all the way to home plate. That excitement was just a precursor to the incredible fireworks show the RiverDogs displayed on the banks of the Ashley River.\n\nUpcoming Promotions at The Joe\n\nThe RiverDogs, the Class-A affiliate of the New York Yankees, continue their four-game series with the Fireflies in Game Four on Sunday at 5:05pm.
