Employers in Charleston, S.C., and elsewhere pooled their resources to start the MEWA.

South Carolina Health Cooperative -- a member-owned, nonprofit health carrier -- has collapsed, forcing 500 small businesses to find other health coverage.

Businesses in South Carolina organized the carrier as a self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA). The MEWA operated outside the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan framework created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).
