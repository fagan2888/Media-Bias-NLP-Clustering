They claim the measure only seeks to protect pregnant women from violent assault and is similar to laws already on the books in more than 30 states across the country.\n\nWhat opponents say: The measure is seen by opponents as a way to stop all abortions and imperil the storage or destruction of eggs for in vitro fertilization. They claim that it portends more government intrusion into personal lives, dictating the kinds of birth control people can use, and interfering with medical decisions made by women with their doctors in treating fertility problems. Any pregnancy not ending in a live birth opponents fear, could trigger a criminal investigation.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/colorado-election-news/ci_26686456/colorado-amendment-67", "modificationDate": "2014-10-12T23:31:03-0600", "sailthru.section": "Election: Colorado races & issues", "endDate": "2024-10-08T10:13:34-0600", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado Constitution protecting pregnant women and unborn children by defining 'person' and 'child' in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act to include unborn human beings?", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26686456:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-12T23:30:25-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/colorado-election-news/ci_26686456/colorado-amendment-67", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado Constitution protecting pregnant women and unborn children by defining 'person' and 'child' in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act to include unborn human beings?", "title": "Colorado Amendment 67"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "What it asks: \"Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado Constitution protecting pregnant women and unborn children by defining 'person' and 'child' in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act to include unborn human beings?", "title": "Colorado Amendment 67", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/colorado-election-news/ci_26686456/colorado-amendment-67", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-12T23:30:25-0600", "sailthru.title": "Colorado Amendment 67", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2014-10-12T23:32:27-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "article_summary": "Definition of person and childWhat it asks: \"Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado Constitution protecting pregnant women and unborn children by defining 'person' and 'child' in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act to include unborn human beings?\"\nWhat it means: Passage of the measure would mean the inclusion of unborn human beings in the Colorado Criminal Code and the state's Wrongful Death Act.\nWhat supporters say: Personhood Colorado has said that this measure differs from past ballot measures that failed in in 2008 and 2010, in that it focuses only on including fetuses in the Colorado Criminal Code and Colorado Wrongful Death Act \u2014 instead of changing the definition of personhood in all areas of law.\nAny pregnancy not ending in a live birth opponents fear, could trigger a criminal investigation.\nWhat opponents say: The measure is seen by opponents as a way to stop all abortions and imperil the storage or destruction of eggs for in vitro fertilization."}
