Sure, to paraphrase Chris Rock (NSFW), if Bill Gates woke up tomorrow with a net worth of $25 million, he\u2019d jump out a window. But to the vast majority of us, it\u2019s a huge sum, more than enough to make some dreams come true. If money can\u2019t buy happiness, $25 million should at least be enough for a down payment on contentment \u2014 and to generate some envy on the part of us without eight figures in assets.\n\nWell, get ready to get jealous, if only for a moment. The number of American households with a net worth of $25 million or more \u2014 excluding their home \u2014 reached a new record last year, according to a recent report by wealth management research provider Spectrem Group.\n\nRelated: 10 Worst States for Surviving a Financial Disaster\n\nYet the same survey found that those wealthy Americans still have plenty of financial concerns. Actually, they sound fairly miserable\u2026and that\u2019s in a survey taken well before the stock market took a tumble last week. They may travel more, go to ballgames or concerts, or buy nice jewelry, but 70 percent of those surveyed said they get more satisfaction out of saving and investing their money than from spending it. More than half said they worry about the next generation wasting the money they inherit. And almost a quarter (23 percent) said they worry \u201cconstantly\u201d \u2014 constantly \u2014 about their financial situation.\n\nMany others worry less about their own financial situation than about the legacy they\u2019ll leave their children and grandchildren, including making sure that the kids develop a respectable work ethic.\n\nRelated: Are 401(k) Plans Setting Up Millennials for Pain?\n\nMaybe that\u2019s all reflective of who these people are, or aren\u2019t. By and large, the wealthy Americans surveyed by Spectrem aren\u2019t lounging around in their mansions counting their cash. Their average age is 58, and nearly 60 percent are still working, and another 20 percent are only semi-retired. Roughly nine out of 10 wealthy households attribute their success to hard work, and about eight in 10 credit education, while just over half credit \u201cluck\u201d or \u201cbeing in the right place at the right time.\u201d Most are entrepreneurs and business owners (22 percent), professionals (22 percent) or corporate executives (15 percent).\n\n\u201cAdditionally,\u201d Spectrem said in its press release, \u201cthe wealthiest of these \u2018one percenters\u2019 now consist of working households with two income wage earners under age 55, nearly three-quarters of whom work more than 40 hours per week.\u201d Plus, those still working likely plan on continuing to work as long as they can.\n\nSo maybe, just maybe, being wealthy isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Often enough, it apparently still means long hours and more than a few financial headaches. Then again, having $25 million in assets sure could make our current long hours and financial headaches that much easier to bear.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Let\u2019s agree right off the bat that $25 million is a lot of money.", "title": "The Super-Rich Are as Miserable as the Rest of Us", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/22/Super-Rich-Are-Miserable-Rest-Us", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04182012_Worried_Wealth_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/22/Super-Rich-Are-Miserable-Rest-Us", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04182012_Worried_Wealth_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Let\u2019s agree right off the bat that $25 million is a lot of money.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a2d\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s agree right off the bat that $25 million is a lot of money.\nThen again, having $25 million in assets sure could make our current long hours and financial headaches that much easier to bear.\nSure, to paraphrase Chris Rock (NSFW), if Bill Gates woke up tomorrow with a net worth of $25 million, he\u2019d jump out a window.\nBut to the vast majority of us, it\u2019s a huge sum, more than enough to make some dreams come true.\nIf money can\u2019t buy happiness, $25 million should at least be enough for a down payment on contentment \u2014 and to generate some envy on the part of us without eight figures in assets."}
