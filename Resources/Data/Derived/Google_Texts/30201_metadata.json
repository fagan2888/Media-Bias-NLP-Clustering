We are pleased that Congress is stepping in to address this important issue,\" continued Pollack.\n\nThe ACA requires employers to compile monthly and report annually, at tax filing time, numerous data points to the IRS and their own employees. This data is used to verify the individual and employer mandates under the law, and administer premium tax credits for coverage in Exchanges. Currently, there is no system to access this important information during the Exchange enrollment process.\n\nThe Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015 creates a front-end voluntary prospective reporting system to improve the accuracy of Exchange tax credit eligibility determinations. Under voluntary prospective reporting, data that would have been reported at the end of the year could now be reported at the beginning of the eligibility process, and help mitigate issues with inaccurate tax credit determinations. The legislation would also protect privacy by not requiring businesses and insurers to collect and report Social Security numbers for spouses and dependents, and authorizes electronic transmission of reporting data.\n\n\"Retailers are concerned that individuals may mistakenly be approved for tax credits through the health Exchanges based upon inaccurate information,\" said Pollack. \"Voluntary prospective reporting would lessen the confusion of Exchange tax credit eligibility and lessen the likelihood of individuals being on the hook for incorrect tax credits. This would ease the eligibility and compliance process for individuals, employers, Exchanges, and state and federal governments,\" noted Pollack.\n\nRILA and the RILA-led E-FLEX Coalition first raised the concept of voluntary prospective reporting to the Administration four years ago, and has been working since then to incorporate the system into the regulatory structure of these ACA requirements.\n\nRILA, the trade association of the world's largest and most innovative retail companies, product manufacturers, and service suppliers, promotes consumer choice and economic freedom through public policy and industry operational excellence. Our members provide millions of jobs and operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities and distribution centers domestically and abroad.

The legislation would also provide regulatory relief to employers who voluntarily report through the new prospective system by lessening the year-end reporting burdens that currently require data to be filed with the IRS on all of their employees. The bill's provision enabling employers to electronically transmit reporting data rather than sending it through the mail will provide further regulatory relief.\n\nAgain, thank you for your leadership in introducing this important legislation. RILA looks forward to working with you and your colleagues in Congress in a bipartisan manner to enact changes to the ACA.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoe Rinzel\n\nSenior Vice President, Government Affairs\n\nSOURCE Retail Industry Leaders Association", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "virginia", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "ARLINGTON, Va., June 10", "description": "ARLINGTON, Va., June 10, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- RILA Endorses Bipartisan Bill to Reform the ACA Subsidy Verification and Reporting Process.", "author": "Retail Industry Leaders Association", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rila-endorses-bipartisan-bill-to-reform-the-aca-subsidy-verification-and-reporting-process-300097399.html", "image": "http://content.prnewswire.com/images/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "ARLINGTON, Va., June 10, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) endorsed...", "title": "RILA Endorses Bipartisan Bill to Reform the ACA Subsidy Verification and Reporting Process"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "RILA Endorses Bipartisan Bill to Reform the ACA Subsidy Verification and Reporting Process", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "Retail Industry Leaders Association, virginia, Federal and State Legislation, U.S. State Policy, Advocacy Group Opinion, Health Care & Hospitals, Retail", "date": "2015-06-10T18:00:00Z", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb835\"", "article_summary": "The voluntary prospective reporting system created under the bill will bring clarity to the health Exchange subsidy process.\nThe Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015 creates a front-end voluntary prospective reporting system to improve the accuracy of Exchange tax credit eligibility determinations.\nThis data is used to verify the individual and employer mandates under the law, and administer premium tax credits for coverage in Exchanges.\n\"Voluntary prospective reporting would lessen the confusion of Exchange tax credit eligibility and lessen the likelihood of individuals being on the hook for incorrect tax credits.\nRetailers are concerned that individuals may mistakenly be approved for tax credits through the health Exchanges based upon inaccurate information."}
