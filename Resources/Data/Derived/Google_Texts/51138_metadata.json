Forward Kevin Volland capitalized on a poor back pass from Bayern\u2019s David Alaba to match the fastest German league goal ever scored.\n\nThomas Mueller equalized by pushing in a rebound with his right thigh in the 41st minute, and Bayern overcame Jerome Boateng\u2019s sending off in the 73rd for a handball in the area as Eugen Polanski struck the resulting penalty against the post. That led to a final push from Bayern and Lewandowski netted the winner after a pass from Douglas Costa.\n\nElsewhere, Hamburger SV twice came from behind to beat Stuttgart 3-2. Bayer Leverkusen won 1-0 at Hannover, promoted Darmstadt held Schalke to a 1-1 draw, and Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 with Augsburg.\n\n___\n\nITALY\n\nOn the opening day in Serie A, Roma was held 1-1 at Hellas Verona while Lazio beat newly-promoted Bologna 2-1.\n\nBosko Jankovic volleyed Verona into the lead on the hour but its advantage lasted barely five minutes before Alessandro Florenzi leveled for Roma with a long-range strike.\n\nLazio took the lead in the 18th when Bologna\u2019s defense failed to deal with Dusan Basta\u2019s cross and the onrushing Lucas Biglia smashed it home.\n\nBologna gifted Lazio the second, too, as it allowed Antonio Candreva\u2019s cross to go through to Ricardo Kishna, who had plenty of time and space to control and shoot.\n\nMatteo Mancosu reduced the deficit on the stroke of halftime.\n\n___\n\nSPAIN\n\nGoals from free kicks gave Atletico Madrid a slim win over promoted Las Palmas and helped Espanyol beat 10-man Getafe as the Spanish league struggled to produce scoring on its opening weekend.\n\nAtletico settled for a 1-0 victory thanks to Antoine Griezmann\u2019s free kick in the 16th minute at its Vicente Calderon Stadium.\n\nIn Barcelona, Espanyol midfielder Salva Sevilla secured a 1-0 win with a dipping free kick that went in off the upright in the third minute.\n\nElsewhere, the Spanish league saw two more 0-0 draws after Valencia stalled at Rayo Vallecano and Real Sociedad split the points at Deportivo La Coruna.\n\nBoth matches were similar to Friday\u2019s league opener when Sevilla and Malaga looked rusty after the summer in their 0-0 draw.\n\n___\n\nFRANCE\n\nLyon fell to its first defeat of the season, losing 2-1 at home to Rennes as Mehdi Zeffane set up the opener before scoring the winner against his former club.\n\nReims and Caen failed to maintain their perfect start to the season as they lost 1-0 at Nantes and 2-1 at Nice, respectively.\n\nJulian Palmieri struck twice in the first half to send Bastia on its way to a 3-0 win at Guignamp.\n\nAngers maintained its third clean sheet in as many games as Cheikh N\u2019Doye scored two first-half goals for a 2-0 victory at Ajaccio.\n\nMonaco failed to boost its confidence ahead of the second leg of its Champions League playoff against Valencia - where it trails 3-1 - as it drew 1-1 at Toulouse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Lewandowski gave 10-man Bayern Munich a last-minute victory in the Bundesliga, while Wayne Rooney recorded his 10th straight game without a goal for Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Robert Lewandowski gave 10-man Bayern Munich a last-minute victory in the Bundesliga, while Wayne Rooney recorded his 10th straight game without a goal for Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday.", "title": "Bayern wins after last-minute goal, United held by Newcastle", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/22/bayern-wins-after-last-minute-goal-united-held-by-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/5c945c27ac09d8257f0f6a7067001b68.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/5c945c27ac09d8257f0f6a7067001b68.jpg", "description": "Robert Lewandowski gave 10-man Bayern Munich a last-minute victory in the Bundesliga, while Wayne Rooney recorded his 10th straight game without a goal for Manchester United in the Premier League on S", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bayern wins after last-minute goal, United held by Newcastle"}, "Author": "The Associated Press", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd736\"", "article_summary": "___GERMANYBayern Munich conceded a goal after just nine seconds but Lewandowski\u2019s late goal secured a 2-1 win over Hoffenheim.\nBayer Leverkusen won 1-0 at Hannover, promoted Darmstadt held Schalke to a 1-1 draw, and Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 with Augsburg.\nForward Kevin Volland capitalized on a poor back pass from Bayern\u2019s David Alaba to match the fastest German league goal ever scored.\nRooney, meanwhile, has now gone 10 games without a goal for United, which was held to a 0-0 draw with Newcastle.\nAlso, Tottenham drew 1-1 at Leicester, while Jermain Defoe secured Sunderland\u2019s first point of the season by equalizing in a 1-1 draw with Swansea."}
