WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The presidential campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is pressing ahead with its lawsuit over access to a Democratic National Committee voter database.

Sanders on Thursday formally notified the DNC after a U.S. District Court judge had threatened to dismiss the campaign's lawsuit if it failed to take action.

Sanders sued in December after the DNC temporarily barred his campaign from accessing its massive trove of voter information. The move came after Sanders' staff improperly accessed data compiled by the campaign of rival Hillary Clinton. Sanders apologized for the breach, and his campaign's access to the data was restored after four days.

In court papers, the campaign claims it lost about $600,000 per day in political donations during the outage. The lawsuit seeks in excess of $150,000 in damages.
