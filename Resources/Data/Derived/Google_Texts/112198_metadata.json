It would appear so. Bad delivery? Quite.\n\nA 65-year-old retiree from England has pledged to devote his remaining days to debunking sundry stereotypes of Native Americans.\n\nBut there is a problem \u2013 the man is a perpetuator of cultural appropriation.\n\nPhotographed in what he refers to as his \u201ccostume\u201d \u2013 a faux feather headdress, breastplate, choker and a pipe, Les Atkins of Walsall, England, retired from his job as a mayonnaise factory manager on July 31 to become a full-fledged Native American, according to the British tabloid Mirror.\n\nAtkins said he now plans to tour the country teaching students and museum-goers all about Native Americans.\n\n\u201cObviously putting on bits of dance display, talks, and basically just letting people know the truth,\u201d Atkins said in a British brogue. \u201cTheir [Native American] way of life is not all about rain dances and scalping people\u2019s heads. I want to teach people how they helped the first wave of settlers by giving them gifts, like food.\u201d\n\nAtkins admitted he became obsessed with Native Americans after watching 1950s Spaghetti Westerns and even claims to have visited several reservations in Arizona and Utah.\n\n\u201cOn one of my visits I was lucky enough to dance with one of the tribes \u2013 they called it to \u2018shake a feather\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the story on Atkins broke Monday, social media responded as expected, with cheers and jeers:\n\n\u201cIf his intentions are truly innocent, then all I see is hateful people hating on someone at least trying to do some good...typical,\u201d Edmond Harjo wrote in response to attacks on Atkins. \u201cI also see native youth either trying to be white, black, or even Mexican and no one says anything.\u201d\n\nFacebook user Steven Hu wrote: \u201cMayonnaise Man wants to eradicate misconceptions about native culture, while wearing his \u2018costumes\u2019. I hope some kid tells him it\u2019s called regalia...we\u2019ll (sic) at least he knows enough to be holding the [pipe] with his left hand...mayonnaise lol.\u201d\n\nRegardless of approbation or condemnation, Atkins remains devoted to his interest in Native America.\n\nAtkins, who allegedly learned traditional sign language (of which specific nation was not mentioned), boasts he has spent more than \u00a35,000 ($8,440 U.S.) over the years on his obsession. He spent more than $7,500 on his headdress alone, which he made himself. He plans to display it on the road to his fellow Englanders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something a lot of people know about and the homemade costumes and artefacts (sic) will grab their eye.\u201d\n\nAmid all the comments about Atkins, one Facebook user\u2019s pithy words would appear to put the situation into perspective:\n\n\u201cHis heart is in the right place, even though his brain hasn\u2019t joined the party,\u201d Charlotte Anderson wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "British Retiree Takes Cultural Appropriation to New Awkward Level", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/06/british-retiree-takes-cultural-appropriation-new-awkward-level-156259", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/les_atkins.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "British Retiree Takes Cultural Appropriation to New Awkward Level"}, "abstract": "British Retiree Takes Cultural Appropriation to New Awkward Level", "dc": {"title": "British Retiree Takes Cultural Appropriation to New Awkward Level"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/06/british-retiree-takes-cultural-appropriation-new-awkward-level-156259", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Simon Moya Smith, Les Atkins, Walsall, England, cultural misappropriation, mayonnaise, factory, manager", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-06T09:45-04:00", "dcterms.title": "British Retiree Takes Cultural Appropriation to New Awkward Level"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c33\"", "article_summary": "A 65-year-old retiree from England has pledged to devote his remaining days to debunking sundry stereotypes of Native Americans.\nBut there is a problem \u2013 the man is a perpetuator of cultural appropriation.\n\u201cObviously putting on bits of dance display, talks, and basically just letting people know the truth,\u201d Atkins said in a British brogue.\nAtkins said he now plans to tour the country teaching students and museum-goers all about Native Americans.\n\u201cI also see native youth either trying to be white, black, or even Mexican and no one says anything.\u201dFacebook user Steven Hu wrote: \u201cMayonnaise Man wants to eradicate misconceptions about native culture, while wearing his \u2018costumes\u2019."}
