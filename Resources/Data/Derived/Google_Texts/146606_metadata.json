Can I use my online state insurance marketplace to compare and buy a Medicare Advantage, supplement or prescription plan?\n\nA: No, the marketplaces (also known as health exchanges) are not for Medicare beneficiaries. They are mostly for uninsured Americans and do not offer Medicare Advantage, medigap supplemental policies or Part D prescription plans. Medicare is not changing because of the marketplaces. For a medigap or Medicare Advantage plan, consult www.medicare.gov.\n\n\n\nQ: What if I mistakenly sign up for insurance on the marketplace, will my Medicare coverage be automatically canceled?\n\nA: No, if you have Medicare coverage, you won\u2019t qualify for insurance on the marketplace. But if you do sign up for a plan accidentally, cancel the marketplace policy.\n\n\n\nQ: But I\u2019m a Medicare beneficiary, and someone contacted me and said I could buy insurance through the marketplace. What\u2019s up?\n\nA: It\u2019s illegal for someone to knowingly sell a Medicare beneficiary a marketplace plan. Watch out for scammers during open enrollment. Do not share your Medicare number or personal information with anyone who says he or she can sell you a plan through the marketplace.\n\nQ: Can I get the premium tax credit that people get when they buy insurance on the marketplaces?\n\nA: If you\u2019re enrolled in Medicare, you\u2019re not eligible for the tax credits that some people qualify for on the marketplaces, but you already get a substantial break on costs. The overall costs of care under Medicare Part B, which pays doctors\u2019 visits, and Part D, the prescription drug benefit, are subsidized 75 percent from federal general revenues. Plus, if you\u2019re a Medicare beneficiary with limited resources and income, you may qualify for low-cost Part D drug coverage under the Extra Help program. Go to www.ssa.gov, call 800-772-1213 or visit your local Social Security office.\n\nNext page: More about Medicare and the health insurance marketplace. \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "What You Need to Know About This Year's Medicare Open Enrollment Period", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-01-05T19:08:29.993-05:00", "keywords": "medicare, medicare open enrollment,open enrollment, faq, medicare advantage, health exchanges, medicare coverage, sign up for medicare", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Marsha Mercer", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "Have a question about Medicare?
