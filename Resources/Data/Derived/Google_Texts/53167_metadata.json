Yet somehow, in the wake of all this, the party is consumed with the question Have we done enough to stop Obamacare?\n\nThis peculiar subject of introspection, as if Joe Francis were lying awake at night cursing himself for his prudery, reflects the deepening mix of terror and rage with which conservatives await the enrollment of millions of uninsured Americans beginning in October. On the substantive merits of the law, only the subtlest variations can be detected in the GOP\u2019s evaluation. Mitch McConnell calls it the \u0093single worst piece of legislation passed in the last 50 years in the country.\u0094 Representative John Fleming of Louisiana calls it \u0093the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed by a Congress\u0094 and \u0093the most existential threat to our economy since the Great Depression.\u0094 Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli harks back to the Fugitive Slave Acts for a comparative affront to liberty.\n\nHaving achieved near consensus on the policy, the party has fallen into intramural squabbling over which extraordinary threats to deploy. Shut down the government? Default on the national debt? (House leaders have wriggled out of demands to do the former by promising to do the latter.) Conservative activists have turned on their leaders as traitors for hesitating to employ the most obviously suicidal methods, affixing John Boehner\u2019s name to the hated program (\u0093Boehnercare\u0094) or accusing McConnell of \u0093empty rhetoric about ending Obamacare.\u0094 These recriminations reprise the hallucinatory attacks by Cold War conservatives like Joe McCarthy and the John Birch Society, which over time migrated from their original targets onto such figures as President Eisenhower and the Army.\n\nThe historical echo is fitting in the sense that Obamacare has come to fill the place in the conservative psyche once occupied by communism and later by taxes: the main point of doctrinal agreement. (In constituent meetings, \u0093this is the overriding issue that is being discussed,\u0094 one Republican member of Congress explained late last month. \u0093Way more than immigration, way more than the debt.\u0094) The transformation of Obamacare from a close relative of Republicans\u2019 own health-care ideas to the locus of evil in modern life is owing to several things, including the almost tautological political fact that its success would be Obama\u2019s: Permanent health-care reform would define Obama as a Reaganesque transformative figure, rather than the failure conservatives still hope him to be remembered as. The law\u2019s slow rollout has made it a live issue, unlike the already-expired stimulus, and thus the main receptacle for simmering concerns over unemployment and the tepid economic recovery.\n\nMost important, the law has, in its direct impact, opened a fissure over the role of government deeper than any since the New Deal. Obamacare threatens America\u2019s unique status among advanced economies as a country where access to regular medical care is a privilege that generally must be earned. In a few weeks, the United States government, like those of France, or Australia, or Israel, will begin to regard health insurance as something to be handed out to one and all, however poor, lazy, or otherwise undeserving each recipient may be. \u0093We can\u2019t afford everything we do now, let alone provide free medical care to able-bodied adults,\u0094 as Missouri Republican Rob Schaaf, author of the state\u2019s harsh anti-Obamacare initiative, put it. \u0093I have a philosophical problem with doing that.\u0094\n\nThe Obamacare wars have progressed from the legislative to the judicial to the electoral fronts, gaining intensity at every step. Now they move to a new battleground to secure the law and all it represents, or provoke its collapse. That an implementation battle is taking place at all is a highly unusual circumstance. Major new laws often stagger into operation with glitches, confusion, and hasty revisions, but not sabotage. Obamacare will come online in the midst of an unprecedented quasi-campaign atmosphere, with Republicans waging a desperate political and cultural war to destroy it.\n\nThe transformative potential of Obamacare is not a conservative hallucination. It is the resolution of a confounding dilemma decades in the making. The American health-care system is not merely the only one in the advanced world that\u2019s closed off to a large share of the population; it\u2019s also the most expensive by far. The normal structure of a public problem is that the worse the problem, the easier it is to solve\u0097as traffic gets worse, more people support mass transit; the more soldiers die, the more pressure to end the war. American health care has long defied that dynamic. The worse the problem grows, the harder it has gotten to solve. The more waste and inefficiency that sprout through the medical system, the more of an interest doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies have in maintaining the status quo. The uninsured are diffuse and disorganized, unable to marshal any substantial political support, and the effect of their plight has largely been to make people with insurance fearful of any change lest they join them.", "article_metadata": {"content.author": "Jonathan Chait", "category": "Features", "Issue_Date": "September 23, 2013", "Byline": "Jonathan Chait", "description": "Why it continues to drive many Republicans to madness.", "copyright": "\u00a9 2014 New York Magazine Holdings LLC.
