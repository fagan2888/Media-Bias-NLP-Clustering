But some had much better views than others. But if you were taking a close look at and giving a careful listen to some of those surrounding Pope Francis during his visit here in New York last week, you could practically hear joints pop and muscles groan as the superwealthy contorted themselves to thread the needle and purchase their way into the pontiff\u2019s good graces. Camels? These wealthy dromedaries gave a new meaning to Hump Day.\n\nNotwithstanding his encounter with notorious, Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis, the pope\u2019s visit to the United States last week was a success, with millions turning out to get even a glimpse of him. But some had much better views than others. In fact, since before the Reformation, when the Catholic Church sold indulgences \u2013 pre-paid, non-stop tickets to heaven for affluent sinners \u2013there has not often been such a display of ecclesiastic, conspicuous consumption and genuflection.\n\nAll of which, of course, is more than ironic when you think about the things Pope Francis has said and written about the rich and poor, some of which he expressed during last week\u2019s papal tour.\n\nBack in November 2013, the pope wrote that, \u201cWhile the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially, so too is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few\u2026 A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules.\u201d\n\nIdeas like that got Kenneth Langone, billionaire founder of Home Depot and major political bankroller of New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie, a little hot under the collar. You may remember that last year he created a stir when he told Politico that he hoped a rise in populist sentiment against the one percent was not working, \u201cbecause if you go back to 1933, with different words, this is what Hitler was saying in Germany. You don\u2019t survive as a society if you encourage and thrive on envy or jealousy.\u201d\n\nA year before, in 2013, New York\u2019s Cardinal Timothy Dolan had enlisted the DIY plutocrat to help raise $175 million to restore the grand and elegant St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, but in an interview Langone gave to the money network CNBC, he said one of his high rolling potential donors was concerned that the pope was being overly critical of market economies as \u201cexclusionary\u201d and attacking a \u201cculture of prosperity\u2026 incapable of feeling compassion for the poor.\u201d\n\nSo Langone complained to Cardinal Dolan, and this is how the cardinal says he replied: \u201c\u2018Well, Ken, that would be a misunderstanding of the Holy Father\u2019s message. The pope loves poor people. He also loves rich people\u2026\u2019 So I said, \u2018Ken, thanks for bringing it to my attention. We\u2019ve gotta correct to make sure this gentleman understands the Holy Father\u2019s message properly.\u2019 And then I think he\u2019s gonna say, \u2018Oh, OK. If that\u2019s the case, count me in for St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut sure enough, there in the exclusive crowd at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue Thursday night, hanging out as the Vicar of Christ celebrated Vespers, was Kenneth Langone, soaking it all in. There, too, reportedly, were a couple of other crony capitalists and St. Patrick\u2019s fundraisers \u2013 Frank Bisignano, president and CEO of First Data Corp., and Brian Moynihan, chairman and CEO of Bank of America.\n\nBisignano, known as \u201cWall Street\u2019s Mr. Fix-It\u201d used to work for Citigroup and for Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and reportedly received annual compensation at First Data to the tune of $9.3 million. Moynihan was paid $13 million for 2014, down from $14 million in 2013. Last year, Bank of America, the second largest in the country \u2013 but the most hated \u2014 made a record-breaking $16.65 billion settlement with the Justice Department to pay up for allegations of unloading toxic mortgage investments during the housing boom.
