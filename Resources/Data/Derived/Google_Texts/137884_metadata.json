It\u2019s called \u2018phantom billing,\u2019 and when doctors or health care providers do this, they face criminal charges.\u201d\n\nJohnston\u2019s comment expands the potential number of legal problems which Gruber may face in connection with his lucrative consulting business, from which he earned an estimated $5 million over the past four years in federal and state contracts.\n\nOn Friday, white collar criminal defense attorney Brady Toensing told Breitbart News, \u201cif [an] investigation uncovers sufficient evidence that Gruber padded his bills, he could be charged by the state with contract fraud or by the feds with mail or wire fraud.\u201d\n\nGruber could also potentially face legal troubles under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to file lawsuits as \u201cqui tam\u201d plaintiffs against individuals or corporations that have defrauded the federal government.\n\nTo date, Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer\u2019s inquiry has not addressed the possibility that Gruber\u2019s receipt of $80,000 for work he claims was done by research assistants may be \u201cphantom billing.\u201d\n\nHoffer has asked for only the minimal information from Gruber about his research assistants: their names, employment status, and contact information. Gruber has refused to provide this information.\n\nThough Gruber has failed to respond to Hoffer\u2019s information requests to date, Hoffer has subpoena power and could subpoena all of Gruber\u2019s business documents, bank statements, and financial records related to his contract with the state of Vermont. While enforcement of that subpoena would require the cooperation of the Democratic Attorney General of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, the documents it uncovers could turn up a hornet\u2019s nest of trouble for Gruber.\n\nHealey was elected to her first term as Attorney General of Massachusetts in November, defeating Republican nominee John Miller by a 62% to 38% margin, and was sworn in early this month. On Monday Breitbart News asked a spokesperson if the Attorney General\u2019s office would enforce a subpoena in Massachusetts issued by Vermont State Auditor Hoffer for Gruber\u2019s records.\n\nBreitbart News has yet to receive a response to that request.\n\nAs part of his inquiry, Hoffer could subpoena Gruber to provide copies of the 1099s or W-2s he provided his research assistants for work performed by them on the state of Vermont contract in 2014. Under federal law, the Internal Revenue Service requires that all employers provide independent contractors who have worked for them in 2014 with 1099s and employees who have worked for them in 2014 with W-2s by January 31, 2015. (This year, that deadline is extended to February 2, 2015, since January 31 is a Saturday.)\n\nVermont State Auditor Hoffer\u2019s request for information on the employment status of the research assistants Gruber claimed conducted work under his supervision is relevant to the issue of Gruber\u2019s tax reporting responsibilities.\n\nIf those research assistants are independent contractors, Gruber\u2019s only tax reporting obligation is to provide them with 1099s, and include copies of those 1099s in his own personal tax filings for 2014.\n\nIf, however, the research assistants were employees, Gruber is responsible for paying Social Security and Medicare withholding taxes as well as providing them with W-2 forms.\n\nWhile Gruber may be an internationally prominent economist with an extensive academic pedigree, his record as a businessman is filled with questions about his billing practices, sloppy bookkeeping, and failure to incorporate his consulting activities into a separate business.\n\nBased on all evidence currently available to Breitbart News, the $5 million Gruber received over the past four years from federal and state governments contracts was paid to Gruber personally, rather than to a corporate entity. Consultants often establish separate corporate entities to prevent co-mingling of funds and allow for clean record keeping, particularly as it relates to federal and state tax payment and reporting.\n\nWhile it is a common practice and entirely legal for an individual who operates a small consulting business to operate it as a proprietorship rather than to form a corporate entity from which to operate it, it is unusual to operate a consulting business on the scale of Gruber\u2019s without forming a separate corporate entity.\n\nOperating a consulting business of the size of Gruber\u2019s enterprise as a proprietorship run out of a personal bank account can be a tax and record keeping nightmare.\n\nOn Friday, Breitbart News confirmed with the office of Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin that Gruber, a resident of that state, has not formed a corporate entity of any sort there.\n\n\u201cJonathan Gruber has not formed any corporate entity in Massachusetts\u201d Brian McNiff, spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, told Breibart News.\n\n\u201cI just checked the corporate database by name and then by last name. There were several people named Gruber, and there are three with the first name of John, but they are not residents of Massachusetts, they are in New York, Washington, and Indiana,\u201d McNiff said.\n\nBreitbart News asked Gruber if he has formed a corporate entity in Massachusetts, or any other state, but has received no response to our inquiries.\n\nIn addition to the state of Vermont, the state of Minnesota, the House Government Oversight and Reform Committee have confirmed and the Inspector General\u2019s Office of the Department of Health and Human Services is considering conducting inquiries into Gruber\u2019s billing practices and consulting contracts.\n\nTo date, there are no press reports indicating that any one in the Department of Justice or the Internal Revenue Service is investigating Gruber\u2019s contracts and billing practices.\n\nWith regards to qui tam plaintiff claims under the federal False Claims Act, such claims could potentially be brought in connection with Gruber\u2019s 2009 contract with the Department of Health and Human Services for $392,600, where, as Breitbart News has documented, at least one of his research assistants was paid by the National Bureau of Economic Research (which was not party to the contract), rather than by Gruber himself.\n\nIn the case of Gruber\u2019s state contracts, a federal False Claims Act suit from a whistleblower would face a higher hurdle, unless the qui tam plaintiff could prove that the state contract was funded substantially by a grant from the federal government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jonathan Gruber Faces Questions About 'Phantom Billing' and Tax Reporting", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jonathan Gruber Faces Questions About 'Phantom Billing' and Tax Reporting", "title": "Jonathan Gruber Faces Questions About 'Phantom Billing' and Tax Reporting - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-02-20T11:01:08-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/26/jonathan-gruber-faces-questions-about-phantom-billing-and-tax-reporting/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jonathan Gruber Faces Questions About 'Phantom Billing' and Tax Reporting", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "title": "Jonathan Gruber Faces Questions About 'Phantom Billing' and Tax Reporting - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "False Claims Act, Jonathan Gruber, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, obamacare, phantom billing, Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer, Vermonters for Health Care Freedom,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-26T10:43:32-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-02-20T11:01:08-07:00", "tag": "Vermonters for Health Care Freedom", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERVermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer is not the only one raising questions about Jonathan Gruber\u2019s billing practices.\nVermont State Auditor Hoffer\u2019s request for information on the employment status of the research assistants Gruber claimed conducted work under his supervision is relevant to the issue of Gruber\u2019s tax reporting responsibilities.\nIf those research assistants are independent contractors, Gruber\u2019s only tax reporting obligation is to provide them with 1099s, and include copies of those 1099s in his own personal tax filings for 2014.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Monday Darcie Johnston, head of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, told Breitbart News that Gruber may have a \u201cphantom billing\u201d problem.\nIf, however, the research assistants were employees, Gruber is responsible for paying Social Security and Medicare withholding taxes as well as providing them with W-2 forms."}
