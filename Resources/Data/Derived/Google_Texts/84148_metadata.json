Information was fed to the police by thousands of clandestine sources \u2013 and a seemingly banal or routine interaction with nearly anyone could lead to a surprise \u201cknock on the door\u201d by authorities. During the late Soviet era, communist leadership moved away from the executions and purges of the Stalin years and began to increasingly rely upon medical professionals to diagnose \u201cenemies of the state\u201d as insane \u2013 thus, a routine trip to your doctor could lead to a visit from police. Although the Cold War ended over two decades ago, a lawsuit filed December 17 in U.S. District Court in Rochester, NY alleges that such heavy-handed police-state tactics are presently being employed in Andrew Cuomo\u2019s New York. The suit, filed by attorney Paloma Capanna on behalf of plaintiff Donald Montgomery, alleges that the New York State Police ordered the permanent confiscation of Mr. Montgomery\u2019s registered handguns after he sought treatment for insomnia. The confiscation was ordered under Cuomo\u2019s \u201cSAFE Act\u201d gun-control law.\n\nThe allegations in the case are downright scary. The complaint contends that Montgomery, a Navy veteran and retired police officer who rose to the rank of detective sergeant during his 30-year career, voluntarily sought treatment for insomnia at a hospital on Long Island in May of 2014 after relocating to a new home several hundred miles from his previous residence. According to the suit, the hospital diagnosed the plaintiff as \u201cmildly depressed,\u201d and his clinical evaluation stated, \u201cPatient has no thoughts of hurting himself. Patient has no thoughts of hurting others. Patient is not having suicidal thoughts. Patient is not having homicidal thoughts\u2026\u201d and \u201cthere is no evidence of any psychotic processes, mania, or OCD symptoms. Insight, judgment, and impulse control are good.\u201d The suit further alleges that a psychiatrist told the plaintiff, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you were referred here. You don\u2019t belong here.\u201d Nonetheless, the suit contends that five days after being discharged from the hospital, the local sheriff\u2019s department showed up at Montgomery\u2019s door and seized his four registered handguns, including his former duty sidearm, after the sheriff had been subjected to \u201crepeated pressure\u201d by the New York State Police, who claimed that Montgomery had been declared mentally defective and had been involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Montgomery alleges that the hospital violated his privacy by transmitting his medical information to the State Police without his consent or knowledge. Montgomery subsequently requested a hearing to have his handgun ownership permit reinstated, but the sheriff\u2019s department allegedly terminated his permit without a hearing. The suit alleges that police denied Montgomery\u2019s Freedom of Information requests to see what information has been placed in his secret file, and that both police and the hospital refused to allow him to correct the falsehoods in his record. The suit names Gov. Cuomo, Eastern Long Island Hospital, and several state officials, including the superintendent of state police and the local sheriff, as defendants, and alleges that they violated Montgomery\u2019s Second-, Fourth-, Fifth-, and Fourteenth-Amendment rights. It seeks injunctive and declaratory relief for Montgomery and all similarly situated persons. Last year, Cuomo publicly stated that \u201cextreme conservatives\u201d \u2013 namely, gun owners and opponents of abortion and gay marriage \u2013 \u201chave no place in the State of New York.\u201d In other words, they are enemies of the state. Cuomo\u2019s use of medical records against gun owners under his \u201cSAFE Act\u201d is clearly an effort to confiscate firearms from people who \u201chave no place\u201d in his police state. Residents of other states should be wary that progressives will make similar efforts to use the federally mandated electronic medical database required by Obamacare against gun owners and/or political dissidents in the future.
