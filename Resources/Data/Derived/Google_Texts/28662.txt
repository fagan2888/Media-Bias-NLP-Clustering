Small-business group NFIB/Florida named St. Petersburg Republican Sen. Jeff Brandes a “Guardian of Small Business” during a luncheon Wednesday.

“As a small-business owner, I have seen firsthand the impact of burdensome government regulations,” Brandes said after accepting the award. “Small businesses are the backbone of our community. We should cut taxes and eliminate unnecessary red tape always and everywhere to keep growing more jobs for Floridians.”

The Guardian of Small Business award is the National Federation of Independent Businesses’ top honor for lawmakers and is awarded yearly to the legislator whose work best reflects the goals of NFIB and the small-business community.

“Sen. Brandes’ support of small business issues makes him one of our true allies in the Senate,” NFIB Florida Executive Director Bill Herrle said. “Sen. Brandes’ leadership on pro-business legislation, including his work on reforms to civil forfeiture laws, and his opposition to expanding Obamacare in Florida have proven his dedication to small business owners and NFIB members, and we’re proud to recognize him for championing these causes.”

Brandes has a 96 percent voting record with NFIB/Florida since 2010, when he first entered the legislature as a member of the House.
