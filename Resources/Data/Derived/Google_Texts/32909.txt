Updated at 7:10 p.m.: Revised to include latest information from DART officials

A DART train struck and killed a pedestrian Saturday afternoon at downtown Dallasâ€™ West End station, a DART official said.

Morgan Lyons said a 34-year-old man walked into the side of a southbound Red Line train as it was pulling into the station. Lyons said the man walked into the back end of the lead car and fell under the train.

The man, who has not been identified, died at the scene.

Witnesses told officials the man was looking down and walked into the side of the train, and Lyons said investigators would be reviewing video to see what the man was doing.

No other injuries were reported, and passengers were moved to other buses or trains.

The train was shut down for about three hours, but was up and running again shortly after 7 p.m.
