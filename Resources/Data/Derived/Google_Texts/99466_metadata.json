However, the three percent surcharge is bringing about mixed reactions from the restaurant\u2019s customers.\n\nOne critic on the review site, Yelp, claimed: \u201cIt\u2019s not MY responsibility to take care of YOUR employees\u2019 healthcare\u2026 that\u2019s YOUR job.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has the same policy that I do as the owners,\u201d owner and chef Walter Manske said. \u201cAnd we offer it to everyone; (the) dishwasher, busboy, waiters, across the board.\u201d\n\nManske says that, ultimately, it is up to the customer whether to take the surcharge out of the gratuity.\n\nThere are other customers, however, who don\u2019t mind the surcharge on the basis of healthcare for workers.\n\n\u201cAdding it to the tip, or taking it away from the tip is normal, and I think it\u2019s important that everybody has healthcare within the restaurants,\u201d customer Chris Jordan said.\n\nUnder Obamacare, businesses like R\u00e9publique, that have over 50 full-time employees, are required by law to provide affordable healthcare benefits.\n\nManske, meanwhile, says that the surcharge system is the solution to that requirement that works for the restaurant and that most feedback has been positive.\n\n\u201cEven if this isn\u2019t the perfect solution, it\u2019s definitely a solution, and so far, there isn\u2019t any other solution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A local restaurant has added a surcharge to every tab in order to pay for its employees' healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/17/local-restaurant-adds-surcharge-to-tabs-to-pay-for-employees-healthcare/", "image": {"width": 850, "secure_url": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/untitled-1.jpg?w=850", "identifier": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/untitled-1.jpg?w=850", "height": 638}, "type": "article", "description": "A local restaurant has added a surcharge to every tab in order to pay for its employees' healthcare.", "title": "Local Restaurant Adds Surcharge To Tabs To Pay For Employees' Healthcare"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsla.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/untitled-1.jpg?w=850", "description": "A local restaurant has added a surcharge to every tab in order to pay for its employees' healthcare.", "site": "CBSLA", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Local Restaurant Adds Surcharge To Tabs To Pay For Employees' Healthcare"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of LA/OC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Los Angeles", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSLA"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, food & drink, local, news, syndicated local, healthcare, los angeles, obamacare, republique, restaurant", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5c05896c022a6d5696298ac60bad5bcf?s=16", "news_keywords": "healthcare, los angeles, obamacare, republique, restaurant"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1603\"", "article_summary": "HANCOCK PARK (CBSLA.com) \u2014 A local restaurant has added a surcharge to every tab in order to pay for its employees\u2019 healthcare.\n\u201cEven if this isn\u2019t the perfect solution, it\u2019s definitely a solution, and so far, there isn\u2019t any other solution.\u201d\nUnder Obamacare, businesses like R\u00e9publique, that have over 50 full-time employees, are required by law to provide affordable healthcare benefits.\nThere are other customers, however, who don\u2019t mind the surcharge on the basis of healthcare for workers.\n\u201cAdding it to the tip, or taking it away from the tip is normal, and I think it\u2019s important that everybody has healthcare within the restaurants,\u201d customer Chris Jordan said."}
