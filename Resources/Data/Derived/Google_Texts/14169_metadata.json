Music included Rolling Stones hits \u201cRuby Tuesday\u201d and \u201cPaint It Black,\u201d as well as \u201cRed Cape Tango.\u201d\n\nThe judges also gave East awards for best effect and best music.\n\nBellevue East percussion instructor Zack Bresler said winning is nice but marching band is about teaching kids life skills like discipline, dedication and teamwork.\n\n\u201cBringing home trophies is icing on the cake,\u201d Bresler said. \u201cEverything we do is to make these kids better people.\u201d\n\nThe contest was held at two sites.\n\nAt Millard South High's Buell Stadium, 22 bands competed in open class for top-10 rankings and awards.\n\nJudges award points for a variety of show components, including music performance, visual performance and overall effect.\n\nA standing-room-only crowd packed the stadium as the awards were announced.\n\nBellevue West's crisp, unison flag work earned the band best color guard. West's show, \u201cThe Awakening,\u201d also won best visual.\n\nMillard West delivered an emotional crowd-pleaser titled \u201cImagine If\u201d that delivered an urgent plea for peace.\n\nKim Meradith, who was in the stands supporting her son in a different band, said the show moved her to tears.\n\n\u201cIt's not my school, but every time I watch it I start to cry,\u201d Meradith said.\n\nHer son, Tyler, is a senior bass drum player in the Papillion-La Vista South band.\n\nRounding out the top 10 were Millard North, fourth, Omaha Burke, fifth, Papillion-La Vista South, sixth, Millard South, seventh, Westside, eighth, Elkhorn South, ninth, and Norris, tenth.\n\nOmaha Burke won the award for best percussion.\n\nMeantime, at Seacrest Field in Lincoln, bands competed in a festival format for ratings only.\n\nThe events were a spectacle in every sense.\n\nBands marched and danced and sang, while drum lines punched out precise rhythms and color guards in creative costumes swung flags and tossed rifles.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Bellevue West High Thunderbirds finished second, edging out third-place Millard West High by the slightest margin.", "title": "Bellevue East strikes right chord at state marching band contest", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/bellevue-east-strikes-right-chord-at-state-marching-band-contest/article_ad5fb6d9-61cb-5fe0-a483-806efb88e260.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/38/238c8b96-3fdb-57b4-b4c8-f746e9367112/5332e1be49dfb.image.jpg", "height": 443}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Bellevue West High Thunderbirds finished second, edging out third-place Millard West High by the slightest margin.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca022\"", "article_summary": "Bellevue West High Thunderbirds finished second, edging out third-place Millard West High by the slightest margin.\nTheir band was crowned Nebraska's best high school marching band.\nThe Chieftains of Bellevue East High School left their mark Saturday night, and it was red.\nBellevue East percussion instructor Zack Bresler said winning is nice but marching band is about teaching kids life skills like discipline, dedication and teamwork.\nBellevue West's crisp, unison flag work earned the band best color guard."}
