The result could be a more economical use of healthcare dollars, or the end of employer-sponsored healthcare.\n\nA new study by the American Health Policy Institute finds that large employers in the United States expect overall Affordable Care Act-related cost increases of between $163 million and $200 million per employer during the next decade.\n\nEmployers currently spend $578.6 billion annually in providing health coverage for 170.9 million employees, retirees and dependents, according to the study.\n\n\u201cIf the law leads to significant cost increases for them, this would affect the behavior of employers, which could in turn affect how\u2014and even whether\u2014they provide healthcare for their employees,\u201d it states.\n\nThe study finds that over the next decade:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will cost large U.S. employers between $4,800 to $5,900 per employee.\n\nLarge employers expect overall Affordable Care Act-related cost increases of between $163 million and $200 million per employer, or an increase of 4.3 percent in 2016 and 8.4 percent in 2023 over and above what they would otherwise be spending.\n\nBased on these data, the total cost of the Affordable Care Act to all large U.S. employers will be from $151 billion to $186 billion, or 5.9 percent more than what they would otherwise be spending.\n\nLarge employers are responsible for a total of 137.7 million American jobs, and maintaining a healthy workforce continues to be a top priority for them, according to the AHPI.\n\nAccording to the study\u2019s authors, AHPI President Tevi Troy and Chief Economist Mark Wilson, \u201cThese data demonstrate that the added mandates, fees and regulatory burdens associated with the [Affordable Care Act] are increasing the cost of employer-sponsored healthcare plans, with implications for both employers and employees.\u201d\n\nThough the financial impact on individual companies will vary, most are feeling significant pressure to, \u201cmake fundamental changes to their health offerings as a result of the [Affordable Care Act.]\u201d\n\nAccording to Troy and Wilson, it is important for policymakers to see the same data employers are grappling with and understand how it may influence their future benefit and staffing decisions.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "2014-04-03 01:37 PM", "dcterms.modified": "2014-04-03 01:37 PM", "description": "During the next decade, large employers in the United States are expecting increases in the cost of providing healthcare due to the Affordable Care Ac MORE", "dc.description": "During the next decade, large employers in the United States are expecting increases in the cost of providing healthcare due to the Affordable Care Ac MORE", "DC.rights": "/about-terms-of-use-12856.aspx", "dc.date": "2014-04-03 01:37 PM", "last-modified": "2014-04-03 01:37 PM", "dc.source": "http://www.acainternational.org/", "DC.coverage": "World", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "publication_date": "2014-04-03 01:37 PM", "dc.subject": "During the next decade, large employers in the United States are expecting increases in the cost of providing healthcare due to the Affordable Care Ac MORE", "dc.language": "en", "dc.title": "Study: Employers Expect Significant Cost Increases From Affordable Care Act - ACA International"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd106e\"", "article_summary": "The study finds that over the next decade:The Affordable Care Act will cost large U.S. employers between $4,800 to $5,900 per employee.\nDuring the next decade, large employers in the United States are expecting increases in the cost of providing healthcare due to the Affordable Care Act.\nA new study by the American Health Policy Institute finds that large employers in the United States expect overall Affordable Care Act-related cost increases of between $163 million and $200 million per employer during the next decade.\nLarge employers expect overall Affordable Care Act-related cost increases of between $163 million and $200 million per employer, or an increase of 4.3 percent in 2016 and 8.4 percent in 2023 over and above what they would otherwise be spending.\nBased on these data, the total cost of the Affordable Care Act to all large U.S. employers will be from $151 billion to $186 billion, or 5.9 percent more than what they would otherwise be spending."}
