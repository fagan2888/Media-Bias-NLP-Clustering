In an open letter to NFL team owners, Goodell not only owned up to his mishandling of Rice\u2019s suspension and $58,000 fine, but also introduced the league\u2019s new Personal Conduct Policy for assault, battery, domestic violence, and sexual assault cases, carrying the possibility of a six-game suspension for the first offense followed by a lifetime ban for the second offense.\n\n\u201cAt times, however, and despite our best efforts, we fall short of our goals. We clearly did so in response to a recent incident of domestic violence,\u201d Goodell said in the letter. \u201cWe allowed our standards to fall below where they should be and lost an important opportunity to emphasize our strong stance on a critical issue and the effective programs we have in place. My disciplinary decision led the public to question our sincerity, our commitment, and whether we understood the toll that domestic violence inflicts on so many families. I take responsibility both for the decision and for ensuring that our actions in the future properly reflect our values. I didn\u2019t get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will.\u201d\n\nRice\u2019s two-game suspension also coincided with a yearlong ban for Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy. While the NFL\u2019s policy on domestic abuse was not set in stone before its decision this past Thursday, the league\u2019s current substance abuse policy has been in place since 2010. Goodell met with officials from the NFL Players Association, team executives, and anti-violence experts to hammer out the details of the NFL\u2019s Personal Conduct Policy. In addition to guidelines for punishing domestic violence offenders, Goodell also promised to \u201cincorporate domestic violence and sexual assault awareness and prevention into our public service work.\u201d\n\n\u201cEffective immediately, violations of the Personal Conduct Policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault that involve physical force will be subject to a suspension without pay of six games for a first offense, with consideration given to mitigating factors, as well as a longer suspension when circumstances warrant,\u201d Goodell said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "roger, goodell, ray, rice, suspension, domestic, violence", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has introduced the league's new Personal Conduct Policy in response to Ray Rice's questionable suspension.", "title": "NFL Takes Steps To Ensure A Situation Like Ray Rice's Will Not Happen Again", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-apologizes-ray-rice-decision-implements-stricter-penalties-300620", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/roger-goodell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has introduced the league's new Personal Conduct Policy in response to Ray Rice's questionable suspension.", "title": "NFL Takes Steps To Ensure A Situation Like Ray Rice's Will Not Happen Again", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-apologizes-ray-rice-decision-implements-stricter-penalties-300620", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/roger-goodell.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/roger-goodell.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-29T16:49:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T16:49:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has introduced the league's new Personal Conduct Policy in response to Ray Rice's questionable suspension."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced8d\"", "article_summary": "We clearly did so in response to a recent incident of domestic violence,\u201d Goodell said in the letter.\nWhile the NFL\u2019s policy on domestic abuse was not set in stone before its decision this past Thursday, the league\u2019s current substance abuse policy has been in place since 2010.\nFollowing a two-game suspension handed down to Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice over domestic abuse charges, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell received a lot of criticism due to his decision, which he initially defended.\nMy disciplinary decision led the public to question our sincerity, our commitment, and whether we understood the toll that domestic violence inflicts on so many families.\nAnd we will.\u201dRice\u2019s two-game suspension also coincided with a yearlong ban for Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy."}
