Naturally, the left hates this with a white hot passion.\n\nPerhaps you think I\u2019m overstating things? I give you Salon\u2019s Chauncey Devega:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn many ways, Thanksgiving is a celebration of gluttony, sports, nationalism, militarism and waste. While some of the poor and homeless may be fed for a day, the institutions and structures that create income inequality and joblessness remain untouched. The day after Thanksgiving is called \u201cBlack Friday.\u201d It is a festival of consumerist excess and greed. It is one of many moments throughout their lives when the American people are told the lie that \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201ccapitalism\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d are interchangeable. In reality, the gangster and casino capitalism of late 20th and early 20th century America is incompatible with a true \u201cWe the People\u201d democracy.\n\nAt base, the left hates Thanksgiving because it is a holiday built around a sense of contentment. Not an absolute contentment. Thanksgiving is not a statement that all is well with the world; it\u2019s actually much smaller than that. Thanksgiving is a day off to count blessings, to remember either verbally or more informally some of the things we have going for us as families, as Americans, as people living in a glorious time with many benefits in terms of health and happiness that previous generations could only dream about.\n\nIf Christmas is defined by the nuclear family and the joy of children opening gifts, Thanksgiving is the more adult spectacle of extended family spending casual time together outside the usual limitations of work or the daily routine. It\u2019s a time to catch up with people we don\u2019t always see but who played a role in our lives nonetheless.\n\nThe left\u2019s response to this has been entirely predictable. A political party that thrives on crisis to demand change does not want even one day wasted on giving thanks for what we have. So, of course, they seek to make this holiday just one more opportunity for leftist agitprop. In what has become a new holiday tradition, the Democratic National Committee and other like-minded websites put out Thanksgiving talking points aimed at turning the holiday into a scene from an Aaron Sorkin TV show.\n\nThese pre-scripted lines are always framed as a defensive action to guard against a conservative onslaught, but \u201cyour Republican uncle\u201d is a boogeyman created to scare the insecure and immature into becoming the aggressors in the left\u2019s endless cultural war. Again, here\u2019s Salon\u2019s Devega:\n\nOn Thanksgiving, the American people should, instead of being thankful for what they have\u2013and by doing so playing along with a tired mythology of American genocide and slavery\u2013should inaugurate a day of political activism and resistance.\n\nNo, they should not do that. On the contrary, the very best thing Americans can do in the face of the left\u2019s attempts to politicize Thanksgiving is to utterly ignore them. Turn on the parade or the game. Have a beer. Tell a joke. Remember how much you have in common with your extended family. And when you reach for that second helping of your favorite dish, be thankful.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanksgiving is when Americans celebrate their family in the least political way.
