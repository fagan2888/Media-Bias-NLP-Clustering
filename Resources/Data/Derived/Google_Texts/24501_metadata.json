The Bureau of Labor statistics reported on Friday that the proportion of people in the workforce, 63 percent, is at its highest level in two years.\n\nThat\u2019s good news. But there\u2019s even better news that 37,000 of the 215,000 new jobs were in the high-paying health-care sector. Over the past year, employment in health care has jumped by 503,000.\n\nRelated: Top 5 Industries for Job Hunters in 2016\n\nBLS projects that of the 30 fastest growing occupations over the next decade, health care prevails with 20 different jobs. The agency also anticipates job growth of 19 percent within the sector over the next decade, resulting in an additional 2.3 million jobs.\n\nThe two primary reasons driving the growth are that more people can access health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and the baby boomer generation is aging into Medicare.\n\nAnd there\u2019s even more good news, as we reported just a few days ago: not all of the health care jobs require years and years of medical school. Requirements for these positions range from getting a license to receiving a graduate degree, though obtaining additional accreditation usually leads to higher salaries and more advanced jobs.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Job Seekers\n\nBelow are the 50 top-paying careers in health care (low to high), along with the minimum education requirements for each position and their median salaries.
