It\u2019s the first time the virus has been diagnosed outside of Western Africa, where it\u2019s killed more than 3,000 people, and the news has sparked some concern about the deadly virus spreading within our borders.\n\nBut health experts have been clear about the fact that there\u2019s virtually no risk of Ebola spreading widely throughout the this country. \u201cI have no doubt that we\u2019ll stop this in its tracks in the U.S.,\u201d CDC director Thomas Friedan said at Tuesday\u2019s press conference.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the current Ebola outbreak is ravaging countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone, and it\u2019s true that the international community is worried about being able to contain it in those impoverished regions with weak health care infrastructures. Ebola is a very serious problem for Western Africa, and it was only a matter of time before someone exposed to the virus got on a plane to the United States. But there are a couple reasons why the epidemic won\u2019t have the same deadly impact on U.S. soil.\n\nFirst of all, the United States has the resources it needs to effectively be able to contain the virus. Our sophisticated hospital system can easily isolate patients so they don\u2019t spread Ebola to other people, and medical experts have been preparing for weeks for an eventual diagnosis in the U.S. The epidemiologist at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where the infected patient is currently being treated, told press that the staff has \u201chad a plan in place for some time now for a patient presenting with possible Ebola\u201d and is \u201cwell prepared to care for this patient.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Ebola isn\u2019t actually that easy to catch. While it is a communicable disease \u2014 which is what makes it sound scary to most people \u2014 it can only be spread through direct contact with an infected person\u2019s bodily fluids. And it\u2019s only contagious once a sick person starts displaying symptoms, which include vomiting and diarrhea. So you can\u2019t get Ebola by standing next to someone who coughs or breathes on you \u2014 and you can\u2019t catch it from a seemingly healthy person sitting near you on a plane.\n\nThat\u2019s why, although the CDC will continue to monitor the handful of people who may have come into close contact with the Dallas patient, they\u2019re not worried about the other passengers who were on his recent flight from Liberia. There\u2019s essentially no chance that Ebola spread to any of them.\n\nWe already have evidence that Ebola can be stopped. In Nigeria, which is home to a sophisticated emergency medical center financed by Bill and Melinda Gates, the government has effectively been able to contain the outbreak. Nigeria enjoys many of the same advantages over the countries that are still experiencing the brunt of the disease, like a greater number of highly trained doctors, as the United States does.\n\nDespite all of the evidence that Americans don\u2019t need to be worried about Ebola here at home, however, it\u2019s clear that many people aren\u2019t listening. According to a recent poll conducted by Harvard researchers, about 40 percent of Americans believe there will be a widespread Ebola outbreak on U.S. soil within the next year, and a quarter of them are worried that someone in their immediate family will catch the virus. The researchers who did that polling concluded that the media needs to do a better job of emphasizing exactly how Ebola is spread, noting that pop culture may play a role in exacerbating people\u2019s fears of pandemics.\n\nThe issue is perhaps complicated further by the fact that Ebola truly is a devastating tragedy for the people living in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where the public health outbreak is descending into an economic crisis. The U.S. military is ramping up its operations in Liberia, but the international community is still struggling to do enough to respond. It\u2019s difficult for the media to emphasize the severity of the issue in Western Africa while effectively diffusing concerns about Ebola\u2019s impact on developed nations.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "We've diagnosed the first Ebola case on U.S. soil, but that doesn't mean we have a public health crisis within our borders.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "We've diagnosed the first Ebola case on U.S. soil, but that doesn't mean we have a public health crisis within our borders.", "title": "A Bunch Of Things Americans Believe About Ebola That Aren\u2019t Actually True", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/01/3574246/ebola-outbreak-united-states/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP189473063917.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We've diagnosed the first Ebola case on U.S. soil, but that doesn't mean we have a public health crisis within our borders.", "title": "A Bunch Of Things Americans Believe About Ebola That Aren\u2019t Actually True", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP189473063917-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP189473063917.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP189473063917.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-01T09:01:56+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0658\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s essentially no chance that Ebola spread to any of them.\nDespite all of the evidence that Americans don\u2019t need to be worried about Ebola here at home, however, it\u2019s clear that many people aren\u2019t listening.\nOur sophisticated hospital system can easily isolate patients so they don\u2019t spread Ebola to other people, and medical experts have been preparing for weeks for an eventual diagnosis in the U.S.\nBut health experts have been clear about the fact that there\u2019s virtually no risk of Ebola spreading widely throughout the this country.\nIt\u2019s true that the current Ebola outbreak is ravaging countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone, and it\u2019s true that the international community is worried about being able to contain it in those impoverished regions with weak health care infrastructures."}
