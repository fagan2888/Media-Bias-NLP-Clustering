At the end of October, there was sexual assault reported near the Koffler Building on the UA campus.\n\nDozens of students marched through their University on Saturday to draw attention the serious topic.\n\n\n\n\"Our credibility as victims should not be decided by what we wear,\"\u201d said UA sophomore Madison Steinke.\n\n\n\n\"Slut Walk\" is an international movement that started four years ago in Canada in response to comments from Toronto police officers who said if women want to avoid getting sexually assaulted, they should stop dressing like sluts.\n\n\n\n'If I'm dressed provocatively or dress in a certain way, that does not by any means give anyone consent to touch me or to rape me,\" said Cissy Morgan.\n\n\n\nNot everyone was supportive of the way the group tried to get its message out.\n\n\n\n\"I think it wasn\u2019t the right way to go about it,\" a local mother said.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line, students hope it starts a conversation about the seriousness of sexual assault.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe they\"ll start to reevaluate how they talk to people in their own lives,\" said junior Ndekela Sakala.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Arizona Police encourage students to use the campus safe ride for a free way to travel between buildings and lots at night.\n\nIf you or someone you know becomes a victim of sex assault, you are encouraged to report it to police right away.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
