With an annual cost burden of $33 billion, and 100,000 patients suffering as a result, physician oversight stands as one of the most easily preventable forms of malpractice, the researchers argue.\n\n\"Every hospital should see this research as a call to action,\u201d said study leader and Centennial Professor of Health Policy at Columbia Nursing, Dr. Patricia Stone, in a statement. \u201cIt's just unconscionable that we're not doing every single thing we can, every day, for every patient, to avoid preventable infections.\u201d\n\nStone and her team\u2019s investigation is the first since the 1970s to critically analyze hospital infection prevention measures \u2014 around the same time the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first linked infection rates to facilities\u2019 lack of oversight. Since then, the majority of hospitals have implemented a system of some variety that details, explicitly, the bedside requirements for each patient, from the hospital imperative of hand washing to information on how often a patient\u2019s catheter must be changed.\n\nThe problem is, these checklists \u2014 crafted in nine of every 10 hospitals, Stone and her team found \u2014 are followed far less often. Three out of every four ICUs had checklists to ensure patients who need a ventilator to breathe for them were receiving help to prevent pneumonia infections, but only half of those hospitals ever followed their checklists. The researchers point out keeping a patient\u2019s head above his feet is a simple way to prevent such an infection. Also of concern were urinary catheters, which don\u2019t come with a universal checklist and fared even worse. Less than a third of hospitals had bedside rules for preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) and among those that did, rules were followed less than 30 percent of the time.\n\n\"Hospitals aren't following the rules they put in place themselves to keep patients safe,\" said Stone, whose research on healthcare-associated infections has been published extensively. \"Rules don't keep patients from dying unless they're enforced.\"\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to make sure the rules are enforced, Stone and her team suggest, is to hire someone whose only job is to make sure hospital staff follows those rules. More than a third of hosptials in the study had no such employee on staff.\n\nAlternatively, hospitals may take advantage of electronic monitoring systems that act as an honest broker for bedside staff, keeping tabs on which parts of the checklist have been fulfilled and which haven\u2019t. These systems issue hospital staff \u201creport cards\u201d and have shown success in prior studies to increase hand washing rates, among other positive outcomes.\n\n\"We've come a long way in understanding what causes healthcare-associated infections and how to prevent them,\" Stone concluded. \"This study shows we still have a long way to go in compliance with well-established, life-saving and cost-saving measures that we know will lower infection rates.\"\n\nSource: Stone P, Pogorzelska-Maziarz M, Herzig C.
