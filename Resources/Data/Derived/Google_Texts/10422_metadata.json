Cuomo charged Tuesday.\n\nCuomo, in his annual budget address, blasted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for dragging its feet on a state request to reinvest $10 billion of the $17 billion the state saved the feds through Medicaid reforms.\n\nEighteen months after the state submitted its request to use the funds to restructure New York\u2019s outdated health care system for the poor, the feds have still not ruled.\n\nThree teetering hospitals in Brooklyn \u2014 Brookdale Hospital, Interfaith Medical Center and Long Island College Hospital \u2014 will close if approval is not granted soon, the governor said.\n\nCuomo referred to the situation as a \u201ccrisis\u201d and noted that Brooklyn has more people combined than San Francisco, Boston and Washington.\n\nPresident Obama's health care reform could be negatively affected in New York by delaying approval to use $10 billion to bolster the state's health care for the poor, Gov. Cuomo contends. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nCuomo has been under pressure from community members to save the hospitals. He said Tuesday that the ball was in the federal government\u2019s court.\n\n\u201cWe need HHS to act on our waiver now as we have no alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cThe size and scope of the problems defy state solution.\u201d\n\nCuomo made a similar plea in May in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nFederal officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nLong Island College Hospital in Brooklyn is one of three facilities that face closure if approval isn't granted to use federal money to save it, Gov. Cuomo says. (Mark Bonifacio/New York Daily News)\n\nState Health Commissioner Nirav Shah said Health and Human Services approved similar requests from Texas and California in far less time.\n\nHe said the state\u2019s implementation of Obamacare could also be affected by the delay.\n\nSources said Cuomo has been discussing the matter with the state\u2019s congressional delegation. He met Tuesday with Brooklyn state legislators at the governor\u2019s mansion about the issue.\n\nCuomo in his budget plan proposed a $1.2 billion capital program for struggling hospitals.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "KENNETH LOVETT", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration has signed the death certificates of three struggling Brooklyn hospitals and jeopardized the success of Obamacare in New York, Gov.
