Holland Co. of Northbrook, Ill., finished its 2013 fiscal year \u2014 ended Sept. 30 \u2014 below budget in pounds because of resin availability.\n\n\u201cThere always used to be material available,\u201d M. Holland owner Ed Holland said. \u201cYou could call [resin makers] at the last minute. That\u2019s not true today. It\u2019s almost like [resin makers] are making resin to order.\u201d\n\n\u201cComing out of the gate after a strong 2012, we expected high single-digit growth, so [2013] has been a little disappointing,\u201d said Kurt Schuering, president of Avon Lake, Ohio-based PolyOne Distribution. The business \u2014 a unit of compounding and concentrates leader PolyOne Corp. \u2014 ranks as one of North America\u2019s largest resin distributors.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 2013, PolyOne Distribution posted sales of $818 million, up almost 4 percent vs. the same period in 2012. The unit\u2019s operating income was flat in the same comparison at just under $50 million.\n\nSchuering added that the automotive and building and construction markets were \u201chot spots\u201d for PolyOne in 2013, but he also said the firm had concerns about the health care market \u2014 its largest distribution sector \u2014 because of potential impacts of the Affordable Care Act and a tax on medical devices.\n\nResin availability also has affected PolyOne in 2013 through product rationalization, where resin makers have eliminated some grades in their portfolios. This has led to fewer grades being available and customers needing to requalify materials, Schuering explained.\n\nAnd even though H. Muehlstein & Co. Inc. has enjoyed double-digit growth in 2013, it\u2019s been \u201ca challenging year,\u201d according to senior vice president and general manager David Skoczen.\n\n\u201cWith [resin] producers so successful in getting prices up, it\u2019s been another year where sales volume is an everyday challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very competitive.\u201d\n\nWilton, Conn.-based Muehlstein is owned by Belgian conglomerate Ravago Group, which also distributes resin in North America through its Ravago Holdings Americas unit. Ravago\u2019s purchase of PET distributors Burcham International and Meckler & Associates in late 2012 has been \u201cvery accretive\u201d to total sales, Skoczen said.\n\nAt Chase Plastic Services Inc. in Clarkston, Mich., owner Kevin Chase said that uncertainty in Washington D.C. and from state governments \u201cis driving us nuts and stalling any kind of recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw a forecast of 2 percent economic growth for the next eight years,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s not really growth. What happened this year is limited growth. It\u2019s nice that the auto market came back and that we\u2019re building a few more homes, but [growth] is not robust. It\u2019s preventing us from taking off.\u201d\n\nChase\u2019s firm is doing well in spite of these limitations, with sales and volume in pounds both on track to be up 8 percent versus. 2012. Automotive in particular has been good to chase in 2013.\n\n\u201cSome transnationals are building assembly plants here [in North America] and they\u2019re willing to look at domestic suppliers,\u201d Kevin Chase said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nThe year has been \u201cfairly good\u201d for Nexeo Solutions LLC as well, with the firm posting sales growth above U.S. GDP growth rates of 2.5 percent, according to Shawn Williams, senior vice president of plastics for Nexeo, which is based in The Woodlands, Texas.\n\n\u201cWe saw growth in automotive and health care and had a geographic expansion by opening a sales office in Mexico City,\u201d he said. \u201cThe long-term outlook for automotive is strong, not only for builds but for material replacement opportunities. We\u2019re going to have a long run in the auto market.\u201d\n\nBut Williams added that customers haven\u2019t added much processing capacity in 2013.\n\n\u201cIf you look within some segments, specific customers may have added production, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of growth overall,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough exact totals are unavailable, it\u2019s widely believed that Ravago/Muehlstein, Nexeo, PolyOne and M. Holland are the region\u2019s four largest resin distributors.\n\nInto 2014\n\nBeyond 2013, the larger narrative for North American resin distributors will be the impact of large amounts of new resin capacity set to hit the region in the next five years. Most of the new announcements have centered around polyethylene, although additions to polypropylene, PVC and PET capacity are expected as well. PE, PP and PET additions could impact distributors. Not much PVC is sold through distribution channels.\n\nThe PE, PP and PVC additions are being driven by newfound supplies of shale gas that are providing plentiful ethane and propane feedstocks. PET additions are being driven by feedstock logistics for that material and by an ultra-competitive PET market.\n\nRavago recently acknowledged the expected impact of this new resin when it formed Genesis Polymers, a new business channel that will focus on bulk commodity sales to North American processors. RHA president James Duffy said in a news release that Genesis is being launched with future North American polyolefin capacity expansions in mind.\n\n\u201cShale gas revitalized the [resin] market,\u201d said Williams at Nexeo. \u201cBut the first question is will all this new capacity be built. We\u2019re well-positioned either way. Some [resin] suppliers have downsized their sales staffs, but we\u2019ve added to ours because we\u2019re expected to play a key role.\u201d\n\nHe added that with the new resin, North American resin markets \u201cshould have stable supply, with less volatility and fewer turnarounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cLonger-term, I have to believe that having two low-cost regions [in North America and the Middle East] will bring more stability in pricing and production for the polyolefins market,\u201d added Schuering at PolyOne.\n\nBut PE supplies will continue to be tight until the new capacity comes on line, according to Ed Holland at M. Holland. That will call for \u201ca change of behavior\u201d among some customers, including more forecasting and better planning, he said.\n\n\u201cSome customers haven\u2019t evolved as quickly on inventory as others,\u201d Ed Holland added. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to [evolve] in order to survive, because the volume of feedstock changes keeps getting bigger. Dealing with supply and volatility takes up more of management\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThe other part of the resin narrative holds that new and affordable supply will lead the region\u2019s processors to install more capacity \u2014 in the form of film lines, blow molding machines, injection molding machines and other types of processing equipment \u2014 as the new material spurs innovation and leads to increased demand for finished products, both within the region and in export markets.\n\n\u201cI can buy into some of that reshoring talk, but our customers are being cautious \u2014 they haven\u2019t really done anything yet as far as adding capacity,\u201d said Skoczen at Muehlstein. \u201cI can see some business coming back to North America from the Far East.\u201d\n\nHe added that within North America, the packaging sector could help some of that new resin find a home when it arrives.\n\n\u201cPackaging has been very solid,\u201d Skoczen said. \u201cCustomers are looking for innovations, and there\u2019s a lot of development work in the pipeline. That market is still evolving.\u201d\n\nUncertainty exists\n\nBut in spite of strong long-term expectations, distribution executives said that they sensed some hesitancy among their resin-consuming customers in 2013.\n\n\u201cSome major processors are going out and going after new programs,\u201d said Kevin Chase at Chase. \u201cBut smaller companies that tend to have 20 or 30 machines, they look at uncertainty and say they might not be able to buy new equipment or build a 25,000 square-foot addition or hire two or three more sales people.\u201d\n\nThe trend of resin buyers buying more frequently but making smaller purchases also continued in 2013, according to PolyOne\u2019s Schuering.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got challenges with working capital and cash flow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd price volatility also is affecting them. Big customers tend to be tied into a [resin pricing] index but distributors have smaller customers, and those customers are very susceptible to price swings of 14-16 cents per pound.\u201d\n\nCustomers \u201cdon\u2019t want to take on too much material so they don\u2019t get stuck with high-priced resin,\u201d Schuering added.\n\nMuehlstein\u2019s Skoczen raised the possibility that customers still might be rattled from surviving the recession. \u201c2008 and 2009 still seem not far away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a traumatic experience for a lot of us \u2014 and customers now are cautious about how to expand.\u201d\n\nAcquisitions increased\n\nTheir customers might not have been active in recent months, but distributors were much more active in buying and selling competitors in the last 18 months. The pace of acquisitions increased as distributors looked for competitive advantages.\n\nRavago has led the way in this category. In addition to its pair of PET-related acquisitions, the firm bought distributor/compounder Amco Plastic Materials Inc. in late 2011, elastomer processor/trader Goldsmith & Eggleton Inc. in early 2012 and just in October purchased resin distributor A-Top Polymers Inc. In other plastics deals, Ravago in 2012 formed Ravago Avangard Innovatice, a recycling services joint venture, and in July bought the expandable polystyrene resin business of Styron LLC.\n\nM. Holland entered the M&A field in late 2012 when the firm \u2014 which was founded in 1950 \u2014 made its first-ever acquisition by buying resin distributor Christler Chemical & Plastics Inc. And Ed Holland has said his firm is looking to make more such deals if they fit what his company is looking for.\n\nEven materials firm A. Schulman Inc. \u2014 which has a far larger distribution presence in Europe than it does in the U.S. \u2014 got into the act in May when it bought Network Polymers, an Akron, Ohio-based compounder that also distributes some engineering resins. Fairlawn, Ohio-based Schulman then evened out its trans-Atlantic mix in September when it added British compounder/distributor Perrite Group.\n\nPolyOne has chosen to grow organically in the last two years, adding warehousing sites in Costa Rica and China.\n\nDistributors also are increasing their ranks internally. Chase said his firm will add a sales rep this month and two more in 2014. Schuering added that PolyOne \u201cwill continue to invest in our industry teams\u201d in the areas of health care, transportation, electrical/electronic and wire and cable.\n\nEd Holland said that adding sales reps has been an ongoing process for his firm as its growth rate has picked up in recent years.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just keep adding more and more customers to the same number of sales reps,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be a major resource for our customers.\u201d\n\nHolland also added a film line at a Chicago-area lab in 2013 and plans to add more lab equipment and personnel in 2014.\n\nAs expected, in-fighting among regional distributors remains alive and well in 2013.\n\n\u201cA customer might see polycarbonate from you at one price, and then the next guy goes a nickel down,\u201d Kevin Chase said.\n\nFirms optimistic\n\nLooking to 2014 sales, Skoczen said that Muehlstein \u201chas quiet confidence\u201d that it can match its 2013 performance next year. Schuering added that PolyOne is looking to get back to high single-digit growth next year. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty optimistic that we can grow beyond GDP in focused markets,\u201d he said. At Nexeo, Williams said that his firm in 2014 \u201cexpects to deliver little above the growth we had this year because of our vertical market approach.\u201d\n\nChase is more blunt about his firm\u2019s expectations: \u201cWe can do 8 percent again next year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to because our suppliers are demanding it. We have to figure out a way how to.\u201d\n\nNone of the distribution execs contacted for this story said that their firms were actively planning to add material suppliers to their line cards in 2014. Kevin Chase said that his firm \u201cis always looking\u201d for new suppliers,\u201d while Skoczen said Muehlstein was curious about new suppliers that might enter the market when resin expansions arrive.\n\n\u201cWe might focus on some new grades in areas like electronics,\u201d PolyOne\u2019s Schuering said. \u201cWe have the industry\u2019s leading line card right now, with the best suppliers across the board.\u201d\n\nWilliams was presenting a similar message at Nexeo. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed a few suppliers in the past and might be looking to fill some niches,\u201d he said. \u201cBut overall we\u2019re excited to be aligned with industry leaders in key market segments.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Plastics News", "description": "It\u2019s widely believed that when Alexander the Great saw the breadth of his domain, he wept \u2014 for there were no more worlds to conquer.If that really happened, Alexander would have been better off as a North American resin distributor, because to hear them tell it, they still have a lot", "title": "Optimism reigns supreme for resin distributors - Plastics News", "url": "http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20131210/NEWS/131219997/optimism-reigns-supreme-for-resin-distributors", "image": "http://www.plasticsnews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/PN/20131210/NEWS/131219997/AR/0/distribution-cartoon-Rich-Williams-2014.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.plasticsnews.com/assets/rwd/logo-small@2x.png", "description": "It\u2019s widely believed that when Alexander the Great saw the breadth of his domain, he wept \u2014 for there were no more worlds to conquer.If that really happened, Alexander would have been better off as a North American resin distributor, because to hear them tell it, they still have a lot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Optimism reigns supreme for resin distributors - Plastics News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe3d\"", "article_summary": "(Resin sales data from Alexander\u2019s reign as ruler of Macedonia, Persia and Egypt from 336-323 BC was unavailable.)\nThe business \u2014 a unit of compounding and concentrates leader PolyOne Corp. \u2014 ranks as one of North America\u2019s largest resin distributors.\nResin availability also has affected PolyOne in 2013 through product rationalization, where resin makers have eliminated some grades in their portfolios.\nOptimism reigns supreme for resin distributorsSHARE \u00d7 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+It\u2019s widely believed that when Alexander the Great saw the breadth of his domain, he wept \u2014 for there were no more worlds to conquer.\nInto 2014Beyond 2013, the larger narrative for North American resin distributors will be the impact of large amounts of new resin capacity set to hit the region in the next five years."}
