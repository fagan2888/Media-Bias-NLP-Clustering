That was a mistake, since enrollment and the cost of treating all those jumping onto the program is surging beyond expectations.\n\nAt first, ObamaCare tried to force states to expand eligibility for Medicaid by including childless adults and people with incomes 38% above the poverty line. In 2012, the Supreme Court blocked this attempt, making expansion optional for states.\n\nTwo dozen states immediately took the bait, lured by the promise the federal government would pay 100% of costs in the first three years and 90% for the newly eligible on into the future. Several more have joined since.\n\nAn analysis by the Associated Press finds that this was short-sighted folly. At least 14 of these states have seen enrollment surge unexpectedly, forcing at least half to increase their cost estimates. And we\u2019re not talking about a few percentage points.\n\n\u0095 In Kentucky, more than twice as many signed up for Medicaid than the state had projected. That\u2019s forced Kentucky to more than double its projected Medicaid costs for 2017.\n\n\u0095 In California, almost 2.3 million enrolled \u2014 nearly triple what the state planned on. Today, 1 in 3 Californians are on Medicaid.\n\n\u0095 In Ohio, Medicaid costs more than doubled after Republican Gov. John Kasich decided to expand the program, and Michigan\u2019s shot up 50%, the AP reports.\n\nOverall, Medicaid rolls climbed a stunning 28% in these expansion states.\n\nAt the same time, these new enrollees are costing far more to treat than expected.\n\nInstead of costing slightly less than those currently on the program, new enrollees\u2019 health costs were 19% higher, a government report found .\n\nFor the left, none of this really matters, since the goal all along has been to get as many people dependent on government for health care as possible. Which is why the Obama administration is busy putting increasing pressure on the holdout states to get in line.\n\nFor those who thought expanding Medicaid would save states money, these developments should be deeply troubling.\n\nMedicaid is already the single biggest program on state budgets, and its explosive growth has started to crowd out basic needs like education. This will only get worse as the full effects of ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid plan emerge.\n\nIncredibly, despite these warning signs, even some Republicans who until now had resisted Medicaid\u2019s expansion are going wobbly.\n\nIn April, Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature approved Medicaid expansion. They\u2019re waiting on the feds to approve some waivers to the program before it can take effect.\n\nUtah is looking for a way to do the same.\n\nTo some degree, you can excuse those Republicans who decided to boost their Medicaid rolls for not knowing exactly what they were getting themselves into. But any governor who does so now, in the face of this hard evidence, is being irresponsible.\n\nThey\u2019re also taking the nation a big step closer to the left\u2019s ultimate goal of a single-payer system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welfare: During the debates on ObamaCare, Medicaid got little attention.
