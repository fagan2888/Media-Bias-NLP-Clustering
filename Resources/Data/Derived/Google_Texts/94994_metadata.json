When Michael Bloomberg, one of his favorite targets, left office in 2013, Moss concluded that New York had lost, at a minimum, 6,926 years of history in the erosion of small businesses during his three terms. \u201cPerusing the list\u201d of shuttered stores, wrote Kristin Iversen, \u201cwas not unlike looking through a high school yearbook, only finding out that practically everyone had died.\u201d\n\nBut devotion to the past, as Susan Sontag observed, is \u201cone of the more disastrous forms of unrequited love.\u201d These days, Moss is looking toward old friends who are still alive \u2014 shifting his business from headstones to healthcare, if you will.\n\nIn December, after a hugely popular but unsuccessful movement to save Cafe Edison, the theater district diner with high ceilings and low prices, Moss started a campaign called \u201cSave NYC\u201d to protect the city\u2019s commercial heritage.\n\nIn Manhattan, retail rents are up 40 percent since 2005. In Lower Manhattan, the average retail rent is now $265 per square foot \u2014 up from $92 in 2005. That rent hike has concurred with a spike in chain stores: According to the Center for an Urban Future, Manhattan now has 2,807 chain stores, a 10 percent increase since 2009. The citywide total has risen 18 percent in that time. And while no one but Moss tracks the closing of places like Pearl Paint and Avignone, there\u2019s a widespread sense that the city is losing older stores at a rapid clip.\n\nFrom a Facebook page, Moss has now developed a website, nurtured a hashtag (if such a thing can be said) \u2014 #SaveNYC \u2014 and assembled a policy agenda. He\u2019s advertised his plans in the New York Daily News and been featured on the local TV news and CNBC. Soon, he hopes to have \u201cSave NYC\u201d signs in the storefronts of mom \u2019n\u2019 pops across the city.\n\nThe political objectives: Fine landlords who leave commercial spaces vacant, end tax breaks for multinationals, zone out chain stores, start a \u201ccultural landmarks\u201d program, and pass the \u201cSmall Business Jobs Survival Act,\u201d a negotiating guideline for commercial tenants and landlords.\n\nCaf\u00e9 Edison, where the playwright August Wilson once wrote his dialogue on napkins, eventually succumbed to the landlord\u2019s desire to open a high-end restaurant in the space. But the movement to save it was instructive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Manhattan, retail rents are up 40 percent since 2005. The face of the city is changing.
