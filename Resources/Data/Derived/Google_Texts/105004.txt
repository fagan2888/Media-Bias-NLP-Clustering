The crowd came from all over the world.

Two fans traveled all the way from Australia to see the future Hall of Famer.

"To me he's the greatest ever, the goat," said one fan.

The main attraction at the last Thunder home game was not the Thunder; it was the Lakers’ Kobe Bryant.

"Oh, it's not surprising. It's been like this all season,” said Kevin Durant. “He's a pioneer in my opinion."

It didn't end well. Bryant scored 13 points and then sat out the rest of the game.

"I tried to loosen up coming out of the locker room,” explained Bryant. “Coming out, I couldn't move well at all, that and the fact we were losing by 40."

But now, it’s time to reflect with only one game left on his journey.

"I spent most of my time to the connectivity that sports has to everything that surrounds us, so I think sports has a deeper connection to human nature," Bryant stated.

The Thunder players made sure to honor him in his last road game for his NBA career. Each one of them wrote personal reflections on their time playing against him and they honored him with a book before the game.

"It takes time for players to be able to do that and I think the biggest thing is to have those memories, especially very personal things," said Bryant.

"Heard he got a lifetime supply of Jordan's,” Durant added. “All our guys wrote a little small message for him and hopefully he appreciates it.”

Now with one last game against Utah, fans got to see this legend's last ride and a legacy left.

"Feel really excited and very happy and looking forward to lacing them up one more time," said Bryant.
