An fire early Saturday morning destroyed one building at the Heartland Truss Plant in Hays and damaged a second building. A drone caught it on camera.

Firefighters were called around 4:40 a.m. to a fire at the plant at 710 General Custer Road.

The Hays Post reports about 30 firefighters battled the fire.

“It burned down and is a total loss but we were able to salvage the east building,” Ellis County Rural Fire Director Dick Klaus told the Post.

Dylan Thomas lives nearby and said he woke up thinking he heard thunder but then fell back asleep. His wife woke him up again and said “there’s a fire and the fire department is here.”

The Thomas’s house is located less than 250 feet from the truss plant.

“We could feel the heat from the fire as we stood on our porch,” Thomas said.

There were no injuries.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.
