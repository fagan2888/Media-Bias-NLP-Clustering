I've been critical of the various listicle attempts to portray the shutdown as the fault of some small, nebulous band of Bolsheviks. Those \"30 Republicans caused the shutdown\" theories don't appreciate how conservative the median Republican is now.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nSo: 144 House Republicans, or 62 percent of the conference, voted against the final deal that gave Republicans nothing but income verification for Obamacare recipients. Eighteen Republican senators, 39 percent of their caucus, voted against the deal\u2014appointed New Jersey Sen. Jeff Chiesa voted \"aye\" as he literally headed out the door, and Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe was absent, recuperating from surgery.\n\nThe Senate \"no\" votes were basically divvied between the vocal hardliners like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and the silent partners like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson\u2014the guys who did not join in the fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n- The blue-staters split at random. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both of whom having criticized the \"defund\" strategy, were ayes. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and Nevada Sen. Dean Heller voted no.\n\n- The survivors of Tea Party primary challenges voted aye. After the vote, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski passed by Arizona Sen. John McCain, who was conducting an interview with NPR in a scrum of reporters. \"Next time, be more constructive, huh?\" heckled Murkowski, as a joke. McCain and the reporters cracked up. \"Thank you, good leadership,\" said Murkowski.\n\nIn 2010, Murkowski survived a narrow primary loss and won re-election as a write-in candidate. Sarah Palin has intermittently threatened to run against her. McCain fended off a primary challenge, too, as did Indiana Sen. Dan Coats (he survived a crowded primary with two more right-wing candidates), Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, and Ayotte. They were joined by a few senators who faced challenges in 2014, like Lindsey Graham and Lamar Alexander. This is the downside of the conservative revolt\u2014if the target stops fearing you, he goes from ignoring you to not taking you seriously. When I asked Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker what he made of the Club for Growth scoring his \"aye\" vote against him, he smiled and replied: \"I confess, I didn't see that.\"\n\nThe House votes were more complicated.\n\n- Most Senate candidates voted no. Mostly. Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton and West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, who are trying to take over seats now held by Democrats, voted for the deal. But Louisiana Rep. Bill Cassidy and all of the Georgia Republicans running for Senate (Broun, Gingrey, Kingston) voted no, as did Montana Rep. Steve Daines, who might run. Cotton and Capito have scared off primary challengers. Those still worried about primaries went with the Club for Growth's position.\n\n- Republicans in blue seats voted aye. Sixteen Republicans now hold districts that voted for Barack Obama in 2012. Fourteen of them voted for the deal; retiring Florida Rep. Bill Young did not vote. The exception: California Rep. Jeff Denham. This might all be obvious, but I want/need to poke the \"gerrymandering doesn't matter\" crowd as often as I can.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Here Are the Republicans Who Voted to Stop the Shutdown and Will Be Primaried Tomorrow", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "The roll calls for last night's shutdown-ending compromise offer us the umpteenth look at the GOP's at-risk members, their hardliners, and their break- ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The roll calls for last night's shutdown-ending compromise offer us the umpteenth look at the GOP's at-risk members, their hardliners, and their break- ...", "title": "Here Are the Republicans Who Voted to Stop the Shutdown and Will Be Primaried Tomorrow", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/17/here_are_the_republicans_who_voted_to_stop_the_shutdown_and_will_be_primaried.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/17/here_are_the_republicans_who_voted_to_stop_the_shutdown_and_will_be_primaried/163770190.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The roll calls for last night's shutdown-ending compromise offer us the umpteenth look at the GOP's at-risk members, their hardliners, and their break- ...", "title": "Here Are the Republicans Who Voted to Stop the Shutdown and Will Be Primaried Tomorrow", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/17/here_are_the_republicans_who_voted_to_stop_the_shutdown_and_will_be_primaried.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/17/here_are_the_republicans_who_voted_to_stop_the_shutdown_and_will_be_primaried/163770190.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@daveweigel", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-17T09:54:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Here Are the Republicans Who Voted to Stop the Shutdown and Will Be Primaried Tomorrow", "sailthru.headline": "Here Are the Republicans Who Voted to Stop the Shutdown and Will Be Primaried Tomorrow", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Here Are the Republicans Who Voted to Stop the Shutdown and Will Be Primaried Tomorrow\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/17/here_are_the_republicans_who_voted_to_stop_the_shutdown_and_will_be_primaried.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/17/here_are_the_republicans_who_voted_to_stop_the_shutdown_and_will_be_primaried/163770190.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"200131017002\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-17T09:54:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"David Weigel\",\n  \"tags\": [\"government shutdown\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Here Are the Republicans Who Voted to Stop the Shutdown and Will Be Primaried Tomorrow", "keywords": "government shutdown, house republicans", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "government shutdown, house republicans", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://facebook.com/daveweigel"}, "sailthru.description": "The roll calls for last night's shutdown-ending compromise offer us the umpteenth look at the GOP's at-risk members, their hardliners, and their break- ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/weigel/2013/10/17/here_are_the_republicans_who_voted_to_stop_the_shutdown_and_will_be_primaried/163770190.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2860\"", "article_summary": "- Republicans in blue seats voted aye.\nSo: 144 House Republicans, or 62 percent of the conference, voted against the final deal that gave Republicans nothing but income verification for Obamacare recipients.\n- The survivors of Tea Party primary challenges voted aye.\nEighteen Republican senators, 39 percent of their caucus, voted against the deal\u2014appointed New Jersey Sen.
