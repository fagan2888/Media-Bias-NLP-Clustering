TA Associates Invests in Travel Software RateGain

The deal follows travel software acquisitions from Sonata Software and Thoma Bravo

Boston private equity firm TA Associates has closed a minority investment in technology business RateGain.

RateGain, headquartered in Noida, India, provides revenue management and distribution channel management software, as well as real-time pricing data and analytics, that aims to help businesses streamline operations and sales. The company provides services mainly to the hospitality and travel industries.

TA's investment should help RateGain expand in the North America and Asia Pacific regions. Naveen Wadhera, co-head of Asia at TA Associate Asia Pacific Ltd., will join RateGain's board of directors.

Goodwin Procter and Nishith Desai provided legal advice to TA on the deal. Signal Hill provided financial advice, while Platinum Partners was legal counsel to RateGain.

There have been a few travel- and hospitality-related M&A transactions recently. Sonata Software bought a controlling stake in Rezopia Inc., which makes a software system for travel providers; and Thoma Bravo paid $930 million to buy TravelClick, which provides cloud-based software to the hospitality industry.
