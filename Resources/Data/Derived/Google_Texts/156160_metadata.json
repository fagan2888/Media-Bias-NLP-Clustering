It\u2019s early days and anything can happen between Washington and Moscow\u2014as Kerry just demonstrated\u2014but if this turn toward cordiality and cooperation holds, the consequences will refract like neutrons all over the planet.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing in any of the potential outcomes not to like.\n\nRelated: Putin Turns to Volunteer Vigilantes to Patrol Moscow\u200b\n\nAs Kerry\u2019s Tweet made plain, the Obama administration\u2019s motivations in this demarche go to three immediate issues\u2014two key to stability in the Middle East and one that has made the phrase \u201cCold War II\u201d common currency in the past year and a half. Analysts of all stripes are unanimous: Washington has now concluded that there\u2019s no resolving any of these questions without Moscow\u2019s help.\n\nThat\u2019s sound thinking except that it\u2019s late by at least a year. One thing above all others prompted Obama and Kerry to get smart quick: These guys have a year and a half to leave a legacy of any value on the foreign side, and there\u2019s not much other than failure in the hopper at the moment.\n\nIn Syria, the administration should have come to wiser conclusions in September 2013, when Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, saved Obama\u2019s bacon by persuading Damascus to give up its chemical weapons inventories. Remember Obama\u2019s foolish \u201cred line\u201d gambit? Lavrov threw the life jacket.\n\nKerry has said since mid-March that he wants new talks toward a political settlement in Syria, and Moscow is essential in making this happen. In this, the administration is straight out of Churchill: \u201cYou can always count on the Americans to do the right thing\u2014after they\u2019ve tried everything else.\u201d\n\nRelated: Yikes! Putin Will Soon Have Superhuman Robo-Soldiers!\u200b\n\nIt\u2019s something of the same on the pending nuclear deal with Iran\u2014which was the No. 1 topic in Sochi. It was Lavrov who got Tehran to consider, if not yet agree, to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium to Russia and re-import supplies as needed for peaceful purposes. With two and a half months before the deadline for this deal, Washington needs all five negotiating partners\u2014Russia above all, I\u2019d say\u2014to keep their oars in the water.\n\nAs to Ukraine, its economy deserves emergency status, even if you read next to nothing in the news reports. Absent the kind of debt write-down the European Union refuses to grant the Greeks, Lawrence Summers argued in the Financial Times over the weekend, default is now a serious option.\n\nEqually, Kiev has done little to address the terms agreed in Minsk last February, which included new constitutional provisions granting rebellious eastern regions greater autonomy. With Europeans increasingly impatient and Russia not even close to stepping back, Kerry\u2019s assistant secretary for European affairs, the controversial Victoria Nuland, was in Kiev two days after Kerry\u2019s Sochi sit-down to confer on implementing the Minsk II agreement, of which Russia is a primary signatory.\n\nSmall wonder Kerry spent seven hours in back-to-back talks\u2014three with Lavrov and four with President Putin. It was his first visit to Russia in two years, and these the objects of his attention\u2014cooperation getting the Syria crisis under control, the final stitching on the Iran deal, and a settlement in Ukraine that\u2014it\u2019s finally clear in Washington\u2014cannot be achieved other than via a negotiated compromise based on Minsk II.\n\nRelated: Did Putin Snag US Uranium and Sell It to Iran?\u200b\n\nIt\u2019s a full agenda, but stop there and you don\u2019t get the half of it. Look at the other factors that sent Kerry to Putin\u2019s Black Sea resort residence:\n\n\u2022 It has been clear for months that Washington\u2019s assertive stance toward Russia has been a source of increasing trans-Atlantic tensions. The very real risk of a lasting rift in U.S.-E.U. ties can now be alleviated.\n\n\u2022 European leaders are due to meet next month to consider the status of the U.S.-led sanctions regime, and at least six nations are on the record saying they\u2019ve had enough. When Kerry hinted after the Sochi sessions that it could be time to step back, he opened a path away from an embarrassing display of disunity, if not mutiny.\n\n\u2022 E.U-Russian relations can begin to mend, too. This is especially key on the economic side. The virtual freeze of banking operations, a drastic slowdown in investment flows, and Russia\u2019s countersanctions against E.U. exports have all hurt the eurozone just as it struggles to recover from seven years of financial and economic crisis.\n\n\u2022 Tensions within the E.U., heated of late, also stand to abate. Greece has been the most evident problem in this regard, as the Syriza government draws closer to Moscow in plainly purposeful defiance of the Brussels consensus. But Greece, we should note, is not alone in harboring these sympathies.\n\nRelated: EU\u2019s New War Against Putin\u2019s Propoganda Campaign\u200b\n\nRussian officials close to the Kremlin, to the perplexity of many Western analysts, have been advancing a worst-is-over line for several weeks. Putin added his voice when he met Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, just before the Sochi talks.\n\nIndeed, sanctions may have backfired in certain respects. While Moscow announced a 1.9 percent drop in 1Q GDP Friday, it was less than expected, and Russia\u2019s industry seems to have been energized. It reminds me of Rhodesia before it became Zimbabwe, when international sanctions forced a not-unimpressive manufacturing sector into being: If you can\u2019t bring it in, make it.\n\nThe ruble, meantime, has come back so strongly this year that Moscow started buying $100 million to $200 million in foreign exchange daily last week to hold it down.\n\nThose hours in Sochi, let\u2019s say, were long due, wherever you sit and however you look at it. Now to watch what comes of them.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "At 8:12 a.m.", "title": "Kerry-Putin Talks Could Deliver a Global Surprise", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/18/Kerry-Putin-Talks-Could-Deliver-Global-Surprise", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05182015_Kerry_Putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/18/Kerry-Putin-Talks-Could-Deliver-Global-Surprise", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05182015_Kerry_Putin.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "At 8:12 a.m.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73eb\"", "article_summary": "Kerry has said since mid-March that he wants new talks toward a political settlement in Syria, and Moscow is essential in making this happen.\nPutin added his voice when he met Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, just before the Sochi talks.\nAnalysts of all stripes are unanimous: Washington has now concluded that there\u2019s no resolving any of these questions without Moscow\u2019s help.\nPutin Will Soon Have Superhuman Robo-Soldiers!\u200bIt\u2019s something of the same on the pending nuclear deal with Iran\u2014which was the No.\nThose hours in Sochi, let\u2019s say, were long due, wherever you sit and however you look at it."}
