Up to seven children aged up to 12 years can be cared for at any one time. Carers must be assessed by the same agency that accredits mainstream childcare services.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "National", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The number of childcare educators operating out of family homes across the country has skyrocketed in the past year, as more parents struggle to find a placement for their child in a traditional centre.", "title": "Family day-care numbers explode across Victoria", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/national/family-daycare-numbers-explode-across-victoria-20150329-1mags1.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/m/a/0/o/o/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.1mags1.png/1429477371789.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/m/a/0/o/o/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.1mags1.png/1429477371789.jpg"}, "title": "Family day-care numbers explode across Victoria", "description": "The number of childcare educators operating out of family homes across the country has skyrocketed in the past year, as more parents struggle to find a placement for their child in a traditional centre.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The number of childcare educators operating out of family homes across the country has skyrocketed in the past year, as more parents struggle to find a ..."}, "article_summary": "Victoria has the most family day-care centres in the country, with 190.\nA lack of places in large childcare centres is pushing more parents to the family day-care sector, which is growing as a result, a recent Productivity Commission report said.\n\"Anecdotal evidence suggests that families often turn to nannies or family day-care where they are unable to access a long-day-care place,\" the report said.\nFamily day-care takes place in the carer's own home.\n\"Family day-care is provided in a nurturing, home-based setting with smaller group sizes, which research suggests is more beneficial to a child's emotional and cognitive development,\" a spokesperson for the organisation said."}
