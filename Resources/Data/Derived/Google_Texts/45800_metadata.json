Wages picked up a bit, rising 0.3% in the month and 2.2% over the past year.

El-Erian (@elerianm) September 4, 2015\n\nFed officials will gather Sept. 16-17. Policy makers had seemed quite close to deciding to hike rates, but sharp financial-market volatility, tied to questions about the health of China\u2019s economy and what that would mean for the global economy, has upset the carefully laid plans. Even Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who supports a rate hike, said on Friday that \u201cno discussion of macroeconomic conditions at this moment would be complete without mention of recent financial market volatility.\u201d\n\nAfter his speech, Lacker called the jobs report \u201ca pretty much right down the middle of the fairway sort of employment report,\u201d adding that this was \u201cgood\u201d and didn\u2019t change the picture for monetary policy, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFed officials have said they want to see \u201csome\u201d further improvement in labor market conditions in order to hike rates. They also want to be \u201creasonably confident\u201d inflation is moving higher.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this number while good is neither so strong as to make clear the need for a rate hike nor so weak that it makes standing pat a clear option,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.\n\nThat was clear from the reaction of other economists.\n\nGus Faucher, senior macro economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said the report gives the Fed all the reason it needs to hike.\n\n\u201cThe headline was weak but it is generally a decent report in line with what we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d he said.\n\nMarketWatch\u2019s Rex Nutting says the economic data tell the Fed to raise rates.\n\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Tufts University, said the data showed an economy \u201cin slowdown mode.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is the Fed is just going to sit here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it didn\u2019t make sense for the Fed to \u201cpop rates and sit\u201d because the market would not stand still, speculating about where the process of higher rates would end up.\n\nTraders who bet on rate hikes using fed funds futures contracts currently project only 1 in 3 chance of a September rate hike. Economists are split fairly evenly, according to surveys.\n\nTim Mullaney offers 4 reasons we know we\u2019re not ready for the Fed to raise rates\n\nTannenbaum, who thinks the Fed will raise rates this month, says Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen would follow up its move with a message that the Fed \u201cwould rest for awhile\u201d before hiking again.\n\nThis view of a September move followed by a period of quiet for as long as six months has been gaining ground among proponents of an increase in rates.\n\nMichael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, said during the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole summit that \u201cstrong communication\u201d about the gradual pace of subsequent hikes might help gel officials around agreeing to a hike on Sept. 17, according to the Financial Times.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The August unemployment report didn\u2019t seal the deal on a rate hike in two weeks, but makes the move somewhat more likely.", "creator": "@grobb2000", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DH785_yellen_ZG_20150317055539.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Greg Robb", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The August unemployment report didn\u2019t seal the deal on a rate hike in two weeks, but makes the move somewhat more likely.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jobs-data-makes-september-fed-hike-a-bit-more-likely-economists-say-2015-09-04", "author": "Greg Robb", "parsely-title": "Jobs data make September Fed hike a bit more likely, economists say", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-04T12:33:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The August unemployment report didn\u2019t seal the deal on a rate hike in two weeks, but makes the move somewhat more likely.", "title": "Jobs data make September Fed hike a bit more likely, economists say", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jobs-data-makes-september-fed-hike-a-bit-more-likely-economists-say-2015-09-04", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DH785_yellen_ZG_20150317055539.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DH785_yellen_ZG_20150317055539.jpg"}, "article.id": "2EAA535E-52FF-11E5-A69E-176758B5801B", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb847\"", "article_summary": "Fed officials have said they want to see \u201csome\u201d further improvement in labor market conditions in order to hike rates.\nTraders who bet on rate hikes using fed funds futures contracts currently project only 1 in 3 chance of a September rate hike.\nMarketWatch\u2019s Rex Nutting says the economic data tell the Fed to raise rates.\nGus Faucher, senior macro economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said the report gives the Fed all the reason it needs to hike.\nTim Mullaney offers 4 reasons we know we\u2019re not ready for the Fed to raise ratesTannenbaum, who thinks the Fed will raise rates this month, says Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen would follow up its move with a message that the Fed \u201cwould rest for awhile\u201d before hiking again."}
