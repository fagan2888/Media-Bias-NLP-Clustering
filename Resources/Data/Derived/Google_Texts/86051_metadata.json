In an interview with Alt 98.7, the Odelay rocker described the new work as the \u201copposite\u201d of his morose Grammy-winning release. That vibe comes through in the hints Beck has been dropping about the album, including videos on his Twitter and Instagrams of abstract zoom shots and surrealist party favors hovering over his face. (Admittedly, said face is still locked in an expression of stoic contemplation, but hey, Beck wasn\u2019t pleased in a day.)\n\nThe videos also carry lively, guitar-heavy clips of the new song, titled \u201cDreams.\u201d It\u2019s hard to extrapolate much from 15-second snippets, but Beck describes the song as a mixture of garage rock and dance music, and says that it was specifically designed to give him something lively to play when he\u2019s on tour. (Even if nobody knows better than Beck how dangerous things can get when a performer gets too enthusiastic during a show).\n\n\u201cDreams\u201d will debut on internet radio platform iHeartRadio at midnight EST on Sunday night. Beck was tight-lipped in regards to release dates for the as-yet untitled album, saying only that \u201cit\u2019s done when it\u2019s done,\u201d because even a Cheerful Beck can only go so far.\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/oGxfTegtkI \u2014 Beck (@beck) June 13, 2015\n\nSend your Newswire tips to tips@avclub.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/beck-debuting-new-song-sunday-night-shows-his-chee-220831", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5461/76/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Occasionally dour alt-rocker Beck will be releasing a new track Sunday night, in advance of his follow-up album to 2014\u2019s Morning Phase.
