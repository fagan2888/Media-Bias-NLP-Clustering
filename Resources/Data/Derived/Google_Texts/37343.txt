The death of a mountain bike racer after a crash Saturday in a competition at Mt. Crested Butte prompted organizers to cancel the rest of the event Sunday.

The rider — Will Olson, 40, of Edwards — died of his injuries on the course in Gunnison National Forest.

Gunnison County Sheriff Richard Besecker said Mt. Crested Butte Police were investigating.

Two other riders who were following Olson in the Crested Butte Big Mountain Enduro competition reportedly tried for 30 minutes to resuscitate Olson before a search and rescue team reached the scene, Mt. Crested Butte police said in a statement Sunday evening.

Members of that team carried him to a trailhead, police said. A paramedic lifted to the scene by helicopter pronounced him dead.
