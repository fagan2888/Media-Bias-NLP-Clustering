[and] select vetted members of the Syrian opposition, including the Supreme Military Council.\u201d\n\n\"This action is part of longstanding and ongoing efforts to provide life-saving chemical weapons-related assistance to people in need in Syria,\" Hayden added, as stated in the article.\n\nReaders will notice that the Arms Export Control Act does not contain such an exemption. In fact, the law explicitly purports to prevent the president from making such unilateral decisions, especially as it pertains to chemical weapons and defenses to their use.\n\nDespite breaking the law, flouting the separation of powers, and sending forbidden chemical agent defenses to known agents of al-Qaeda, the president\u2019s actions will make it very difficult for international regulators \u201cto track and contain those weapons stockpiles.\u201d\n\nThis is precisely the point made recently by Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Paul said that the situation in Syria \u201cis more likely to be unstabler\u201d if the United States continues to intervene in the country\u2019s civil war.\n\nPerhaps the most troubling aspect of the administration\u2019s intent to break the law in order to send chemical agent defenses to our \u201callies\u201d in Syria (a group whose leadership counts with many members of the same organization that allegedly carried out the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001) is that the shipment will violate another law, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). It is already apparent that for this illegal act the president will, again, not be held accountable.\n\nAccording to the applicable (until now) provisions of the NDAA, anyone suspected of providing material support to al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces is subject to indefinite detention in military custody.\n\nOn several occasions now, President Obama and hundreds of federal lawmakers have approved shipments of weapons and money to the so-called Syrian resistance. The evidence of al-Qaeda\u2019s presence in this force is overwhelming.\n\nThe zeitgeist prevalent since the opening of the Obama epoch of the Pax Americana is to pass laws that do not apply to the lawmakers (ObamaCare and the NDAA) and to flout laws that ostensibly are obstacles to the establishment of an empire.\n\nUnfortunately, President Obama has determined that he \u201ccannot wait\u201d on Congress to act and he will autocratically authorize the export of biological weapons defenses to Syrian \u201crebels.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as if it isn\u2019t expected, however. As has been known for at least a week now, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been supplying military weaponry to the anti-Assad forces fighting in Syria.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on September 11 that the shipments are \u201climited to light weapons and other munitions that can be tracked.\u201d However, in a related report, CBS News expands the list of materiel being trafficked to Syria by agents of American intelligence:\n\nThe agency has also arranged for the Syrian opposition to receive anti-tank weaponry like rocket-propelled grenades through a third party, presumably one of the Gulf countries that has been arming the rebels, a senior U.S. intelligence official and two former intelligence officials said Thursday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the classified program publicly.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s sending of military-grade weapons to a group with irrefutable ties to known terrorists brings up a very revealing question.\n\nWhy are para-military organizations teeming with terrorists permitted to own firearms (and to have those weapons paid for and provided by the federal government), but Americans whose very Bill of Rights protects such ownership are having that very right eviscerated day by day by the very same government?\n\nAs with so many similar inexplicable inconsistencies, the president has no answer.\n\nPerhaps now that the government is about to \u201crun out of money,\u201d President Obama and the CIA can save the American people a little money by combining their illegal shipments of weapons and weapons defenses.\n\nJoe A.
