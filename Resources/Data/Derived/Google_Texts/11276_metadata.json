Raul Labrador of Idaho on Monday over the current battle over Obamacare and refuted his guest\u2019s insinuation that he is biased against Republicans.\n\nCooper insisted that President Barack Obama was elected twice running on universal health care, the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare and it is currently the law of the land as passed by Congress. He pressed Labrador on why Republicans can\u2019t agree on that and put up a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution to end the partial government shutdown.\n\nLabrador pointed out that Republicans also won the House in 2010 and 2012, but Cooper didn\u2019t seem to accept his argument as valid.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re nullifying two presidential elections and you\u2019re nullifying the vote of Congress because you don\u2019t like it,\u201d the CNN host said.\n\nCooper went on to ask the Republican why the House won\u2019t allow a vote on a clean CR to \u201csee\u201d if it would pass. Labrador insisted there are not enough votes to pass the bill.\n\nWhen Labrador practically accused Cooper of doing the bidding of the Democrats, Cooper was quick to refute the allegation.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, just because you don\u2019t like the fact that the Republicans are in control of the House of Representatives, you want to make sure that the Republicans actually pass the Democrat\u2019s\u2013\u201d Labrador began before being interrupted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a stake in this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the way it works in journalism. When you\u2019re not on Fox News, you get contentious interviews. When you\u2019re not on MSNBC and a liberal, you get contentious interviews. My job is to ask you questions that are different than you think, just as my next guest, who\u2019s a Democrat, I\u2019m gonna ask the same kinds of questions\u2026 that\u2019s what a journalist does.\u201d\n\nWatch the segment via CNN:\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "CNN's Anderson Cooper went at it with Rep.
