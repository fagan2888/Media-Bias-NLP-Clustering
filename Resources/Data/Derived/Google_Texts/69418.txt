There's new legal action against Essar Steel Minnesota.

The Duluth News Tribune reports that two companies filed a lawsuit against Essar saying they haven't been paid for giant haul trucks and front-end loaders.

Essar allegedly owes a New York-based company, Axis Capital Funding, more than $27.6 million and a Nebraska-based company, ESML Funding, more than $1.3 million, according to the Duluth News Tribune's report.

The suit alleges that Essar Steel Minnesota "has failed to make full and timely payments of rents and other amounts due under the master lease agreement."

Essar has been in legal trouble before. Back in 2014, the company was sued by vendors and contractors for not paying its bills, the newspaper says. Even Gov. Mark Dayton threatened a lawsuit if it didn't repay a $65.9 million state grant.

The Duluth News Tribune says Essar has not made any formal announcement about securing additional financing, so far.

Essar did not respond to the newspaper's request for comment.
