Unless you\u2019re in a plan that\u2019s being shortchanged by your employer.\n\nAccording to a report from the Department of Labor, nearly 73 percent (or 2,677) of the plans it audited last year made the wrong employer match or made some other error. The upshot? A whopping $423.6 million was restored to workers\u2019 401(k)s last year.\n\nAmong the more common mistakes: failing to account for bonuses, overtime and vacation pay when making employer contributions; failing to make contributions at all or to make timely distributions; and charging improper plan expenses to participants. Each of those errors reduced the amount of money workers had in their plans.\n\nThose miscalculations also proved costly to employers (otherwise known as plan sponsors). The plans, which were found to be in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, were either fined, hit with penalties or ordered to reimburse funds to workers\u2019 plans.\n\nEmployers have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interest of workers and their beneficiaries regarding workplace retirement plans. The DOL oversees nearly 684,000 such plans nationwide.\n\nSo now that you\u2019re wondering about the accuracy of the balance in your own retirement savings plan, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that more government audits of 401(k)s are planned. The DOL says it\u2019s focusing more investigative resources on audits, enforcement and other measures to protect workers\u2019 retirement security. If the government\u2019s regulations are not met, hefty fines can be meted out to plan sponsors.\n\n[Related: Are you saving enough?

You can also contact a DOL benefits adviser at (866) 444-3272.\n\nPhoto: Mario Aguilar/istock", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "If you\u2019re fortunate enough to get a company match in your 401(k) savings plan, you might be feeling lucky.
