They left the body armor and assault-style rifles back at the office. Their black SUV \u2014 it has to be black, right? \u2014 blends into the midday traffic barreling west through the city on Interstate 70. When you\u2019re carrying $122,000 in cash stuffed in a blue tote bag that smells like marijuana, the less conspicuous the better.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re like any other vehicle on the road,\u201d says Phil Baca, the ex-sheriff\u2019s officer, checking his rearview mirror to make sure they aren\u2019t being tailed. \u201cYou\u2019d never think there was a bunch of money in it.\u201d\n\nThis is nothing more illicit than the delivery of one month\u2019s worth of tax revenue owed to the state by Medicine Man, a family-owned Denver marijuana business with designs on becoming a national brand.\n\nThe cash \u2014 everything from singles to $100 bills \u2014 is being delivered to a state office by employees of Blue Line Protection Group. Former military and law enforcement veterans began the Denver company to provide security and other services to licensed marijuana businesses.\n\nThe surreal scene of law-and-order guys transporting cash from recreational and medical marijuana sales to a state government office could only happen in Colorado, where the ambitions of a lucrative but risky business run headlong into the realities of trafficking in a product still illegal under federal law.\n\nThe only reason the $122,000 in cash from Medicine Man\u2019s safe is zooming down the highway is that a month earlier, the bank that had taken the marijuana merchant as a customer closed its accounts.\n\nThere were no more checks to write.\n\nBad news in a letter from bank\n\nBusiness had been smooth and thriving at 4750 Nome St.\n\nLines curled around the building on \u201cGreen Wednesday,\u201d the first day of recreational marijuana sales anywhere in the world.\n\nAndy Williams, the driving force behind Medicine Man, wore a blue suit and gave interview after interview. He expects his store \u2014 billed as the largest single-location dispensary in the state \u2014 to bring between $10 million and $12 million in revenue this year.\n\nThe three siblings at the heart of the business have their differences over how aggressively to expand and what kind of image to project. But after a buyout proposal from a man who made a fortune in snack foods fell though a few months ago, they resolved to move forward together.\n\nThen, on April 14, the bad news arrived in a letter on Sally Vander Veer\u2019s desk: Bank of America was shutting down Medicine Man\u2019s accounts. There was no explanation, no mention of marijuana.\n\n\u201cI was panicked,\u201d says Vander Veer, Medicine Man\u2019s controller and the sister of co-founders Andy and Pete Williams. \u201cI just opened this letter thinking it was normal correspondence.\u201d\n\nVander Veer guesses the bank\u2019s auditors flagged Medicine Man\u2019s three-fold increase in credit-card deposits and cash after the opening of recreational pot sales Jan. 1.\n\nMarijuana businesses have long struggled to gain banking services because marijuana is as illegal as cocaine and heroin in the eyes of federal law \u2014 and federal agencies regulate banks.\n\nFive months into Colorado\u2019s history-making turn selling marijuana for recreational use, banking remains the largest obstacle for business owners and government officials trying to regulate them.\n\nLike most Colorado marijuana businesses, Medicine Man has followed a many-forked road working with financial institutions so it can deposit money and pay its employees, taxes and other bills.\n\nBack when Medicine Man started in 2010, Andy Williams says he opened an account in the business\u2019 name at Wells Fargo, where he had a personal account and those of past failed businesses.\n\nWilliams, a serial entrepreneur and former industrial engineer, began Medicine Man with his brother Pete, a high school dropout who started growing weed in his basement and selling it to medical marijuana dispensaries.\n\nThe woman at Wells Fargo submitted the paperwork \u201cin such a way that it didn\u2019t call attention to itself,\u201d and somehow Medicine Man remained in good standing even after the San Francisco-based bank began a purge of marijuana-business accounts in 2012, Andy says.\n\nTo keep up good relations, he went out of his way to learn little details about bank employees \u2014 like the teller who was teased because her wedding ring was small. He sprayed weed-scented dispensary cash with Febreze air freshener before depositing it.\n\nThen, in 2013, Wells Fargo moved to close Medicine Man\u2019s accounts.\n\nWells Fargo spokeswoman Cristie Drumm declined to discuss Medicine Man\u2019s circumstances. But she said it is against company policy to work with marijuana businesses, and the bank conducts internal reviews to enforce that.\n\nThrough industry word-of-mouth, Medicine Man was steered to Bank of America. Bank officials didn\u2019t ask for much detail, Vander Veer says. She says she provided a copy of the articles of incorporation and described the nature of the business as \u201cretail grow.\u201d\n\nAsked by a bank official whether Medicine Man sold anything else, she says she mentioned T-shirts and other sundry items.\n\n\u201cThere was no instance when I didn\u2019t answer their questions without a direct answer,\u201d Vander Veer says. \u201cI guess it was an omission. I didn\u2019t mention marijuana. It may not be best practices. It\u2019s desperate practices.\u201d\n\nAll was well until April 7, the date of the letter from Bank of America. It was signed: \u201cSincerely, Closure Unit.\u201d\n\nA Bank of America spokesman said the bank does not comment on specific cases involving customers but that, as a matter of policy, does not work with marijuana-related businesses.\n\nThis was supposed to be a hopeful time for marijuana entrepreneurs looking for financial services that other businesses take for granted.\n\nIn February, the U.S. Department of Justice and an arm of the U.S. Department of Treasury provided guidance meant to make it easier for banks to openly work with marijuana businesses.\n\nThe guidance, however, put greater burdens on banks to document that marijuana companies were preventing distribution to minors and not funding criminal enterprises, as well as six other federal priorities.\n\nAccording to marijuana industry officials, a \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy some banks practiced became \u201cJust say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are probably a bit worse off,\u201d said Mike Elliott, director of the Denver-based Marijuana Industry Group. \u201cI\u2019ve had more people tell me they\u2019ve lost bank accounts, and I don\u2019t hear many positive stories about things opening up.\u201d\n\nThe Williams siblings did have stopgap measures in place, including an account for a separate entity that owns Medicine Man\u2019s real estate and a restricted bank account set up by a brokerage firm.\n\nThe brokerage account does not accept cash deposits, which forces Medicine Man to pay many bills in cash.\n\n\u201cIt just makes cash management a full-time job,\u201d Vander Veer says. \u201cThere are just other things I\u2019d rather be doing to move this business forward.\u201d\n\nVander Veer says she is sending employees to 7-Eleven to purchase money orders in $500 increments to pay bills. For safety reasons, the owners and senior staffers do not take product or money home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that nothing is going to happen until someone dies, that no widespread changes will be made until it\u2019s reactionary,\u201d she says.\n\nFirm handshakes and pistols\n\nThe guys from the security company arrive just after lunch. Vander Veer guides them to the safe room, where televisions display footage from some of the 65 cameras trained on the property. She punches in the code, spins a gold wheel and hands over the cash.\n\nPaying taxes this way is a first for Medicine Man, but the business knows Blue Line Protection Group well. The firm\u2019s armed guards have worked the door checking IDs at the store since Jan. 1.\n\nThe tax-delivery men have firm handshakes, broad shoulders, khaki pants and Glock pistols on their waists.\n\nBaca, the driver, is a 28-year-old Denver native. As a member of the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office special-operations response team, he says he worked the Democratic National Convention, transported high-risk prisoners and kicked down his fair share of doors.\n\nHis partner, 27-year-old Matt Karr, grew up on a Nebraska pig farm. The former Marine says he spent much of his 8\u00bd- year tour overseas in Iraq and on \u201csome small missions that don\u2019t need to go in the paper.\u201d\n\nBaca acknowledged \u201csurreal moments\u201d walking into a warehouse with workers calmly snipping bud from flowers, which in his past life would be a crime scene with people cuffed facedown on the ground.\n\nBoth men say they find the work satisfying.\n\n\u201cIt is rewarding like doing CPR to save someone\u2019s life?\u201d Baca says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. But you are making people feel safe.\u201d\n\nOn these deliveries, Baca and Karr don\u2019t take the same route twice. They switch up vehicles.\n\n\u201cAfter a while,\u201d Baca says, \u201cpotentially dangerous things become the norm.\u201d\n\nThe risks are real. Earlier this month, the Denver Police Department warned marijuana business couriers of a plot to rob them. That prompted Blue Line to take extra precautions, including putting an additional armed guard on some runs.\n\nAt the Department of Revenue office, they are whisked past people waiting to renew their vehicle registrations or pay fines. They don\u2019t need to take a number.\n\nThey are led to Window 1, where state employees count bills that in the previous month were used to purchase bubble hash and Cherry O.G.\n\n\u201cTell them thank you for having it well organized,\u201d the clerk says.\n\nThe couriers head out, joking that they are no longer of value.\n\nLaughed out of the room\n\nNot surprisingly, the marijuana industry\u2019s banking crisis has attracted opportunists, some more credible than others.\n\nTwo men in their early 20s came to Medicine Man claiming to be former special-forces members. They said they were fully insured and bonded and prepared to use their private plane to fly Medicine Man cash to a bank in the Cayman Islands on a monthly basis.\n\nTheir proposed cut? Seven percent of the deposits.\n\nVander Veer laughed them out of the room.\n\nThe most promising proposal to date came from the very same company that guards Medicine Man\u2019s doors and pays its taxes.\n\nOn a May morning in Andy Williams\u2019 office, two representatives of Blue Line Protection Group laid out their plan.\n\nThe company would serve as a compliance intermediary, an independent third party that would provide banks with data confirming that customers are 21 or older, licensing confirmation, monthly tax income, sales figures and other sensitive information.\n\n\u201cThe banks are saying they won\u2019t do it because it\u2019s an enormous amount of information they don\u2019t possess,\u201d says Dan Sullivan, Blue Line\u2019s vice president of sales and training. \u201cA third party, though, could do it for them. That could work.\u201d\n\nSullivan says the company is working with five Colorado marijuana companies as part of a beta program and has drawn interest from two Colorado-based banks, which he would not identify.\n\nBlue Line would transport cash from businesses, store it in its own vault and then take it to a bank processing center, he says.\n\nThe service would cost $2,500 a month, Sullivan says.\n\nAndy Williams says the arrangement would give Medicine Man access to debit cards and checking. He says the terms are agreeable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only solution we have right now,\u201d he says.\n\nJenifer Waller, senior vice president of the Colorado Bankers Association, says third-party compliance plans are a new development. A handful of companies have emerged with proposals in recent weeks, she says.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see it as being a solution,\u201d Waller says. \u201cThe challenge to banking isn\u2019t necessarily the compliance, it\u2019s that (marijuana) is illegal federally. Until a change is made at the federal level, I don\u2019t see any resolution taking place on this topic.\u201d\n\nThere is little hope among bankers or industry officials that a bill signed into law this month by Gov. John Hickenlooper will provide a fix, either. The legislation would create the world\u2019s first marijuana business banking cooperative. The Federal Reserve Bank would need to approve, an uncertain prospect.\n\nFor now, Medicine Man\u2019s ambitions are not being slowed by the lack of a bank.\n\nNegotiations are underway to purchase property outside Denver for an additional retail operation and a greenhouse grow.\n\nStill, Williams must figure out how to handle a $1 million loan he\u2019s receiving from an investor for an expansion of the current location.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Williams says. \u201d \u2018I want it in cash, guys?\u2019 \u201c\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is the third in an occasional series of articles on Year One of recreational pot sales in Colorado told through the lens of one business, Medicine Man in northeast Denver.\n\nMedicine Man Part 1: Family-owned pot shop in Denver seeks to become national player\n\nMedicine Man Part 2: Family bonds holding marijuana business together showing strains\n\nMedicine Man Part 3: Reluctance of banks leaves pot shops looking for secure practices", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Reluctance of banks leaves pot shops looking for secure practices", "title": "Reluctance of banks leaves pot shops looking for secure practices", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/14/reluctance-of-banks-leaves-pot-shops-looking-for-secure-practices/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140614__20140615_A1_CD18POTTAXp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140614__20140615_A1_CD18POTTAXp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-14T20:12:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:48:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09a9\"", "article_summary": "Medicine Man Part 1: Family-owned pot shop in Denver seeks to become national playerMedicine Man Part 2: Family bonds holding marijuana business together showing strainsMedicine Man Part 3: Reluctance of banks leaves pot shops looking for secure practices\n\u201cI was panicked,\u201d says Vander Veer, Medicine Man\u2019s controller and the sister of co-founders Andy and Pete Williams.\nEarlier this month, the Denver Police Department warned marijuana business couriers of a plot to rob them.\nThe most promising proposal to date came from the very same company that guards Medicine Man\u2019s doors and pays its taxes.\nTwo men in their early 20s came to Medicine Man claiming to be former special-forces members."}
