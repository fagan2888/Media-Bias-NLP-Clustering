NEW YORK (AP) — The war of the words continues between rappers Meek Mill and Drake.

Mill said Sunday night that that a song Drake wrote dissing him is soft — like baby lotion.

Mill made the comments at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where he was opening on tour for his girlfriend, Nicki Minaj.

Drake released the song “Charged Up” dissing Mill over the weekend after the Philadelphia-based rapper claimed Drake didn’t write the lyrics for a song they collaborated on this year.

Mill said to the audience: “I was doing my album and I asked (Drake) to give me a verse for my album, but (Drake) gave me a verse that he didn’t write that another (person) wrote.”
