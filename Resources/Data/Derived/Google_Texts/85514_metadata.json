(AP) \u2014 It can be pretty challenging to get a room full of adults of all ages and from all walks of life to agree on much of anything. But getting them to agree enthusiastically is the stuff of which dreams are fulfilled.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, winemakers and distillery producers in the western part of West Virginia met to discuss the creation of a trail that would link wineries and distilleries located within close proximity to each other for the benefit of them all.\n\nThere was so much excitement in the air, it was practically tangible.\n\n\u201cWe have a gold mine right here,\u201d said Bryan George, who owns Vu ja de Vineyards in Roane County.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly a new idea. Winery trails have long been established in nearly every state in the country.\n\nThere are 277 such trails nationwide, according to America\u2019s Wine Trails, which compiles a comprehensive list.\n\nThere just aren\u2019t any in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; you can make your own wine trail by taking a day to visit a few of this state\u2019s magnificent wineries,\u201d suggests the website.\n\nThat, say many vineyard owners here, isn\u2019t good enough.\n\nWith 27 farm wineries (and 10 distilleries) listed in the various branches of state government that track such things, somehow there\u2019s just never been enough momentum to get a wine and distilleries trail going.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAfter reading the first two articles in the Gazette-Mail series about West Virginia farm wineries, Mark Whitley, executive director of the Jackson County Development Authority, met with winery and distillery owners in the western part of the state on Sept. 16 to begin discussions.\n\n\u201cThis is our first wine and distillery trail meeting, but it\u2019s something we hope we\u2019ll be able to build on from there,\u201d Whitley said.\n\nThe meeting led to the formation of the Country Roads Wine and Distillery Trail on Sept. 26.\n\nWhitley has developed a mock-up of a \u201cpassport\u201d for the trail, which he believes will be beneficial to many other businesses in the Jackson County area, including restaurants, historical attractions, inns and hotels.\n\n\u201cThe passport idea is similar to the VIP state park and national park passports, as well as the Bourbon Trail in Kentucky,\u201d Whitley said.\n\nBy offering passports, wine and distillery trails encourage guests to visit more than one vineyard or distillery to compare samples at each and learn the different techniques used by winemakers and distillers.\n\n\u201cThe scenic routes are just beautiful this time of year and we have a lot of visitors from out of state. We felt it was time to get involved to do something about this great opportunity and decided to have a strategy meeting. I\u2019ve toured most of the vineyards and the distilleries, and their facilities are beautiful. We have so much to offer people. I\u2019m excited about this,\u201d Whitley said.\n\n\u201cThe Jackson, Roane and Wirt county development authorities are pledging to get it done,\u201d Whitley said.\n\nRepresentatives of the state Division of Tourism and Department of Agriculture attended the meeting and expressed support for the group\u2019s efforts.\n\nWhitley also has been developing a proposal for a central retail facility for the wineries in the area.\n\nOwners from Chestnut Ridge Winery, Roane Vineyards, Stone Road Vineyards and Vu ja de Vineyards, as well as Appalachian Mountain Distillery, Hatfield and McCoy Distillery and Herot Hall Farm attended.\n\n\u201cThe more of us, the merrier. We\u2019re not competitors. We want to help each other,\u201d Mark Hatfield, of Hatfield and McCoy Distillery, said.\n\nPhil Holcomb, of Chestnut Ridge Winery, even said he has plans to get a small bus service started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m purchasing a 10 to 15 passenger vans and will start at one of the bed-and-breakfasts and plan to visit the vineyards,\u201d Holcomb said. He plans to develop food and wine packages for the tours.\n\nHolcomb\u2019s neighbor and Vu ja de Vineyards winemaker Bryan George has described the region of the state as a \u201cmini Napa Valley,\u201d due to the close proximity of three vineyards - Vu ja de, Chestnut Ridge and Roane Vineyards - and with Hatfield\u2019s farm winery and distillery soon to open nearby.\n\nThere are plenty of concerns to be addressed still - including the lack of road signs for the vineyards.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina and Virginia have really nice road signs with a standard logo and the name of the winery closest to the exit,\u201d said Anna-Neale Taylor. She and her husband, Paul Taylor, own Roane Vineyards.\n\nTeresa Halloran, a marketing specialist with the Department of Agriculture, has visited several winery, distillery and brewery trails in surrounding states.\n\n\u201cKeeping everyone unique is the key to this trail\u2019s success, and I think that everyone can offer a unique experience at each location,\u201d Halloran said.\n\nShe also pointed out that U.S. wine production and consumption is at an all-time high. According to the Beverage Information and Insights Group\u2019s 2014 Wine Handbook, the wine category increased 1.9 percent to 325.4 million 9-liter cases of wine consumed in the U.S. last year.\n\nJohn Brown, former commerce commissioner under Gov. Gaston Caperton and writer of the Gazette-Mail\u2019s \u201cVines & Vittles\u201d column, said the formation of wine trails in the state is a winner for West Virginia in multiple ways. \u201cWhen I was commerce commissioner, we worked hard to develop hiking and mountain-biking trails throughout the state, as well as other trails.\n\n\u201cLinking those with wineries would be an excellent idea. It will help the whole tourism experience,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHe said his involvement with the state\u2019s farm wineries began long ago. Brown helped plant the first farm vineyard in 1977 at Fisher Ridge Wine Co. in Putnam County with Wilson Ward and Andy McQueen.\n\n\u201cWith the trail systems and state parks we have right now, we could link these so easily. The state basically sells itself when people drive through it and they are looking for tourism opportunities. I think a wine trail would be wonderful,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown described visiting Italy and how that country\u2019s entire economy is helped by wine tours.\n\n\u201cWine is such a great thing to pull people together. I view wine as a food. It enhances the meal and the overall experience, as well as the ambiance of civilization, something that is sometimes missing in our modern life,\u201d Brown said.\n\nWhile efforts in the western region of the state are well underway, vineyard owners and distillers elsewhere in West Virginia are also eager to establish trails in their areas. Many are hoping by the time their grapes are ready to harvest next season, there will be a new crop of tourists to fill their tasting rooms.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Charleston Gazette, http://www.wvgazette.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "It can be pretty challenging to get a room full of adults of all ages and from all walks of life to agree on much of anything.
