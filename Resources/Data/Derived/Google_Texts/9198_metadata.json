His loan request was denied, and he has no idea how he is going to pay out-of-control bills, including credit card payments that gobble up nearly half his monthly income.\n\nXavier, a taxi driver, is among the rapidly burgeoning ranks of \u201csuper debtors\u201d \u2014 people who rose into the middle class during Brazil\u2019s nearly decade-long boom, but now find themselves drowning in debt as Latin America\u2019s largest economy stalls, causing inflation to heat up and unemployment to rise.\n\nBrazil\u2019s top credit information bureaus estimate that as of April, more than 55 million Brazilians were behind on paying off credit cards or loans. That\u2019s 37 percent of the adult population in a country of about 200 million people, and the numbers are rising. According to the SPC credit information bureau, the lists have grown by an estimated 700,000 people since January, when the top credit bureaus began working together on combined lists for the first time.\n\nSoraia Panella, coordinator of customer service at Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Procon consumer protection agency, said she routinely sees people living so close to the edge financially that any sudden misfortune can plunge them into a hole from which it\u2019s nearly impossible to climb out.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people who come here break down in tears and cry and cry. They\u2019re ashamed and feel they have no way out,\u201d said Panella, whose team helps about 450 debtors consolidate their payments every day. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get much worse than it already is.\u201d\n\nAfter peaking at 7.5 percent annual growth in 2010, Brazil\u2019s economy has steadily retreated. And this year, it contracted 0.2 percent in the first quarter and is forecast to fall more than 1 percent for the full year.\n\nThe boom was fueled partly by China\u2019s hunger for Brazilian commodities, such as iron ore and soy. But the left-leaning governments of President Dilma Rousseff and especially her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, also relied heavily on consumers for growth for about a decade. Among other things, the government used tax breaks to enoucrage car sales, ended a tax on big-ticket household goods, slashed interest rates and gave incentives to banks to expand credit for lower-middle class Brazilians.\n\nDomestic consumption, which in 2004 accounted for 53 percent of Brazil\u2019s GDP, rose to 63 percent of the total in 2014. Consumers newly armed with credit cards and tax-break incentives snapped up flat-screen TVs, refrigerators, motor scooters and compact cars.\n\nWith access to easy credit and a tradition of paying for small-ticket items like tennis shoes or even groceries over several monthly installments, Brazilian consumers racked up such large bills that nearly 30 percent of disposable income now goes to servicing debt, the Central Bank says. By contrast, consumer debt servicing in the U.S. accounts for just over 5 percent of disposable income, according to the Federal Reserve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid Brazil\u2019s economic crisis, consumers struggle with debt", "title": "Amid Brazil\u2019s economic crisis, consumers struggle with debt", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Amid Brazil\u2019s economic crisis, consumers struggle with debt", "title": "Amid Brazil\u2019s economic crisis, consumers struggle with debt", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/15/amid_brazils_economic_crisis_consumers_struggle_with_debt/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/brazil-consumer-crunch.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amid Brazil\u2019s economic crisis, consumers struggle with debt", "title": "Amid Brazil\u2019s economic crisis, consumers struggle with debt", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/brazil-consumer-crunch.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Barchfield", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8db1\"", "article_summary": "By contrast, consumer debt servicing in the U.S. accounts for just over 5 percent of disposable income, according to the Federal Reserve.\nBrazil\u2019s top credit information bureaus estimate that as of April, more than 55 million Brazilians were behind on paying off credit cards or loans.\nDomestic consumption, which in 2004 accounted for 53 percent of Brazil\u2019s GDP, rose to 63 percent of the total in 2014.\nConsumers newly armed with credit cards and tax-break incentives snapped up flat-screen TVs, refrigerators, motor scooters and compact cars.\nThat\u2019s 37 percent of the adult population in a country of about 200 million people, and the numbers are rising."}
