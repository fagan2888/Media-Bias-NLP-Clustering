Enrollments really are above target; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically, whatever the reason; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage. If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead, fine (but please explain), but the facts so far are pretty good.\n\nBut what I\u2019m getting \u2014 and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK \u2014 is an outpouring, not so much of disagreement, as of fury. People get red-in-the-face angry, practically to the point of incoherence, over the suggestion that it\u2019s not a disaster.\n\nWhat\u2019s that about? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome. I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster he\u2019s been \u2014 when the column didn\u2019t so much as mention the guy. Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents, to tie the president to the disaster to come; now they\u2019re livid that it, and he, are turning out OK.\n\nPartly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate, especially if they happen to be, you know, not white. Such programs must be disasters \u2014 don\u2019t bother me with evidence.\n\nAnd partly, I suspect, there\u2019s now an element of shame. If this thing is actually working, everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid.\n\nBut, you know, sometimes looks don\u2019t deceive.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140714194209, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 14, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Health Care Hatred ( 20140714 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Good news is unacceptable.", "title": "Health Care Hatred", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/health-care-hatred/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003000409, "description": "Good news is unacceptable.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 14, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1405381329, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-07-15T19:45:45-04:00"}, "utime": 20140715194545, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140714, "pdate": 20140714, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Good news is unacceptable.", "title": "Health Care Hatred", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/health-care-hatred/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/health-care-hatred/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Health Care Hatred", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Enrollments really are above target; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically, whatever the reason; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage.\nPartly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate, especially if they happen to be, you know, not white.\nIf this thing is actually working, everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid.\nThe good news about Obamacare so far shouldn\u2019t be considered disputable.\nIf you want to insist that big problems lie ahead, fine (but please explain), but the facts so far are pretty good."}
