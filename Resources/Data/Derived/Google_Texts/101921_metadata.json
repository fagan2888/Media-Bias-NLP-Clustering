As a youth, I spent a lot of time outdoors and a lot of time in the West. I grew up hiking, tent-camping (pitch your own tent and roll out your own sleeping bag), fishing, and backpacking. Outside of a little poo \u2013 which I always buried \u2013 I pretty faithfully followed the practice \u201cTake nothing but pictures; leave nothing but footprints.\u201d\n\nMy favorite cartoonist of all time is Walt Kelly, creator of \u201cPogo,\u201d who gave the world the famous \u201cWe Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us\u201d Earth Day poster pictured nearby. (I keep a black and white version of it framed and hanging on the wall of my apartment.) I pay the high price of living downtown so that I can walk to work if the weather is clement. I do my best to keep the air clean and breathable and the water clean and safe to drink.\n\nI don\u2019t smoke and I turn out lights as I go from room to room. I recycle everything that can be recycled, I have my shoes re-soled, and I pick up and re-use paper clips and rubber bands that I find on the floor or the sidewalk. My carbon footprint is probably about one-one millionth that of Al Gore or Nancy Pelosi, and about one one-billionth that of President Obama every time he steps aboard Air Force One to go play golf. In short, I respect and protect the environment.\n\nBut these new EPA regulations have really got me steamed. Here\u2019s why:\n\nIn the first place, they\u2019re an affront to government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Our Constitution provides for two kinds of separation of powers: between the states and the national government, and among the branches of the national government. These new regulations violate both.\n\nIn a nutshell, the \u201cCarbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units\u201d that the EPA issued for comment on June 2, 2014, seek to regulate, in the name of \u201cglobal warming,\u201d the output of carbon dioxide from every carbon-burning electricity-generating plant in the country. They violate the separation of powers between the president and the Congress because they emanate from the executive branch, not the legislature, which has neither proposed nor debated nor adopted them. They violate the separation of powers between the states and the federal government because, although replete with references like \u201cthe broad range of options available to states\u201d they seek, like all federal regulations, to impose a top-down solution from Washington \u2013 in this case to a problem that may not even exist and that they won\u2019t solve even if it does.\n\nThe proposed regulations also show that the EPA doesn\u2019t really much care very much what the people themselves think, either. They take up 645 pages, including literally two pages just listing some of the acronyms and jargon with which they\u2019re filled. (If you missed them above, you can check \u2018em out here.) But they\u2019re the subject of just four \u2013 count \u2018em, four \u2013 public hearings, for one of which the EPA won\u2019t even announce the exact date until later. (If you plan to be in Washington, D.C., the whole week of July 28, though, you\u2019re in luck.)\n\nIf you do plan to speak at one of these four hearings \u2013 conveniently located in a town near you if you happen to live in Atlanta, Denver, Pittsburgh, or the aforementioned District of Columbia \u2013 then you should \u201cpre-register in advance\u201d (as opposed to in arrears, we suppose). You could also take your chances of waiting until the day of the hearings, except that \u201cpreferences on speaking times may not be able to be fulfilled.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201c[b]ecause these hearings are being held at U.S. government facilities\u201d (that would be your government, by the way), then you \u201cshould be prepared to show valid picture identification to the security staff in order to gain access to the meeting room\u201d although \u2013 thank goodness \u2013 you still don\u2019t need a picture ID in order to be able to vote.\n\nIn addition, you \u201cwill need to obtain a property pass for any personal belongings you bring with you,\u201d you must surrender the property pass before you leave the building, you may not bring any large signs in with you, and don\u2019t even think about taking a picture inside the building! (For a government that supposedly works for you, it sure is a bossy employee.)\n\nIn short, the EPA\u2019s latest proposed \u201ccarbon pollution emission guidelines\u201d are a repugnant assault on a self-governing people. But it gets worse.\n\n[Tomorrow, Part Two: The Scientific and Economic Illiteracy of the EPA\u2019s Proposed Carbon Regulations.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/06/so-wrong-in-so-many-ways-part-one-how-new-epa-regulations-disrespect-you-and-your-intelligence/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Pogo-Enemy.png", "type": "activity", "title": "So Wrong in So Many Ways \u2013 Part One: How New EPA Regulations Disrespect You and Your Intelligence"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a1e\"", "article_summary": "[Tomorrow, Part Two: The Scientific and Economic Illiteracy of the EPA\u2019s Proposed Carbon Regulations.]\nThe proposed regulations also show that the EPA doesn\u2019t really much care very much what the people themselves think, either.\nBut these new EPA regulations have really got me steamed.\nIn short, the EPA\u2019s latest proposed \u201ccarbon pollution emission guidelines\u201d are a repugnant assault on a self-governing people.\nThese new regulations violate both."}
