(Jeff Simon/The Washington Post)\n\nMichael Botticelli is the acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. He's also in recovery for an addictive disorder. This is his story. (Jeff Simon/The Washington Post)\n\nThe nation\u2019s top drug-control official had a confession.\n\nMichael Botticelli was seated on a tattered couch in an old Victorian in this city just outside Boston. Above his head was a photo of Al Pacino as a drug kingpin in \u201cScarface,\u201d and gathered around was a group of addicts who live together in the house to receive help and support. On one door there was a black mailbox labeled \u201curine,\u201d where residents left samples for drug tests. Botticelli was listening to their stories of addiction and then offered this:\n\n\u201cI have my own criminal record.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d one man yelled after Botticelli\u2019s declaration. The crowd burst into applause.\n\nThe nation\u2019s acting drug czar has a substance-abuse problem.\n\nBotticelli, 56, is an alcoholic who has been sober for a quarter-century. He quit drinking after a series of events, including waking up handcuffed to a hospital bed after a drunken-driving accident and a financial collapse that left him facing eviction.\n\nDecades later, he is tasked with spearheading the Obama administration\u2019s drug policy, which is largely predicated on the idea of shifting people with addiction into treatment and support programs and away from the criminal justice system.\n\nBotticelli\u2019s story is the embodiment of the policy \u2014 a view that he credits with saving his life.\n\nThe approach at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy has been, Botticelli said, a \u201cvery clear pivot to, kind of, really dealing with this as a public-health-related issue of looking at prevention and treatment.\u201d He heads an office that has shifted away from a \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and is instead expanding treatment to addicts and preventing drug use through education.\n\nBotticelli became the acting director of drug-control policy in March, about a year and a half after he came to Washington to be then-czar Gil Kerlikowske\u2019s deputy. The White House has not formally nominated him to take over the job permanently. It is a position that has been held by law enforcement officials, a military general and physicians. But for now, it is occupied by a recovering alcoholic.\n\nThe nation is facing an epidemic of prescription-drug and heroin abuse. The number of fatal overdoses increased by 118 percent nationwide from 1999 to 2011, mostly driven by powerful prescription opioids and a recent shift that many users are making from prescription drugs to heroin, which can be cheaper and more accessible.\n\nIn recent years, the White House has placed great importance on tackling opiate addiction, holding two national summits on the subject. But even given the administration\u2019s attention, the battle remains a huge challenge on the federal, state and local levels.\n\nDrug trends and issues tend to vary geographically, making a sustained national effort difficult. Insurance companies often do not cover inpatient treatment, and an obscure federal rule restricts the expansion of addiction treatment under the Affordable Care Act. The White House also is grappling with the legal, financial and political implications of medical and legalized marijuana. Botticelli\u2019s office has taken the administration\u2019s toughest stance against legalization.\n\n\u201cPart of this is: How do we look at solutions that work for the entirety of the drug issue?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not just the entirety of the drug issue, but the entirety of the population?\u201d\n\nBotticelli is trying to expand on some of the programs he used at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, where he was director of the state\u2019s Bureau of Substance Abuse Services. They include allowing police to carry naloxone \u2014 a drug commonly known as Narcan that can reverse a heroin overdose \u2014 and helping people who have completed treatment find housing and jobs.\n\nBotticelli spends much of his time on the road, meeting with state and local officials. He visits treatment programs, where he is, by all accounts, treated like a rock star by people with substance-abuse problems, a group he calls \u201cmy peeps.\u201d Although Botticelli easily shares his struggle, those who worked with him said he doesn\u2019t let it dictate policy.\n\n\u201cHe was very good at separating his story from the work, which I think allowed him a little more objectivity,\u201d said Kevin Norton, chief executive of Lahey Health Behavioral Services in Massachusetts.\n\nThe bar scene\n\nBotticelli drank in high school and college, and he once was fired from a bartending job after repeatedly telling the manager he couldn\u2019t work, only to show up as a patron. In the 1980s, he moved to Boston, where he spent most of his time outside of work at the Club Cafe, a legendary gay bar. Along with a group of regulars, Botticelli would stay well into the next morning, knocking back drinks and ridiculing people who were heading into the gym below the bar for an early workout.\n\n\u201cA lot of the center of gay life, particularly in urban areas, focused on bars,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s where you went to socialize, to meet people.\u201d\n\nIn May 1988, Botticelli was drunk when he left a Boston bar and drove west on the Massachusetts Turnpike. What happened next is hazy: He may have been reaching for a cigarette in the console. His car collided with a disabled truck. He remembers being placed on a stretcher and put in an ambulance.\n\nHours later, he woke up at a hospital, handcuffed to a bed. A state trooper stood sentry in his room. Botticelli was lucky: His injuries consisted mainly of bumps and bruises. He was taken to the state police barracks and booked; his driver\u2019s license was suspended.\n\n\u201cAt some level, I knew I had a problem,\u201d Botticelli said. \u201cBut at another level, because my license was taken away, I thought that my problems were solved. Because I wasn\u2019t drinking and driving anymore, so how could it really be an issue?\u201d\n\nThe case was continued without a finding after Botticelli paid fines and restitution. It is no longer a matter of public record. Botticelli had to ask his brother for the money to make the payments, but his downward spiral continued that summer. He ended a relationship and drank heavily, despite attending a court-ordered course on the dangers of drinking and driving as well as a 12-step recovery group.\n\n\u201cI felt that because I wore a suit to work and a lot of the other people in the class came from more blue-collar jobs, that somehow I was better and I didn\u2019t have a problem. There was a sense of arrogance about me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018I finally said yes\u2019\n\nBotticelli\u2019s path to recovery began in, of all places, a bar. He met a man who acknowledged that he was an alcoholic. The two swapped stories and went on a date. The romance didn\u2019t materialize, but they remained friends. Botticelli received an eviction notice soon after and called his brother, who asked if Botticelli was an alcoholic. Botticelli talks with his hands, one of them often nursing an iced coffee.\n\n\u201cI finally said yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember distinctly thinking to myself, \u2018If I say I\u2019m an alcoholic, there\u2019s no going back.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBotticelli\u2019s friend took him to a 12-step meeting in downtown Boston. The following night, Botticelli stepped into the Church of the Covenant in Boston, a neo-Gothic sanctuary with Tiffany glass windows. In the basement was a recovery program for gay men and lesbians.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first time that I raised my hand and said that my name was Michael, and I was an alcoholic, and that I needed help,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, people kind of rally around you.\u201d\n\nBotticelli stuck close to that group, attending meeting after meeting and avoiding his old haunts, going so far as to cross the street when walking past the Club Cafe. He said he learned something then that has guided him since: Identify with people who have a problem, but don\u2019t compare yourself.\n\nBotticelli had worked in higher education since finishing graduate school but pivoted toward a career in public health. He started working on AIDS issues and then turned toward helping others facing addiction. He eventually felt comfortable going to bars and not drinking. He met David Wells at one in 1995. They got married in 2009.\n\nPower of recovery\n\nOne of Botticelli\u2019s recent trips took him back to Boston this month. Soon after arriving, he was smoking a cigarette outside a Starbucks when a woman had a question: Why are burly agents standing around? (He has a protective detail.) They chatted; she told Botticelli she was addicted to prescription painkillers, progressed to heroin and became homeless. She began recovery months earlier and started working at Starbucks the week before.\n\n\u201cAnd that was like, \u2018Oh, my God, our work is done here,\u2019 \u201d Botticelli said in the back of a black SUV that weaved through the streets of Boston. \u201cAnything else was going to pale in comparison to just listening to people\u2019s stories.\u201d\n\nBotticelli\u2019s day was packed with meetings on what he called his home turf. There was a roundtable with more than a dozen doctors, nurses, law enforcement officers, elected officials and others. He met with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D), who also is a recovering alcoholic. Botticelli had sandwiches with law enforcement agents who spoke about the major increase in heroin addiction. Here in Lynn, a city of 91,000 people, 188 opiate overdoses and 18 deaths occurred in 2013; as of July 31, there were 163 overdoses and 20 deaths.\n\nBotticelli hugged and shook hands with people at the home here, and spoke to the men about the struggles of addiction and finding what he called a bridge job \u2014 something that you do while getting better to make money and get back into the workforce.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed to work at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts,\u201d said one of the men, Pat Falzarano. Botticelli nodded.\n\nHours later, Botticelli stood outside the church where his recovery started and marveled at how he got from there to the White House.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came here, all I wanted to do was not drink and have my problems go away,\u201d he said, choking up. \u201cI\u2019m standing here 25 years later, working at the White House. And if you had asked me 25 years ago when I came to my first meeting here if that was a possibility, I would\u2019ve said you\u2019re crazy. But I think it just demonstrates what the power of recovery is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recovering alcoholic is the White House point man on nation\u2019s drug abuse problem.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Recovering alcoholic is the White House point man on nation\u2019s drug abuse problem.", "title": "Michael Botticelli, the nation\u2019s drug czar, sees things from a different angle: As a recovering alcoholic", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/drug-czar-approaches-challenge-from-a-different-angle-as-a-recovering-alcoholic/2014/08/26/fa518dd0-2883-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/26/Web-Resampled/2014-08-26/drugczar914087211091409086518-U5852025839496zGH--296x197@wp.com.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katiezez"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/drug-czar-approaches-challenge-from-a-different-angle-as-a-recovering-alcoholic/2014/08/26/fa518dd0-2883-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "botticelli, drug czar, michael botticelli", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "news_keywords": "botticelli, drug czar, michael botticelli", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "fa518dd0-2883-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf328\"", "article_summary": "The White House also is grappling with the legal, financial and political implications of medical and legalized marijuana.\n(Jeff Simon/The Washington Post)Michael Botticelli is the acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.\nInsurance companies often do not cover inpatient treatment, and an obscure federal rule restricts the expansion of addiction treatment under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe White House has not formally nominated him to take over the job permanently.\nMichael Botticelli is the acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy."}
