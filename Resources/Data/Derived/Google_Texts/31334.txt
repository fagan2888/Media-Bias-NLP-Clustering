This year's German Fest rocks out with a new concert series, Jams on Tap, that brings pop and rock headliners with local opening acts to the BMO Harris Pavilion at Maier Festival Park. Three Dog Night (6 p.m. Friday, $15), Bret Michaels (8 p.m. Saturday, $20) and Plain White T's (7 p.m. Sunday, $15) are on the bill. The required admission tickets for those concerts include admission to German Fest itself.

If you prefer a more traditional form of gem√ºtlichkeit, catch the party animals of Chikeria playing Volksmusik (8 p.m. Friday, 7 p.m. Saturday and 6 p.m. Sunday). Bask in the afterglow of Germany's World Cup victory with the Euro-Cup 3v3 Soccer Tournament. Help the Capuchins feed the hungry by registering for a 5K run and 2-mile walk, which begins at 7 p.m. July 25.

Hours are 3 p.m. to midnight Friday, noon to midnight Saturday and noon to 10 p.m. Sunday. Tickets are $10 in advance, $13 at the gate, $7 for seniors 60 and older and students with valid school ID. Children under 12 are admitted free with an adult. Visit germanfest.com.
