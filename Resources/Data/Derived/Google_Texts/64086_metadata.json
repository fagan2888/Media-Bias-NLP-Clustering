The clinic should be complete and open for business by the end of December.</p>\n\nBy John Ingle\n\nJust as children outgrow the clothes they wear, Pediatric Associates of Wichita Falls has outgrown the building it has been in the past 10 years.\n\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019ve broke ground on a brand new, state-of-the-art $2.5 million clinic on the city\u2019s southeast side, said Karen Johnson, office manager of husband Dr. Terry Johnson\u2019s clinic. The location of the new clinic will be at 4420 Kimbell Dr. near Kickapoo Downtown Airport.\n\nWith about 13,000 patients and a staff of 25, the clinic is bursting at the seems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just outgrown it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that we needed a bigger facility in order to bring in a couple more pediatricians and nurse practitioners. And our parking lot. We want to be able to accommodate our patients because we are swamped.\u201d\n\nChristy Koski with Hirschi Realtors and Michael Detrick of Nortex Realty, the listing agency, worked in cooperation to complete the transaction. Architects for the design of the new facility is SLA Architects, formerly Secord & Lebow.\n\nPete Durant & Associates out of Fort Worth will be the lead contractor on the project.\n\nMichael Johnson said the build and move will mean moving from a 7,000-square-feet facility to 11,000, and increase the number of exam rooms from 17 to 24.\n\nPediatric Associates was able to make the decision to build the new clinic because of a change to Medicaid reimbursements, he said. As part of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid reimbursement rates were increased to the same level as Medicare, and the clinic received prorated amounts for 2013 and 2014.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the patients seen at the clinic are on Medicaid.\n\n\u201cBecause of that, a big part of this chunk that went down toward the down payment is from the Affordable Care Act, the ACA payments ...,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe Medicare allowable rates have always been higher than the Medicaid rates.\u201d\n\nWhile some pediatricians are part of a group that houses several physician specialties, Karen said the new build will allow them to continue to be a stand-alone pediatric-focused clinic in a part of town where one doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be on our own, and we just really wanted to be here. We could have paid double for the (other) property,\u201d she said of other options. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nKaren said the new clinic in that area could be the beginning of more growth in that area of Wichita Falls.\n\nAnother important part of the clinic\u2019s mission is taking care of people, whether it\u2019s Wichita Falls or Nairobi. Michael said Dr. Johnson makes two trips to the African nation annually, and Dr. Jake Kaiser makes a trip, too.\n\nThey\u2019re hoping to expand that mission overseas while they expand their mission here.\n\nFollow John Ingle on Twitter at @inglejohn1973.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Pediatric practice outgrows clinic, begins construction of new facility", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesrecordnews.com/business/pediatric-practice-outgrows-clinic-begins-construction-of-new-facility-ep-1059898704-331417771.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/pediatricassociatesplans_17494099_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Pediatric Associates of Wichita Falls is building a new clinic near Kickapoo Downtown Airport.", "title": "Pediatric practice outgrows clinic, begins construction of new facility"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/pediatricassociatesplans_17494099_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Pediatric Associates of Wichita Falls is building a new clinic near Kickapoo Downtown Airport.", "site": "@timesrecordnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pediatric practice outgrows clinic, begins construction of new facility"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-trn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3b7\"", "article_summary": "Michael said Dr. Johnson makes two trips to the African nation annually, and Dr. Jake Kaiser makes a trip, too.\nMichael Johnson said the build and move will mean moving from a 7,000-square-feet facility to 11,000, and increase the number of exam rooms from 17 to 24.\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019ve broke ground on a brand new, state-of-the-art $2.5 million clinic on the city\u2019s southeast side, said Karen Johnson, office manager of husband Dr. Terry Johnson\u2019s clinic.\nPediatric Associates was able to make the decision to build the new clinic because of a change to Medicaid reimbursements, he said.\nThe location of the new clinic will be at 4420 Kimbell Dr. near Kickapoo Downtown Airport."}
