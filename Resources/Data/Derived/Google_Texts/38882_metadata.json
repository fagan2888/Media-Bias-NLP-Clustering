A Fox News spokesperson cited numbers from Nielsen, the ratings company that tracks TV viewership.\n\nIn 2013, Fox News also saw a 42 percent drop in viewers during the week of Christmas, according to Nielsen.\n\nThe TV research company noted that Fox News viewers have been dwindling all month, from 1,723,000 million viewers in the first week of December, ending Dec. 7, to 939,000 in the last week, ending Dec. 28.\n\nCompeting news channel MSNBC similarly saw a decline in the last two weeks of 2014, with viewership dropping 21 percent to 402,000.\n\nCNN improved to 484,000, up 10 percent.\n\nDish customers have been unable to watch Fox News and Fox Business News since negotiations between the companies reached an impasse Dec. 20.\n\nAt the time, Dish said Fox was asking for triple its rate if Dish wanted to offer the channels to its 14 million subscribers.\n\nDish has changed some content around, temporarily offering Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze on Channel 205 and NewsMax on Channel 206, according to its consumer site, dishstandsforyou.com. Fox News has its own consumer advocacy site, keepfoxnews.com.\n\nDouglas County-based Dish had no further comment Friday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fox News still dark for Dish customers, during seasonal ratings decline", "title": "Fox News still dark for Dish customers, during seasonal ratings decline", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/fox-news-still-dark-for-dish-customers-during-seasonal-ratings-decline/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T20:20:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T20:20:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4ee\"", "article_summary": "A Fox News spokesperson cited numbers from Nielsen, the ratings company that tracks TV viewership.\nDish customers have been unable to watch Fox News and Fox Business News since negotiations between the companies reached an impasse Dec. 20.\nA 43 percent drop in Fox News Channel\u2019s viewership last week coincided with a dispute between 21st Century Fox and Dish Network that left the channel dark for Dish\u2019s 14 million customers.\nAt the time, Dish said Fox was asking for triple its rate if Dish wanted to offer the channels to its 14 million subscribers.\nIn 2013, Fox News also saw a 42 percent drop in viewers during the week of Christmas, according to Nielsen."}
