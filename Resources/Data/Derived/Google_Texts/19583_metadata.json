Without the high level of merger and acquisition activity, S&P believes there would have been more credit downgrades this year.\n\nContinuing the trend, S&P expects there to be more downgrades in nonprofit healthcare than upgrades in 2015 due to a number of factors, including the effect of health reform readiness activities and emerging changes in the payment environment.\n\nAlthough expanded health coverage under the PPACA is viewed as a positive for the nonprofit sector, there is still uncertainty surrounding some of the health reform law's provisions, which could have a negative effect on nonprofit hospitals and health systems. For instance, S&P cited to King v. Burwell, a case challenging the subsidies millions of Americans receive to help them pay their health insurance premiums.\n\nAlthough S&P believes some nonprofit hospitals and health systems will be able to manage effectively in the changing healthcare environment, the rating agency expects many will have trouble adapting.\n\nMore articles on healthcare finance:\n\nEvaluating potential partners: Q&A with Sherman Oaks Hospital CFO Kanner Tillman\n\nScripps Health's surplus dips to $291.57M\n\nAfter 10-year battle, Piedmont Medical Center receives go-ahead to build new hospital\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
