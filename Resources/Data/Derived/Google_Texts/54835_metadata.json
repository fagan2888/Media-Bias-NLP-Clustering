Unlike the CNN Town Hall the previous day, Clinton did not struggle to come up with answers. Instead she repeated a serious of prepared sound bites which made her seem ingenuous.\n\nClinton, an old DLC Democrat, is making a huge mistake in getting into a debate she cannot win when she claims to be a progressive. She has already admitted to being a centrist, and she just shows her propensity for changing her views based upon political expediency when she claims otherwise. She also opens herself up for mocking by actual progressives, such as at Common Dreams, when she claims to be a progressive. As I recently pointed out with this graph, Clinton is much closer to the Republicans ideologically than Sanders and his supporters:\n\nIf Sanders made any mistake on this line of attack, it was to give the impression that holding certain views are a litmus test of whether one is a progressive. Certain individual progressives might disagree on one or more positions. It is the overall world view which counts, with Clinton opposing progressive viewpoints on a wide range of issues.\n\nClinton is also fighting a losing battle when claiming not to be part of the establishment because she is a woman. By that logic do we vote for Carly Fiorina? Citing support from Howard Dean does not also help her considering how Dean has sold out to be a lobbyist for they pharmaceutical industry.\n\nClinton\u2019s sound bites on so many issues are total nonsense. Despite what she claimed, HillaryCare was not ObamaCare. HillaryCare was a highly flawed plan which failed both due to its flaws and her unwillingness to compromise on the details. Her bungling of health care reform was the first sign that she is a progressive who gets things done. She also got far less done in the Senate compared to Sanders who was influential on passing many amendments.\n\nClinton repeated her nonsensical attack on Sanders\u2019 proposal for free public universities in saying, \u201cWhat I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump\u2019s kids, get to be able to afford college.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s kids are not going to go to free public universities.\n\nIn attacking Medicare for All, she falsely claimed, \u201cSenator Sanders wants us to start all over again.\u201d Expanding Medicare, a highly successful program we have now, is not starting all over again. And, in any event, Sanders is not going to take away ObamaCare before Medicare for All is available as the Clinton camp has suggested. Meanwhile, Clinton has no serious proposals to handle the high costs of health care which persist under ObamaCare, despite its improvements to the system, while Medicare for All would provide a solution.\n\nClinton continued to distort Bernie Sanders\u2019 record on guns, despite his D- lifetime rating from the NRA. She now claims to be more liberal, despite having described herself as a \u201cpro-gun churchgoer\u201d in 2008.\n\nClinton was put on the defensive regarding her ties to Wall Street and the speaking fees she received from Goldman Sachs. Back when it was seen as a race between Clinton and Jeb Bush, leaders of Goldman Sachs made it clear that they saw Clinton as being on their side. She evaded a question as to whether the transcripts of her highly-paid speeches to them will be released to the public.\n\nClinton denied that payouts from Wall Street affect her views. Elizabeth Warren has disagreed.\n\nI would also caution Clinton from repeating the phrase, \u201cI have a record\u201d while the FBI investigation of her email is in progress. She also repeated one of her dishonest sound bites here in claiming, \u201cThey are retroactively classifying it.\u201d As Reuters described months ago, some of the email was \u201cborn classified\u201d and as Secretary of State Clinton should have known the material was classified at the time. Further email releases have only made matters look worse for Clinton since this article was posted.\n\nClinton tried to excuse her actions by bringing up Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice. What they did does not excuse any violations of the law by Clinton. Plus stricter rules were put into place in 2009 in response to the abuses under the Bush administration which Clinton violated.\n\nClinton brags that Obama made her Secretary of State, but that was a political decision. He had rejected Clinton\u2019s views, such as her talk of obliterating Iran, during the campaign. Obama ran foreign policy from the White House, and the Obama administration usually rejected Clinton\u2019s more hawkish, neoconservative advice. Sanders pointed out how he was right on the Iraq war, and warned of the perpetual warfare we are likely to see if Clinton is elected. Unfortunately Clinton\u2019s hawkish views on Libya and Syria were not discussed during the debate. Sometimes I wish Sanders would also move further beyond his usual sound bites.\n\nThe issue of electability came up with Sanders pointing out how well he does in head to head match-ups against republicans. Old left versus right arguments re electability no longer apply. These days elections are won by getting out the base. Bernie can do that better than Clinton. Plus Sanders does better with independents while Clinton does poorly in the battleground states. Voters are looking for a candidate with integrity, and a reformer who who fix the system Clinton is too close to, not where a candidate falls on the flawed right to left spectrum.\n\nSanders is working towards improving his support among minorities (with news coming out earlier in the day that a former NAACP head is planning to endorse Sanders.) He was smart to bring up the impact on minorities when opposing the death penalty. He pointed out that, \u201ctoo many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. That\u2019s number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.\u201d\n\nSanders also discussed the water situation in Flint, Michigan. When he spoke of the children being poisoned, an issue where both Democratic candidates agree, I quipped on Facebook that Republicans do not agree\u2013they think that the poisoning of children is an issue which should be left up to the states. (My blow by blow account of the debate on Facebook has been left public for now.)\n\nBesides the issue of whether Clinton is a progressive and a member of the establishment, another topic which came up during the debate was a faux complaint from Clinton that Sanders was waging a negative campaign on her.\n\nThe Clinton machine is probably the dirtiest machine in all of politics, yet when someone presents an accurate criticism of Clinton\u2019s record she cries about how she is being smeared. The Clinton machine spread the Reverend Wright and Birther smears against Obama eight years ago. This year we have seen twisting of Sanders\u2019 words to claim sexism, a distortion of his position on guns, and claims that Sanders is going to take Medicare, Medicaid, and even ObamaCare away from people.\n\nSlate called Sanders the winner but did have some criticism of his performance, while others called it for Clinton. David Graham at The Atlantic called Sanders the winner but was reluctant to call Clinton a loser. He highlighted Sanders\u2019 concentration on limited issues, which I think is largely part of his strategy to take on Clinton and build a winning general election coalition. Google showed that there was more interest in Sanders than Clinton during the debate. More importantly, the types of search queries look more like those who are looking to become engaged with the campaign:\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nHow old is Hillary Clinton?\n\nWho can beat Hillary?\n\nWhere is Hillary Clinton today?\n\nWill Hillary win?\n\nHow much is Hillary Clinton worth?\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nWhere will Bernie Sanders be speaking?\n\nWhy Bernie Sanders?\n\nWho would be Bernie Sanders\u2019 VP?\n\nHow to donate to Bernie Sanders\n\nWhere can I see Bernie Sanders in NH?\n\nOriginally posted at Liberal Values", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "Wednesday's one-on-one debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton (transcript here) was probably the best debate yet, and unfortunately the lowest rated.
