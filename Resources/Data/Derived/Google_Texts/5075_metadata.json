Rand Paul, R-KY, and U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield \u2013 fit the profile of modern Golden State Republicans that Chairman Jim Brulte would like to popularize: well-spoken GOP celebrities who don\u2019t sound like fire-breathing evangelists.\n\nBut when their actual records are examined, Paul and McCarthy are wholly in tune with Tea Party terrorized Republican orthodoxy \u2013and some of the most whackjob extremists \u2014 on the most divisive issues for California voters: immigration, abortion, gay marriage and health care. (Not to mention climate change or the minimum wage.)\n\nWhen it comes to projecting an image that doesn\u2019t frighten moderate and independent voters, Paul and McCarthy are top-notch picks. But \u2013 whisper aside \u2013 they\u2019re both opposed to a pathway to citizenship and a woman\u2019s right to choose, against gay marriage and would \u2013 even now \u2014 repeal Obamacare.\n\nWisdom of Yoda Rhetoric does not supplant action; good words are no substitute for good deeds. As Calbuzzer Yoda explained to young Luke Skywalker: \u201cTry not. Do or not do. There is no try.\u201d\n\nPaul, in particular, as a potential 2016 candidate for president, has sought to soften his image on a variety of issues, especially immigration. He claims to have sympathy for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, has said he favors giving work permits to all of the country\u2019s illegal immigrants and he says he\u2019s for immigration reform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually a moderate on immigration,\u201d he said in one interview.\n\nBut not really. He voted against the comprehensive bill that was passed by the Senate last year, he previously opposed the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, which allowed up to 500,000 undocumented minors to be exempted from deportation. And he sharply criticized Texas Gov. Rick Perry for embracing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. His \u201csympathy\u201d for \u201cthe DREAM Act kids\u201d only goes so far.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very open to discussing that I think there should be some kind of immigration reform, but I don\u2019t think you can do it without first securing the border, and that\u2019s the problem with the president doing this unlawfully,\u201d Paul has said. And he\u2019s left no doubt that he\u2019s opposed to giving \u201camnesty\u201d to undocumented immigrants.\n\nHow they dodge Paul and others have made two critical sidesteps in hopes of finessing the immigration issue:\n\n1) They no longer talk about a pathway to citizenship but discuss a pathway to legalization, meaning undocumented immigrants already here might be able to get some form of residence status short of citizenship (and the right to vote);\n\n2) They\u2019re all for comprehensive reform but only after the \u201cborders have been secured\u201d \u2013 whatever that means and however that would be measured. Which it can\u2019t, which is why it\u2019s a phony form of support for immigration reform.\n\nIn other words, Sen. Paul talks a good game on immigration \u2013 hoping to sound less threatening to Latino voters \u2013 but in the end, he\u2019s an impassable boulder on the pathway to citizenship.\n\nThe 100% compromise: The other keynote speaker, Kevin McCarthy, likewise says he supports some form of legalization of undocumented immigrants, but he opposes a pathway to citizenship and, as Majority Leader of the House \u2013 the No. 2 leadership position \u2013 he has failed to bring immigration reform to the floor for a vote.\n\nHe, too, uses border security as a way to dodge pushing for reform. As he said in an interview with Fox News:\n\nI\u2019m on record saying nothing about immigration, until we secure the borders. The borders are not secure. Look at the humanitarian crisis that is happening right now along the border states. These are children coming from three major countries in Central America. They\u2019re going across. Kids are dying. Who knows what\u2019s happening when it comes to human trafficking and others, it\u2019s because our borders are not secure. Until you secure the borders, you cannot have the conversation about anything else.\n\nWhen Chris Wallace asked, \u201cThat must come first?\u201d McCarthy replied, \u201cThat must come first.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not reasonable compromise, As MSNBC\u2019s Rachael Maddow put it, McCarthy\u2019s approach is that \u201cRepublicans should get 100% of what they want, he says, while Democrats get 0% of what they want. Once the GOP is satisfied with having everything, Republicans will then consider related policies.\u201d\n\nBowing to GOP Taliban Paul and McCarthy may be in tune with the jihadist Republicans who attend GOP conventions, but they are sharply out of touch with California voters at large. As the Field Poll reported last February:\n\nThere is now nearly universal support among California voters to allow undocumented immigrants who have lived here for a number of years to stay and become citizens if they have a job, learn English, and pay back taxes. Statewide, 90% of voters now favor this policy.\n\nJust last week, the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll reported that 72% of likely voters in California \u2013 including 72% of Republicans! \u2013 agreed with a plan including a provision that would boost border security and \u201callow illegal immigrants already in the United States with no serious criminal record to apply for legal status, learn English, pay taxes and a penalty and then go to the back of the line to work toward citizenship.\u201d\n\nPaul and McCarthy are not even in synch with the majority view throughout the country where a recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution, nonpartisan research groups in Washington, found 62% of Americans in favor of a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the United States illegally.\n\nBut they sound reasonable when talking about the issue. And that\u2019s the image Brulte is hoping to project as he tries to rebuild the California GOP.\n\nLikewise on abortion, Paul and McCarthy like to sound reasonable, but they\u2019re not.\n\nPaul, for example, says he wouldn\u2019t try to overturn Roe v Wade but in Congress he introduced the Life at Conception Act, which would grant legal personhood rights to zygotes from the moment of fertilization. The bill would ban abortion entirely and could affect the legality of some forms of birth control and in-vitro fertilization.\n\nMcCarthy is in lockstep with National Right to Life on the issues surrounding abortion and favored cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhat you cannot fake Immigration and abortion are not just important wedge issues \u2013 they\u2019re threshold issues that have a dramatic effect on Latino and women voters in particular. While few Latinos or women argue that immigration or choice on abortion are the No. 1 issue facing the nation, huge proportions of these voters don\u2019t even want to hear a candidate\u2019s stand on other, more important issues, if he or she (or a party) is on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of these threshold issues.\n\nGay marriage and Obamacare are other high-profile issues on which both Paul and McCarthy may appeal to the Republican shock troops who attend GOP conventions, but not the broad mass of California or even U.S. voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the dilemma of appealing to the base versus winning elections,\u201d says lobbyist Bob Naylor, the very smart former Assembly leader and state GOP chairman. \u201cTo the extent that those issues are defining issues, I don\u2019t think you can finesse it.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see how far the headliners are willing to go on any of these issues when they speak to delegates on Saturday. The smart money says that Paul, at least, will be keeping the national impact of his words in mind, even if it means sounding a bit \u201cmoderate\u201d to the red meat crowd of conventioneers.\n\nP.S.
