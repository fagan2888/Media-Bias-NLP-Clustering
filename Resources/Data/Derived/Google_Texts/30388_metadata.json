At least for two elections worth. But you can't fool all of the people all of the time.\n\nObama has attempted to doctor intel reports into claiming that he's beating ISIS. But he needn't have wasted his time because Americans aren't buying it.\n\nAmericans believe 57 percent to 21 percent that Obama is losing the war to ISIS. Even Democrats admit it by 45 to 26 percent. Black voters admit it by 52 to 27 percent. The most ignorant category is predictably the 18-34 group that gets its news from the bleatings of John Oliver of BuzzFeed, but even it only has enough John Oliver fans to bring up the number who think the US is winning up to 34 percent. 43 percent know we're losing.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "You can't fool all of the people all of the time", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "You can't fool all of the people all of the time", "title": "Americans Say Obama Losing to ISIS 57% to 21%", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/259973/americans-say-obama-losing-isis-57-21-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/08/ht_obama_fear_poster_jef_120604_wblog.jpg?itok=mzqPb3n8", "updated_time": "2015-09-05T11:49:38-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/259973/americans-say-obama-losing-isis-57-21-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/08/ht_obama_fear_poster_jef_120604_wblog.jpg?itok=mzqPb3n8", "description": "You can't fool all of the people all of the time", "card": "summary", "title": "Americans Say Obama Losing to ISIS 57% to 21%"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T11:49:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-05T11:49:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb872\"", "article_summary": "Americans believe 57 percent to 21 percent that Obama is losing the war to ISIS.\nObama has attempted to doctor intel reports into claiming that he's beating ISIS.\nThe most ignorant category is predictably the 18-34 group that gets its news from the bleatings of John Oliver of BuzzFeed, but even it only has enough John Oliver fans to bring up the number who think the US is winning up to 34 percent.\nBut he needn't have wasted his time because Americans aren't buying it.\nBut you can't fool all of the people all of the time."}
