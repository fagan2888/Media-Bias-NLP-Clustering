I strayed from drinking my gallon of water a day for about a year now. But once I went looking for ways to cut weight, I constantly heard "drink more water." Some people told me to drink a gallon, some 2 gallons. According to experts you should be "drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily," this according to the National Institute of Health.

I've noticed a big change in my cravings since I started drinking a gallon of water a day. I also carry my gallon around with me to remind me to finish the whole thing.

I stumbled on an Infographic on Mother Nature Network and wanted to share it here. Some points:

- When dehydrated, cells are depleted of energy which causes them to rely. As a result, people tend to eat more when, in reality, the body is thirsty

- Drinking cold water can speed your metabolism and burn calories. The effects of elevated metabolism begin about 10 minutes after consuming the water and peak at 30-40 minutes after drinking.

- When chronically dehydrated, the body's organs, including its largest organ, the skin, begins to wrinkle and wither prematurely.
