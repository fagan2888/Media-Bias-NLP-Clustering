setback to the Federal Trade Commission, a federal judge denied a request to temporarily block the merger of Penn State Hershey Medical Center and PinnacleHealth System, Modern Healthcare reported.\n\nThe ruling is a rare blow for the FTC, which has stopped a number of hospital mergers in recent years.\n\nThe FTC and the Pennsylvania attorney general can appeal the decision.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn deciding for the hospitals, U.S. District Judge John Jones said that the FTC failed to acknowledge the pressures of the changing healthcare environment, including the Affordable Care Act, fluctuations in Medicare and Medicare reimbursement and risk-based contracting.\n\n\u201cWe find it no small irony that the same federal government under which the FTC operates has created a climate that virtually compels institutions to seek alliances such as the hospitals intend here,\u201d Jones wrote.\n\nHe also chided FTC for failing to consider how far many patients have to travel to reach hospitals, and for not including enough hospitals, in its definition of the two health systems\u2019 market.\n\n\u201cIn sum, we find based on the hours of testimony and thousands of pages of exhibits presented by the parties and considered by this court, that the FTC\u2019s four-county \u2018Harrisburg Area\u2019 relevant geographic market is unrealistically narrow and does not assume the commercial realities by consumers in the region,\u201d the judge writes.\n\nJones also notes that the two hospitals have proactively worked with major payers in central Pennsylvania to ensure they don\u2019t raise rates after the merger.\n\nThe merger will combine Penn State Hersey\u2019s 508-bed facility with PinnacleHealth\u2019s 607-bed, three-campus system.\n\nIn a blog post on the university\u2019s website, the hospitals said the merger will increase patient access to a wider range of services and full-spectrum care.\n\n\"The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Monday failure to halt a Pennsylvania hospital merger could help health care providers in future merger cases because in a novel move, the judge described the Affordable Care Act as a factor that could help justify industry consolidation, experts say,\" Law 360 noted.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nModern Healthcare: Judge delivers FTC rare healthcare loss in Pennsylvania hospital case", "article_metadata":
