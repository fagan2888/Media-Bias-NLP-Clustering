Pasadena police say one person was injured when a generator inside a refinery exploded.

Police spokesman Vance Mitchell said the explosion inside the Pasadena Refining System Inc. facility happened Saturday morning.

He says refinery officials are continuing to do a head count and that he believes the injured person was taken to a nearby hospital. Mitchell did not know the extent of the personâ€™s injuries.

He says a plume of blue and black smoke could be seen rising from the refinery but no evacuation was ordered.

Plant officials told authorities there was no danger to the public and no chemicals were released.

Washburn Tunnel, which is nearby and runs beneath the Houston Ship Channel, was closed and workers inside were told to shelter in place.
