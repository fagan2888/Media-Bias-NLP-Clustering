If we can revive extinct life forms, create analog worlds, and weave new webs of communication\u2014what about new webs of life? Why not synthetic life forms that can sense, feel, remember, and go through Darwinian evolution?\n\n* * *\n\nHod Lipson is the only man I know whose first name means \u201csplendor\u201d in Hebrew and a V-shaped wooden trough for carrying bricks over one shoulder in English. The paradox suits him physically and mentally. He looks strong and solid enough to carry a hod full of bricks, but he would be the first to suggest that the bricks might not resemble any you\u2019ve ever known. They might even saunter, reinvent themselves, refuse to be stacked, devise their own mortar, fight back, explore, breed more of their kind, and boast a nimble curiosity about the world. Splendor can be bricklike, if graced by complexity.\n\nHis lab building at Cornell University is home to many a skunk-works project in computer sciences or engineering, including some of DARPA\u2019s famous design competitions (agile robots to clean up toxic disasters, superhero exoskeletons for soldiers, etc.). Nearby, two futuristic DARPA Challenge cars have been left like play-worn toys a few steps from a display case of antique engineering marvels and an elevator that\u2019s old and slow as a butter churn.\n\nOn the second floor, a black spider-monkey-like robot clings to the top left corner of Lipson\u2019s office door, intriguing but inscrutable, except to the inner circle for whom it\u2019s a wry symbol and tradesman\u2019s sign of the sort colonial shopkeepers used to hang out to identify their business: the apothecary\u2019s mortar and pestle, the chandler\u2019s candles, the cabinetmaker\u2019s hickory-spindled armchair, the roboticist\u2019s apprentice. Though in its prime the leggy bot drew the keen gaze of students, students come and go, as do the smartbots they work on, which, coincidentally, seem to have a life span of about 3.5 years\u2014how long it takes a student to finish a dissertation and graduate.\n\nA man with curly hair, chestnut-brown eyes, and a dimpled chin, Hod welcomes me into his cheerful office: tall windows, a work desk, a Dell computer with a triptych of screens, window boxes for homegrown tomatoes in summer, and a wall of bookshelves, atop which sits an array of student design projects. To me they look unfamiliar but strangely beautiful and compelling, like the merchandise in an extraterrestrial bazaar. A surprisingly tall white table and its chairs invite one to climb aboard and romp with ideas. At Lipson\u2019s round table, if you\u2019re under six feet tall, your feet will automatically leave the planet, which is good, I think, because even this limited levitation aids the imagination, untying gravity just enough to make magic carpet rides, wing-walkers, and spaceships humble as old rope. There\u2019s a reason we cling to such elevating turns of phrase as \u201cI was walking on air,\u201d \u201cThat was uplifting,\u201d \u201cheightened awareness,\u201d \u201csurmounting obstacles,\u201d or \u201cMy feet never touched the ground.\u201d The mental mischief of creativity\u2014which thrives on such fare as deep play, risk, a superfluity of ideas, the useful application of obsession, and willingly backtracking or hitting dead ends without losing heart\u2014is also fueled by subtle changes in perception. So why not cast off mental moorings and hover a while each day?\n\nWhat\u2019s the next hack for a rambunctious species full of whiz kids with digital dreams? Lipson is fascinated by a different branch of the robotic evolutionary tree than the tireless servant, army of skilled hands, or savant of finicky incisions with which we have become familiar. Over ten million Roomba vacuum cleaners have already sold to homeowners (who sometimes find them being ridden as child or cat chariots). We watch with fascination as robotic sea scouts explore the deep abysses (or sunken ships), and NOAA\u2019s robots glide underwater to monitor the strength of hurricanes. Google\u2019s robotics division owns a medley of firms, including some minting life-size humanoids\u2014because, in public spaces, we\u2019re more likely to ask a cherub-faced robot for info than a touchscreen. Both Apple and Amazon are diving into advanced robotics as well. The military has invested heavily in robots as spies, bionic gear, drones, pack animals, and bomb disposers. Robots already work for us with dedicated precision in factory assembly lines and operating rooms. In cross-cultural studies, the elderly will happily adopt robotic pets and even babies, though they aren\u2019t keen on robot caregivers at the moment.\n\nAll of that, to Lipson, is child\u2019s play. His focus is on a self-aware species, Robot sapiens. Our own lineage branched off many times from our apelike ancestors, and so will the flowering, subdividing lineage of robots, which perhaps needs its own Linnaean classification system. The first branch in robot evolution could split between AI and AL\u2014artificial intelligence and artificial life. Lipson stands right at that fork in that road, whose path he\u2019s famous for helping to divine and explore in one of the great digital adventures of our age. It\u2019s the ultimate challenge, in terms of engineering, in terms of creation.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he says with a nearly illegible smile, \u201cI\u2019m trying to recreate life in a synthetic environment\u2014not necessarily something that will look human. I\u2019m not trying to create a person who will walk out the door and say \u2018Hello!\u2019 with all sorts of anthropomorphic features, but rather features that are truly alive given the principles of life\u2014traits and behaviors they have evolved on their own. I don\u2019t want to build something, turn it on, and suddenly it will be alive. I don\u2019t want to program it.\u201d\n\nA lot of robotics today, and a lot of science fiction, is about a human who schemes at a workbench in a dingy basement, digitally darning scraps, and then figuring out how to command his scarecrow to do his bidding. Or a mastermind who builds the perfect robots that eventually go haywire in barely discernible stages and start to massacre us, sometimes on Earth, often in space. It assumes an infinite power that humans have (and so can lose) over the machine.\n\nEngineering\u2019s orphans, Lipson\u2019s brainchildren would be the first generation of truly self-reliant machines, gifted with free will by their soft, easily damaged creators. These synthetic souls would fend for themselves, learn, and grow\u2014mentally, socially, physically\u2014in a body not designed by us or by nature, but by fellow computers.\n\nThat may sound sci-fi, but Lipson is someone who relishes not only pushing the envelope but tinkering with its dimensions, fabric, inertia, and character. For instance, bothered by a question that nags sci-fi buffs, engineers, and harried parents alike\u2014Where are all the robots we were told would be working for us by now?\u2014he decided to go about robotics in a new way. And also in the most ancient of ways, by summoning the \u201cmother of all designers, Evolution,\u201d and asking a primordial soup of robotic bits and pieces to zing through millions of generations of fluky mutations, goaded by natural selection. Of course, natural evolution is a slapdash and glacially slow mother, yielding countless bottlenecks for every success story. But computers can be programmed to \u201cevolve\u201d at great speed with digital finesse, and adapt to all the rigors of their environment.\n\nWould they be able to taste and smell? I wonder, realizing at once how outmoded the very question is. Taste buds rise like flaky volcanoes on different regions of the tongue, with bitter at the back, lest we swallow poisons. How hard would it be to evolve a suite of specialized \u201ctaste buds\u201d that bear no resemblance to flesh? Flavor engineers at Nestle\u0301 in Switzerland have already created an electronic \u201ctaster\u201d of espresso, which analyzes the gas different pulls of ristretto give off when heated, translating each bouquet of ions into such human-friendly, visceral descriptions as \u201croasted,\u201d \u201cflowery,\u201d \u201cwoody,\u201d \u201ctoffee,\u201d and \u201cacidy.\u201d\n\nHowever innovative, Lipson\u2019s entities are still primitive when compared to a college sophomore or a bombardier beetle. But they\u2019re the essential groundwork for a culture, maybe a hundred years from now, in which some robots will do our bidding, and others will share our world as a parallel species, one that\u2019s creative and curious, moody and humorous, quick-witted, multitalented, and 100 percent synthetic. Will we regard them as life, as a part of nature, if they\u2019re not carbon-based\u2014as are all of Earth\u2019s plants and animals? Can they be hot-blooded without blood? How about worried, petulant, sly, envious, downright cussed? The future promises fleets of sovereign silicants and, ultimately, self-governing, self-reliant robotic angels and varmints, sages and stooges. To be able to ponder such possibilities is a testament to the infinite agility of matter and its great untapped potential.\n\nWhenever Lipson talks of robots being truly alive, gently stressing the word, I don\u2019t hear Dr. Frankenstein speaking, at one in the morning, as the rain patters dismally against the panes, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?\n\nAs in the book\u2019s epigraph, lines from Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost: \u201cDid I request thee, Maker, from my clay / To mould Me man?\u201d Mary Shelley suggests that the parent of a monster is ultimately responsible for all the suffering and evil he has unleashed. From her early years of seventeen to twenty-one, Shelley was herself consumed by physical creation and literally sparking life, becoming pregnant and giving birth repeatedly, only to have three of her four children die soon after birth. She was continually pregnant, nursing, or mourning\u2014 creating and being depleted by her own creations. That complex visceral state fed her delicately horrifying tale.\n\nIn her day, scientists were doing experiments in which they animated corpses with electricity, fleetingly bringing them back to life, or so it seemed. Whatever the image of Frankenstein\u2019s monster may have meant to Shelley, it has seized the imagination of people ever since, symbolizing something unnatural, Promethean, monstrous that we\u2019ve created by playing God, or from evil motives or through simple neglect (Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s sin wasn\u2019t in creating the monster but in abandoning it). Something we\u2019ve created that, in the end, will extinguish us. And that\u2019s certainly been a key theme in science-fiction novels and films about robots, androids, golems, zombies, and homicidal puppets. Such ethical implications aren\u2019t Lipson\u2019s concern; that\u2019s mainly for seminars and summits in a future he won\u2019t inhabit. But such discussions are already beginning on some campuses. We\u2019ve entered the age of such college disciplines as \u201crobo-ethics\u201d and Lipson\u2019s specialty, \u201cevolutionary robotics.\u201d\n\nHas it come to this, I wonder, creating novel life forms to prove we can, because a restless mind, left to its own devices and given enough time, is bound to create equally restless devices, just to see what happens? It\u2019s a new threshold of creators creating creative beings.\n\n\u201cCreating life is certainly a tall pinnacle to surmount. Is it also a bit like having children?\u201d I ask Lipson.\n\n\u201cIn a different way. . . . Having children isn\u2019t so much an intellectual challenge, but other kinds of challenges.\u201d His eyebrows lift slightly to underline the understatement, and a memory seems to flit across his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes, but you set them in motion and they don\u2019t remake themselves exactly, but . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have very little control. You can\u2019t program a child . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can shape its brain, change the wiring.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you can shape some of the child\u2019s experiences, but there are others you can\u2019t control, and a lot of the personality is in the genes: nature, not nurture. Certainly in the next couple of decades we won\u2019t be programming machines, but . . . like children, exactly . . . we\u2019ll shape their experiences a little bit, and they\u2019ll grow on their own and do what they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ll simply adjust to whatever job is required?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. Adaptation and adjustment, and with that will come other issues, and a lot of problems.\u201d He smiles the smile of someone who has seen dust-ups on a playground. \u201cEmotions will be a big part of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think we\u2019ll get to the point where machines have deep emotions?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will have deep emotions,\u201d Hod says, certain as the tides. \u201cBut they won\u2019t necessarily be human emotions. And also machines will not always do what we want them to do. This is already happening. Programming something is the ultimate control. You get to make it do exactly what you want when you want it. This is how robots in factories are programmed to work today. But the more we give away some of our control over how the machine learns . . .\u201d\n\nAs a cool gust of October air wafts through the screenless window, carrying a faint scent of crumbling magnolia leaves and damp earth, it trails gooseflesh across my wrist.\n\n\u201cLet me close the window.\u201d Hod slides gingerly off the tall chair as if from a soda fountain seat and closes the gaping mouth of the window.\n\nWe were making eye contact; how did he notice my gooseflesh? Stare at something and only the center of your vision is in focus; the periphery blurs. Is his visual compass wider than most people\u2019s, or is he just being a thoughtful host and, sensing a breeze himself, reasoning that since I\u2019m sitting closer to the window I might be feeling chillier? As we talk, his astonishingly engineered biological brain\u2014with its flexible, self-repairing, self-assembling, regenerating components that won\u2019t leave toxic metals when they decompose\u2014is working hard on several fronts: picturing what he wants to say in all of its complexity; rummaging through a sea of raw and thought-rinsed ideas; gauging my level of knowledge\u2014very low in his field; choosing the best way to translate his thoughts into words for this newly met and unfamiliar listener; reading my unconscious cues; rethinking some of his words when they\u2019re barely uttered; revising them right as they\u2019re leaving his mouth, in barely perceptible changes to a word\u2019s opening sound; choosing the ones most accurate on several levels (literally, professionally, emotionally, intellectually) whose meaning I may nonetheless give subtle signs of not really understanding\u2014signs visible to him though unconscious to me, as they surface from a dim warehouse of my previous thoughts and experiences and a vocabulary in which each word carries its own unique emotional valence\u2014while at the same time he\u2019s also forming impressions of me, and gauging the impression I might be forming of him . . .\n\nThis is called a \u201cconversation,\u201d the spoken exchange of thoughts, opinions, and feelings. It\u2019s hard to imagine robots doing the same on as many planes of meaning, layered emotions, and spring-loaded memories.\n\nBeyond the windows with their magenta-colored accordion blinds, and the narrow Zen roof garden of rounded stones, twenty yards across the courtyard and street, behind a flimsy orange plastic fence, giant earth-diggers and men in hard hats are tearing up rock and soil with the help of machines wielding fierce toothy jaws. Such brutish dinosaurs will one day give way to rational machines that can transform themselves into whatever the specific task requires\u2014 perhaps the sudden repair of an unknown water pipe\u2014without a boss telling them what to do. By then the din of jackhammers will also be antiquated, though I\u2019m sure our hackles will still twitch at the scrape of claw-like metal talons on rock.\n\n\u201cWhen a machine learns from experience, there are few guarantees about whether or not it will learn what you want,\u201d Lipson continues as he remounts his chair. \u201cAnd it might learn something that you didn\u2019t want it to learn, and yet it can\u2019t forget. This is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nI shudder at the thought of traumatized robots.\n\nHe continues, \u201cIt\u2019s the unspoken Holy Grail of a lot of roboticists\u2014 to create just this kind of self-awareness, to create consciousness.\u201d\n\nWhat do roboticists like Lipson mean when they speak of \u201cconscious\u201d robots? Neuroscientists and philosophers are still squabbling over how to define consciousness in humans and animals. On July 7, 2012, a group of neuroscientists met at the University of Cambridge to declare officially that nonhuman animals \u201cincluding all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses\u201d are conscious. To formalize their position, they signed a document entitled \u201cThe Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness in Non-Human Animals.\u201d\n\nBut beyond being conscious, humans are quintessentially self-aware. Some other animals\u2014orangutans and other cousins of ours, dolphins and octopuses, and some birds\u2014are also self-aware. A wily jay might choose to cache a seed more quietly because other jays are nearby and it doesn\u2019t want the treasure stolen; an octopus might take the lid off its habitat at night to go for a stroll and then replace the lid when it returns lest its keepers find out. They possess a theory of mind, and can intuit what a rival might do in a given situation and act accordingly. They exhibit deceit, compassion, the ability to see themselves through another\u2019s eyes. Chimpanzees feel deeply, strategize, plan, think abstractly to a surprising degree, mourn, empathize some, deceive, seduce, and are all too conscious of life\u2019s pressures, if not its chastening illusions. They\u2019re blessed and burdened, as we are, by strong family ties and quirky personalities, from madcap to martinet. They jubilate when happy, mope when sad.\n\nI don\u2019t think they fret and reason endlessly about mental states, as we do. They simply dream a different dream, probably much like the one we used to dream, before we crocheted into our neural circuitry the ability to have ideas about everything. Other animals may know you know something, but they don\u2019t know you know they know. Other mammals may think, but we think about having thoughts. Linnaeus categorized us in the subspecies of Homo sapiens sapiens, adding the extra sapiens because we don\u2019t just know, we know that we know. Our infants respond to their surroundings and other people, and start evolving a sense of self during their first year. Like orangutans, elephants, and even European magpies, they can identify themselves in a mirror, and they gather that others have a personal point of view that differs from their own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not sci-fi: Meet an amazing professor building creative, curious, moody, quick-witted and multitalented robots", "title": "Here comes the future: We\u2019re making robots that feel!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's not sci-fi: Meet an amazing professor building creative, curious, moody, quick-witted and multitalented robots", "title": "Here comes the future: We\u2019re making robots that feel!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/28/here_comes_the_future_were_making_robots_that_feel/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/c3p0_r2d22.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's not sci-fi: Meet an amazing professor building creative, curious, moody, quick-witted and multitalented robots", "title": "Here comes the future: We\u2019re making robots that feel!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/c3p0_r2d22.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Diane Ackerman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, excerpts, robots", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc366\"", "article_summary": "Other animals may know you know something, but they don\u2019t know you know they know.\nI don\u2019t think they fret and reason endlessly about mental states, as we do.\nLinnaeus categorized us in the subspecies of Homo sapiens sapiens, adding the extra sapiens because we don\u2019t just know, we know that we know.\nThe military has invested heavily in robots as spies, bionic gear, drones, pack animals, and bomb disposers.\nAnd that\u2019s certainly been a key theme in science-fiction novels and films about robots, androids, golems, zombies, and homicidal puppets."}
