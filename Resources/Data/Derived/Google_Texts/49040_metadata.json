(Reuters)\n\nRepublicans are pulling out of their only scheduled debate that would be aired on a Spanish-language TV network. So Democrats may respond by holding a second gathering aired on one.\n\nThe Spanish-language network Telemundo is in talks with the Democratic National Committee about possibly scheduling a new candidate forum with the Dem presidential candidates, after the Republican National Committee canceled its debate on NBC News and the NBC-owned Telemundo to protest CNBC\u2019s handling of last week\u2019s gathering, sources familiar with ongoing discussions tell me.\n\nIf this comes to fruition, Democrats would effectively be moving into the breach created by the RNC\u2019s decision. It would mean Democrats end up holding two debate-style events on Spanish-language networks, since they are already set to hold a Univision debate in March.\n\nTelemundo had already been in private talks with the DNC about holding a candidate forum, but in the wake of the GOP decision, those efforts will now be escalated, I\u2019m told.\n\n\u201cTelemundo will intensify its ongoing discussions with the DNC about having some type of candidate forum in light of the RNC cancelling the only Spanish-language Republican debate that they had scheduled,\u201d a source familiar with ongoing discussions between Telemundo and Democrats tells me.\n\nIf Telemundo does hold a candidate forum with Democrats, it would not be a DNC-sanctioned debate, but rather a forum similar to the one being held by MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow this Friday in South Carolina. Thus, ultimately Telemundo would set up such a gathering in direct talks with the Democratic campaigns. But the DNC would offer organizational support, and the DNC appears to be generally supportive of the idea and is giving some input already.\n\n\u201cIf NBC and Telemundo host a forum for Democratic candidates we\u2019d be happy to promote it, just as we have with others like the November 6th South Carolina forum with MSNBC,\u201d Luis Miranda, the communications director for the DNC, tells me. \u201cWhile we will not be sanctioning forums, we would be happy to help promote such events should they organize them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obviously possible that this won\u2019t come to anything. The Democratic campaigns may decide the logistics are too daunting or that they don\u2019t want to take time out of their campaigning schedules for it, or it could fall through for other reasons.\n\nBut you\u2019d think it would be a good idea for Democrats to try to make this happen. The RNC is claiming there will be another debate scheduled to replace the cancelled one on NBC and Telemundo. But RNC chair Reince Priebus has declined to say whether Telemundo would be included in the replacement debate. Obviously the RNC did not cancel this debate because of the Spanish-language network\u2019s participation; it had many other reasons for doing so. But one consequence of this decision could be that Republicans end up holding no debate aired on a Spanish-language network. If Democrats do add a second such gathering, they would then be able to argue that they are far more interested in communicating with Latino voters than Republicans are, which is a good message for the general election.\n\nIndeed, one of the GOP campaigns \u2014 that of Jeb Bush \u2014 is actually protesting the decision to cancel the NBC/Telemundo debate, and demanding that Telemundo be reinstated, presumably because Latino outreach would be good not just for Jeb Bush, but for the GOP overall. Guess which GOP candidate is opposing a reinstatement of Telemundo? Yep: Donald Trump. All this comes after GOP establishment types went into full-scale panic earlier this fall over the damage Trump \u2014 with his call for mass deportations and suggestion that Mexican immigrants are rapists \u2014 may already be doing to the GOP brand among Latinos. And it comes as incoming House Speaker Paul Ryan is renewing his pledge not to act on immigration reform while Obama is president.\n\n*********************************************************************\n\n* FRUSTRATED GOP CAMPAIGNS TRY TO CHANGE DEBATE PROCESS: Last night representatives from the GOP presidential campaigns met to try to alter the debate process. The New York Times sums up their demands:\n\nThey emerged with a modest list of demands, including opening and closing statements of at least 30 seconds; \u201cparity and integrity\u201d on questions, meaning that all candidates would receive similarly substantive questions; no so-called lightning rounds; and approval of any graphics that are aired during the debate. The campaign representatives also moved to take the Republican National Committee out of the debate negotiating process.\n\nOne wonders what the GOP candidates mean by demanding questions with \u201cintegrity.\u201d I guess we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n* JEB WANTS SPANISH-LANGUAGE COVERAGE. TRUMP DOESN\u2019T: The Post overview of the meeting also contains this striking little nugget:\n\nBush campaign manager Danny Diaz recommended that Telemundo be reinstated after being dropped along with NBC. But the campaign of businessman Donald Trump, represented by manager Corey Lewandowski, threatened to boycott a debate if the Spanish-language network that Trump has clashed with was granted one.\n\nI suppose Donald Trump has very good reasons for wanting as few Latinos as possible to hear his ideas, but that\u2019s not exactly good for GOP overall.\n\n* PAUL RYAN VOWS NOT TO REFORM IMMIGRATION: Incoming Speaker Paul Ryan this weekend went out of his way to reassure conservatives: Republicans will not enter into any bipartisan compromising with Obama on immigration reform. No sirree:\n\n\u201cSpecifically on this issue, you cannot trust this president,\u201d Ryan said on CNN, making reference to Obama\u2019s executive orders last year granting some illegal immigrants a path to legal status: \u201cThis president tried to write the law himself. . . . Presidents don\u2019t write laws; Congress writes laws.\u201d\n\nShorter Paul Ryan: Conservatives won\u2019t let me hold a vote on the immigration reforms I myself would like to see happen, and I\u2019m not about to challenge that, so I\u2019ll just go ahead and blame this on #Obummer.\n\n* DEMS HIT GOP OVER SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE: The Hillary Clinton-allied Super PAC Priorities USA is releasing a new Web video this morning featuring comments from Ben Carson, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio that suggest Republicans would target Social Security and Medicare. The video then cuts to Clinton ridiculing Jeb\u2019s \u201cRight to Rise\u201d Super Pac, by saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can credibly say that everyone has a \u2018right to rise,\u201d and then say you\u2019re for phasing out Medicare or repealing Obamacare. People can\u2019t rise if they can\u2019t afford health care.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an indication that Dems will seek to make GOP designs on entitlements a key point of contrast for yet another cycle.\n\n* ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER DEMS: Paul Krugman looks at all the evidence that the economy does better under Democrats, and explains why GOP candidates always promise that tax cuts for the rich will produce spectacular growth. If not, we\u2019d have to pay for them by cutting government programs deeply:\n\nHow can a politician sell the tax-cut agenda? The answer is, by promising those miracles, by insisting that tax cuts on high incomes would both pay for themselves and produce wonderful economic gains\u2026.Republicans must sell an essentially unpopular agenda by confidently declaring that they have the ultimate recipe for prosperity \u2014 and hope that nobody points out their historically poor track record.\n\nIt\u2019s of a piece with the deeply held Republican belief, on display in this cycle once again, that there\u2019s too much downward redistribution of wealth. Of course, their resulting agenda of rolling back Obama\u2019s redistributive policies has to be sold as good for those at the bottom and in the middle.\n\n* REPUBLICANS ARE DEEPLY PESSIMISTIC: E.J. Dionne sits in on a focus group of New Hampshire Republicans as they watched the last GOP debate, and finds them deeply convinced that the country is being transformed, perhaps irrevocably, into something vaguely awful:\n\nThis is why there\u2019s cheering on the right for the obstructionism of groups such as the House Freedom Caucus. Throwing sand in the gears of the machine is an honorable pursuit if you believe the machine is headed entirely in the wrong direction. It\u2019s also why Trump and Carson will not be easily pushed aside.\n\nIndeed. Threatening massive damage to the country to stop Obama (via debt limit showdowns, for instance) is justified, given what he\u2019s already doing to it.\n\n* QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND, DEEP-INSIDE-THE-GOP-PRIMARY-BUBBLE EDITION: Ted Cruz lays down conditions for the next GOP debate moderators:\n\n\u201cHow about we stop letting left-wing liberals moderate Republican debates?\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHow about if say from now on, if you have never voted in a Republican primary in your life, you don\u2019t get moderate a Republican primary debate?\u201d\n\nAlso, no more debate moderators who traffic in any facts that challenge the cherished mythologies of GOP primary voters, deal?", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Republicans cancel their only debate on a Spanish-language network, Democrats may move to schedule a second one.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "After Republicans cancel their only debate on a Spanish-language network, Democrats may move to schedule a second one.", "title": "Morning Plum: Republicans shoot themselves in foot with Latinos, again", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/plum-line/Images/GOP_2016_Trump-0e8ae-021.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/02/morning-plum-republicans-shoot-themselves-in-foot-with-latinos-again/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "rnc, republican national committee, rnc cancels nbc debate, jeb bush, donald trump, hillary clinton, latino voters, republican primary, priorities usa", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "rnc, republican national committee, rnc cancels nbc debate, jeb bush, donald trump, hillary clinton, latino voters, republican primary, priorities usa"}, "article_summary": "One wonders what the GOP candidates mean by demanding questions with \u201cintegrity.\u201d I guess we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\nBut one consequence of this decision could be that Republicans end up holding no debate aired on a Spanish-language network.\n* QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND, DEEP-INSIDE-THE-GOP-PRIMARY-BUBBLE EDITION: Ted Cruz lays down conditions for the next GOP debate moderators:\u201cHow about we stop letting left-wing liberals moderate Republican debates?\u201d Cruz said.\n(Reuters)Republicans are pulling out of their only scheduled debate that would be aired on a Spanish-language TV network.\nThe RNC is claiming there will be another debate scheduled to replace the cancelled one on NBC and Telemundo."}
