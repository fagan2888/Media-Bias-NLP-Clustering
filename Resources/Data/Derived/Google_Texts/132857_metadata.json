It felt like a weight had been lifted off the state of South Carolina. The flag coming down is a thing I believe needed to happen \u2026 We\u2019re not the state that everybody thinks we are. \u2014 Gov. Nikki Haley, speaking on NBC\n\n\n\n\u201cI removed the flag not only in defiance of those who enslaved my ancestors in the southern United States, but also in defiance of the oppression that continues against black people globally in 2015 \u2026 I did it for all the fierce black women on the front lines of the movement and for all the little black girls who are watching us. I did it because I am free.\u201d \u2014 Bree Newsome, who took down the Confederate flag on June 27 as an act of civil disobedience.\n\n\n\n\u201cMaking a difference in our communities has been \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 a part of the fabric of Nelson Mullins. It is in that tradition that we strongly support the decision to revisit the issue of the Confederate flag in order to move it to a more appropriate location.\u201d \u2014 Nelson Mullins law firm\n\n\n\n\u201cThis flag has become too divisive and too hurtful for too many of our fellow Americans.\u201d \u2014 Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee\n\n\n\n\u201cBMW applauds the courage of Gov. Haley and supports her leadership in calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the grounds of the South Carolina State House.\u201d \u2014 BMW statement to Talking Points Memo\n\n\n\n\u201cThe creed of our great state is Dum Spiro Spero \u2014 While I breathe I hope. Today is a day that millions have hoped for and our collective joy is representative of what South Carolinians and all people of good will can accomplish when we come together.\u201d \u2014 Mayor Steve Benjamin\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we go forward from the horrors of June 17th, let us learn from the example set by the parishioners and leaders of Mother Emanuel AME church toward healing the gaping wound that appalled our state. Let us have meaningful conversations that look honestly at the racial biases that poison minds and can lead to the most horrific acts. Let us think and act deliberately about a new legacy for our state, one that brings the two South Carolinas together into one.\u201d \u2014 Former Gov. Dick Riley and Riley Institute Director Don Gordon in op-ed for The Greenville News\n\n\n\nConfederate Flag Timeline\n\nAfter state legislators reached a compromise in 2000, moving the flag from the State House dome to its longstanding spot by a Confederate war memorial, political leaders were reluctant to raise the issue again.Republicans remembered the example of former Gov. David Beasley, who championed the idea of removing the flag two decades ago, only to set off a firestorm of opposition within his own political base that helped lead to his defeat in 1998 when he sought a second term. Democrats remembered how long and hard they fought just to move the flag in the first place \u2014 and knew they lacked the votes to advance the issue once again in a flag-weary General Assembly.All of that changed on June 17 and in its immediate aftermath. When 21-year-old Dylann Roof allegedly killed nine churchgoers in Charleston \u2014 and a photo emerged shortly thereafter showing Roof holding a gun in one hand and a Confederate flag in the other \u2014 the political ground shifted quickly. Republican presidential candidates, all of whom are keen to do well in South Carolina\u2019s 2016 primary, were put on the spot over their positions on the flag. The candidates waffled, with most of them trying to dodge the question by calling the matter a states\u2019 rights issue. Meanwhile, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney spoke loud and clear: The flag should come down.As the presidential candidates stumbled, the public was moving in another direction. Several rallies were held at the State House calling for the flag to come down. A poll conducted June 23 for Free Times by Crantford Research found that 54 percent of South Carolina voters wanted the flag to come down \u2014 a huge shift from last fall, when a Winthrop Poll found that 61 percent of residents wanted the flag to stay where it was.In the end, all it took for the flag to come down was political cover from Gov. Nikki Haley. Once the governor announced on June 22 that she wanted the flag to come down, business leaders and politicians jumped on the bandwagon. Despite lengthy debate in the S.C. House over the matter, the eventual votes in both the House and Senate to take down the flag were lopsided in favor.The flag came down last Friday, July 10, in a brief morning ceremony attended by thousands. The crowd cheered as the flag was lowered.Now that the flag is down, many are heralding the arrival of a new era in South Carolina \u2014 one of a more inclusive politics rooted in racial understanding rather than racial divisiveness.While we at Free Times would welcome the arrival of a kinder, gentler politics \u2014 an environment in which lawmakers worked together on such seemingly intractable problems as persistent poverty, educational inequities and access to health care \u2014 we\u2019re not convinced that the removal of a symbol will lead to a change in substance. For that to happen, we would need to see the same coalition that demanded the removal of the flag work together toward improvement in other areas \u2014 and that\u2019s a high hurdle.As we enter the post-flag era, we\u2019ll set our sights a little lower: If not a change in the substance of our politics, we can at least hope for a change in tone. We can\u2019t expect that legislators will suddenly have a change of heart on their long-held positions on Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act. What we can and should expect is that lawmakers will cease to govern in a way that is blatantly offensive to a significant portion of the state\u2019s residents. If the removal of a divisive symbol can at least achieve that, it would stand as a lasting achievement in the history of our state.This week, Free Times looks back at the history of how the flag came down with a timeline of key events and photos from recent events. \u2014 Dan CookBy Eva Moore: One hundred years after the Civil War, a Confederate flag is raised on the dome of the State House as part of the bicentennial celebration. Originally, the flag hadn\u2019t been part of the commemoration activities, but Aiken Rep. John May, who chaired the state\u2019s centennial observance committee (and, according to a historian on the committee, used to wear a Confederate uniform to the meetings), made the request. A resolution to raise the flag didn\u2019t pass until 1962.\u2013 Tensions over the flag heat up as several Columbia businesses and groups ask that it be removed. A rally in defense of the flag draws 100 people.\u2013 Rep. Kay Patterson, a Richland Democrat and later a state senator, mounts the first of his many efforts to have the flag taken down, telling his fellow lawmakers, \u201cYou certainly know by now, or at least y\u2019all ought to know, since viewing Alex Haley\u2019s Roots on the idiot box, that your admiration for y\u2019all\u2019s flag is not shared by us descendants of that peculiar institution of slavery.\u201d He\u2019s forced to sit down on the objection of a colleague, but is later allowed to finish.- Glenn McConnell, then a state senator and later the Senate president pro tem, appears on NBC-TV\u2019s Today show with a representative of the NAACP to debate the question, \u201cShould South Carolina fly the Confederate flag over the State House?\u201d\u2013 Columbia Mayor Bob Coble sues the state\u2019s General Services director to take the flag down. Several attempts at compromise fail, including a proposal by Coble and Sen. Darrell Jackson to fly the flag for one month out of the year, during a proposed Confederate History Month. Coble\u2019s suit is later dismissed.\u2013 At the height of the band\u2019s fame, Hootie & the Blowfish singer Darius Rucker tells Rolling Stone the band declined an offer by Gov. David Beasley to introduce them at a concert because of Beasley\u2019s support for the flag. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t love South Carolina so much, and if I didn\u2019t love my friends and my family, I\u2019d never live there \u2018cause the government is absolutely asinine,\u201d Rucker told the magazine. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the South Carolina government can all go to hell.\u201d\u2013 As pressure mounts inside and outside the state to take down the flag, Gov. David Beasley reverses course, calling for the flag to come down.- Beasley loses re-election bid.\u2013 The NAACP passes a resolution asking tourists to boycott South Carolina until the flag is removed.\u2014 A crowd of 46,000 people marches through the streets of Columbia to call for the flag to come down. [Note: Online copy updated.]\u2013 Charleston Mayor Joe Riley leads a five-day march from Charleston to Columbia to protest the flag.\u2013 Legislators pass a compromise to move the flag off the dome and onto the lawn of the State House, next to the Confederate Soldier Monument; the newly prominent location leads to the slogan, \u201cOff the dome and in your face!\u201d among some flag supporters. As part of the compromise, the General Assembly agrees to build a monument to African-American history, and passes the Heritage Act, which protects all existing monuments and flags in the state against change or removal. The act can\u2019t be changed without a two-thirds vote of both the House and Senate.\u2013 The flag is removed from the dome and placed on a pole on the lawn.- Steve Spurrier says flag should come down: \u201cI realize I\u2019m not supposed to get in the political arena as a football coach, but if anybody were ever to ask me about that damn Confederate flag, I would say we need to get rid of it,\u201d he said during an awards ceremony. \u201cI\u2019ve been told not to talk about that. But if anyone were ever to ask me about it, I certainly wish we could get rid of it.\u201d\u2013 Dylann Roof allegedly kills nine people at Bible study at a historic black church, including Democratic state Sen. Clementa Pinckney.- A rally held on the State House grounds draws 1,000 to 1,500 people to protest the flag. Though several other rallies followed \u2014 one on June 22, another on July 4 \u2014 the first one was the most immediate, with the emotions of the church shooting still raw and the flag\u2019s removal a distant hope.- Gov. Nikki Haley calls for the flag to come down. Just last fall, Haley was denying that the flag was a problem for South Carolina, telling a debate audience that, \u201cI can honestly say I have not had one conversation with a single CEO about the Confederate flag.\u201d But five days after the church shooting, Haley gathers together a bipartisan, multiracial group of key leaders on the second floor of the State House and says it\u2019s time for the flag to come down. The state\u2019s two U.S. senators are there, and U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, as are key Republican and Democratic leaders from the State House; also in the crowd behind Haley is Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee.\u201cWe respect freedom of expression, and that for those who wish to show respect for the flag on their private property, no one will stand in your way,\u201d Haley said. \u201cBut the State House is different. The events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way. Fifteen years ago, after much contentious debate, South Carolina came together in a bipartisan way to remove the flag from atop the Capitol dome. Today, we are here in a moment of unity in our state, without ill will, to say \u2018It\u2019s time to move the flag from the Capitol grounds.\u2019\u201d\u2013 Fifty-four percent of South Carolina voters want the flag to come down, while 35 percent want it to stay where it is, according to a survey of 517 voters conducted June 23 by Crantford Research exclusively for Free Times. That\u2019s a change from the Winthrop Poll conducted in September, which found that 61 percent of South Carolinians wanted the flag to stay up.- The Senate and House vote overwhelmingly to take up a flag bill.- North Carolina activist Bree Newsome dons climbing gear, scales the pole and carefully removes the flag, quoting Bible verses as she goes. She is arrested. Reactions range from celebration to anger, with some who wanted the flag down worrying her solo act would screw up the momentum.- A skirmish breaks out as several vehicles full of Confederate flag supporters cruise up Gervais Street and a fight ensues between opponents and proponents. A 25-year-old Irmo man is arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. After that, security on the grounds is tightened significantly.\u2013 As the flag debate begins, Sen. Lee Bright, a tea party Republican from Spartanburg, goes on a tirade in the Senate against same-sex marriage. \u201cThis nation was founded on Judeo-Christian values and they are under assault by men in black robes who are not elected by you,\u201d Bright said. \u201cWe can rally together and talk about a flag all we want, but the devil is taking control of this land and we\u2019re not stopping him.\u201d Bright calls the removal of the flag a \u201cStalinist purge.\u201d Nonetheless, all but three senators vote to remove the flag.\u2013 The House takes up the bill, and Rep. Mike Pitts, a Laurens Republican, introduces 26 amendments to bring the issue \u201cto a grinding halt,\u201d he says. Others, too, offer amendments; one that comes close to passing, failing 61-56, would have replaced the Confederate flag with the South Carolina 1st Volunteer Infantry Regiment flag.At one point, Republican Rep. Jenny Horne of Summerville lambastes the foot-dragging, \u201cThe people of Charleston deserve immediate and swift removal of that flag from this grounds,\u201d she says. \u201cI cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body to do something meaningful such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds on Friday.\u201dAfter midnight, the House votes 93-27 to remove the flag. Third reading follows soon after.- Haley signs the bill to remove the flag. The governor uses nine pens to sign the bill, each of which will go to the family of a victim of the Emanuel AME church shooting on June 17.\u2013 On a steamy, sunny morning, several thousand people gather to watch to flag\u2019s removal. Though there may have been a ceremony at the base of the pole, all most people in the crowd could see was the flag suddenly slide down the pole and out of view. Four hours later, a crane and a crew from the state\u2019s General Services division takes down the pole and the fence surrounding it.\u2013 NAACP ends its 15-year economic boycott of South Carolina.\n\nLet us know what you think: Email editor@free-times.com.\n\nMore cover Stories\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.free-times.com/cover/the-flag-comes-down-071515", "image": "http://www.free-times.com/images/site/facebook_icon.jpg", "site_name": "Free Times", "title": "The  Flag Comes Down"}, "msvalidate.01": "D447E8C6DE9AF19223287D4BB64EB7C5", "description": "For 15 long years, the Confederate battle flag flying on the State House grounds was the political elephant in the room.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Columbia City Council, Downtown Columbia SC, Gov.
