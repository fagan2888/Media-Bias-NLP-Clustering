At the subcommittee\u2019s second hearing overseeing the implementation of the law, officials form physicians groups said they were talking with colleagues and members about the best ways to implement the law.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started the rule making process regarding the law, which will further determine how doctors implement the reform.\n\nSubcommittee Chairman Rep. Joseph Pitts (R-Pa.) said that until then, physicians should be preparing for the process, as they know it is coming.\n\n\u201cRather than wait until CMS issues a proposed rule on how they plan to implement these incentives and program changes, there are steps every practitioner can be taking right now\n\nPhysicians should be thinking about ways they can modernize their practices and participate in current programs to act as a springboard for their preparation for MACRA.\n\nRep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas), a doctor, said Congress has a priority to ensure the law is implemented properly so that doctors aren\u2019t faced with another policy that is unliked and difficult to repeal.\n\n\u201cSocieties have some obligation to prepare doctors for implementation of this,\u201d Burgess said.\n\nBarbara McAneny, a board member of the American Medical Association, said the group had learned many physicians were unaware of the details of the law and how it would affect them, according to prepared remarks.\n\nThe group recommended that CMS consolidate performance reporting for providers, broaden APMs and improve its methods for measurement.\n\nRobert McLean, from the American College of Physicians, said in his prepared remarks that many of his colleagues are surprised to learn that the law will make it easier for them to practice.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that if MACRA can get rolled out with its best intentions implemented well, it is a remarkable \u2018shot in the arm\u2019 Congress can give to physicians and the rest of the clinician community to combat burnout, and thereby enable our system to realistically strive for the Quadruple Aim,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group recommended that CMS create a learning health system, ensure patient centeredness and make reporting less burdensome.\n\nRobert Wergin, the board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in his remarks that the group has launched a multi-year education and communication initiative for its members to inform the about MACRA.\n\nAdditionally, Jeffrey Bailet, president of the Aurora Health Care Medical Group and chairman-elect of the American Medical Group Association, a trade association group representing medical groups and health systems, testified on how the Wisconsin hospital he leads has shifted to a value-based payment system through some initiatives.\n\n\u201cMedicare largely has been based on fee-for service payments since its inception and many physicians are in various stages of readiness for a value-based payment system,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile systems such as Aurora and our physicians have early experience with value-based payment structures, there is and will continue to be a significant learning curve as providers begin to take on financial risk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Lawmakers questioned provider organizations on how they are preparing their members to implement the changes included in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which became law just over a year ago.
