The Wildcats were selected to host Colgate University next Saturday in the first round of the NCAA FCS playoffs at Cowell Stadium (3:30 p.m.)...UNH beat Colgate on the road, 26-8, when the teams met in Hamilton, N.Y. on Sept. 12. The Raiders (7-4, 6-0 Patriot League) went on to win seven of their next nine games after losing to the Wildcats.Head coach Sean McDonnell\u2019s team will appear in the postseason for the 12th straight year, the highest active streak of any program in the country. The Wildcats (7-4, 5-3 CAA) secured the postseason birth after finishing the regular season riding a four-game winning streak...\u201cIt\u2019s been a great run,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThese kids\u2019 work of the season and especially the last four or five weeks paid off,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThey all have a chance to play one more game. Now we have to go do something.\u201d..The Wildcats scuffled to a 3-4 start this year and dealt with their fair share of injuries to key players, including starting quarterback Sean Goldrich. However, UNH hit its stride in a comeback win over Rhode Island that jump-started the team to four straight wins...\u201cWe had people hurt all year and I purposely didn\u2019t mention it, didn\u2019t care about it because those, in my mind, are excuses,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cYou have to have enough people in your program to win football games. And the kids found a way and that\u2019s all that counts.\u201d..Goldrich missed four games this season with a high-ankle sprain he suffered Sept. 12 at Colgate. The senior quarterback laughed while mentioning when the injury took place, saying he will \u201ctry to get through the whole\u201d game this time around against the Raiders...The senior was at a loss for words when asked what it will mean to get the chance to play another game at Cowell Stadium.\u201cBeing a senior, you know that you want to get every opportunity you can to be out on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome that we have another home game, too, which is going to be outstanding for us, so we\u2019ll be ready for this. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d..The team locker room erupted when \u201cNew Hampshire\u201d popped on the TV screen as the Wildcats gathered to watch the NCAA selection show.Jullian Turner, a team captain and senior defensive tackle, was lost for words after he found out his team was heading to the playoffs...\u201cI\u2019m overjoyed for what just happened for us,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI felt my heart hitting my chest but even being that nervous, I had confidence in us and what we did in the past four weeks that they (NCAA) would show us some faith, and they did.\u201d..Goldrich shared Turner\u2019s joy following the highly anticipated decision.\u201cI\u2019m so excited I can\u2019t explain it,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought the way we played over the last four weeks showed the country that we belong in the playoffs. I think we have a lot of momentum going into this and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to put on a show in the playoffs.\u201d..McDonnell said he is proud of what the program has accomplished in past years in the playoffs, and he is confident his team can make noise again in these playoffs.\u201cYou look over the course of time what we\u2019ve done, not just for 11 games, but for 12 years here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every time we\u2019ve gotten into these tournaments, we\u2019ve represented very, very well.\u201d..An added plus for the Wildcats is that the game will be in the friendly confines of Cowell Stadium, where they are 5-0 this season and where they have historically been tough to beat. On Sept. 12, the teams met at Andy Kerr Stadium in Hamilton, N.Y...Turner said playing at home gives UNH an advantage.\u201cWe don\u2019t lose here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t lose here and it\u2019s the best place to be in the world. I don\u2019t want to play anywhere else, I don\u2019t want to be anywhere else. They have to come here this time, and we\u2019re a whole different type of animal.\u201d..Colgate is on a hot streak similar to UNH. The Raiders are winners of five straight games and are a different team than when the two teams last met, according to Turner.\u201cThey have gotten a lot better since we played them. They have been on a roll, too,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThere\u2019s more film we have to study and be ready to attack a different type of opponent.\u201d..Goldrich said his team is hitting the reset button as it approaches the postseason.\u201c0-0 is everyone\u2019s record,\u201d the quarterback said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter at this point. It\u2019s a new season, a new day. We\u2019re going to show up like this is our championship game because it\u2019s one and done at this point.\u201d..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of New Hampshire football team got a second life Sunday morning.
