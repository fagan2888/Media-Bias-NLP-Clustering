The U.S. Supreme Court says so, ruling this week that illegals and other noncitizens can be included in the population when states apportion their state legislative districts. This dilutes the electoral weight of legal residents and encourages partisans to bring in illegals to swell their ranks.\n\nThe unanimous ruling in Evenwel v. Abbott rejected a legal challenge by several Texas voters who had argued that the state\u2019s 2013 redistricting formula, which counted voters and nonvoters alike in reapportioning state Senate seats, violated the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d principle the court had earlier found in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. \u201cAs the Framers of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment comprehended, representatives serve all residents, not just those eligible or registered to vote,\u201d wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for a unanimous court. \u201cNonvoters have an important stake in many policy debates \u2014 children, their parents, even their grandparents, for example, have a stake in a strong public-education system \u2014 and in receiving constituent services, such as help navigating public-benefits bureaucracies.\u201d\n\nAll this is inarguably true. But when conservatives on the high court join with Justice Ginsburg and her liberal colleagues in a rare unanimous ruling, they lead the justices to thin ice. They have done it before. Just as the Supreme Court was pushed by liberal justices to uphold President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the justices have fallen in with the march toward the day when the distinction between legal and illegal resident becomes moot.\n\nLocal and state jurisdictions can be expected to boost representation in government by enabling illegals to settle within their borders. By arguing for inclusion of the undocumented among the calculations of redistricting, Texas chose the \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em\u201d approach to dealing with the Obama administration\u2019s failure to secure the southern border. The swelling illegal tide becomes opportunity.\n\nMore than 300 sanctuary jurisdictions have been established across the nation, including Dallas and Houston, with laws protecting illegal residents from the sanctions of law. Where does it end?\n\nIntended or not, the justices have bolstered the cause of immigration activists who seldom miss a chance to enhance political muscle. In sanctuary cities such as New York City, campaigns are moving to expand rights for illegals.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio has backed a plan to provide them with city identification cards, a small step forward to enabling them to vote, citizen or not. The goal may be distant, but as the Chinese proverb counsels, \u201ca journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d Voting is a right and a privilege, too, and voting in an American election is a right only of citizens of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Illegal immigrants can't vote, but they still count.
