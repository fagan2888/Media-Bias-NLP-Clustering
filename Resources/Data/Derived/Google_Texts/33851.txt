Joseph Katema, the health minister said Saturday that all Zambian citizens and residents intending to travel to the Ebola-hit countries would also be stopped until further notice.

Zambia, Africa’s top copper miner, becomes the second African nation after Ghana to impose a travel ban following the worst outbreak of Ebola in history, killing almost 1,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.
