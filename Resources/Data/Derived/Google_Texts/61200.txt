The federal official who oversees the nation's $600 billion Medicare program reversed moves by fraud investigators to block payments to health providers under investigation after she was pressured by politicians, according to a new report Friday.

In one 2012 case, two months after Medicare boss Marilyn Tavenner ordered the release of some payments billed by a Riverside General Hospital in Houston at the request of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, the hospital's CEO Earnest Gibson III was arrested on federal charges related an alleged $158 million Medicare fraud scheme, according the The Wall Street Journal.

The story said contract investigators for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had wanted to block all payments to Riverside General after determining that nearly 90 percent of a sampling of certain Medicare reimbursement claims by the hospital "were incorrect."
