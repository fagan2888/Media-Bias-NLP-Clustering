On Tuesday, during his 21-hour marathon "filibuster" against Obamacare, Senator Ted Cruz read aloud to his daughters back home the Dr. Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham. But he clearly missed its message. And he likely didn't realize that Dr. Seuss (real name: Theodor Geisel) was a fervent liberal. To commemorate the occasion, I wrote this poem:

Cruz does not like Obamacare



He doesn't like to care or share

He doesn't want to help the poor

He wants the rich to just have more

He likes to bully folks around

His own voice is his favorite sound

If Dr. Seuss had met Ted Cruz

He'd tell him, "Ted, I hope you lose."
