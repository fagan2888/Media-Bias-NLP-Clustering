Because it\u2019s certainly not the one that controls the White House and the U.S. Senate today. It\u2019s certainly not the Democratic Party she belongs too.\n\nIf that party is \u201ctrying to fix our nation\u2019s problems,\u201d they clearly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Consider their record.\n\nThey took a healthcare system in need of reform and made it worse with ObamaCare. Their \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d made healthcare more expensive. Premiums have been increasing since the law passed and are expected to spike\u2014in some cases by double-digit percentages\u2014in 2015, making life harder for families who already can\u2019t make ends meet. Instead of giving Americans more choices, ObamaCare resulted in millions of Americans receiving health care insurance cancellation notices; it also has restricted families\u2019 access to their preferred doctors.\n\nMoreover, poll after poll shows more Americans disapprove of ObamaCare than approve of it. If Wasserman Schultz wants to criticize Republicans for opposing ObamaCare, then she\u2019s criticizing us for standing with the American people. I\u2019ll choose that side any day.\n\nLet\u2019s also look at jobs and the economy. How exactly are Democrats trying to \u201cfix our nation\u2019s problems\u201d here? The Republican-led House of Representatives has passed over forty jobs bills. Forty. But the Democrat-controlled Senate won\u2019t touch them. Harry Reid won\u2019t even bring them up for a vote.\n\nJobs and the economy are Americans\u2019 number one priority. According to Gallup, a majority of Americans\u201457 percent\u2014say the economy is getting worse right now. Nineteen million of our fellow Americans are unemployed, are underemployed, or have given up looking for work. The percentage of Americans in the labor force is at a low not seen since the Carter presidency. It\u2019s unacceptable that Harry Reid is letting jobs bills\u2014including plans to build the Keystone Pipeline\u2014gather dust at a time when Americans desperately need jobs.\n\nLikewise, Harry Reid refuses to take up legislation that would expand education opportunities for disadvantaged kids. It looks like he has no intention of bringing up the House-passed Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act, which would help kids in failing schools get into better schools.\n\nThat\u2019s par for the course. More often than not, liberal Democrats stand in the way of expanding school choice. Nevertheless, Republicans continue to fight to give parents the chance to choose a good school for their kids.\n\nWhen it comes to education, Democrats haven\u2019t done anything to \u201cfix\u201d the problem; they\u2019ve spent more time locking arms with the special interests to keep our neediest kids out of better schools.\n\nFinally, the issue grabbing headlines lately is the humanitarian crisis at the border. Here again, President Obama and Democrats didn\u2019t just fail to solve the crisis when they had the chance; the president helped create the crisis in the first place.\n\nIn 2012, President Obama started unilaterally rewriting our immigration laws, deciding he would only enforce the ones he liked. As a result, residents of other countries believe they can come to the United States and stay here.\n\nThis was a foreseeable crisis; it was a preventable crisis. Governor Perry and other leaders in our border states have been alerting the president about the issue long before it reached crisis level. At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops warned that an estimated 60,000 children would arrive in the United States; still the White House didn\u2019t act.\n\nThe stories we hear and images we see from the border and holding facilities are heartbreaking, yet the president still refuses to visit the border. He was even in Texas last week. He couldn\u2019t find time to visit the border, but he could find time for fundraisers, including one for the Democratic National Committee. I\u2019m sure DNC Chair Wasserman Schultz is grateful for that, but I hope she realizes that the border, not the DNC\u2019s finances, is actually one of \u201cour nation\u2019s problems\u201d that we need \u201cto fix.\u201d\n\nJobs. ObamaCare. Education. Border security. These are just a few of the issues where Democrats are blocking real solutions and actual legislation\u2014and in fact have made the problems worse.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, have passed legislation out of the House, and have given voice to the concerns of working class Americans. Unfortunately, those concerns fall on deaf ears in Harry Reid\u2019s Senate and the Obama White House.\n\nIn other words, Republicans are standing with the American people, not \u201cstanding in our way.\u201d But if ObamaCare and killing jobs are examples of what Democrats think it means to \u201cfix our nation\u2019s problems,\u201d then, yes, we will keep fighting until we have a healthcare system and an economy that actually work for the American people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jobs.
