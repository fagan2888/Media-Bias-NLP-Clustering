Washington \u2014 the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 is the city of memorials, particularly to remember the sacrifices of war.\n\nThere was no place in America that was not deeply affected by World War II \u2014 big cities and small towns across the country. But Washington was the place where the decisions were made about the future of not just this country, but of the free world fighting the Axis threat to our way of life.\n\nIt was played out during a Redskins-Eagles football game at Griffith Stadium on Dec. 7, 1941, when about halfway through the first quarter, the public address announcer began paging military and government officials, one after the other, to report to their respective units and agencies.\n\nWashington Post columnist Shirley Povich documented the solemnity of the day, while a football game was taking place, recounting the public announcements that were, in their own ways, a declaration that America was at war: \u201cAdmiral W.H.P. Bland is asked to report to his office at once\u2026..Captain R.X. Fenn of the United States Army is asked to report to his office at once.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s notice of a world at war happened at a football game.\n\nA little more than a month later, Senators owner Clark Griffith, a close friend of President Franklyn D Roosevelt, is believed to have urged Roosevelt to write what has historically become known as the \u201cGreen Light Letter,\u201d in which the president urged baseball commissioner Judge Kenesaw M. Landis to keep baseball on the field during World War II:\n\n\u201cAs you will, of course, realize the final decision about the baseball season must rest with you and the Baseball club owners \u2014 so what I am going to say is solely a personal and not an official point of view,\u201d Roosevelt wrote.\n\n\u201cI honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before.\n\n\u201cAnd that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before.\n\n\u201cBaseball provides a recreation which does not last over two hours or two hours and a half, and which can be got for very little cost. And, incidentally, I hope that night games can be extended because it gives an opportunity to the day shift to see a game occasionally.\u201d\n\nBaseball did continue during the war, even with more than 500 major league baseball players \u2014 including Ted Williams and Stan Musial \u2014 serving in the military. But Gedeon and O\u2019Neill and many others, like the 137 minor leaguers who lost their lives, made the ultimate sacrifice to serve their country in battle. Baseball was part of the story of World War II.\n\nThe connection between baseball and those who are remembered on Memorial Day is one that should be memorialized permanently at Nationals Park.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 radio and espn980.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before Memorial Day became a celebration of barbecues, discount sales and ball games, it was a day when the men and women who died while serving in the United States armed forces would be remembered.
