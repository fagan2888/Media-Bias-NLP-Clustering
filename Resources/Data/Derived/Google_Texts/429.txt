MASON, Ohio — Serena Williams earned a 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over Caroline Wozniacki on Saturday to reach the final of the Western & Southern Open.

The top-seeded Williams bounced back from losing her first set of the tournament to beat the 12th-seeded Wozniacki for the eighth time in nine career matches.

Williams has never won the championship in five previous appearances. She lost a third-set tiebreaker to Victoria Azarenka last year.

Williams will play the winner of Saturday night’s match between fifth-seeded Maria Sharapova and ninth-seeded Ana Ivanovic for the championship.

Williams and Wozniacki both struggled with their serves, leading to a combined 15 service breaks, including the first five games of the third set.
