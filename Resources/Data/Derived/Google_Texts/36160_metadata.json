Gen Xers \u2014 who were born during the breakdown of the family, raised during crumbling faith in government, and saw many of their rites of passage marked by economic collapses \u2014 see the younger generation as entitled narcissists. (They are the offspring of the Boomers, after all.) And millennials, like everyone else, write off Xers as slackers, cynics, pessimists, and so on.\n\nBut it seems that on at least one major index, Xers (hatched in the mid-\u201860s to early \u201880s, by most counts) and millennials (mid-\u201880s to about 2004) are a lot alike: Both generations are losing their faith on life in the United States faster than older generations.\n\nThis news comes from a new Gallup poll. The fall off in American pride was gentle but widespread, according to the Washington Post: \u201cIt\u2019s a day on which Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d is probably second only to the National Anthem,\u201d Aaron Blake\u2019s post said, \u201cbut it seems Americans haven\u2019t been less \u2018proud to be an American\u2019 since before Sept. 11, 2001.\u201d And the number with moderate, a little, or no pride has hit a 21st century high.\n\nIn the years after the 9/11 attacks, about 70 percent of the nation as a whole described itself as \u201cextremely proud.\u201d Now that figure is at 54 percent. Gallup\u2019s own story puts it this way: \u201cThe reading of 54% in early June is about the same as the 55% recorded when Gallup first asked the question nearly 15 years ago, at the tail end of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. This indicates that patriotism is not necessarily a fixed characteristic, but can vary depending on circumstances \u2014 most notably when the U.S. is under duress, as was the case after the events of 9/11 and the build-up to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of reasons people would have mixed feelings with the course of the nation these days. The recession left a lot of Americans disoriented and despising the financial class, and a supposed recovery that has mostly benefited the one percent has not exactly generated patriotic feeling for the rest of us. The mishandled wars have made many Americans, across the generational divide, deeply queasy. And recent social progress has prompted serious backlash: A decent portion of the country simply can\u2019t believe a black man is president or that same-sex marriage is legal.
