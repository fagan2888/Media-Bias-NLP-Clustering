Now, there\u2019s a good chance your doctor will know and do something about it, thanks to a slew of new partnerships between CVS Health and various health systems.\n\nOne of the most recent, which is slated to begin by early next year, will integrate the electronic medical records from MedStar Health\u2019s 10 hospitals and 4,000 doctors \u2013 located in Washington, D.C. and Maryland \u2013 with CVS pharmacies as well as the chain\u2019s 900 MinuteClinics located across the country.\n\nIt makes coordination easier, said Bob Gilbert, MedStar\u2019s president of ambulatory services. When someone gets care at a pharmacy or retail clinic, it will be entered in the patient\u2019s MedStar records for the doctor to see. If a MedStar patient receives CVS service in another state, practitioners there will still be able to see the patient\u2019s records.\n\nCounting the MedStar partnership, CVS now has 41 such health system agreements in place, with the last nine encompassing the retailers\u2019 pharmacies. CVS hopes the other existing arrangements \u2013 which linked the systems with the MinuteClinics \u2013 will follow this course.\n\nThe move underscores a larger push by retail pharmacies to expand their role in the health care market. CVS has the most physician partnerships, but competitor Walgreens is also associated with 20 health systems and has joined accountable care organizations \u2013 the care-giving coalitions created by the health law to control costs. Even stores like Wal-Mart and grocery companies such as Safeway, which feature some in-store pharmacies, are looking to bolster ties with clinics and hospitals.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough primary care physicians to treat enough chronic and routine care that patients need. Ergo, the market is responding,\u201d said Christopher Kerns, managing director for research and insights at the Advisory Board Company, a health care consulting firm.\n\nCVS \u2013 which itself operates more than 7,600 pharmacies with more than 800 clinics \u2013 now has relationships with between 300 and 350 hospitals in addition to clinics and physician groups, according to spokeswoman Christine Cramer, adding that the exact number is hard to quantify. These collaborations extend over 24 states plus the District of Columbia.\n\nThe agreements do not have any explicit financial element. \u201cIt\u2019s purely a clinical collaboration,\u201d said MedStar spokeswoman Ann Nichols.\n\nBut health system partnerships can still benefit a pharmacy company like CVS.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to chronically ill patients, there\u2019s now incentive [for physicians] to refer them to CVS\u201d for day-to-day disease management, Kerns said. That can give a company a new stream of customers and drive up pharmacy sales and in-store foot traffic.\n\nHow hospitals win\n\nEntering such partnerships can make sense for a hospital system, too. For instance, if different providers communicate well, they help reduce how often the chronically ill need to go to the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way of being able to provide more care to more people, more conveniently and ideally at a lower cost,\u201d Kerns added.\n\nBy reducing admissions and readmissions, for instance, hospitals can address one of their major budget challenges. In addition to paying for patient care itself \u2013 which can be costly if those patients have lower incomes and are uninsured \u2013 hospitals with high readmission rates can face financial penalties from the government through reductions in Medicare payments \u2013 as much as 3 percent of each Medicare payment per patient for an entire year starting in October. Across all penalized hospitals in the country, those reductions are expected to total around $330 million annually.\n\nRetail clinics say they offer routine health services in a cheaper and more convenient setting than doctors\u2019 offices, urgent care or emergency facilities. In ads, CVS boasts that the clinics are open seven days a week, with nurse practitioners giving physicals, vaccines, strep tests and other basic services. Most services cost less than $100. Clinics are often separated from pharmacies by a privacy screen.\n\n\u201cIt really goes back to today\u2019s health care consumers looking for care when they want it,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nMuch of the arrangement might remain invisible for a MedStar patient, said Patrick Gilligan, CVS\u2019 senior vice president for system alliances.\n\nBut even if patients don\u2019t see it directly, a stronger network between physicians, pharmacists and retail clinics is valuable, said Christine Alexander, 66, a MedStar patient who frequently gets basic health services and medication from her local MinuteClinic and CVS in Washington, D.C.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, she said, health problems meant she had to take multiple kinds of medication, but \u201cthere wasn\u2019t good communication, and I ended up taking way too many drugs that were interacting with each other.\u201d\n\nFor patients with chronic conditions, \u201clong term adherence is a big issue,\u201d Gilligan.\n\nBut with this type of arrangement, pharmacists and nurse practitioners can more easily share information with doctors, providers can work in concert to encourage patients to stay on medications, Gilligan added. \u201cYou tend to have a lot higher compliance rate,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nIn addition, because pharmacists see a patient\u2019s entire drug regimen, they often notice the potential for drug interactions and other risks. When records are integrated, that information can more easily be transmitted to doctors, too.\n\n\u201cA lack of adherence and a problem of mixing the wrong medications is one of the leading causes of adverse events \u2013 it\u2019s one of the leading causes of readmissions,\u201d Kerns said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
