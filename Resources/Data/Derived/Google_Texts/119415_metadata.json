Moving forward, the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation must work together to make sure there is a permanent solution, codified in law, so children will be able to retain access to their health care and get out from under the ill-advised mandates created by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBefore the health care law, states had to cover children under the age of six in families who received income below 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Older children and teens in families with incomes above 100 percent of the FPL were permitted to be covered in separate state CHIP or Medicaid programs at state option. Obamacare will cause 21 states to move children off of popular and well-run CHIP plans and into Medicaid.\n\nThis legislation, originally introduced by Dent, would simply scratch the changes from the healthcare law that would require all children below 133 percent of the FPL to be forced into Medicaid.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, this requirement would affect approximately 30,000 families.\n\nIf the CHIP Act were to be voted into law, states would then have the option of covering children between 100 percent and 133 percent FPL either in Medicaid as \u201cMedicaid child funded with CHIP dollars\u201d or in a different CHIP program.\n\nGovernor Corbett took up CHIP\u2019s standard earlier this year and secured a one-year waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIncluding Thompson and Dent, the CHIP Act also has seven other original co-sponsers in PA: Congressman Jim Gerlach (R-Chester), Congressman Pat Meehan (R-Delaware), Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks), Congressman Mike Kelly (R-Butler), Congressman Scott Perry (R-York), Congressman Lou Barletta (R-Luzerne) and Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz (D-Montgomery).\n\nPA CHIP is a nationally recognized program, originally established in 1992, reauthorized in 1998 and expanded in 2006. In the fiscal year 2012-2013 almost 190,000 children were enrolled in PA CHIP.\n\nJanuary 28th, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 3 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill would also protect similar programs in other states.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/thompson-dent-introduce-bipartisan-chip-protection-bill/54571/", "description": "Bill would also protect similar programs in other states.", "title": "Thompson, Dent Introduce Bipartisan CHIP Protection Bill"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "thompson,dent,aca,chip", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Thompson, Dent Introduce Bipartisan CHIP Protection BillWritten by Jordan Krom, Contributing WriterCongressman Charles Dent (R-Lehigh) and Congressman Glenn \u2018GT\u2019 Thompson (R-Centre) today announced the introduction of legislation that would preserve the Pennsylvania Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), as well as programs similar to CHIP in other states.\n\u201cCHIP was a bipartisan creation here in Pennsylvania that served for the basis of the federal model of market-based insurance for our children,\u201d said Thompson.\nObamacare will cause 21 states to move children off of popular and well-run CHIP plans and into Medicaid.\nPA CHIP is a nationally recognized program, originally established in 1992, reauthorized in 1998 and expanded in 2006.\nIn the fiscal year 2012-2013 almost 190,000 children were enrolled in PA CHIP."}
