Other barriers include objections to contraception as an issue of conscience or religion, unnecessary medical practices that prevent easy initiation of contraception, institutional and payment barriers, and health-care inequalities.\n\n\"ACOG supports access to comprehensive contraceptive care and contraceptive methods as an integral component of women's health care and is committed to encouraging and upholding policies and actions that ensure the availability of affordable and accessible contraceptive care and contraceptive methods,\" wrote the researchers.\n\nReferences", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,cancertherapyadvisor.com,chemotherapyadvisor.com,clinicaladvisor.com,clinicalpainadvisor.com,empr.com,endocrinologyadvisor.com,infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com,mycme.com,neurologyadvisor.com,oncologynurseadvisor.com,psychiatryadvisor.com,renalandurologynews.com", "news_keywords": "Contraception, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Women's Health", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "Clinical Advisor", "description": "Barriers include knowledge deficits, cost and insurance coverage, unnecessary medical testing.", "title": "Recommendations for improving access to contraception issued", "url": "http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/web-exclusives/improving-access-to-contraception-recommendations-issued-by-american-college-of-obstetricians-and-gynecologists/article/389904/", "image": "http://media.clinicaladvisor.com/images/2014/12/12/longactingbirthcontrolgain_698887_698888.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media.clinicaladvisor.com/images/2014/12/12/longactingbirthcontrolgain_698887_698888.png"}, "title": "Recommendations for improving access to contraception issued", "description": "Barriers include knowledge deficits, cost and insurance coverage, unnecessary medical testing.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ClinicalAdvisor"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=560576498", "fb": {"app_id": 192680054084788}, "article": {"section": "Web Exclusives", "tag": "Women's Health", "published_time": "2014-12-28T04:00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-27T18:43:43"}, "google-site-verification": "XulxkiFWEPyxheHjOZuqhAMgO-BVDn-SoydyqDALxeI", "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Barriers include knowledge deficits, cost and insurance coverage, unnecessary medical testing."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe56a0\"", "article_summary": "Recommendations for improving access to contraception issuedShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintRecommendations for improving access to contraception issuedHealthDay News -- All women should have unhindered and affordable access to contraception, but many barriers to care exist, Committee Opinion published in Obstetrics & Gynecology reported.\nCost and insurance coverage are also barriers to contraceptive use, but as the Affordable Care Act goes into effect, obstetrician-gynecologists should advocate for continued expansion of affordable contraceptive access.\nAccess could also be improved by allowing over-the-counter access to oral contraceptive pills.\n\"ACOG supports access to comprehensive contraceptive care and contraceptive methods as an integral component of women's health care and is committed to encouraging and upholding policies and actions that ensure the availability of affordable and accessible contraceptive care and contraceptive methods,\" wrote the researchers.\nOther barriers include objections to contraception as an issue of conscience or religion, unnecessary medical practices that prevent easy initiation of contraception, institutional and payment barriers, and health-care inequalities."}
