The driver of the Accord, a 22-year-old Bremerton man, died at the scene, said Washington State Patrol spokesman Sgt. Mark Francis. His identity has not yet been released pending notification of next of kin.\n\nThe Washington State Patrol closed Northbound I-5 through Mountlake Terrace, forcing all northbound I-5 traffic off the freeway at 244th Street Southwest shortly after emergency personnel responded to the two-alarm incident around 11:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\nA separate tanker truck had to be brought to the scene so the liquid nitrogen could be transferred into it, Francis said, and the freeway was shut down northbound overnight to protect motorists\u2019 safety while that process occurred. About 40 percent of the load was transferred, while the rest of the liquid nitrogen evaporated, he said.\n\nThe tanker truck driver, Phuong N Truong, 50, of Puyallup, was not injured. He told investigators that the driver of the Accord passed him in the HOV lane, hit I-5\u2032s center jersey barrier, then crossed all lanes of traffic and hit the truck trailer, causing it to flip over onto the car.\n\nIn addition to the Washington State Patrol, other emergency responders to the incident included Fire District 1, the Shoreline Fire Department, the Lynnwood Fire Department, the Everett Fire Department, and police officers from Mountlake Terrace, Brier, Lynnwood, Edmonds and Shoreline.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.5 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "author": "MyEdmondsNews", "og": {"site_name": "My Edmonds News", "description": "An accident near the Mountlake Terrace Transit Center involving a tanker truck closed northbound I-5 Sunday night after 11:30 p.m. The freeway reopened at 7:45 a.m. All northbound lanes of Intersta\u2026", "title": "Tanker rollover closes I-5 through MLT overnight; Bremerton man killed", "url": "http://myedmondsnews.com/2014/02/tanker-rollover-closes-5-mlt-overnight-bremerton-man-killed/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/myedmondsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/I-5-tanker-possible-fatality-accident-Feb.-16-002-650x487.jpg?fit=650%2C487", "height": 487}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/myedmondsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/I-5-tanker-possible-fatality-accident-Feb.-16-002-650x487.jpg?fit=650%2C487&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-17T16:27:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-17T16:27:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05e0\"", "article_summary": "The driver of the Accord, a 22-year-old Bremerton man, died at the scene, said Washington State Patrol spokesman Sgt.\nAbout 40 percent of the load was transferred, while the rest of the liquid nitrogen evaporated, he said.\nThe tanker truck driver, Phuong N Truong, 50, of Puyallup, was not injured.\nThe Washington State Patrol closed Northbound I-5 through Mountlake Terrace, forcing all northbound I-5 traffic off the freeway at 244th Street Southwest shortly after emergency personnel responded to the two-alarm incident around 11:30 p.m. Sunday.\nA separate tanker truck had to be brought to the scene so the liquid nitrogen could be transferred into it, Francis said, and the freeway was shut down northbound overnight to protect motorists\u2019 safety while that process occurred."}
