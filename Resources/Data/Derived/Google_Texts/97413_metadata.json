Dallas wants \u201cprice concessions as well as some stability,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t their business model,\u201d Carroll said of the area\u2019s hospitals. \u201cTheir model is, \u2018Just give us your money and don\u2019t worry about what it costs.\u2019 We\u2019re hoping they are interested in at least having a conversation with us about options.\u201d\n\nGary Brock, president of the North Texas operations of Baylor Scott & White, said Baylor welcomed dialog but would not accept the municipalities\u2019 request for bids.\n\nHe characterized Medicare-linked prices as one among several \u201cshort-term proposals that do not support the goals of population health initiatives proven to lower an employer\u2019s cost for care while improving the quality of care for its employees and dependents.\u201d\n\nOther hospitals in the area have not yet responded to the coalition\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe 31 municipal governments joined in the North Texas Coalition represent roughly 40,000 employees. The number doubles to about 80,000 when insured family members are included.\n\nTogether, they\u2019re hoping that gives them enough clout to negotiate a better deal, beginning in 2017, than the insurance companies have been able to achieve on care delivered by the hospitals. Nationally, health care costs have risen between 3.4 and 5 percent a year since 2010. Medicare prices have actually fallen slightly during that time period.\n\nDallas-based Holmes Murphy, an insurance broker and consulting firm, has worked on the initiative for more than a year as part of a consulting contract with the city of Dallas. The city\u2019s major employers were urged to demand Medicare-plus pricing from hospitals five years ago, but shied away from the idea.\n\nDen Bishop, president of Holmes Murphy, said the approach aimed to give cities better transparency and lower inflation in their medical bills.\n\n\u201cWe are not telling any hospital system that this is the most they can charge. It\u2019s not Medicare plus x-percent, take it or leave it,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cWe are just asking, at what percent of Medicare are you willing to sell your services? It gives the purchaser, the city, full indexed transparency on what the cost difference is between the hospitals, the same as they would get when buying police vehicles, telephone poles or asphalt.\u201d\n\nSince the Reagan administration, the federal government has used price controls to set hospital Medicare payments. Any provider willing to accept Medicare has to live with those reimbursements, even though hospitals have long complained that the payments don\u2019t even cover their costs.\n\nIndexing payments to a Medicare rate \u2013 Medicare plus 10 percent, 35 percent or whatever -- would allow cities to compare prices among area hospitals. That\u2019s something they haven\u2019t been able to do.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing we purchase where we don\u2019t know how much it costs,\u201d said Brian Dickerson, Fort Worth\u2019s human resources director. \u201cBetween 2008 and 2013, our medical spending went from $67 million to $100 million. If that happens again, we have to rethink how we do health care for our employees. Can we go out and spend the next $1 in taxpayer funds for health care or $1 for filling pot holes?\u201d\n\nMedicare is a federal insurance program for seniors and the disabled, and does not have a price for some medical care, such as childbirth. The North Texas Coalition is working with Milliman, another health consulting firm, to come up with prices for those procedures.\n\nHospitals have price lists, called \u201cchargemasters,\u201d but they bear little relationship to the deep discounts hospitals actually accept as payment for insured patients. Hospitals and insurers negotiate those discounts annually, but don\u2019t disclose them to try to keep competitors in the dark.\n\nAs a result, patients and their employers typically don\u2019t know the difference between the cost of care among area hospitals.\n\nHolmes Murphy\u2019s analysis of Medicare and other insurance claims shows hospital charges for a knee replacement, for example, range from $37,947 at Methodist Dallas Medical Center to $142,851 at Plaza Medical Center of Fort Worth.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is better care, better benefits and lower costs,\u201d Dickerson said. With prices, he said, \u201cwe need predictability and sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe governments of Dallas, Fort Worth, Plano and Grand Prairie comprise the executive board of the North Texas Coalition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to save taxpayer dollars, and one of the ways we can do that in benefits is to be sure we are paying fair rates for health care services,\u201d said Jim Parrish, deputy city manager of Plano. \u201cWe believe getting a good, solid basis to compare our health care providers\u2019 costs is a first step in looking to do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fed up with soaring costs, Dallas and 30 other North Texas municipalities are asking hospitals to submit bids indexed to federally controlled Medicare prices to cover the cost of care for city employees.", "og": {"description": "Fed up with soaring costs, Dallas and 30 other North Texas municipalities are asking hospitals to submit bids indexed to federally controlled Medicare prices to cover the cost of care for city employees.", "title": "Cities see strength in numbers in negotiating for better health care costs", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151204-cities-see-strength-in-numbers-in-negotiating-for-better-health-care-costs.ece", "image": {"width": 977, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151204-1202bus_medicalcosts.ece/BINARY/original/1202bus_medicalcosts", "height": 837}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-12-07T05:25:31Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-12-04T15:08:48Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cities see strength in numbers in negotiating for better health care costs\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151204-cities-see-strength-in-numbers-in-negotiating-for-better-health-care-costs.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151204-1202bus_medicalcosts.ece/BINARY/original/1202bus_medicalcosts\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2563853\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-04T15:08:48Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"JIM LANDERS\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151204-1202bus_medicalcosts.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/1202bus_medicalcosts", "publishtime": "2015-12-04T15:08:48Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Nationally, health care costs have risen between 3.4 and 5 percent a year since 2010.\n\u201cWe believe getting a good, solid basis to compare our health care providers\u2019 costs is a first step in looking to do that.\u201d\nIf that happens again, we have to rethink how we do health care for our employees.\nMolly Carroll, Dallas\u2019 human resources director, said the city and its employees are spending $129 million on health care costs that are inflating at roughly 10 percent a year.\nThe 31 municipal governments joined in the North Texas Coalition represent roughly 40,000 employees."}
