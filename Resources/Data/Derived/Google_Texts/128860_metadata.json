Nevada issued such guidance in June, and Rhode Island followed suit last week.\n\nThe Minnesota commissioners noted that their departments \u201care committed to ensuring that Minnesotans do not face discrimination in accessing medically necessary health care benefits, including those based on transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and gender dysphoria.\u201d\n\nThe commissioners continued, \u201cCommerce and Health currently disapprove policy forms filed by insurers if there are exclusions on coverage for medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria and related health conditions, including gender confirmation surgery (previously known as sex reassignment surgery). Commerce and Health will also continue to conduct independent 2 reviews for denials of coverage on the basis that services are not medically necessary via the Departments\u2019 external review programs. Determination of medical necessity and prior authorization protocols for gender dysphoria-related treatment must be based on the most recent, published medical standards set forth by nationally recognized medical experts in the transgender health field.\u201d\n\nThough the commissioners note that private health insurers cannot discriminate under Minnesota law, public health programs in the state do discriminate.\n\nMinnesota law specifically forbids the state\u2019s Medicaid program from covering gender confirmation health care for transgender people. The state covered such procedures until 2005 when legislators passed, and Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty signed, a health and human services omnibus bill that blocked the coverage. Currently, Medical Assistance, General Assistance Medical Care, and MinnesotaCare do not provide equitable health care for transgender Minnesotans.\n\nA bill introduced in 2015 and up for consideration in 2016 would change that.\n\nThe Column is a community-supported non-profit news, arts, and media organization.
