After the election, they may be about to lose it.\n\nMike Huckabee, the Fox News host and wannabe presidential contender, was governor of my home state, Arkansas, until 2007. While he was certainly conservative in that post, he also believed that the government could actually use its tools to care for people. In the 2008 presidential campaign, he broke party rank and said he supported programs that would allow children of undocumented immigrants to receive college scholarships.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect,\u201d he said during a debate to his colleagues who opposed the idea, \u201cWe\u2019re a better country than that.\u201d This ever-so-slight heart-bleed for immigrant children branded him a party apostate, and he began to change course. Now he earns millions spouting venom on Fox News about immigrants, women, gays and lesbians, and anyone else. The governor with at least a tiny sliver of a heart is gone.\n\nThe same is true of the state from which we both came. This week, Arkansas went fully red like the rest of the South. It had been a last holdout state in old Dixie that still elected some Democrats to its top offices. After Obama\u2019s election, though, those Democrats started falling. The cascade peaked this midterm election with the loss of the governor\u2019s seat to Republican Asa Hutchinson and the loss of a favorite son\u2019s Senate seat. Now-lame-duck Senator Mark Pryor\u2019s dad was a beloved governor and senator, and a few years ago the son would have been considered a lock for whatever political office he wanted in the state. The GOP also enhanced its hold on the statehouse, which the party took over two years ago.\n\nThe issue, or one of the big ones, was Obamacare. Outgoing Democratic Governor Mike Beebe compromised with the state\u2019s Republicans on the controversial health care law when it passed and devised a unique plan, called the \u201cprivate option,\u201d one that many had hoped to replicate in other reluctant red states. Instead of expanding Medicaid, the federal program that insures the poor, the state would foot the bill for its low-income residents to enter the private insurance market.\n\nIt has so far insured more than 200,000 people who had never been insured before, but it has to be renewed next year. Hutchinson, the incoming governor, has said he needs time to decide what his position is on the plan. Perhaps more significant is that Republicans won all four races for the state senate, increasing their lead in that chamber by two, and they\u2019ve all come out against renewal. And unlike the rest of the country, turnout there was actually up this midterm election, to 47.6 percent, which means the newly elected officials can more safely claim a mandate than states where the turnout was much lower. A nay vote on the private option in the state legislature could force the new governor\u2019s hand even if he does decide he backs the existing program.\n\nSo government giveth, and government taketh away. Republicans who campaigned against the state\u2019s health plan said the state couldn\u2019t afford it, but the federal government is fully funding it until 2017. In the near term, the state will only be on the hook for 10 percent of its costs by 2020. In general, like most states with low median incomes, Arkansas gets more money in federal spending than it gives away in federal tax dollars.\n\nDon\u2019t try to tell that to my fellow Arkansans, though. I\u2019ve never been able to convince them that there aren\u2019t freeloaders in faraway cities they\u2019ve never visited taking their money. Yet if they really cared about nefarious outside forces meddling with the wellbeing of their state, they would have been more suspicious of the campaigns run on behalf of Republicans this year, which were funded by $39.9 million in outside money. This outside, dark money was used to convince the state\u2019s residents that the plans their own elected officials had devised to solve their problems, plans that were working well, were actually bad.\n\nWhat does it mean for the people of the state? Arkansas has continually ranked as one of the least healthy states in the country, and has had one of the worst health care systems. Arkansans can expect to die at a younger age than their counterparts in wealthy, healthy states like Connecticut and Massachusetts.\n\nYet, Arkansas had been marginally healthier than the states surrounding it. All of the poor states in the mid-South show up at the bottom of all the good lists and the top of all the bad ones, but my little state had always done at least a little bit better than Mississippi, Alabama, and sometimes Louisiana.", "article_metadata": {"content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "pageNum": 1, "description": "Around 200,000 people have gained coverage under Arkansas\u2019s hybrid Obamacare program.
