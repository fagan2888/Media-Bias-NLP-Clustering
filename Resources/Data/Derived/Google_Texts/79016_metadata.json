Still, it was hard not to notice this morning that Drudge, in the prime upper-left real estate of his site, had listed a full 14 links regarding immigration and a supposed impending push for \u201camnesty\u201d among the House Republican leadership. (Personal favorite: \u201cKids Complaining Burritos They\u2019re Being Fed Making Them Sick\u2026\u201d)\n\nWhat gives on this sleepy Tuesday? We learned last week, after all, that the House won\u2019t hold any immigration-related votes in June. That leaves the leadership a few weeks in July to pass the unicorn-like Secret Amnesty that\u2019s not in its interest to pass. Why is it so vital to whip up the conservative base about immigration reform on today of all days?\n\nHmmm \u2026 maybe something about Tuesday \u2026 primary season \u2026 it\u2019s a Tuesday during primary season \u2026 Ohhhhhhhh, we get it: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s primary is today!\n\nCantor is facing a challenge from the right in the form of a little-known college economics professor named David Brat. Brat has taken all the easy leadership-sellout hits on Cantor, such as his support for raising the debt ceiling. (If you\u2019re wondering why a college economics professor would criticize someone for raising the debt ceiling, it\u2019s because Brat is what we\u2019d call a \u201cspecial\u201d economics professor. He\u2019s the director of something called the \u201cBB&T Moral Foundations of Capitalism\u201d at Randolph-Macon College, funded by a rich nutter who doesn\u2019t think the kids are reading enough Ayn Rand these days.)\n\nThe main flashpoint in the race, though, is immigration reform. Brat, like many in the conservative movement, sees Cantor and the House leadership as always one breath away from jamming amnesty and cheap Mexican labor down the throats of God-fearing White American people. Cantor, especially, since he\u2019s a major fundraising conduit for the Republican business community, which wants to see immigration reform get done. Brat is playing off of these fears of What Cantor Might Do. \u201cEric Cantor doesn\u2019t represent you and he doesn\u2019t represent \u2026 the 7th District of Virginia,\u201d Brat has been saying on the trail. \u201cEric Cantor represents large corporations who want a never-ending supply of cheap, low-wage foreign labor \u2026 Eric Cantor saying he opposes amnesty is like Barack Obama saying he opposes Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe race hasn\u2019t gotten that much national media coverage, but it\u2019s sure grabbed the attention of the prominent right-wingers who devote their entire lives to stopping comprehensive immigration reform. There\u2019s Drudge, of course. And Ann Coulter. And radio/TV personality Laura Ingraham, who recently suggested that the United States should have traded Eric Cantor to the Taliban for Bowe Bergdahl. And the writings and tweets of Mickey Kaus, now of the Daily Caller, have been indistinguishable from those of a Brat staffer in recent months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eric Cantor should beat his primary challenger tonight, but the anti-immigration crowd has already made its point", "author": "Jim Newell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Eric Cantor should beat his primary challenger tonight, but the anti-immigration crowd has already made its point", "title": "Drudge\u2019s new fixation: Eric Cantor and the right\u2019s frenzied paranoia", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/10/drudges_new_fixation_eric_cantor_and_the_rights_frenzied_paranoia/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/eric_cantor2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eric Cantor should beat his primary challenger tonight, but the anti-immigration crowd has already made its point", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/eric_cantor2.jpg", "title": "Drudge\u2019s new fixation: Eric Cantor and the right\u2019s frenzied paranoia", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Drudge\u2019s new fixation: Eric Cantor and the right\u2019s frenzied paranoia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, amnesty, Ann Coulter, David Brat, Editor's Picks, Eric Cantor, House, Immigration, Immigration Reform, Laura Ingraham, Matt Drudge, Media Criticism, Mickey Kaus, primaries, Virginia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfad6\"", "article_summary": "And radio/TV personality Laura Ingraham, who recently suggested that the United States should have traded Eric Cantor to the Taliban for Bowe Bergdahl.\nWhy is it so vital to whip up the conservative base about immigration reform on today of all days?\n\u201cEric Cantor doesn\u2019t represent you and he doesn\u2019t represent \u2026 the 7th District of Virginia,\u201d Brat has been saying on the trail.\nCantor, especially, since he\u2019s a major fundraising conduit for the Republican business community, which wants to see immigration reform get done.\nThe main flashpoint in the race, though, is immigration reform."}
