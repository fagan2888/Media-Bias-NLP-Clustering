However, especially over the past 7 years, policymakers in Washington have moved beyond divided, becoming consistently divisive. Polarization on both sides of the aisle has forced personal ambitions and identity politics to the forefront, at the expense of our country and wellbeing.\n\nJust last week, with little fanfare, Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement to fund the government through September 2016. Funding the government is one of the most basic tasks allocated to congress, yet contrasted against the dysfunction of recent years, it\u2019s a positive step in the right direction.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans didn\u2019t get everything they wanted, and neither did Democrats, but the bill was a good compromise at a moment when it was sorely needed.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanPuerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate Overnight Finance: GOP faces dilemma on spending bills | CEOs push Congress on tax rules | Trump talks energy Overnight Energy: Trump outlines 'America First' energy plan in North Dakota MORE\u2019s (R-Wis.) new position may place him in the GOP establishment by default; in reality, he\u2019s an independent thinker who\u2019s bridging the gap within the Republican Party and putting the party back on offense. Ryan\u2019s vision for smaller government and decentralized power doesn\u2019t merely focus on our oversized federal bureaucracy \u2013 it\u2019s an approach he\u2019s implementing to govern in the House.\n\nRyan is a different type of speaker than we\u2019ve had in the past, and his rise signals the hunger for a new era in the GOP. Yes, he brings a generational change \u2013 he famously listens to music through earbuds as he walks through the Capitol, sends text messages, and takes his own #speakerselfies. But more importantly, what really makes him different is his style of leadership.\n\nIn a very traditional sense, Ryan will return the House to the \u201cPeople\u2019s House.\u201d Regular order will be the rule and not the exception. Committee chairmen, subcommittee chairmen, and rank-and-file members will contribute substantively. Bills will be envisioned and drafted by those who study and know the issues best: the committees.\n\nEven Ryan will have to step out of his own comfort zone to make this work. Instead of burying himself in arcane tax and economic policy, he will focus on crafting big ideas and working with members to translate them into effective policy solutions.\n\nRyan is a different type of Speaker because his priorities are different. His insistence on family time wasn\u2019t simply a condition for taking the job; it\u2019s a core part of who he is. When the Speaker not only shares, but practices, the same core values and priorities as everyday Americans, that\u2019s truly special.\n\nFixing our broken Congress is akin to turning around a battleship, and fixing our broken government is akin to turning around a whole fleet. In charting a new course for Republicans in the House, there may be some choppy waters. Ryan at the helm represents our best chance at making it through the storm \u2013 and based on the groundwork he\u2019s laying, the best chance for change in 2016.\n\nBelcher is a managing director at Steptoe & Johnson LLP", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s rise brings new hope for Congress", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s rise brings new hope for Congress", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/lawmaker-news/263753-paul-ryans-rise-brings-new-hope-for-congress", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/ryanpaul11302015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/lawmaker-news/263753-paul-ryans-rise-brings-new-hope-for-congress", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-21T06:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Leslie A.
