But he said he was not prepared for Ebola.\n\nTo learn about Ebola, a virus he knew little about and had never treated, Mosher had to read a 100-page information packet on the flight to Africa.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak, which began close to the borders of three neighboring countries\u2014Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia\u2014and spread quickly from villages to cities, has killed 1,900 people.\n\nEbola has killed 1,900 people.\n\nThe World Health Organization warns that more than 20,000 people could become infected.\n\n>>>Q&A: Ebola in Africa Not Yet a National Security Issue\n\n\u201cEbola is much more sobering because of the nature of the illness,\u201d said Mosher, noting that people tend to bleed before they die. \u201cIt\u2019s unlike anything else. It\u2019s horrific. It\u2019s hellish, it\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nWorking among 20 American team members, and also, Liberian locals with four-year medical degrees who Samaritan\u2019s Purse hires, Mosher began his mission in Foya, inside a clinic with concrete floors, a tin roof, tarp barriers between rooms and no windows.\n\nHis mission was to provide support to the local health-care workers, so they could learn to give aid on their own.\n\nBut most of all, the Samaritan\u2019s Purse team, which partners with Doctors Without Borders, documents everything in sight.\n\nMosher said his team confirmed dozens of cases per day, determined through a blood test.\n\n\u201cBut the numbers are always shaky,\u201d Mosher said. \u201cYou have to assume they are underreported.\u201d\n\nEbola is especially tricky, Mosher says, because, unlike a cold, the virus does not start off being especially contagious.\n\n>>>CDC Chief: Ebola a \u2018Scary\u2019 Disease, but \u2018We Can Stop It\u2019\n\nAs the virus develops, with symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and severe tiredness, it becomes progressively contagious.\n\nA dead body is \u201cradioactive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBodies don\u2019t bother me,\u201d Mosher said. \u201cSuffering people bother me. Since I\u2019m older, I understand what that means for a family.\u201d\n\nTim Mosher: \u201cBodies don\u2019t bother me. Suffering people bother me.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritan\u2019s Purse outreach team, of which Mosher was not a part, went into nearby villages to educate the people still there\u2014and to pick up bodies.\n\nOne day, the outreach team traveled to a village one-and-a-half hours from Foya.\n\nSkeptical locals fearful that the aid workers were carrying the virus attacked the outreach team with rocks, destroying their vehicle.\n\nDespite the hostility, Mosher said he felt no animosity toward the locals.\n\nHe was just there to do a job\u2014to save them.\n\n\u201cI had two fears,\u201d Mosher said. \u201cThe fear of getting Ebola. And the fear of failing at my duties. You worry you might have to abandon the patients because you\u2019re not up to the task. The patients were my concern.\u201d\n\nAfter spending four days in Foya, Mosher\u2019s Samaritan Purse team pulled out\u2014overwhelmed \u2014well short of the three weeks they were supposed to stay there.\n\nAs part of his job there, Mosher interviewed patients to determine how they contracted the virus.\n\nOne patient, a 7-year-old girl, lost all six family members to Ebola.\n\nShe didn\u2019t really talk to the aid workers, but rather stared blankly into the masked interviewers\u2019 eyes.\n\nMosher says 75 percent of the patients were female.\n\nThe most common story was that the mothers cared for ill family members\u2014feeding and bathing them\u2014before contracting the virus themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a true humanitarian disaster,\u201d Mosher said of Ebola. \u201cIt\u2019s not just people. The economy slows down. Every single person is touched by Ebola in someway. That\u2019s something we haven\u2019t experienced in America. Where you wake up and that\u2019s all you think about. The amount of human suffering is mind boggling.\u201d\n\nEbola is a \u201ctrue humanitarian disaster,\u201d Mosher says.\n\nMosher spent the second stage of his trip in the capital, Monrovia, with the specific mission of caring for Brantly and Writebol.\n\nUpon arriving back to the United States, Mosher spent three weeks quarantined\u2014one week alone in a hotel and two weeks at home.\n\nDriving to hopefully meet Brantly, the peer and now renowned doctor he helped heal, Mosher said he would travel to the Ebola zone in West Africa again, if called.\n\n\u201cI hope we helped spur the use of an antibody [ZMapp] that otherwise would not have been [utilized] if not for the situation,\u201d Brantly said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Liberian staff are the real heroes. I am not more special than anyone else.\u201d\n\n>>> Security Expert Steve Bucci Talks Ebola Threat to U.S. With Genevieve Wood", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tim Mosher, a nurse practitioner from Ohio, followed his faith in volunteering to treat Ebola in Africa.
