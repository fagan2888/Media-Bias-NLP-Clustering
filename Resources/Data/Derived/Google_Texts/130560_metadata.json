Her elderly mother was wandering out of the house in the middle of the night, forgetting to turn the stove off. Macri had to keep watch over her 24/7.\n\n\u201cDementia is a cruel disease,\u201d Macri says.\n\nShe says the stress of caring for her mother was overwhelming. It wasn\u2019t until she landed in the hospital herself \u2014 losing the sight in her right eye for 10 days \u2014 that she was ready to confront the fact that it was time to place her mother in assisted living.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gut wrenching to put someone that you love and who has cared for you in a facility with strangers,\u201d she says.\n\nMacri lives in central Oregon. But she wanted to find a home for her mother in Southern California where all of her friends and extended family live. Her search started where all consumer searches start these days: on the internet. She wanted to make sure the places she considered had no complaints lodged against them, no violations for neglect or abuse.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cannot find anything.\u201d\n\nMacri would have had to travel to a regional state office in Southern California and request paper copies of these reports. But from her home in Oregon, California\u2019s website proved useless.\n\n\u201cI was dumbfounded at the fact that there were no methods to see if there were any reasons that I would not want to put my mom in any of these facilities,\u201d she says.\n\nShe says the lack of meaningful information made an already difficult decision even more painful.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re placing this individual that you love in a situation where you can only hope and pray that they\u2019re going to be safe, secure, and well cared for.\u201d\n\nAbout a dozen states in the U.S. \u2014 including North Carolina, Florida and Ohio \u2014 make details about facility violations readily available online. California lawmakers say it\u2019s an embarrassment that a state with the technical genius of Silicon Valley is so far behind.\n\nAt a press conference in January, Assemblymember Susan Eggman (D-Stockton) introduced a bill, AB 1571, that would require the state to build an online rating system where consumers can compare facilities on quality.\n\n\u201cWe should not depend on Yelp when a loved one needs help,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bill is one of several proposed assisted living reforms currently pending at the State Capital. Lawmakers will vote on it this month, but it\u2019s unclear if they \u2013- or the governor \u2013- will sign off on the million-dollar price tag.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how we afford not to do this,\u201d Eggman says, though she conceded that the political will to back technology projects is lacking. \u201cThere\u2019s always more needs than there is money. And the state\u2019s encountered budget problems for awhile now. So upgrading technology is not at the top of anyone\u2019s list.\u201d\n\nPrior Attempt \u2018Mind-blowingly Bad\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the state has tried to build a consumer website for assisted living facilities. Several years ago, the Department of Social Services (DSS) received a grant to help collect information from facilities that could be posted online.\n\n\u201cThe result was mind-blowingly bad,\u201d says Tony Chicotel, an attorney with California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, an advocacy group that monitors the assisted living industry and is backing more than a dozen reform bills.\n\nThe site only listed names and addresses of facilities. There were no details on services, cost, or past problems.\n\n\u201cFor consumers, it was completely useless,\u201d Chicotel says.\n\nPart of the problem was resistance from the assisted living industry. Most facilities refused to provide information for a website, partly because the technology deployed by the Department of Social Services to collect the information was so bad. But facilities also objected to publishing anything about their rates, says Benson Nadell, program director for the San Francisco Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program.\n\n\u201cThey want interested parties to call up and have an appointment with their marketing person,\u201d he says, adding that some sweet-talking salesmen want to prey on peoples\u2019 guilt around placing their parents in a facility. \u201cIt\u2019s like buying a car, particularly the nice looking places. They are quite enticing. And suddenly, money is no object.\u201d\n\nWill Lawmakers Greenlight the Funding?\n\nAfter more than eight years, the California\u2019s Department of Social Services finally added a new feature to its website in June. It now lists the number of complaints and citations lodged against a facility, but doesn\u2019t say for what.\n\n\u201cIt lacks specificity,\u201d Nadell says.\n\nNadell says a database is only as good as the information entered into it. And here California has another problem. Current law only requires inspections of assisted living facilities every five years \u2014 more frequently only if there\u2019s a complaint. But there\u2019s a constant backlog of complaints that haven\u2019t been investigated. So a lot of helpful information isn\u2019t even being gathered.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s pretty hopeless,\u201d Nadell says.\n\nThe Department of Social Services says it\u2019s trying. Chief deputy director Pat Leary says the agency wants to post more information online, but it\u2019s hamstrung by outdated technology. The department uses Lotus Notes, a database program developed before the internet took off.\n\n\u201cWe have an antiquated computer system that requires human beings to go in and collect data and create reports by hand,\u201d Leary says.\n\nA complete overhaul of the entire system is what\u2019s really needed, advocates say, but the cost of that far exceeds what lawmakers are willing to spend.\n\nSo consumers like Lorchid Macri are basically on their own. She found a facility in San Bernardino that she thought would be okay for her mother. But it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cShe lost 17 pounds in 6 months,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was not showered daily as she was supposed to be. We often found her in room still in her nightgown at 2 or 3 in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nAfter two facilities in two years, Macri was fed up. She moved her mom back up to a place in Oregon.\n\n\u201cI did not want to see another facility in California, because I couldn\u2019t research it,\u201d she says.\n\nMacri says she knows her mother is doing well now, because she\u2019s stopped asking if she can come home.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A dozen states have information readily available online.
