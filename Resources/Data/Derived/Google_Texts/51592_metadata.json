But that\u2019s the case only through a funhouse mirror.\n\nOne quick way to comprehend the level of distortion on your screen is by playing a game of \u201cCount the Characters.\u201d Tune to your favorite hospital drama and count how many characters are nurses and how many are doctors. More likely than not, you will find about 10 doctors for every one nurse. The reality is roughly the opposite: There are about 10 times more nurses than physicians in the hospital down the street from you. Most of what hospitals do is deliver expert nursing care.\n\nIf you believe the TV image, however, you imagine that if you get admitted to the hospital you\u2019ll be immediately surrounded by five or 10 (exceptionally good-looking) physicians. They will work all the complex technology at your bedside and monitor your every breath during your stay. If your life needs saving, they will be there first.\n\nI\u2019m convinced it\u2019s these media-inspired assumptions that come into play when people who are admitted to a real hospital express amazement, even shock, about the extent of their nursing care. They can\u2019t believe how much knowledge the nurses demonstrate. Many are surprised they only occasionally see a physician, while nurses dominate their care around the clock. \u201cHeavens, my life was in the hands of my nurses!\u201d said one of my friends, equally impressed and dismayed.\n\nThere\u2019s a fascinating book about this, \u201cSaving Lives: Why the Media\u2019s Portrayal of Nursing Puts us All at Risk,\u201d and a movement I support to pressure the entertainment industry to make some effort to acknowledge the actual work of nurses. Beyond the fact it\u2019s plainly wrong for Hollywood to obscure the vital work of nurses, it\u2019s also clearly bad for our health as patients. The best and the brightest young people might think from watching TV that it\u2019s a waste of their talents to aspire to a career in nursing, but we need them! We also need to reverse the nursing shortage.\n\nI admit it\u2019s entertaining to think George Clooney will care for you every moment you\u2019re in the hospital. But in real life, none of us should ever entrust our lives to a hospital without top-notch nurses and high quality nursing leadership.\n\nLeah Binder (@LeahBinder) is president and chief executive officer of Leapfrog Group, a national organization based in Washington, D.C., representing employer purchasers of health care and calling for improvements in the safety and quality of the nation\u2019s hospitals.\n\nRead the latest Health Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "People think that the television image of medicine is true-to-life because, after all, TV hospitals look realistic enough, so we assume they mirror real-life hospitals.
