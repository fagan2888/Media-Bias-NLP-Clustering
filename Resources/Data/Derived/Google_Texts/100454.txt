Deadwood, SD

Snowmobile riders from the West and Midwest will hit the Black Hills trails and have the chance to meet some professional racers later this month.



The first Deadwood Snowmobile Rally is Jan. 29 to Feb. 1 in conjunction with the International Series of Champions (ISOC) Deadwood SnoCross Shootout at the Days of '76 Rodeo grounds.



People who take part in the rally will be able to attend a number of events, including meet-and-greet party with the ISOC racers, a display of antique snowmobiles on Main Street and a Deadwood-style tailgate party for football fans.
