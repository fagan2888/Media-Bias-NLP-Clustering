Attorneys representing Chamorro in her lawsuit were set to appear before Goldsmith on Thursday to try to change his mind and issue a preliminary injunction.\n\nChamorro is currently on bedrest at her home and scheduled to deliver by cesarean section later this month. The ideal time, medically, for a woman to have a tubal ligation, commonly known as having one\u2019s \u201ctubes tied,\u201d is at the point of delivery. The next nearest hospital where Chamorro could have the procedure done is in Chico, 70 miles from her home.\n\n\n\nChamorro\u2019s suit is part of a growing clash over birth control and abortion health care coverage. Dozens of U.S. Roman Catholic dioceses, charities and colleges have sued in federal court over the contraceptive coverage required under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nSeveral evangelical nonprofits have also sued, arguing some of the birth control methods covered under the law are tantamount to abortion.\n\nLast June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Hobby Lobby chain and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of the birth control mandate.\n\nThe ACLU has filed a complaint against a Michigan Catholic hospital that also refused to perform tubal ligation, according to Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. She said the woman in that case was able to go to another hospital.\n\nChamorro sued to get the procedure done immediately following her scheduled cesarean section on Jan. 28 because she and her husband do not want more children.\n\nChamorro\u2019s attorneys, including the American Civil Liberties Union, say the procedure is safest when performed immediately after birth, and Chamorro has no choice but to use Mercy Medical Center because Redding is about 200 miles north of San Francisco and the next closest hospital she could go to is more than 70 miles away.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Dignity Health of violating California laws against sex discrimination and the practice of medicine by corporations, pointing out that Chamorro\u2019s obstetrician had sought permission from Mercy Medical to perform the procedure.\n\nThe ACLU says the hospital allowed another woman to undergo a tubal ligation after the ACLU threatened a lawsuit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The judge said the hospital, part of San Francisco-based Dignity Health, is not engaging in sex discrimination.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Judge Rules Catholic Hospital Can Deny Tubal Ligation to Redding Woman\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/01\\/14\\/judge-rules-catholic-hospital-can-deny-tubal-ligation-to-redding-woman\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-14 11:47:04\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-15 12:36:31\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":139018,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Birth Control\",\"News\",\"Women's Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/01\\/iStock_000011829482_Large-e1452800792112.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The judge said the hospital, part of San Francisco-based Dignity Health, is not engaging in sex discrimination.", "title": "Judge Rules Catholic Hospital Can Deny Tubal Ligation to Redding Woman", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/01/14/judge-rules-catholic-hospital-can-deny-tubal-ligation-to-redding-woman/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/01/iStock_000011829482_Large-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "birth control,news,women\\'s health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The ACLU says the hospital allowed another woman to undergo a tubal ligation after the ACLU threatened a lawsuit.\nHealth care provider Dignity Health, which operates Mercy Medical, also says the tubal ligation Chamorro seeks is not medically necessary.\nThe ideal time, medically, for a woman to have a tubal ligation, commonly known as having one\u2019s \u201ctubes tied,\u201d is at the point of delivery.\nUpdate, 4 p.m. Thursday:A San Francisco judge has denied a woman\u2019s request that he require a Catholic hospital to perform a tubal ligation to prevent pregnancy.\nThe ACLU has filed a complaint against a Michigan Catholic hospital that also refused to perform tubal ligation, according to Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU."}
