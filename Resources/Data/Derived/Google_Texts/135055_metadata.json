However, they assured employees that they would still be able to obtain coverage from the new provider.\n\n\u201cI find the whole thing kind of appalling. I know it has been labeled under religious exclusion as birth control, but this is a medicine that is used for many different things,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI have a condition called polycystic ovaries, and I get very sick without this medicine. It makes me really angry that the university doesn\u2019t care enough about my health to cover this for me.\u201d\n\nButler said she paid the $75 needed for one month of her perscription despite the university\u2019s claims that United Health Care would still be able to cover the costs.\n\nNow, many faculty members have complained that the university failed to adaquately communicate how to gain this coverage.\n\nButler, a distinguished professor of history, said the initial statement from the university said there would be no inconvenience to those seeking contraceptives under the terms of Loyola\u2019s religious exclusion, but this has not been the case.\n\n\u201cThe new plan requires us to get a whole separate card, and that process alone takes a few weeks, so I expect that I will be required to foot the bill for another month,\u201d Butler said.\n\nRoss Matthews, director of human resources, said that the insurance company is responsible for administering this information.\n\n\u201cSeparate coverage for these services is available from United Health Care and communication regarding the coverage will come directly from them,\u201d Matthews said.\n\nAccording to Butler, Matthews will meet with the Women\u2019s Resource Center to discuss the issue.\n\nNot all believe the change to be negative. The Rev. Ed Vacek, S.J., Stephen Duffy Chair in Catholic studies and sexual ethics professor, said that the university\u2019s new plan is a good compromise.\n\n\u201cThis allows the university to distance itself from this controversy, while not telling the faculty that they do not care,\u201d Vacek said.\n\nButler said she disagrees.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous that they did the religious exclusion. I understand that it is a possibility now, but I think that a university that cares about its female faculty and staff would not take this stance,\u201d Butler said.\n\nVacek said the decision to stop providing contraceptive care is not an attack on women.\n\n\u201cThis university is extremely sensitive to women\u2019s issues. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone here would say that women\u2019s issues don\u2019t matter. That is not the ethos of Loyola University,\u201d Vacek said.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Matthews sent out an email to the staff recognizing that there had been a mistake in past informational publications.\n\nThe email stated that the new healthcare provider, United Health Care, told Loyola that employees could use the same insurance card for all medical services, so Loyola published this information. However, United Health Care failed to set up its system this way and would now issue separate cards to employees seeking contraceptive coverage, the email said.\n\nMatthews\u2019 email stated that United Health Care had apologized for the inconvenience.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Maroon", "description": "When Loyola professor Sara Butler went to fill her birth control prescription in January, she was surprised that she had to pay full price for her medication due to confusion from the university\u2019s new health care providers.
