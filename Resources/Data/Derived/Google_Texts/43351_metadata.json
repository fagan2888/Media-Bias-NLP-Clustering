TRIA offers all organizations that do business in the U.S. financial protections to cope with the very real and unsettling devastation caused by terrorism, as well as the confidence to remain focused on their objectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cA well-functioning private terrorism insurance marketplace has been preserved because Congress and the Administration made TRIA\u2019s reauthorization an immediate priority,\u201d said Leigh Ann Pusey, president and chief executive officer of the American Insurance Association (AIA). \u201cThe program, which has overwhelming bipartisan support, will continue to protect our nation\u2019s economy against major acts of terrorism. AIA thanks Congressional leadership and the Administration for moving so quickly to reauthorize TRIA.\u201d\n\nTRIA was first signed into law in 2002 by President George W. Bush. It was later extended as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 and in 2007 the president signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA). The law, which is administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury created a \u201ctemporary federal program that provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from a certified act of terror,\u201d according to the Department of Treasury.\n\nThe final version reauthorizes the program for six years with the following changes:\n\nAn increase from $100 million to $200 million is phased in to the program\u2019s trigger by 2020. Decreases federal share of losses from 85% to 80% by 2020 Increases the government\u2019s mandatory recoupment amount from $27.5 billion to $37.5 billion by 2020 Increases recoupment percentage amount from 133% to 140% Streamlines the certification process for an act of terror by removing the Secretary of State and Attorney General from the formal process Instructs the Secretary of Treasury to issue a certification timeline to Congress\n\nThe National Association of Professional Surplus Lines Offices (NAPSLO) said it continues to gather information on the impact of TRIA\u2019s reauthorization.\n\nNAPSLO issued a side-by-side comparison of the expired TRIA program and H.R. 26:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The insurance industry breathed a sigh of relief this week after President Obama signed legislation reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which had been allowed to expire on Dec. 31, 2014.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "The insurance industry breathed a sigh of relief this week after President Obama signed legislation reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which had been allowed to expire on Dec. 31,", "title": "TRIA Signed into Law by President Obama - Terrorism Risk Insurance Act", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/tria-signed-law-president-obama-terrorism-risk-insurance-act", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/28/Globe%20Americas%20Dark%20Blue.jpg?itok=RNaT1x4R", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "legal, business, government, Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, Obama, TRIA, Bush, TRIPRA, Department of Treasury", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, government, Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, Obama, TRIA, AIA, NAPSLO, TRIPRA, Department of Treasury"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb489\"", "article_summary": "It was later extended as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 and in 2007 the president signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA).\nSunday, January 18, 2015The insurance industry breathed a sigh of relief this week after President Obama signed legislation reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which had been allowed to expire on Dec. 31, 2014.\nThe Terrorism Risk Reauthorization Act of 2015, H.R.\nNAPSLO issued a side-by-side comparison of the expired TRIA program and H.R.\n\u201cWe are thrilled that Congress and President Barack Obama finally realized that this federal backstop is more than just an insurance issue."}
