This is fun.\u201d\n\nLigety has the resume, the talent, the charisma to be as big of name in the sport as, say, Lindsey Vonn, who\u2019s sitting out these Olympics after recently undergoing knee surgery. But cover shots on trendy magazines hold no appeal for the 29-year-old from Park City, Utah. And walking the red carpet at an extravagant event isn\u2019t exactly Ligety\u2019s thing.\n\nNo, he\u2019s all skiing, all the time.\n\n\u201cTed\u2019s focused on what he needs to do to not lose. He\u2019s amazing that way,\u201d U.S. men\u2019s coach Sasha Rearick said. \u201cHe\u2019s so professional in everything he does, in terms of getting up in the morning, warming up, making sure his service guys have the perfect setup, training his butt off, coming off the hill and talking to the service guys \u2014 \u2018OK, this is what we have to adjust\u2019 \u2014 getting in on the bike to recover, eating the right foods.\n\n\u201cHe does all those things in such a professional way.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s earned the moniker \u201cMr. GS\u201d among his peers, a label Austria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher, the reigning World Cup overall champion, gave to him.\n\nBestowed with good reason, too.\n\nFor a while there, Ligety was almost unbeatable in the giant slalom. He had a stretch where he captured four straight World Cup giant slalom races dating back to last season, the first to accomplish that since Italy\u2019s Alberto Tomba in 1991. The streak was halted on Dec. 14 in Val d\u2019Isere, France, when Ligety didn\u2019t finish the first run.\n\n\u201cI feel very confident in my skiing,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cI know I have a good chance to win any race I start.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t exactly the case heading into the 2012-13 season.\n\nSee, the International Ski Federation altered the hourglass configuration of the GS skis, essentially leveling the playing field in the name of safety after years of supremacy by Ligety.\n\nLigety was highly agitated about the rule change. He even voiced his displeasure in a rather terse blog post.\n\nDidn\u2019t do much good, though. But he made his point this way: He mastered the new design of GS skis quicker than anyone and captured his fourth overall GS title last season. He even won a race in Austria by 2.75-second margin, a landslide in races usually determined by fractions of a second.\n\nOf course, Ligety will be the favorite in the GS going into Sochi. Maybe in a few other events, too.\n\nAfter all, he did win the super-combined in Wengen, Switzerland, on Friday for his first World Cup win outside the GS event.\n\nIn years past, Ligety was viewed as more of a technical specialist. But he shattered that myth last season at the world championships by winning the super-G, super-combined and defending his title in the giant slalom. He was the first male skier to win three events since French great Jean-Claude Killy took home four golds at the \u201868 world championships.\n\nThat\u2019s some pretty elite company.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no questioning Ted\u2019s ability or his brain,\u201d teammate Bode Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s smart and he\u2019s unique in that he takes responsibility for his situation. That\u2019s what has allowed him to be successful.\n\n\u201cHe has no one to blame for his success except himself.\u201d\n\nLigety\u2019s biggest push may just be from Miller, especially with the five-time Olympic medalist rounding back into shape after missing last season with a knee injury. These two have an intriguing relationship, almost a little brother trying to upstage big brother sort of rivalry. Ligety is ultra-competitive with Miller.\n\n\u201cHe fouls me harder than anybody else on the basketball court. He tries to take me out in soccer,\u201d said Miller, who finished runner-up to Ligety during a giant slalom race in Beaver Creek, Colo., on Dec. 8. \u201cHe\u2019s just very competitive.\u201d\n\nNo offense, but Ligety is that way with everyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the beast playing sports on the ski team, and how competitive all of us are,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cI want to beat everybody\u2019s time. We\u2019re all like that. Definitely because Bode is Bode and he has been so successful. He\u2019s a guy that everyone looks up to. I guess you compete a little bit more with a guy like that.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ligety\u2019s not exactly a big fan of fame, it has opened some doors for him, like launching his own company, Shred, which specializes in goggles, helmets, sunglasses and outerwear. He\u2019s also appeared in a few commercials.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely perks,\u201d he said, grinning, \u201cto being a good ski racer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. skier is one of the world's best and the cameras will be zoomed in tight on him at the Sochi Games next month.
