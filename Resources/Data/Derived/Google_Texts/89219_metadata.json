The same legal system that helped Laura Haughie win the verdict blocked her from receiving it, the Palm Beach Post reports.\n\nWhen Laura Haughie went to Dr. Gregory Latchaw in 2006, she expected to get relief from the discomfort caused by a fibroid tumor. Latchaw scheduled Haughie for a laparoscopic hysterectomy, a 45-minute procedure that would have her back at work in about four days. But Latchaw nicked her bladder, causing Haughie\u2019s abdomen to fill with urine, leaving her unable to work and in need of further surgeries.\n\nBy the time Haughie filed suit in 2008, Latchaw\u2019s corporate practice had been closed and he was employed by a different corporation. Meanwhile, he filed bankruptcy. So the jury\u2019s outsized award could not be collected.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "A Boca Raton patient won a $30 million verdict for injuries from a simple surgery that went went horribly wrong and left her unable to work.
