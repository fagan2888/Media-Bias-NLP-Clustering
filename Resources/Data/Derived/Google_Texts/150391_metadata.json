Al Jazeera America\n\nSpecialty care in Alaska can cost four times the U.S. average, and primary care can cost up to 30 percent more. A day in the hospital can cost up to 50 percent more, according to a 2011 study by the Institute of Social and Economic Research.\n\nIn Alaska, premiums for individual coverage rose nearly 60 percent from 2001 to 2012, according to data from the Federal Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.\n\nAs the costs continue to rise, some are pinning the blame on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senate incumbent Mark Begich voted for the Affordable Care Act. Now campaign advertisements for Republican challenger Dan Sullivan link Begich to \u201cObamacare\u201d whenever possible, using it as a way to align him with President Barack Obama, whose approval rating in Alaska is one of the lowest in the country.\n\nBegich, for his part, has highlighted his disagreements with the administration, saying that he has problems with the way the ACA was rolled out and even calling himself a \u201ctotal thorn\u201d in Obama\u2019s behind. More recently, he has begun embracing the law while saying that it could use some improvements, such as allowing insurance companies to offer cheaper plans than currently permitted. Alaska is one of 19 states in the country that chose to let the federal government manage the health insurance market under the ACA.\n\nFor Selman, the ACA is just another factor that contributes to the soaring cost of insurance in the Last Frontier.\n\nSheila Hestes, a server at Club Paris, discovered this when she had to undergo major surgery. \u201cYou get that itemized bill, and it\u2019s $25 for aspirin. They rent you a blanket for $12 a day,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, it adds up, and it adds up, and it adds up.\u201d\n\nHealth care\u2019s high costs in Alaska are due to a combinations of factors, according to Mouhcine Guettabi, an assistant professor and a co-author of a report about employer-sponsored health insurance in Alaska at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska at Anchorage. \u201cThe simplest one of them being that Alaska is isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has thin markets, less providers and isolated communities that are hard to get to.\u201d\n\nHigh insurance premiums are caused by a different although related set of factors, he said. The price of insurance premiums is negotiated by firms and depends on, for example, the profile of the employees and the size of the firm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Specialty care in the Last Frontier can cost four times the US average and primary care up to 30 percent more", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/10/14/5-days-in-alaskasoaringcostofhealthinsuranceaffordablecareact.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/10/14/5-days-in-alaskasoaringcostofhealthinsuranceaffordablecareact/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.alaska_doctor_101314.1413301520334.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Specialty care in the Last Frontier can cost four times the US average and primary care up to 30 percent more", "title": "5 days in Alaska: Voters chilled by soaring health care costs"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/10/14/5-days-in-alaskasoaringcostofhealthinsuranceaffordablecareact/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.alaska_doctor_101314.1413301520334.jpg", "description": "Specialty care in the Last Frontier can cost four times the US average and primary care up to 30 percent more", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "5 days in Alaska: Voters chilled by soaring health care costs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Small business, Alaska, Election 2014, Health Care, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c54\"", "article_summary": "Al Jazeera AmericaSpecialty care in Alaska can cost four times the U.S. average, and primary care can cost up to 30 percent more.\nThe price of insurance premiums is negotiated by firms and depends on, for example, the profile of the employees and the size of the firm.\nIn Alaska, premiums for individual coverage rose nearly 60 percent from 2001 to 2012, according to data from the Federal Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.\n\u201cIt has thin markets, less providers and isolated communities that are hard to get to.\u201dHigh insurance premiums are caused by a different although related set of factors, he said.\nAs the costs continue to rise, some are pinning the blame on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or \u201cObamacare.\u201dDemocratic Senate incumbent Mark Begich voted for the Affordable Care Act."}
