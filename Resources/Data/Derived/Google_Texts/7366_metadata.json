Domino's thyroid finally got the better of her, and she's been a pretty sick kitty for the past month or two. About six weeks ago she gave up on dry food, so we switched to wet food. That helped, but she gradually ate less and less of it. A couple of weeks ago she stopped eating entirely no matter what we tried. She'd lap up microscopic amounts of gravy or tuna juice a couple of times a day, but that was it. She just wouldn't eat anymore.\n\nBy last week she was very thin, and her energy level was pretty low. She slept most of the time in her favorite hidey-hole, and came out only a few times a day for five or ten minutes at a time. By the start of this week she'd gotten a bit unsteady on her feet, and it was obvious the end was near. I talked to our vet earlier this week, and yesterday we took Domino in and had her put to sleep. I hated doing it, but I'm certain it was the right thing to do. She didn't show it, but she must have been in a fair amount of pain, which was only going to get worse over time.\n\nTo the very end, she was sweet and sociable, which made it even harder. She lost her meow several weeks ago, but she never lost her purr or her love of tummy rubs. She was a good cat. She'll be missed.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/09/friday-cat-blogging-5-september-2014", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_domino_2014_09_05_1_0.jpg", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "title": "Friday cat blogging - 5 September 2014"}, "twitter": {"creator": "kdrum", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/09/friday-cat-blogging-5-september-2014", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_domino_2014_09_05_1_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_domino_2014_09_05_1_0.jpg"}, "title": "Friday cat blogging - 5 September 2014", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "A couple of weeks ago she stopped eating entirely no matter what we tried.\nAbout six weeks ago she gave up on dry food, so we switched to wet food.\nShe lost her meow several weeks ago, but she never lost her purr or her love of tummy rubs.\nBy the start of this week she'd gotten a bit unsteady on her feet, and it was obvious the end was near.\nShe'd lap up microscopic amounts of gravy or tuna juice a couple of times a day, but that was it."}
