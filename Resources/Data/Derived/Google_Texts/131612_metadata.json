And I\u2019ve actually been involved in my community. And I\u2019ve actually been in business. She doesn\u2019t have any of these experiences,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cThis is just not a starter job.\u201d\n\nBurton, 51, is a Colleyville tea party organizer who worked on Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign and now has his endorsement. She faults Shelton for voting in favor of the state budget passed in the midst of the 2011 funding crisis. It was balanced by delaying billions in state payments.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the legislators who passed a budget who said it was balanced when it was not. There were $7 billion of bills they pushed off to the next session,\u201d Burton said.\n\n\u201cHe did not do enough for conservatives,\u201d she said.\n\nBurton told Arlington Republicans she wants more transparency in state spending. She also supports a school choice program known as the \u201cTaxpayer Savings Grant,\u201d which critics call a voucher program. It would allow a public school student to transfer to a private school. Up to 60 percent of the per-pupil spending allotted for that student would also be transferred to the private school.\n\nThe candidates on school vouchers\n\n\u201cIt helps the money follow the child with some of the money still staying in the public schools,\u201d Burton said of the measure which did not pass the legislature.\n\n\u201cIt was a great step in the right direction for Texas. I think that\u2019s something we need to look at,\u201d she said.\n\nShelton says he\u2019d oppose that program and any other that uses public dollars for private schools.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong supporter of public schools. I think all our tax dollars should go to public schools. I would not vote to give it to private schools,\u201d Shelton said.\n\nA difference on how to fund water projects\n\nShelton and Burton also disagree on how to pay for big infrastructure needs.\n\nShelton supported taking $2 billion from the state\u2019s rainy day savings account to set up a fund that will finance about $30 billion in water projects. He says drought and Texas\u2019 growing population made that the most important measure passed during the last legislative session.\n\n\u201cIt is a long-term plan,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cIt is a 50-year plan. It will increase the storage capacity for water in the state of Texas.\u201d\n\nBurton wants to reexamine the water fund. She says it was a priority it should have been paid for through general tax dollars and not through a savings fund. She believes lawmakers have just created more bureaucracy and haven\u2019t clearly explained how the money will be spent.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to get it first? How much is the funding going to go? What is it going to go to? I mean, are we going to be repainting water towers?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis is unfortunately a lot of the way governments work. The money goes to things that are not a priority.\u201d\n\nArlington Republicans listening to the candidates were split in their support.\n\nDave McElwee is backing Shelton because of he\u2019s worked in the community for years.\n\n\u201cShe has not been active in local community affairs, whereas Dr. Shelton has a long history in this county. He\u2019s been very active in politics especially when it comes to children,\" McElwee said.\n\nCraig Ownby supported Shelton\u2019s senate race two years ago when he lost to Wendy Davis. But not this time.\n\n\u201cMark has barely campaigned,\" Ownby said. \"Konni\u2019s been out doing the grassroots work. She\u2019s talking to the voters. She\u2019s talking to the constituents. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure Mark can win the district.\"\n\nWinning Senate District 10 was paramount for all the Republican at the forum. If their nominee retakes the seat, Republicans will have a large enough majority in the state senate to block most Democratic bills.\n\nThe winner faces Democrat Libby Willis in November.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "The entire state will be watching Tuesday night as Republicans in Tarrant County decide which runoff candidate will continue and compete in the fall for", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://keranews.org/post/republicans-konni-burton-and-mark-shelton-battle-pivotal-senate-seat-tarrant-county", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kera/files/styles/medium/public/201404/Shelton-Burton_jpg_312x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The entire state will be watching Tuesday night as Republicans in Tarrant County decide which runoff candidate will continue and compete in the fall for", "title": "Republicans Konni Burton And Mark Shelton Battle For Pivotal Senate Seat In Tarrant County"}, "story_id": 315941852, "twitter": {"site": "@keranews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@keranews"}, "author": "Shelley Kofler", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Republicans Konni Burton And Mark Shelton Battle For Pivotal Senate Seat In Tarrant County"}, "nid": 50015, "datePublished": "2014-05-25", "keywords": "Elections, Senate District 10, Mark Shelton, Konni Burton, Wendy Davis, Tea Party", "wordCount": 874, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4c24\"", "article_summary": "If their nominee retakes the seat, Republicans will have a large enough majority in the state senate to block most Democratic bills.\nIt would allow a public school student to transfer to a private school.\nI would not vote to give it to private schools,\u201d Shelton said.\nUp to 60 percent of the per-pupil spending allotted for that student would also be transferred to the private school.\nThe entire state will be watching Tuesday night as Republicans in Tarrant County decide which runoff candidate will continue and compete in the fall for Wendy Davis\u2019 state senate seat."}
