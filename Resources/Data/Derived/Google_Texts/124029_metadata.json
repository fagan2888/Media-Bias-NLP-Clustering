According to The Clarion-Ledger, James \u201cScooby Doo\u201d Warren says he has put together a statewide get-out-the-vote (GOTV) plan with the help of the PAC and New Horizon Church pastor Bishop Ronnie Crudup, Sr.\n\nWhen asked if he was receiving blow back from members of his own party for supporting a Republican campaign like this, Warren said he \u201cgot all that taken care of on the front end.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called D.C. and told them what was going on with the tea party,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do anything after the 24th because I\u2019m a Democrat \u2026 Whoever wins will have to deal with me in November.\u201d\n\nWhile Cochran and McDaniel divided the vote fairly evenly in the June 3 primary, McDaniel is going into the runoff with a slight advantage in support and could easily take advantage of the fact that turnout is not expected to be high on June 24, the runoff election day. The winner will be the candidate who is able to get the most voters to the polls, and it won\u2019t take much to unseat the incumbent.\n\nAccording to Politico, the \u201cNow or Never\u201d PAC recently threw in their support for McDaniel. The political action committee will spend $90,000 on radio ads which will air through next week\u2019s runoff election, using the senator\u2019s comments last week that he did \u201call kinds of indecent things with animals\u201d as a kid.\n\n\u201cTell Thad Cochran you\u2019re no farm animal,\u201d the narrator of the ad says. \u201cAnd you are not going to take being on the receiving end of his so-called fun any longer.\u201d\n\nThe ad then goes on to attack Cochran for not doing more to repeal the Affordable Care Act (colloquially known as Obamacare).\n\nLast week, former Texas Republican congressman Ron Paul announced his endorsement for McDaniel while his son, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he was going to stay out of the race as ideology clashes with political strategy. Paul senior has never had an issue putting ideology above partisanship, but Rand has future political ambitions to consider.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, this has been an expensive primary race. Cochran has raised over $4.4 million, mostly from large contributors ($2,296,545) and PACs ($1,869,227), and has spent over $4.5 million as of the last report. McDaniel has raised over $1.5 million (the majority of which is also from large contributors)and has spent over $1.4 million.\n\nThis race has attracted a lot of attention from groups and operatives inside and outside Mississippi, and will likely be the focus of election coverage for many news outlets next week.\n\nPhoto Source: AP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Big money and political influence is trying to sway voters ahead of the Mississippi Senate race as incumbent Thad Cochran faces a tough fight for re-election.", "og": {"site_name": "IVN.us", "description": "Big money and political influence is trying to sway voters ahead of the Mississippi Senate race as incumbent Thad Cochran faces a tough fight for re-election.", "title": "'Scooby Doo' Leads Black GOTV Operation in Mississippi Senate Race - IVN.us", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 605, "identifier": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sen-thad-cochran.jpg", "height": 328}, "updated_time": "2014-06-17T16:43:27-07:00", "url": "http://ivn.us/2014/06/17/scooby-doo-leads-black-gotv-effort-mississippi-senate-race/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Big money and political influence is trying to sway voters ahead of the Mississippi Senate race as incumbent Thad Cochran faces a tough fight for re-election.", "creator": "@TheShawnG", "image": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sen-thad-cochran.jpg", "title": "'Scooby Doo' Leads Black GOTV Operation in Mississippi Senate Race - IVN.us", "site": "@IVN", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-17T14:03:32-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 322111017868621, "pages": 233116802464}, "keywords": "Thad Cochran, Chris McDaniel, Mississippi, Senate, elections, primaries, Republican Party", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IVN", "section": "Campaigns", "tag": "Thad Cochran", "published_time": "2014-06-17T14:03:32-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T16:43:27-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "chris mcdaniel, elections, mississippi, primaries, republican party, senate, thad cochran, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4040\"", "article_summary": "According to OpenSecrets.org, this has been an expensive primary race.\nA Democratic operative is working with the Mississippi Conservative PAC to rally support for incumbent U.S Senator Thad Cochran (R), who is in a heated primary runoff race against Mississippi state Senator Chris McDaniel.\nSenator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he was going to stay out of the race as ideology clashes with political strategy.\nAccording to Politico, the \u201cNow or Never\u201d PAC recently threw in their support for McDaniel.\nAccording to The Clarion-Ledger, James \u201cScooby Doo\u201d Warren says he has put together a statewide get-out-the-vote (GOTV) plan with the help of the PAC and New Horizon Church pastor Bishop Ronnie Crudup, Sr."}
