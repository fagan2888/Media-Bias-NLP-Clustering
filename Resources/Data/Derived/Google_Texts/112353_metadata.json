They also can use a form found here to register by mail, if it\u2019s postmarked no later than Tuesday. And the board will allow folks to register in person from 8 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. Tuesday on the sixth floor at 69 W. Washington St.\n\nIf potential voters miss the deadline, they still have the option of registering at early and Election Day polling places at the same time as their vote is cast, provided they bring two forms of accepted identification, one with their current address.\n\nEarly voting is scheduled to start Wednesday at 69 W. Washington, said Jim Allen, spokesman for the board. On Feb. 29, additional early voting sites will be opened in each of the city\u2019s 50 wards.\n\nAllen also is reminding 17-year-olds that they can vote in the primary if they will turn 18 by Nov. 8, the day of the general election.\n\nSo far, there are about 1.5 million people registered to vote in the city, Allen said. That\u2019s about 200,000 more than four years ago during the last presidential election cycle. (Hal Dardick)\n\nWhat's on tap\n\n*Mayor Rahm Emanuel has no public events.\n\n*Gov.

Completed in 1855, the mansion has not undergone a major overhaul since 1972.\n\nAt one point, there was black mold growing in the basement, plaster fell from the ceiling and rainwater leaked into the Lincoln bedroom so often that furniture was covered in tarps and buckets were set up to catch drips.\n\nStill, Gov. Rauner, who stays at the mansion when in Springfield, joked that it was in better condition than his frat house \u2014 a statement that may have been an exaggeration given a survey last year by the Illinois Capital Development Board.\n\n\"The current condition of the mansion is, at best, marginally acceptable for conducting business of the state and is not suitable for long-term occupancy by the governor,\" the survey said.
