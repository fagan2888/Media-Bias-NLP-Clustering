And when we have something to talk about, we'll show you.\"\n\nThe outline of a plan was supposed to be circulated among the GOP this month, but shortly after the plan to craft the plan started to make news, Politico reported that the eventual bill might not even get a vote from the leaders likely to craft it.\n\nWhen pressed on why an Obamacare replacement was not in the GOP's new budget proposal, and on how important it is for Republicans to offer an alternative when Democrats finally have some positive news to point to, including potentially improving opinions about the health care law, Boehner stuck by his promise to propose a replacement.\n\n\"I think when we outline how we would repeal this bill and what we would replace it with, you'd see that our intent here is to take care of the American people, as opposed to harm them, as the president's bill has done,\" Boehner said.\n\nMichael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.
