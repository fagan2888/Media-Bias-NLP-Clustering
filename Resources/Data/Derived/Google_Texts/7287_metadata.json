Unlike previous years, current budget conditions and new data give the idea a fighting chance of becoming reality.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget request marks the fifth year in a row defense officials have requested a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. The request has typically gone right into the shredder, with lawmakers worried that the process would target military installations in their districts.\n\nRelated: Half a Trillion for the Pentagon? Why Defense Spending Is Only Going Higher\n\nAdd to those parochial interests the fact that the last BRAC, conducted 2005, wound up costing the Pentagon around $35 billion to implement in order to achieve roughly $4 billion in future annual savings, putting the department in the red until at least 2018.\n\nBut the fiscal 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a policy roadmap for the Pentagon, contains language allowing for a department-wide examination of excess infrastructure. The bill stopped short, however, of saying the data gleaned would lead to a new round of base closures.\n\nA BRAC \u201chas been an aspirational goal for several years now \u2026 the studies the department has done generally find 20 percent to 25 percent, sometimes more surplus infrastructure in most of our mission areas,\u201d Pentagon Comptroller Michael McCord said Monday during an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\nHe argued that the most important costs are associated with keeping personnel at outdated installations, rather than the cost of maintaining defunct facilities or owning more real estate than the department needs.\n\n\u201cWe are operating with a constant physical infrastructure with a lot of overhead to maintain it,\u201d McCord said.\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Military Buildup Continues with Big New Fighter Jet Order\n\nDefense leaders estimate a new base closing round will save billions annually, and vow the process would be more efficient than in 2005, when the focus was on shifting the U.S. military toward fighting nonconventional wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIt's critical to note that the department is not happy with what happened in the 2005 BRAC round in terms of cost takeout. We've rebalanced the force in some useful ways, but we think a future BRAC round would have a much different financial ramification,\u201d said McCord.\n\nThe timing of the comptroller\u2019s pitch, one repeated by various service officials in recent weeks as they have defended their budget requests in front of Capitol Hill lawmakers, is important because work on the next NDAA is set to begin next month.\n\nThe various subpanels of the House Armed Services Committee are slated to begin next month hammering out the policy roadmap for the Pentagon\u2019s nearly $583 billion budget request; its Senate counterpart is expected to follow suit soon thereafter.\n\nRelated: $583 Billion Defense Budget Covers Russia, China, and ISIS with New Weapons\n\nThe House panel\u2019s chair and many off its senior members are embroiled in a funding war over the 2017 budget. Fiscal hawks want $30 billion shaved off the $1.07 trillion top-line set by last year\u2019s budget deal, while defense hawks want the Pentagon\u2019s war account increased by over $20 billion.\n\nWhile the entire budget process could get scrapped in the next few weeks, it\u2019s possible that lawmakers will look to a BRAC as a way to earn future savings, or appease penny-pinchers on the right.\n\nEven if the stars align, McCord said the Pentagon knows BRAC \u201cis a difficult -- a political topic. We understand that.\n\n\u201cBut the department is going to, I think, remain consistent in the method that we just need to move forward on this to enable a whole bunch of cost takeout, to drive more combat capability out of each taxpayer dollar.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Defense Department\u2019s top money man on Monday repeated the agency\u2019s plea to Congress for a new base closure round and unlike previous years, budget conditions and new data give the idea at least a fighting chance of becoming reality.", "title": "BRAC Is Back \u2013 but Will Congress Actually Close More Military Bases?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/08/BRAC-Back-Will-Congress-Actually-Close-More-Military-Bases", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/08/BRAC-Back-Will-Congress-Actually-Close-More-Military-Bases", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Defense Department\u2019s top money man on Monday repeated the agency\u2019s plea to Congress for a new base closure round and unlike previous years, budget conditions and new data give the idea at least a fighting chance of becoming reality.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget request marks the fifth year in a row defense officials have requested a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.\nWe've rebalanced the force in some useful ways, but we think a future BRAC round would have a much different financial ramification,\u201d said McCord.\n\u201cIt's critical to note that the department is not happy with what happened in the 2005 BRAC round in terms of cost takeout.\nRelated: $583 Billion Defense Budget Covers Russia, China, and ISIS with New WeaponsThe House panel\u2019s chair and many off its senior members are embroiled in a funding war over the 2017 budget.\nEven if the stars align, McCord said the Pentagon knows BRAC \u201cis a difficult -- a political topic."}
