(TRNS)- For the first time since Gallup began to track party favorability in 1992, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have attained at least 40% favorability from the public, a recent poll reveals.

The poll also showed that Republican party favorability has dropped five points since the midterm elections and that the Democratic party favorability hovers just above its record low of 36%.

The article accompanying the results of the survey said that previous Gallup polls have revealed a pattern showing that Americans have been largely disappointed with government performance and leadership for a while, but despite that, have review at least one party well. The fact that neither party has reviewed well is an unusual departure from the normal pattern.

Gallup suggested that, “perhaps because of the constant brinksmanship going on between Obama and the Republican Congress, but maybe for other reasons— both parties are floundering.”

The survey was conducted from March 5-8, 2015 through telephone interviews. 1,025 adults were polled.
