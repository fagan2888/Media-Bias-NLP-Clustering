Elementary Librarians are on the long list of cuts USD 259 could make as they deal with a potential $30,000,000 deficit.

There will be at least three people speaking at the Wichita Public School Board Meeting tomorrow, hoping to keep librarians at elementary schools.

One student at Wichita East High School says he likely would not be fielding offers from Harvard or Princeton if his elementary librarian was not there to help him.

"I know that the school district is in a bit of a bind right now when it comes to funding, but I'm really concerned about the idea of cutting elementary school librarians," said Andrew Figueiredo.

Figueiredo says he knows his journey through learning really began at the elementary school library.

"That's where I could figure out what ever I wanted to learn about," he said. "If I wanted to learn about other countries, if I wanted to learn about animals, I could go and pick up and learn about that whenever I needed to and I always had a librarian to help me."

Teacher and former librarian Wendy Fjordan says that she left her position as a librarian because she feared the position would be eliminated. Now an English teacher, she says she sees students suffer from not having a librarian.

"When the librarians were eliminated in 2011 at the high school level...what I am seeing now, being back in the classroom, is that directly impacted to students skills that they have now," Fjordan said.

Figueiredo said, "I think we have to remember that the school district is in a tough place. I think that librarians are so critical, we cannot cut this, if we cut this, it is going to be spelling problems down the line."
