[Obamacare] fundamentally changes the relationship.\u201d\n\nMartin pushed back with standard Democratic talking points that make the preposterous claim that government controlled healthcare \u201cempowers the individual.\u201d\n\nCarson said the Affordable Care Act \u201cplaces the government at the pinnacle. Now it\u2019s placed on a road to control your health \u2026 and I think most of us are asleep at the wheel. We don\u2019t realize what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d Carson warned. \u201cWhat you will see is that a lot of the insurance companies will begin to fold\u2026 Ultimately we\u2019ll have a single-payer system if we don\u2019t stop this from happening.\u201d\n\nWhich has been the ultimate goal all along for President Obama and the now decidedly far-left Democratic Party.\n\n[poll id=\u201d128\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "On his NewsOne radio show Friday morning, host Roland Martin confronted Dr. Ben Carson over recent comments comparing Obamacare to slavery, words the neurosurgeon and author did not back away from. \u201cObamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d Carson said early this month while speaking at \u2026", "title": "Ben Carson defends comment, Obamacare is 'worse thing' since slavery", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bencarson.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-22T08:41:22+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2013/10/21/ben-carson-defends-comment-obamacare-is-worse-thing-since-slavery-85652", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2013-10-21T10:36:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T08:41:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cObamacare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d Carson said early this month while speaking at the Values Voter Summit.\nNoting that atrocities like Jim Crow arose after slavery, Martin asked him, \u201cDid you go too far?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my opinion,\u201d Carson responded.\nOn his NewsOne radio show Friday morning, host Roland Martin confronted Dr. Ben Carson over recent comments comparing Obamacare to slavery, words the neurosurgeon and author did not back away from.\n\u201cFirst of all, I recognize that slavery was a horrible thing.\nNow it\u2019s placed on a road to control your health \u2026 and I think most of us are asleep at the wheel."}
