The big showdown between Donald Trump and Fox News’ Megyn Kelly on the day Mitt Romney denounced the Republican frontrunner was predictably surreal and fairly toddler-like.

Here are a few of the more bizarre moments from the GOP debate Thursday night.

1. It was very important for Donald Trump to say on national TV that he does not have a small penis.

Marco Rubio earlier in the week made mention of Trump’s small hands. This is a sore subject for Trump.

During the debate, the Donald wanted to make sure everyone knows or believes he is in no way under-endowed in the manhood department.

“He referred to my hands, if they’re small, something else must be small,” Trump said. “I guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee that.”

In the coming days, look for Melania Trump to back up that assertion on the campaign trail.

2. Ted Cruz blamed Detroit’s problems on leftwing politics.

Asked what he would do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train people to do the jobs, Ted Cruz gave a bizarre, deflecting answer. “Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of left-wing policy.”

Huh?

He went all the way back to Henry Ford and WWII.

“And then for 50 years, leftwing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies and have driven the residents out.”

But what would you do to bring back jobs?

Cut taxes, eliminate regulation, yada yada.



3. The Donald repeatedly asserted that the military will “do as I tell them” even if it’s illegal, a war crime and a bunch of high-ranking military people just said they will not obey illegal orders.

The Donald just kept repeating that they will do what he tells them. Because they will. They just will.
