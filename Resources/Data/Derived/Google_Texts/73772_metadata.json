State, led by a sophomore quarterback who stands 6-foot-5 with an arm to match, gladly accepted a deferred coin flip, won by CSU-Pueblo.\n\nAnd on the game\u2019s first play from scrimmage, Bart Williams, Grand Valley\u2019s long-haired slinger, winged a 65-yard touchdown pass to Matt Williams. CSU-Pueblo, the defending Division II champion, was winded.\n\nLike a plastic bag blowing in the breeze, CSU-Pueblo got tossed around Saturday as Grand Valley State blew out the ThunderWolves 31-7 in a quarterfinal mismatch that drew 4,325 fans to the ThunderBowl.\n\n\u201cWhen I threw it, I wasn\u2019t expecting that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think the wind caught it and helped me out, put the ball where it needed to be.\u201d\n\nCSU-Pueblo (12-2), which won its first national championship last season and its fifth consecutive Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference title this season, never recovered from its first-play deficit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as good a ball as I\u2019ve seen thrown,\u201d CSU-Pueblo coach John Wristen said of the long TD pass that put his team in a ditch. \u201cAnd they kept gaining traction after that.\u201d\n\nGrand Valley State (12-2), which finished third in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, upset a third team ranked in the top five in as many weeks. The Lakers advanced to meet No. 5 Shepherd (W.Va.) in the national semifinals next weekend.\n\n\u201cA big factor was the coin flip,\u201d said Grand Valley State coach Matt Mitchell. \u201cWe wanted to take some shots. So we hooked up on the first play.\u201d\n\nGrand Valley State rode a slipstream. The Lakers led 14-0 after five minutes. They led 21-0 midway through the first quarter. Marty Carter and Kirk Spencer ran for touchdowns on two drives that lasted less than five minutes combined.\n\nSpencer, who suffered a broken leg on a hit at the 3-yard line, kept plugging to score his 7-yarder. Carter, his backup, took over and finished with 231 yards rushing.\n\nCSU-Pueblo scored late in the first quarter when quarterback AJ Thompson found Patrick O\u2019Malley for a 5-yard TD pass. But the ThunderWolves had only 75 total yards in the first half. Grand Valley State finished the game with 527 total yards. The ThunderWolves had 157.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Carter took a shotgun handoff, faked a draw run, then threw a 22-yard pass into the wind for a touchdown strike to Nick Keizer. The Lakers managed the clock the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be timid and win playoff games,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nCSU-Pueblo senior Cameron McDondle (106 yards Saturday), Division II\u2019s second-leading rusher this year, and his brother, eighth-best sophomore Bernard McDondle (8 yards), set a D-II record for most yards rushing in a season by a tandem with 3,674. They helped the ThunderWolves average more than 300 yards rushing per game this year.\n\nBut after CSU-Pueblo fell behind quickly Saturday, there wasn\u2019t enough time to run down a rally.\n\n\u201cThat was definitely surprising,\u201d said CSU-Pueblo freshman linebacker Branon Payer. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d start like that. But you have to be able to rebound. And we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Defending champ CSU-Pueblo bows out in a blowout to Grand Valley", "title": "Defending champ CSU-Pueblo bows out in a blowout to Grand Valley", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/defending-champ-csu-pueblo-bows-out-in-a-blowout-to-grand-valley/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__csu-pueblo-grand-valley-football2p1.jpg", "height": 403}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__csu-pueblo-grand-valley-football2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T17:24:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:40:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA big factor was the coin flip,\u201d said Grand Valley State coach Matt Mitchell.\nAnd on the game\u2019s first play from scrimmage, Bart Williams, Grand Valley\u2019s long-haired slinger, winged a 65-yard touchdown pass to Matt Williams.\nGrand Valley State finished the game with 527 total yards.\nGrand Valley (Mich.)
