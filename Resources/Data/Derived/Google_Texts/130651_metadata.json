Before that stretch, it happened once in 37 majors.\n\nWilliams didn\u2019t show up for a news conference, meaning she could face a fine. Instead, she issued a five-sentence statement that read in part: \u201cWhen you arrive at any tournament, you hope you will have a chance to work your way into the event, but I didn\u2019t have that opportunity \u2014 she just played better than me today.\u201d\n\nThat is true.\n\nThe 40th-ranked Stephens, who has reached the French Open\u2019s fourth round the last three years, was consistently strong from the baseline, making only 14 unforced errors to Williams\u2019 30.\n\n\u201cI want her to play with a sense of joy \u2026 and play everything as well as she can, relentlessly, and not be concerned with the result. Let the result take care of itself. And she did a good job of that today,\u201d said Stephens\u2019 coach, Nick Saviano.\n\n\u201cI have noticed that missing. \u2026 For any athlete, in any sport, at any high level, they must have that passion and the joy to perform,\u201d Saviano explained. \u201cOtherwise, it becomes onerous. It becomes too much of a job, so to speak.\u201d\n\nThe biggest victory of Stephens\u2019 career came at the 2013 Australian Open, when she defeated Williams\u2019 younger sister Serena en route to the semifinals.\n\nThis was the first time Stephens had faced Venus Williams, other than beating her in an exhibition as a teen.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Stephens said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that really counts.\u201d\n\nNow Stephens joins Lindsay Davenport as the only Americans to have beaten each Williams at a Grand Slam tournament.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Venus Williams ousted from French Open by Sloane Stephens", "title": "Venus Williams ousted from French Open by Sloane Stephens", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Venus Williams ousted from French Open by Sloane Stephens", "title": "Venus Williams ousted from French Open by Sloane Stephens", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/venus_williams_ousted_from_french_open_by_sloane_stephens/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-tennis-french-open.jpeg12-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Venus Williams ousted from French Open by Sloane Stephens", "title": "Venus Williams ousted from French Open by Sloane Stephens", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-tennis-french-open.jpeg12-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Howard Fendrich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This was the first time Stephens had faced Venus Williams, other than beating her in an exhibition as a teen.\n\u201cBut,\u201d Stephens said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that really counts.\u201dNow Stephens joins Lindsay Davenport as the only Americans to have beaten each Williams at a Grand Slam tournament.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPARIS (AP) \u2014 A loss by Venus Williams in the first round at a Grand Slam is no longer the rarity it once was.\nIt also was the fifth time in the last 13 Grand Slam tournaments she\u2019s entered that she exited in the first round.\nAnd, as it happens, the woman who beat Williams at the French Open on Tuesday, Sloane Stephens, is making a concerted effort, at her coach\u2019s behest, to focus less on who is on the other side of the net."}
