One of football\u2019s premier receivers clutched the ball and ran unrestricted to the end zone to complete an 86-yard touchdown play.\n\nNobody was paying attention as Arizona Cardinals cornerback Antonio Cromartie walked the few feet to the bench, removed his helmet and slammed it into the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s not my best day,\u201d he would say.\n\nBut Cromartie wasn\u2019t the first to be beaten by Manning.\n\nFive hundred and two times defenders had fallen before him on touchdown passes. And many more will fall before Manning\u2019s work is done.\n\nManning is the epitome and embodiment of Dorian Gray and Benjamin Buttons. Although 381/2, the Broncos quarterback really is the ageless wonder. He\u2019s 14 and playing with his brothers in the front yard of the Manning home in the Garden District of New Orleans.\n\nAll he did Sunday was pass for his 500th touchdown, then Nos. 501, 502 and 503. Ol\u2019 Rocky Top also threw two more touchdown passes that were called back. Brett Favre\u2019s record total of 508 is going down in October.\n\nWhen Manning signed with the Broncos it was for five years. Everybody went \u201cwink-wink.\u201d He might play two seasons, perhaps three. Before the first season Manning surprised me with: \u201cI\u2019m basically treating it as a one-year contract. If I don\u2019t play that well or don\u2019t pass my physical next spring, this could be it.\u201d\n\nManning is in the third year. Whenever I ask him how much longer he plans to play, he shrugs. Tom Brady and Drew Brees have openly discussed playing into their 40s.\n\nWhy not Peyton?\n\nPHOTOS: Arizona Cardinals vs. Denver Broncos\n\nIf the nerve in his arm continues to improve and the nerve in his approach to the game continues to be the same, the man could play until he\u2019s 50. He certainly will finish his five-year contract.\n\nHis mind wins over matter.\n\nAsk the Cardinals. Manning threw for a mile high and a personal all-time high 479 yards with 31 completions. The Broncos dumped their mediocre running game and did what they do best in the league \u2014 pass.\n\nYes, Peyton threw a couple of interceptions. Richard Petty brushed a few fences. Willie Mays hit into some double plays. Mozart penned a few lousy compositions.\n\nAfter the game, Manning was his normal humble self. When asked if he keeps the footballs that set records, Peyton said: \u201cYou know what. I\u2019ve never kept a football .\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason. Another record is waiting. Before he\u2019s finished in 2016, \u201917 or \u201922, Manning probably will possess every record except the one he wants.\n\nYet, he still has time to win more Super Bowls.\n\nAnd he still has time to have fun. And he still has time to give the NFL the most exciting and enthralling games. People like Peyton.\n\nFor a moment late Sunday afternoon, Peyton showed his age. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any players still playing (who were playing) when I threw my first touchdown . . . I do think about how many people have helped me throughout my career. Football is the ultimate team game, so I guess one man kind of has to accept it \u2014 not really accept it \u2014 on behalf of coaches and teammates.\u201d\n\nPeyton needs to be reminded how many people in football he has helped.\n\nAsk Julius Thomas, who caught the 500th. Ask Demaryius Thomas, who recorded 226 yards and two touchdowns \u2014 and another that was nullified. Slump? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nThere was a moment in the first half Sunday when the Cardinals\u2019 offense was moving. During a timeout, Manning was signaling to the Broncos\u2019 defense what to expect. He was working the whole room.\n\n\u201cYeah, I thought those guys were awesome,\u201d he said of the defense.\n\nPerpetual Peyton played some awesome, too.\n\nWoody Paige: wpaige@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Easy, breezy, Peyton Manning could throw 600 before he\u2019s done", "title": "Paige: Easy, breezy, Peyton Manning could throw 600 before he\u2019s done", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/05/paige-easy-breezy-peyton-manning-could-throw-600-before-hes-done/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__manning-cardinalsp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__manning-cardinalsp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-05T20:20:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:11:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bd1\"", "article_summary": "One of football\u2019s premier receivers clutched the ball and ran unrestricted to the end zone to complete an 86-yard touchdown play.\nOn a clear day Peyton Manning can pass forever.\nIf I don\u2019t play that well or don\u2019t pass my physical next spring, this could be it.\u201dManning is in the third year.\nManning threw for a mile high and a personal all-time high 479 yards with 31 completions.\nAfter the game, Manning was his normal humble self."}
