The war on poverty is a flop after 50 years and $13 trillion spent. The Obama administration won\u2019t even fight the war against drugs, even though drug abuse is a major cause of unemployment and unemployability.\n\nBut we\u2019ve won the war against pollution and now should be preserving the peace to maintain those benefits. Instead of celebrating success, environmental extremists insist on redefining the goals so that now we spend far more to accomplish far less. They rarely even utter the word \u201cpollution,\u201d instead substituting \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d as supposed environmental threats.\n\nSEE ALSO: EPA \u2018burning the Constitution\u2019 with carbon rules, Harvard scholar says\n\nNews media also ignore the victories, even though the Environmental Protection Agency brags about them on its website, with everything except a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner. For example, the agency concludes that we\u2019ve had \u201cdramatic improvements in the quality of the air that we breathe,\u201d including:\n\n\u2022 A decrease in the six major air pollutants by an average of 72 percent from 1970 to 2012.\n\n\u2022 A 91 percent improvement for lead pollution, 83 percent for carbon monoxide, 78 percent for sulfur dioxide, 55 percent for nitrogen dioxide and 25 percent for ozone between 1980 and 2012.\n\nSEE ALSO: Over public opposition, EPA to extend Clean Water Act to ponds, ditches\n\n\u2022 Levels of airborne fine particles improved 37 percent and coarse particles 27 percent between 2000 and 2012.\n\n\u2022 All 41 areas that had unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide in 1991 now meet the national health standard.\n\nThese and similar accomplishments on water and soil contamination require vigilance. Nor can EPA take all the credit, especially with its often ham-handed methods. Public and business attitudes have led to many voluntary improvements.\n\nBut bureaucracies and their regulations have a natural tendency to expand. \u201cMission creep\u201d is too gentle a term for EPA\u2019s new goals such as curbing carbon dioxide. Compared to what\u2019s already been accomplished, these new goals would provide only tiny benefits, at exorbitant expense. They would wreak havoc on the economy in general and household budgets in particular.\n\nAdvocates talk about regulating carbon but don\u2019t mention dioxide, so that people will think we\u2019re talking about dirty black soot in the air instead of the clear odorless gas that every animal exhales and every plant inhales to make oxygen.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s own analysis finds that the agency\u2019s new carbon dioxide regulation will raise electric rates by 6 percent to 24 percent by the year 2020. And by 2030, even as the U.S. population grows by 54 million, America\u2019s ability to produce electricity will drop by 9 percent, from a baseline of 1,095 gigawatts to only 994 gigawatts. This is because a fifth of coal-powered generating plants will be forced to close. Get set for hard times and lots of brownouts and blackouts.\n\nThis new regulation is so massive that the EPA in a court brief estimated full implementation would need \u201c230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required,\u201d at a cost of an extra $21 billion per year. Their plan to phase in the regulation is only delaying that extra horror.\n\nIt\u2019s not just air quality. Similar problems are expected as the EPA prepares to claim jurisdiction over even temporary stands of water.\n\nWhen the EPA was created in 1970 it was common to regulate how many \u201cparts per thousand\u201d of a pollutant were in the air or water. Today, EPA requires measuring \u201cparts per quadrillion\u201d in some instances. The one-in-a-quadrillion standard is literally and mathematically one trillion times more restrictive than one in a thousand.\n\nRequiring total purity is too much. Just because you can measure parts per billion, or per trillion, or per quadrillion does not make those quantities significant. Even the ads for Ivory Soap only claimed 99.44 percent purity \u2014 or 56 impurities per 10,000 parts.\n\nWe\u2019re beyond the point of diminishing benefits with EPA and into the realm of actual harm when federal bureaucrats demand absurd levels of purity. Government asks us to be perfect but it excuses itself.\n\nThe official federal goal is to improve its rate of wrongful payments so that \u201conly\u201d 3 percent of them are in error. Medicare reports a 10 percent error rate, which is $36 billion a year. On the earned income tax credit, it\u2019s 24 percent, which is $14.5 billion. Food stamps errors are \u201conly\u201d at 3.4 percent, but that\u2019s still $2.6 billion annually.\n\nWhen Uncle Sam can come close to what the EPA requires of everybody else, then let\u2019s talk. In the meantime, let\u2019s celebrate our hard-won victories over pollution but not pollute our economy with draconian new regulations.\n\n\u2022 Former Oklahoma Congressman Ernest Istook is president of Americans for Less Regulation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why does the Left keep expanding a war that America has already won?", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Why does the Left keep expanding a war that America has already won?", "title": "ERNEST ISTOOK: In war on pollution, EPA can\u2019t admit we\u2019re winning", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/1/ernest-istook-in-war-on-pollution-epa-cant-admit-w/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/15/d6423801592ccd245f0f6a70670047ab.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/15/d6423801592ccd245f0f6a70670047ab.jpg", "description": "Why does the Left keep expanding a war that America has already won?", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "ERNEST ISTOOK: In war on pollution, EPA can\u2019t admit we\u2019re"}, "Author": "Ernest Istook", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Environmental Protection Agency"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2917\"", "article_summary": "The EPA\u2019s own analysis finds that the agency\u2019s new carbon dioxide regulation will raise electric rates by 6 percent to 24 percent by the year 2020.\n\u201cMission creep\u201d is too gentle a term for EPA\u2019s new goals such as curbing carbon dioxide.\nBut we\u2019ve won the war against pollution and now should be preserving the peace to maintain those benefits.\nThey rarely even utter the word \u201cpollution,\u201d instead substituting \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d as supposed environmental threats.\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s celebrate our hard-won victories over pollution but not pollute our economy with draconian new regulations."}
