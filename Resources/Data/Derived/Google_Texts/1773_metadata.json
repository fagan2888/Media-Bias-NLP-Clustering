But that won't necessarily make them think twice about buying it.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration last week announced new rules requiring fast food chains, vending machine companies and other restaurants with more than 20 locations to list the number of calories in each of their menu items. The regulations, which came out of a provision of Obamacare, aim to help diners make \u201cinformed choices for themselves and their families,\u201d FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg wrote in a press release.\n\nBut extra information may not translate into healthier choices, experts say. With a few exceptions, \u201cthe overwhelming majority of the research\u201d finds that diners don\u2019t eat less when restaurants post the number of calories in their meals, according to David Just, a Cornell professor who has researched how portion labeling influences food choice.\n\nPeople who make dining decisions based on calorie counts already have a pretty good sense of how many calories are in a Big Mac or burrito, Just noted. And most diners who head to a restaurant chain go for a specific item and rarely look at the menu anyway, said Maeve Webster, a senior director at DataSsential, a company that studies food trends. If customers don't look at the menu, they won't see how many calories are in that serving of french fries.\n\n\"It will be a very rare case where a restaurant will full-on lose customers by putting calorie counts up there,\u201d Webster said.\n\nThis July 18, 2008, file photo shows a McDonald's drive-thru menu in New York, printed with calorie counts for each food item.\n\nProbably the biggest reason why adding calorie counts doesn't typically change diners' behavior is that many people \u201chave virtually no understanding\u201d of how many calories they should be eating or even what constitutes a healthy meal, Webster said. For some, calorie counts are just \u201cwhite noise\u201d on an already crowded menu, she said.\n\nIn some cases, listing the calories on the menu may even trick diners into thinking that unhealthy items are normal, Webster said. For example, if people see a 2,000-calorie burger at a variety of different restaurants, they could begin to think that a burger should have 2,000 calories. For some perspective, an average quarter-pound cheeseburger with ketchup on a bun has about 400 calories, according to FitDay, an online dietary and weight loss journal.\n\nThe FDA rules do offer some help for diners trying to make sense of calorie counts, by requiring that eateries post a statement that says: \u201c2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary.\u201d\n\nPosting calorie counts may even push some people to eat more food rather than less, Webster suggested. Some people might think that higher calorie counts mean they're getting more for their money, just as they do with bigger portion sizes.\n\nA 2012 study on the impacts of New York City\u2019s 2008 requirement to post calorie counts found that McDonald\u2019s customers slightly increased their calorie intake after the rules took effect.\n\nIt\u2019s also not uncommon for restaurants to add a super-high-calorie item to the menu to make a slightly less-heavy meal look healthier to customers, Just said. He added that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see restaurants try this tactic as the calorie count rules go into place.\n\nSome research does show that restaurants make their dishes healthier in response to requirements to post calories. And most of the research on the impacts of calorie counts has focused on short-term results and fast food chains, according to Brian Elbel, a professor at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service who studies how people make decisions that influence their health. We still don't really know much about what the long-term effects of the policy might be, or how the rules might affect fancier establishments, he said.\n\nElbel\u2019s own research on the topic has found that fast food diners take note of calorie information when restaurants post it, but don't change the number of calories they eat or the number of times they visit the restaurants.\n\nBut research focused on fast food may not be a reliable predictor of how calorie counts affect behavior in other contexts, Elbel said. That\u2019s because people typically don\u2019t head to fast food restaurants with the intention of ordering something healthy. They're looking for something that\u2019s cheap and quick.\n\nHealth may be more of a priority when ordering at sit-down chains, which are included in the FDA\u2019s rules, Elbel said. There, seeing the calorie difference between a steak and fish dish could influence a diner\u2019s order, especially given that meals at sit-down chains probably have more calories than most diners think.\n\n\u201cThey might have a lot more sticker shock from these places,\u201d Elbel said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans will soon know just how many calories are in that fast food burger they're about to buy.
