CC BY 2.0\n\n\u201cWhat a psycho.\u201d This could be referring to your crazy, deceptive ex-boyfriend (who is in reality a sociopath), the cat lady next door who does some strange things (who really just has dementia), or someone who has actually been diagnosed with a form of psychosis. Many people also use the word to describe a serial killer who has committed some heinous crime.\n\nMental illness and personality disorders consist of an array of complex, hard-to-pin-down disorders that are often confused \u2014 but avoiding misdiagnosis is crucial in properly treating them. With all the \u201cpsycho\u201d in psychosis, psychotic, and psychopathy, it\u2019s often easy to get them all muddled. In reality, psychotic and psychopathic are two separate, distinct disorders \u2014 and labelling everyone who falls under these categories as a \u201cpsycho\u201d is certainly a faux pas.\n\nThe root word, \u201cpsych\u201d or \u201cpsycho\u201d is actually derived from the Greek word for mind, soul, spirit, or sense of living, breathing being. It\u2019s interesting, then, that now among English speakers, the word \u201cpsycho\u201d has such a negative connotation. The Alfred Hitchcock movie, Psycho, certainly colored the word with the feeling that it implies someone we should be afraid of \u2014 someone who is out of control emotionally or mentally. Indeed, both psychopaths and psychotic people might pose danger at times, though at completely different levels.\n\nPsychosis\n\nPsychosis is a general umbrella term for a wide variety of disorders. Also referred to as psychotic disorders or psychoses, these disorders typically involve losing touch with reality, manifested by delusions and hallucinations. Delusional thinking often occurs in psychotic people; this consists of believing that people are out to harm you or are plotting against you. Hallucinations (which occur in schizophrenia, for example) are also a symptom of some form of psychosis, and they involve hearing or seeing things that aren\u2019t there.\n\nSchizophrenia \u2014 along with brief psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, and others \u2014 is considered a form of psychotic disorder. People with bipolar disorder, depression, or other mental illnesses can often show psychotic symptoms (in the DSM-5, bipolar disorder is actually listed as a bridge between psychotic disorders and depressive disorders). But as with many mental illnesses, psychosis can often be a fluid category and definition, with aspects of it manifested in people who are psychopathic, sociopathic, bipolar, or depressed.\n\nBut here\u2019s the major differentiating point between psychosis and psychopathy: People with psychosis aren\u2019t necessarily crazy or immoral serial killers. Psychotic individuals suffer from serious mental disorders that require proper care and treatment, and anti-psychotic medications as well as cognitive behavioral therapy can help mitigate these effects. Psychosis isn\u2019t someone\u2019s fault, and neither does it mean the person lacks a soul or empathy. Instead, it is a mental illness that shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized, just like any other form of physical or mental illness.\n\n\u201c[T]here are a lot of inaccurate perceptions of psychotic people as immoral people,\u201d Scott Barry Kaufman, scientific director of the Imagination Institute in the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, writes on Psychology Today. \u201cThis is simply not true. While some bad people such as serial killers have psychotic episodes\u2026 the vast majority of psychotic individuals are not immoral. In fact, many people who are psychosis-prone contribute positively to society.\u201d\n\nPsychopathy\n\nPsychopathy, meanwhile, is generally the term that encompasses people who commit crimes and have no empathy for other humans or animals. Psychopaths begin exhibiting these qualities at a very young age; they have destructive impulses, such as hurting animals or bullying other kids, and they show no remorse, empathy, or sensitivity.\n\n\u201cPsychopathic refers to someone without a conscience, who exists on a spectrum from your con man (self-involved, uses others for own benefit, not prone to violence) to the serial killer (predatory, gets aroused by hurting people physically causing suffering),\u201d Dr. Paul Puri, a psychiatrist and blogger, writes. \u201cPsychopaths are scary because they seemingly have no limits to what they might do, including hurting others, just for their own benefit or enjoyment.\u201d\n\nPsychopaths also are generally considered intelligent, manipulative, and charming \u2014 as well as having an inability to learn from mistakes or punishment.\n\nIn addition, there seems to be confusion between differentiating psychopathy with sociopathy. There is a difference between the two, however; sociopaths are considered products of their environment or upbringing, while psychopaths are believed to have genetic or biological causes behind their character. Both psychopathy and sociopathy are considered forms of antisocial personality disorder in the DSM-5.\n\nWhile people with psychosis can generally be treated with proper medication and therapy, it\u2019s difficult to say whether psychopaths can be treated. In fact, most doctors and psychiatrists believe that psychopathy is an untreatable condition, and the only way to stop many such people from harming others is to put them behind bars. But others believe that early intervention is key: When kids begin showing psychopathic signs at a young age, persistent intervention from parents and teachers can hopefully make a difference in the long run.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "psychotic, psychosis, psychopathy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\u201cPsycho\u201d is a complicated term that shouldn\u2019t be used to label everyone with a mental illness.", "title": "What It Really Means To Be Psychotic, According To Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-it-really-means-be-psychotic-difference-between-psychosis-and-psychopathy-338712", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/17/shining.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cPsycho\u201d is a complicated term that shouldn\u2019t be used to label everyone with a mental illness.", "title": "What It Really Means To Be Psychotic, According To Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-it-really-means-be-psychotic-difference-between-psychosis-and-psychopathy-338712", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/17/shining.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/17/shining.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-06-18T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T13:45:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\u201cPsycho\u201d is a complicated term that shouldn\u2019t be used to label everyone with a mental illness."}, "article_summary": "Schizophrenia \u2014 along with brief psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, and others \u2014 is considered a form of psychotic disorder.\nBut here\u2019s the major differentiating point between psychosis and psychopathy: People with psychosis aren\u2019t necessarily crazy or immoral serial killers.\nWith all the \u201cpsycho\u201d in psychosis, psychotic, and psychopathy, it\u2019s often easy to get them all muddled.\nIt\u2019s interesting, then, that now among English speakers, the word \u201cpsycho\u201d has such a negative connotation.\nAlso referred to as psychotic disorders or psychoses, these disorders typically involve losing touch with reality, manifested by delusions and hallucinations."}
