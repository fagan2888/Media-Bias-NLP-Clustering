Rice responded multiple times that the timing of strikes would not be released, but that was not the question at hand, and reporters pressed her on whether her boss had authorized strikes. This she could not answer. Did she not know? Or had he not bothered to sign the authorization? Or did she get her information from Valerie Jarrett and not know the details? We don\u2019t know because she ran away. See for yourself via Breitbart.\n\nThe National Security Advisor of the United States did something astonishing yesterday.

The National Security Advisor is the one person in a White House who is required to have nerves of steel, the person who places the 3 AM phone call waking up the president in a time of crisis, the person who is expected to have options and plans available for the the POTUS. The person who takes the measure of the enemy and explains to the nation\u2019s chief executive the risks and the possibilities in a situation of extreme peril.\n\nPonder this for a moment.
