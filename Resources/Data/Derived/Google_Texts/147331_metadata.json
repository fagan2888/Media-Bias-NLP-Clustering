These \u201cAccountable Care Organizations\u201d would get bonuses if they were able to keep costs below what traditional Medicare would have spent.\n\nThat was the idea, anyway.\n\nBut it turns out that almost half the 353 ACOs in the program last year spent more on seniors than would have been the case had they stayed in regular old Medicare, Kaiser reports. Oregon\u2019s North Bend Medical Center, for example, spent 12% more than expected, and then dropped out of the ACO program this year.\n\nThen, after paying out bonuses to those ACOs that did save money, the program ended up adding a total of $3 million to Medicare costs. That\u2019s not much in a program with a $500+ billion annual budget, but ACOs were supposed to cut Medicare spending by $320 million last year, and by almost $5 billion through 2019.\n\nSo, naturally, the Obama administration is expanding the program, with a goal of having half of Medicare spending running through one of these ACOs.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the few efforts to bring down health costs in ObamaCare actually caused federal spending to climb last year, according to a report in Kaiser Health News,", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "One of the few efforts to bring down health costs in ObamaCare actually caused federal spending to climb last year, according to a report in Kaiser Health News, adding to the pile of ObamaCare&#821\u2026", "title": "ObamaCare\u2019s Big Cost-Saving Idea Isn\u2019t Working", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/accountable-care-organizations-fail-to-save-money/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-09-14 16:04:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-14T16:04:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The idea was to encourage doctors and hospitals to coordinate care with an eye on keeping patients healthier and lowering spending.\nOne of the few efforts to bring down health costs in ObamaCare actually caused federal spending to climb last year, according to a report in Kaiser Health News, adding to the pile of ObamaCare\u2019s failed promises.\nSo, naturally, the Obama administration is expanding the program, with a goal of having half of Medicare spending running through one of these ACOs.\nThen, after paying out bonuses to those ACOs that did save money, the program ended up adding a total of $3 million to Medicare costs.\nThese \u201cAccountable Care Organizations\u201d would get bonuses if they were able to keep costs below what traditional Medicare would have spent."}
