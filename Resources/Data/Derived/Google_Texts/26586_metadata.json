His mother Robyn was forced to return to work full-time as a pharmacist.\n\nHis younger sister Tania, the second oldest of four children, took over many of the domestic duties at their East Keilor home. She was 12 or 13.\n\nAs Poynton puts it, she became the family \u201cbrick\u201d. The \u201ccomfort and the confidante and the mum\u201d.\n\n\u201cExactly as you see now,\u201d he says of his sister, now known as the wife of James Hird. \u201cWe thrived in adversity.\u201d\n\nYet this glowing reference, according to Poynton, understates her qualities. For one, his sister may have been a better dancer than he was. Forget the disco lights and adoring fans of TV studios. She was the real star.\n\nShe played the violin and the piano, and is qualified to teach both. Tania was a champion swimmer and wielded a sharp mind; the oft-repeated story goes that she topped both the law and commerce faculties at Melbourne University.\n\nThe quality most obvious in recent days, to both her loved ones and her critics, is her unerring penchant for saying what she thinks.\n\nNone of this \u201cmoving forward\u201d corporate jargon, either, the patter trotted out by the heavies who labelled her defence of her husband last week a \u201cdistraction\u201d.\n\nHird has had something they have not. Armed with bottled outrage, she has seemed answerable to no one but her better judgment.\n\nAs crafted as she has always been on the Brownlow Medal red carpet since the 1990s (typically elegant in J\u2019Aton), Tania Hird has been unshackled.\n\nYet it has been a polarising approach. She won\u2019t be \u201cbullied\u201d, she has said, but casting her family as \u201cvictims\u201d, suggests one acquaintance, is problematic, given the tiresome history of the Essendon supplements saga.\n\nThere are also the optics: the doorstop press conferences in the Toorak driveway, talk of their children doing a school term in a European school while her husband, in essence, is paid a lot of money to take a year off for doing the wrong thing.\n\nThe timing before Essendon\u2019s first-round game has roused heavy criticism. As her comments raised queries about her \u201cscapegoat\u201d husband\u2019s tenure at the club, James Hird was said to be en route to France to begin an elite business course paid for, in part, by Essendon.\n\nGold Coast Suns coach Guy McKenna was frank \u2014 Tania Hird should have stayed silent. AFL commissioner Bill Kelty said the saga was about player welfare, not the politicking of James Hird or the AFL executive.\n\nEssendon president Paul Little on Friday said James Hird needed to \u201ccontrol\u201d those around him. Little wondered what the coach knew of Tania\u2019s comments and what motivated them.\n\nPoynton can offer Little some answers, at least. He says the Hirds are \u201cuncompromising people\u201d of \u201cunwavering morals\u201d. He says they have been compelled to keep quiet while people \u201cshoot off at the mouth\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis whole conundrum has shaken their world,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have let them down.\u201d\n\nONLINE surveys are hardly the stuff of empirical measure, but they do gauge the mood: more than three in four Herald Sun readers, after Tania Hird\u2019s interview, felt her husband should be sacked by Essendon.\n\nOne person who knows her says \u201cshe wears the pants\u201d in the relationship; another, describing the same dynamic, admires how she is so \u201cfiercely protective of her brood\u201d. One Essendon insider who knows them both well has little doubt that James Hird would have had intimate knowledge beforehand of his wife\u2019s intention to speak out.\n\nHird\u2019s reliance on his wife for advice is no secret; indeed, he has spoken of it as the great strength: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t tell me how to play footy, she never has, but for moral and all sorts of support, she\u2019s been the one.\u201d\n\nHird herself spoke of frustration with recent penalties, a gag placed on her husband after he was found to have brought the game into disrepute. A source tells the Sunday Herald Sun that her children have been abused in the street. There was anger in the process of Hird\u2019s suspension last August.\n\nTania sat in at AFL Commission hearings and, according to one report, angrily confronted the AFL\u2019s Gillon McLachlan, a former fellow law student at Melbourne University.\n\nPlainly, the Hirds, who brought along a QC best known for his human rights advocacy, felt they were denied natural justice.\n\nLast December, Tania Hird told the Herald Sun her husband was being paid by Essendon while he was suspended.\n\nShe chose to introduce the bombshell to the public arena. AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou looked out of touch when he (mistakenly) declared in response that Hird was not being paid.\n\nOne whisper goes that Tania was incensed by platitudes heaped on Demetriou after he announced several weeks ago that he would stand down as AFL chief executive at the end of the season.\n\nYet perhaps the biggest surprise about the fallout from the Tania Hird interview on the ABC last Thursday night, at least for those who know her, is that anyone was at all surprised she gave the interview.\n\nShe has always stood up for herself. It\u2019s the sort of self-assuredness that sounds open to interpretation.\n\nPoynton calls it a product of being \u201csolid stock\u201d. Someone else who knows her well calls it a \u201cself-centredness\u201d that distorts her ability to see how the world perceives her and her family.\n\nHer confidence was evident, says one source, when she turned up in polka dot bikinis at a surf club many years ago. Or as a corporate lawyer in her 20s. Or the time she first met her future husband.\n\nShe was working, according to Poynton, at the Grand Hotel in Essendon, behind the bar or as a waitress. It was one night after footy training. Hird was just a skinny kid; the lifelong adulation of his silk and grit came later.\n\nNo one had heard of him when he encountered the pretty blonde. He asked her out. She said no.\n\nDECADES and four kids on, as a couple both hailed and derided as \u201cTeam Hird\u201d, Poynton draws parallels between the teenage kid who cooked and cleaned at home and the woman who followed her criticisms of the AFL last week with another flurry the following day.\n\nHe says the thinking remains the same. It does not go: why are we in this situation? Instead, it is: how do we fix this situation?\n\nPoynton knows the wider Hird family.\n\n\u201cThere is a commonality through both our families,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been brought up from the cradle to stand up for ourselves. People being able to say basically whatever they like and not really having the right of reply has been so difficult. It\u2019s been hard for them (James and Tania) and it\u2019s been hard for the extended family as well.\u201d\n\nFabled spin doctor Ian Hanke has worked for the Hirds. He argues that Tania Hird had always been told she could tell her story. The problem was that the right time for the club, or for the good of the game, never seemed to eventuate.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that at some time or another she felt the need to tell her story because she is protective,\u201d he surmises. \u201cShe felt there had been egregious damage done to her family and I can understand it because she cares for them so much.\u201d\n\nA source familiar with the inner workings of Essendon football club, as well as the Hirds, believes that both parties have suffered from tunnel vision.\n\nBoth camps have argued the finer points at the expense of the bigger picture. Neither camp, the source says, has grasped the risks to players. Both camps have been dazzled by \u201cbelief in their brand\u201d.\n\nAs for Tania Hird\u2019s tip-off claim about Demetriou that bumped the search for MH370 from newspaper front pages?\n\n\u201cIn reality, that phone call has nothing to do with anything,\u201d the source points out. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change whether Essendon took substances or not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GREG Poynton was having fun.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "HeraldSun", "description": "GREG Poynton was having fun.", "title": "The real Tania Hird revealed", "url": "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/the-real-tania-hird-revealed/story-fni0fit3-1226862146474", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/03/22/1226862/142396-078c8a6e-b19b-11e3-8ffb-bdc84c71056c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/03/22/1226862/142396-078c8a6e-b19b-11e3-8ffb-bdc84c71056c.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@theheraldsun", "id": "@theheraldsun"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135469303148773}, "articleid": 1226862146474, "keywords": "real star, adoring fans, unerring penchant, commerce faculties, Bill Kelty, domestic duties, glowing reference, champion swimmer, red carpet, bottled outrage, oft-repeated story, disco lights, elite business course, Fabled spin doctor, fellow law student, supplements saga, human rights advocacy, tunnel vision, footy training, source familiar, football club, player welfare, school term, inner workings, ,,,France, Australian Football League Commission, ,Essendon,Victoria,Australia, Grand Hotel AS, Melbourne University, Gold Coast Suns, Australian Football League, Ian Hanke, Guy McKenna, Andrew Demetriou, Paul Little, Dannii Minogue, Robyn, James Hird, Gillon McLachlan, Kevin Sheedy, Poynton, Joey Perrone, Patrick Carlyon, corporate jargon, chief executive", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Mon Mar 24 07:21:46 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Mon Mar 24 07:21:46 EST 2014", "author": "Patrick Carlyon"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2ba\"", "article_summary": "VideoImage Tania Hird slams AFL over suspension 0:38 Play video Tania Hird has blasted the AFL over the Essendon supplements scandal, saying her husband is a scapegoat.\nAs crafted as she has always been on the Brownlow Medal red carpet since the 1990s (typically elegant in J\u2019Aton), Tania Hird has been unshackled.\nGold Coast Suns coach Guy McKenna was frank \u2014 Tania Hird should have stayed silent.\nHe argues that Tania Hird had always been told she could tell her story.\n\u201cExactly as you see now,\u201d he says of his sister, now known as the wife of James Hird."}
