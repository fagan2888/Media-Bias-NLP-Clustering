A quandry for conflicted progressives\n\nA year ago, former Secretary of State and New York Senator Hillary Clinton was considered a shoo-in for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination. After narrowly losing the nomination to then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton had a clear path to the presidency in 2016. She was popular, having already enjoyed a stay in the white house as First Lady and earned the respect and admiration of women, minorities, and moderates across the country. Had Obama not run eight years ago, Clinton, the early frontrunner and the winner of the popular vote in the Democratic primary, might have put together a record-breaking campaign the likes of the eventual nominee. With little viable competition within her party this time around, Clinton finally had the chance to become the Democratic nominee and the country\u2019s long-awaited first female president.\n\nSo, when little-known Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent of more than 35 years, announced his candidacy for the Democrats\u2019 presidential nomination on April 30, 2015, the media and the general public paid him little attention. How could Sanders, a 73-year old, second-term Senator from a tiny, white, northeastern state (the country\u2019s second-least populous) and a self-professed democratic socialist present a challenge to the most popular and accomplished female politician in the history of the United States?\n\nSanders trailed Clinton by fifty points or more in critical election states and across the country well into the summer. But as the campaign trail stretched on, cracks began to form in Clinton\u2019s seemingly impenetrable foundation. Sanders\u2019 rallies drew larger and larger crowds, breaking records left and right; Clinton, already the subject of an unending e-mail scandal and potshots from the entire Republican party, saw her public image \u2014 and poll numbers \u2014 suffer.\n\nSanders brought his dramatic, issue-oriented rhetoric to the party\u2019s first debate in October and spared no one, calling out the big-money interests he vowed to take a stand against when his campaign began. Sanders firmly established himself as a legitimate competitor to Clinton when he defended her from a question about the e-mail scandal, calling for the public and the media to focus on more substantive subjects. He had a propensity for sound bites like Donald Trump, but with the ideological substance of Clinton.\n\nWhat was once one candidate\u2019s cakewalk became a close two-horse race. They practically tied in Iowa for the first delegates of the Democratic primary, and Sanders trounced Clinton in New Hampshire. With the two candidates now essentially on an even ground heading into the Super Tuesday (March 1) primaries in fifteen states and territories (including Arkansas), many progressives are undecided between the two.\n\nClinton has been noticeably pulled to the left by Sanders\u2019 unexpected competition. To an untrained eye, their views have become practically indistinguishable; Clinton, once a moderate (to which she \u201cplead guilty\u201d in 2014), has warmed to many of the ideas Sanders has championed in his campaign, including a tax on high-frequency trading on Wall Street and the overturn of Citizens United. Clinton is favored by older voters and minorities; Sanders has a large advantage among college-age students and independents. It\u2019s their slight (but numerable) differences that divide Democratic voters across the country. Here is an overview of the candidates\u2019 key differences:\n\nCAMPAIGN FINANCE\n\nHillary Clinton accepts donations from large organizations and financial institutions and their members. Roughly a third of the $188 million Clinton has raised has come from PACs (political action committees) and SuperPACs. This has been a key talking point for Sanders, who paints this as a sign that Clinton operates under the influence of big-money interests.\n\nSanders is the only presidential candidate who does not receive PAC funding; the vast majority of his funding comes through individual donations averaging about $27. Sanders does, however, receive support from various unions.\n\nBoth support the overturn of Citizens United vs. FEC, a 2010 landmark case which ruled that limits to campaign contributions from nonprofits are unconstitutional. Sanders has stated that he plans to use that position on the case as a litmus test for any potential Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThis category is a clear advantage for Sanders, who credits the success of his campaign to a large volume of small individual donations \u2014 a \u201cgrassroots movement\u201d.\n\nWALL STREET\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign is centered around \u201ctaking on Wall Street\u201d. He claims that a wide range of problems arise from and contribute to economic disparity, including racial tension and international terrorism. He plans to fund his proposed social programs through a 1% tax on Wall Street speculation, which is essentially a tax on high-frequency trading. Sanders has repeatedly expressed distaste for Wall Street\u2019s influence on politics, stating that \u201cCongress does not regulate Wall Street; Wall Street regulates Congress\u201d.\n\nClinton\u2019s position is similar; she plans to better enforce the Dodd-Frank act, a law enacted after the recession in 2010 to regulate the financial sector, protect consumers from abusive financial practices, and prevent another fiscal collapse.\n\nSanders supports the revival of the Glass-Steagall act, a law passed after the Great Depression to separate commercial and investment banking (or \u201cbreak up the banks\u201d) that was repealed in 1999. Clinton does not support Glass-Steagall legislation, citing the dangers of breaking up large banks and denying that the law\u2019s repeal contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nTHE MINIMUM WAGE\n\nBoth support raising the minimum wage. Sanders calls for raising the federal minimum wage to a living wage of $15.00 an hour. Clinton wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 and adjust it yearly alongside inflation, encouraging states to go above the federal minimum should a high cost-of-living require it.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nSanders calls for free tuition at public universities, a measure he plans to fund through his Wall Street speculation tax. Accounting for a 50% decrease in trading volume, that tax is projected to bring in $300 billion annually; free public tuition would cost around $75 billion a year.\n\nClinton supports free community college tuition, but not free public university tuition. She plans to give states additional Pell grant funding, and supports free pre-K education.\n\nBoth aim to lower student loan interest rates and end federal profit from student loans. These practices have contributed to skyrocketing tuition costs at universities across the country.\n\nHEALTHCARE\n\nThis category is the definitive divide between the two candidates.\n\nSanders champions health care as a fundamental human right and supports a single-payer (or universal) health care system similar to those in Canada and the UK. This would essentially end private healthcare and insurance, replacing it with a \u201cMedicaid for all\u201d system that covers everyone, regardless of income level. He anticipates a tax increase of about $500 a year for middle-class families, but that cost is accompanied by the elimination of private health care costs, saving the average family about $5,000.\n\nClinton supported a single-payer system in 2008 (chastising fellow Democrats for fighting each other on the issue), but has recently instead advocated the protection and continuation of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. The ACA has drastically decreased the number of uninsured Americans but has faced unprecedented opposition from a Republican-controlled Congress determined to repeal it. The act preserves private options for individuals who can afford them, but has increased costs for some middle-class families and crucially leaves many in the \u201cMedicaid gap\u201d: too poor to afford private insurance, but too wealthy to qualify for government assistance.\n\nClinton frequently attacks Sanders on the issue, claiming that his preference for a single-payer system reflects a desire to abandon what has for the most part been a successful policy. Sanders\u2019 criticisms of the President \u2014 including his call for someone to primary Obama in the 2012 election \u2014 has frequently been mentioned by Clinton as an opposition to the party\u2019s values.\n\nFOREIGN POLICY\n\nClinton\u2019s years as Secretary of State provide her a large advantage in foreign policy. She has spoken on international issues with remarkable depth and detail in debates. Though Sanders has some experience in foreign policy as a Senator, there is little question that Clinton is a seasoned veteran in dealing with other countries and has the know-how necessary to fulfill the President\u2019s role as commander-in-chief.\n\nIn terms of actual policy, the two candidates lie on opposite sides of a moral spectrum. Sanders fundamentally opposes nearly all foreign intervention and warns of the dangers of regime change in turbulent dictatorships in the Middle East, pointing to the chaos that ensued in the region following previous attempts to overthrow corrupt and abusive governments. He voted against the war in Iraq as a Representative in 2002.\n\nClinton more closely resembles the prototypical American approach to foreign policy, advocating for military intervention in unstable foreign countries if it might lead to democracy.\n\nSanders opposes free trade agreements like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and blames many domestic problems \u2014 outsourcing, unemployment, wealth disparity \u2014 on permissive trade deals. Clinton supported the TPP during its formative years (once calling it the \u201cgold standard\u201d) but now opposes it.\n\nPRIVACY & SURVEILLANCE\n\nSanders opposes government surveillance on American citizens and was one of 66 Congressmen to vote against the Patriot Act in 2001. Clinton rarely discusses the issue, but voted for the Patriot Act (and, later, its renewal) as a New York Senator.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY\n\nClinton wants to protect and preserve Social Security in its current state. Sanders wants to expand the program by lifting the cap on taxable income above $250,000.\n\nCONSISTENCY\n\nSanders is staunchly liberal and has been for the entirety of his political career. He has fought for marriage equality, Wall Street regulation, single-payer healthcare, and free college tuition, among other issues, since his days as a student at the University of Chicago in the 1960\u2019s.\n\nClinton, like her husband, is a more moderate Democrat, and has evolved to her current progressive stance over time. She ran as a conservative alternative to then-Senator Obama in 2008, opposing marriage equality, gun control, and drivers licenses for illegal immigrants. While she holds that her positions are rooted in liberal values, it is fair to wonder if Clinton would fight for the same positions as President as she has so far in the primary.\n\nPROGRESSIVISM, PRACTICALITY, AND ELECTABILITY\n\nThe healthcare debate is a microcosm of a more far-reaching disparity between the two. Both have progressive goals, but each represents a different approach to reaching them. Sanders is a democratic socialist committed to quick, dramatic change; Clinton is a progressive who \u201clikes to get things done\u201d and is willing to compromise with a conservative legislative body. What\u2019s more conducive to success \u2014 deep-willed determination or a willingness to collaborate?\n\nThe productivity of a hypothetical President Clinton or President Sanders is a more complex subject than what meets the eye. Either is sure to face opposition from a Republican-majority Congress whose specialty is an utter lack of progress. Clinton, who is ostensibly more open to working with legislators, is the easy answer. She touts her productivity as a Senator in every context and points to her opponent\u2019s socialist background as a sign that Congress will impede any progress toward his (very liberal) goals.\n\nHistory paints a different picture in some respects. In the case of a few landmark progressive movements of the past century, quick, dramatic change proved more effective than compromise (often after quite a lot of compromise was attempted). It took a \u201cradical\u201d liberal voice to earn women and African-Americans the right to vote, to pass sweeping financial reform and a host of social programs after the Great Depression, to integrate black students into segregated southern schools, to create Medicaid and Medicare, and to achieve marriage equality. Compromise is ultimately necessary in any legislation, but might truly progressive goals become more easily attainable if the progressive fighting for them starts the bargaining from a little farther to the left?\n\nRegardless, a Congress in its current divided, gridlocked, obstructionist state is bound to prevent either hypothetical President from accomplishing anything. Sanders is well-liked among his fellow Congressmen but would represent a significant and unprecedented shift to the left for American politics. Clinton is among the most influential and accomplished women in the world, but recent controversies have placed her in rare territory: she is currently more widely hated and distrusted (whether that hate and distrust is justified or not) than any figure in American politics.\n\nEach presents troubling ideological and practical obstacles. So which is more electable? Which provides a better opportunity for the Democratic Party to maintain control of the White House? Which is better suited to take on the practically indestructible Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee?\n\nSanders, at 74, would be the oldest President ever elected, but is in good health. His voter base consists primarily of white, college-age liberals, but he has another key demographic in his corner: independents. Sanders is the longest-serving independent in Congressional history, and his relatively loose ties to the Democratic party and ideological uniqueness may appear an attractive option for moderates, those disillusioned by the political process, and those fundamentally opposed to voting for the tactless Trump, the reckless Cruz, or the puppet-like Rubio.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, is far more popular with older voters (who vote far more often than younger ones) and minorities. She has proven that in nearly every primary thus far; Clinton has defeated Sanders handily in the more racially diverse southern states. The respect she has earned among women and minorities is indisputably a huge advantage. She is younger, she has extensive foreign policy experience, and she is, by most standards, a moderate. But she lacks support from outside her party, a key factor that decides every general election.\n\nIf it sounds like each candidate is qualified but crucially problematic, that\u2019s because the real issues plaguing progressive politics lie well outside the presidency. No truly liberal President can accomplish truly liberal policy if the legislators (s)he must work with are bound and determined to pull the government in the opposite direction. Legislation providing universal health care or limiting the power of Wall Street begins not with the President but with the Senators and Representatives that the people choose to communicate their interests to Washington, D.C. It begins not with Bernie Sanders nor Hillary Clinton, but with state and local elections. It begins with the young, liberal minds who have thus far carried Sanders to the forefront of the Presidential conversation voting to best suit their needs and desires at the local level. It begins with the millennial vote.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://heritagetalon.org/3366/showcase/sanders-or-clinton-a-quandry-for-conflicted-progressives/", "site_name": "The Talon", "image": "http://heritagetalon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/berniehillary-900x568.png", "type": "article", "title": "Sanders or Clinton?
