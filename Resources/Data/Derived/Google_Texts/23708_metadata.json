Rather, it's for the Massachusetts insurance company Fallon Health.\n\nFallon is one of several insurance companies that have crossed over into providing healthcare services. And in a reverse trend, some hospitals are starting to offer insurance. These border crossings are changing both the tone of messages and expanding ad budgets.\n\nThe hospitals offering insurance tend to be smaller, said Ellen Carney, principal analyst of insurance e-business and channel strategy at Forrester Research. Among them is the Steward Health Care System chain of 11 hospitals in Massachusetts, which has a partnership with the Tufts Health Plan. Another is North Shore-LIJ on Long Island, N.Y., which is in partnership with Aetna on an insurance program, Carney says.\n\n\u201cThe healthcare industry is evolving rapidly. It\u2019s moving from a segmented one\u2014where there were providers and there were payers\u2014to one in which single companies are looking to do more, if not everything, involved in healthcare,\u201d said Christine Cassidy, Fallon Health\u2019s chief communications officer. To get the word out about Fallon\u2019s various services, the company launched its latest campaign with four TV ads. Typically, it\u2019s run one or two commercials in the past. And the budget has increased accordingly.\n\nThe trend, which was stimulated by the Affordable Care Act, has spurred a major change in the messages both types of businesses convey. Insurance messages are now much more warm and friendly, whereas some hospital ads are leaning toward a more corporate tone. In both cases, the new sensibility is the exact opposite of what their messages conveyed in the past, observers said.\n\n\u201cInsurance used to be a b-to-b sell: a company offered insurance; you had one carrier,\u201d recalled Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates. Today, consumers can buy their own insurance and be more autonomous. Insurance companies have to engage consumers and brand for the first time, he added.\n\nWith all the change, it's little wonder that ad spend for insurance and health care climbed 50 percent between 2009 ad 2013, according to Kantar Media data. Those figures are cited by Dave Lockwood, group director of strategic planning at Lowe Campbell Ewald, which represents another insurance company that provides health services, Kaiser Permanente. However, he noted that the tracking service\u2019s categories are broadly grouped (hospitals, clinics and medical centers; medical and dental insurance).\n\n\u201cBrands on both sides of the fence are communicating at a higher level, and much more effectively,\u201d Lockwood said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An elderly woman looks around her home fondly as she sings \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home\u201d in an advertising message for a service that helps senior citizens live a happy, healthy life in the place they love best\u2014rather than a nursing home.", "og": {"url": "http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/obamacare-turns-hospitals-insurers-and-insurers-healthcare-providers-156512", "site_name": "AdWeek", "image": {"width": 150, "identifier": "http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/general-thumbnail/news_article/doctor-ipad-hed-2013.jpg", "height": 84}, "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare Turns Hospitals Into Insurers, and Insurers Into Healthcare Providers"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Adweek", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Turns Hospitals Into Insurers, and Insurers Into Healthcare Providers"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-25 12:11:29", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=570229326", "fb": {"admins": 507972634, "pages": 126756847074, "app_id": 329778260413541}, "sailthru.tags": "Advertising & Branding,Affordable Care Act,Healthcare,Obamacare", "keywords": "Advertising & Branding", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Adweek", "section": "Advertising & Branding"}, "viewport": "width=1028"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae6b\"", "article_summary": "Fallon is one of several insurance companies that have crossed over into providing healthcare services.\nInsurance messages are now much more warm and friendly, whereas some hospital ads are leaning toward a more corporate tone.\nAmong them is the Steward Health Care System chain of 11 hospitals in Massachusetts, which has a partnership with the Tufts Health Plan.\nHowever, he noted that the tracking service\u2019s categories are broadly grouped (hospitals, clinics and medical centers; medical and dental insurance).\nInsurance companies have to engage consumers and brand for the first time, he added."}
