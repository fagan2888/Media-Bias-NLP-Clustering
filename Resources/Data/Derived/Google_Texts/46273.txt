GOG Promises Free Videogames for Furloughed Government Workers

Never discount the Internet’s ability to highlight the silly side of serious things, even if only for a marketing gimmick.

Case in point: Today’s promotion from GOG, a.k.a. Good Old Games, a digital store that caters to the nostalgic PC gamer. It’s offering a bundle of games for free to government workers who can prove that they’ve been furloughed (that same bundle is $25 for everyone else).

Five of the games — the most famous of which is probably Alpha Centauri, Sid Meier’s futuristic pseudo-sequel to Civilization — feature politics in some way, which GOG is characterizing as a “quick lesson in civic government.” In a nod to the Obamacare/Affordable Care Act, the bundle also includes a hospital simulator, Theme Hospital.

“Finally, for reasons entirely unrelated to who may or may not have been involved in shutting down the U.S. Government,” GOG wrote in its announcement of the bundle, the games from the Redneck Rampage series are in there, too.

Furloughed workers who want the bundle are asked to email GOG with a picture of themselves holding their furlough letters. The offer ends Friday at midnight ET.
