Instead, we think that they will focus on how \u201cObamacare\u201d encouraged a wave of innovation that gradually tamed the spiraling costs of a dysfunctional system, even as millions of previously excluded Americans gained access to health insurance.\n\nInnovation is probably the least discussed aspect of health-care reform. Yet it is crucial to \u201cbending\u201d the sector\u2019s cost curve, because it enables the delivery of quality health care in cost-effective ways. Obamacare has provided powerful new incentives for such innovation.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2010, US health-care spending grew almost twice as fast as the economy, rising from 9.2% to 17.4% of GDP. While many factors contributed to this surge, most experts agree that the single most important cause was a fee-for-service system that rewarded health-care providers for billing as many services as possible, rather than for keeping people healthy and treating their illnesses efficiently.\n\nThe ACA has been changing that, by establishing myriad new incentives to foster efficiency in health-care delivery \u2013 for example, by reducing costly and unnecessary hospital infections and readmissions, and by adopting electronic health records. Most important, the ACA is providing incentives for the creation of \u201caffordable care organizations,\u201d \u201cbundled payment systems,\u201d and other delivery innovations to encourage better coordination of care, especially for patients with numerous chronic conditions. Such patients are among the 10% who account for an estimated 64% of overall health care costs.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/default/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "When historians look back on US President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care reform, they will not focus on its troubled insurance exchanges or its website's flawed launch.
