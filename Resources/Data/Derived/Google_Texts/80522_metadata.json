Jessie Ulibarri, D-Commerce City. But the legislation died and another year is going by with condo construction stuck in the deep freeze.\n\nBut maybe the city of Lakewood can prod the General Assembly out of indifference.\n\nAs John Aguilar reported in The Denver Post, the Lakewood City Council has taken up a proposed ordinance addressing structural defects in construction that will \u201cgive builders more opportunity to fix problems before litigation begins.\u201d\n\nNo one is suggesting that developers escape liability for construction defects or that homeowners be denied the right to sue. But under the state\u2019s current construction defects law, the scales have tilted too far in favor of litigation as the default tool for resolving disputes. And this appears to be the biggest reason for the collapse in the number of new multi-family dwellings in recent years.\n\nAt the time Ulibarri introduced his bills, condos represented just 2 percent of new residences being built. That improved slightly to 4.6 percent of the inventory in the second quarter, but the percentage is still way below what existed before the current construction defects law went into effect.\n\nFor example, condos were 26 percent of new housing units in 2008.\n\nMayors and city planners have been pushing to amend the law, and now Lakewood is going to try flying solo \u2014 although its powers to do so as a home-rule city may well be challenged.\n\nWhether the city succeeds or not, there is no doubt its purpose is laudable. \u201cIf there are defects, we want to get them fixed rather than dragging this through the courts for years,\u201d says Lakewood Mayor Bob Murphy.\n\nIf only state lawmakers would heed the message.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado state law hampers building of condos", "title": "Colorado state law hampers building of condos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/26/colorado-state-law-hampers-building-of-condos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926__OP29CONDOSp1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926__OP29CONDOSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T17:44:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:13:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcc3\"", "article_summary": "But under the state\u2019s current construction defects law, the scales have tilted too far in favor of litigation as the default tool for resolving disputes.\nThat improved slightly to 4.6 percent of the inventory in the second quarter, but the percentage is still way below what existed before the current construction defects law went into effect.\nLawmakers had a chance last spring to address the lack of condo construction with bills sponsored by Sen.
