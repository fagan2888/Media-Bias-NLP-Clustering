WASHINGTON–For Sen. Ted Cruz, the White House’s decision to rename Mt. McKinley in Alaska is just another example of President Barack Obama trampling over the Constitution.

“It is the latest manifestation of the megalomaniacal, imperial presidency that we have seen for six and a half years,” Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday. “This administration has been the most lawless administration we have ever seen. And this president routinely disregards the law, disregards the Constitution, disregards the Congress.”

Obama announced Sunday that Interior Secretary Sally Jewell would rename Mt. McKinley ‘Denali’ using her executive authority. The move restores Alaskan Native name to the nation’s tallest mountain, which was called Denali long before it was officially renamed for President William McKinley in 1917.

The Interior Department said Jewell has the authority to do so under a 1947 law passed by Congress that allows her to standardize U.S. geographical names for federal usage.

Members of Congress from Alaska and Ohio–McKinley’s home state–have squabbled for decades over Denali’s name. Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska applauded the decision, while Ohioans–including House Speaker John Boehner–panned the president.

“If he wants to change the name of a mountain, the way to do so is to go to Congress,” said Cruz. “But he can’t be bothered with Constitutional niceties like actually passing legislation.”

Cruz added that Obama had become the president Richard Nixon “always wished he could be.” The senator also compared Obama to Nixon in July during a hearing he chaired about IRS targeting of political non-profits.
