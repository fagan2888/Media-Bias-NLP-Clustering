For example, they could ask students whether they prefer skateboards or bikes, milk or juice, dogs or cats, summer or winter.\n\n\u201cAlways ask yourself, \u2018Will this configuration create a gendered space?\u2019\u201d said step 1 of the handout.\n\nOr they could \u201cCreate classroom names and then ask all of the \u2018purple penguins\u2019 to meet at the rug,\u201d the handout said.\n\nStep 5: \u201cWhen you find it necessary to reference gender, say \u2018boy, girl, both or neither,\u201d the handout said. \u201cWhen asked why, use this as a teachable moment. Emphasize to students that your classroom recognizes and celebrates the gender diversity of all students.\u201d\n\nStep 7: \u201cLook for examples in the media that reinforce gender stereotypes or binary models of gender (it won\u2019t be hard; they\u2019re everywhere). When with others, call it out and interrogate it.\u201d\n\nStep 10: \u201cAvoid using \u2018normal\u2019 to define any behaviors.\u201d\n\nLincoln Superintendent Steve Joel told KLIN Radio this week he was \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cpleased\u201d with the training materials because the school district needs to be inclusive and educate and understand all children and address bullying.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get involved with politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get involved with gender preferences. We\u2019re educating all kids \u2026 and we can\u2019t be judgmental.\u201d\n\nAl Riskowski, executive director of the conservative Nebraska Family Alliance, said his group has supported legislation to combat bullying, but the training materials go \u201cway beyond trying to teach someone how to respect another individual\u201d or understand gender identification or sexual orientation to a \u201cwhole new idea of boy-girl.\u201d\n\nRiskowski said the idea \u201cyour biology at birth doesn\u2019t designate who you are,\u201d but instead you\u2019re on a \u201cgender spectrum\u201d is at odds with the beliefs of \u201calmost everyone in the community.\u201d\n\nIrving Principal Susette Taylor told the Lincoln Journal Star she held a staff session on the issue, and the handouts were given out by a staffer on a \u201cdistrict equity team.\u201d She said they were meant for teachers, not students or parents, and were suggestions, not rules, on how to make students feel comfortable.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The handout \u201c12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness\u201d advised teachers to avoid separating students by gender, but by birth dates or preferences.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The handout \u201c12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness\u201d advised teachers to avoid separating students by gender, but by birth dates or preferences.", "title": "Nebraska School Seeks to Be More 'Gender Inclusive'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/495212891.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-09T22:36:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CZAZrn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The handout \u201c12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness\u201d advised teachers to avoid separating students by gender, but by birth dates or preferences.", "title": "Nebraska School Seeks to Be More 'Gender Inclusive'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/495212891.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2014-10-10T03:01:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T22:36:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gender, nebraska, purple penguins"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2f3\"", "article_summary": "For example, they could ask students whether they prefer skateboards or bikes, milk or juice, dogs or cats, summer or winter.\nStep 5: \u201cWhen you find it necessary to reference gender, say \u2018boy, girl, both or neither,\u201d the handout said.\nEmphasize to students that your classroom recognizes and celebrates the gender diversity of all students.\u201dStep 7: \u201cLook for examples in the media that reinforce gender stereotypes or binary models of gender (it won\u2019t be hard; they\u2019re everywhere).\nOr they could \u201cCreate classroom names and then ask all of the \u2018purple penguins\u2019 to meet at the rug,\u201d the handout said.\n\u201cAlways ask yourself, \u2018Will this configuration create a gendered space?\u2019\u201d said step 1 of the handout."}
