The couple volunteers every week at the children's club. Their routine is good practice since they will soon be caring for their own child.\n\n\u201cAdding baby is going to be a different challenge,\u201d Adrian said.\n\nOne challenge as they prepare to become parents is figuring out their healthcare situation because their jobs don\u2019t offer coverage.\n\n\u201cAs a substitute teacher, I haven\u2019t been able to land steady position,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cSubbing allows me to do what I love but at a cost of not having insurance.\u201d\n\nThey are currently getting some help through the state for Erin\u2019s pre-natal needs.\n\n\u201cI qualify and the baby qualifies,\u201d Erin said. But, their current coverage leaves Adrian uninsured.\n\nThe Selmons thought they would be able to find out their options in the insurance exchange weeks ago. Attempt after attempt to enroll on the healthcare.gov website left them frustrated.\n\n\u201cEach time the results weren't favorable,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cAfter I signed on, it said sorry website was not available.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty is a heavy burden for this family because every time they get sick \u2013 it\u2019s a big question mark.\n\n\u201cI have to say how much am I going to have to pay?\u201d Adrian said. \u201cFor people who don't have coverage, they ask those questions. Medication or do I want dinner tonight?\u201d\n\nAdrian said they are anxiously awaiting for the healthcare website to be fixed in order to learn how much they will have to pay for coverage.\n\n\u201cWe are still going to have to see if we can afford that,\u201d he said.\n\nA family making $15,000 per year would make too much to qualify for Medicaid in Indiana and too little to be eligible for tax subsidies in the federal health insurance exchange.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was passed with the assumption that all states would expand their Medicaid coverage. The federal insurance exchange only offers subsidies to those with incomes between 100-400 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal law would have anyone making below that percentage covered though Medicaid.\n\nBut, the Supreme Court ruled that states could not be required to make this move.\n\nStates like Indiana decided not to expand Medicaid. The Hoosier state offers its own alternative called the \u201cHealthy Indiana Plan.\u201d In this program, the state contributes but so do those who enroll.\n\nThe HIP program will be limited to 45,000 people for next year and there is a waiting list.\n\nA spokesperson for the Indiana Family and Social Services office tells me a family like the Selmons would likely qualify for HIP.\n\nFor now, the Selmons continue with their routine. They are holding on to the hope that they will be insured by the time their baby is born.\n\nThere is a website for Hoosiers to determine what group they fall into for healthcare coverage and what they need to do to apply.
