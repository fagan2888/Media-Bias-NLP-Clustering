JERSEY CITY, N.J. — We’re starting to understand that the six-game suspension Broncos linebacker Von Miller received to start the season could have been worse.

The suspension was part of a settlement worked out between the NFL and Miller’s NFL Players Association lawyers. Miller, who was found in violation of the league’s drug policy, did have to forfeit $806,161 of his 2013 salary as part of the settlement, but the Broncos understood he would also have to pay back $1,215,264 of his $13,773,000 signing bonus he received in 2011 as the NFL’s No. 2 overall draft pick, as part of a collective bargaining agreement.

The settlement between the league and Miller’s representatives, however, made no mention of the signing bonus. An independent mediator heard the case and both sides have been informed Miller will be able to keep a little more than $1 million of that bonus but not quite the full $1.215 million, according to two NFL sources. ESPN first reported Miller would keep the bulk of his signing bonus. Such an “award” may be unprecedented as suspended players ordinarily do have to pay back pro-rated portions of upfront bonuses.

A negotiated settlement, though, apparently falls outside the CBA jurisdiction.

The Broncos, who were not part of the settlement negotiations, will seek clarification from the league office on the matter at a later date. The team has been busy with other matters, like the Super Bowl. Miller won’t play in the Super Bowl on Sunday because he suffered a torn ACL in his right knee in the Broncos’ 15th game at Houston.
