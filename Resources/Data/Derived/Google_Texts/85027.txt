Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer made the bold proclamation on Wednesday that the comments White House press secretary Jay Carney made in response to the recently-released CBO report on Obamacare will be “emblazoned on the tombstone of liberalism.”

Here’s the statement made by Carney that he is referring to:

“Opportunity created by affordable, quality health insurance allows families in America to make a decision about how they will work, or if they will work.”

“He says opportunity. This is what he’s heralding in this achievement, that the government is giving opportunity for people to decide if they want to work. This is the liberals’ ideal of the opportunity society,” Krauthammer said. “Of course, in a free society, you can decide if you want to work, but what Obamacare does, and so the essence of liberalism, is you can choose not to work, and the people who do work end up subsidizing you.”

In other words, he explained, the people who work “have to send their money to the government” so they can redistribute it to the people who choose, “in this ideal new opportunity society,” not to work.

Krauthammer also echoed the words of CBO director Douglas Elmendorf, who admitted Obamacare creates a disincentive for people to work.

“Now, you can argue it’s an inevitable side effect kind of benefit of this sort, but that’s not the argument the administration is making,” he added. “This is a benefit, a wonderful thing that we’re giving people the opportunity not to work and to live off the sweat and the work of other people. Is that the American way? That sounds odd to me.”
