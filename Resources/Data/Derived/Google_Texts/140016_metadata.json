When the commander laughed about his atrocities, in addition to beating the boy's mother when she tried to intervene and stop him from assaulting her son, he got roughed up.\n\n\n\nNow Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland, a Green Beret with 11 years of outstanding Army service, is being kicked out of the military as a result of doing the right thing.\n\n\n\nEven as the U.S. military denies reports that American troops were told to ignore Afghan child abusers, an 11-year Green Beret who was ordered discharged after he confronted an alleged rapist was informed Tuesday that the Army has denied his appeal.\n\n\n\nSgt. 1st Class Charles Martland earlier this year was ordered discharged by Nov. 1. He has been fighting to stay in, but in an initial decision, the U.S. Army Human Resources Command told Martland that his appeal \u201cdoes not meet the criteria\u201d for an appeal.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsequently, your request for an appeal and continued service is disapproved,\u201d the office wrote in a memo to Martland.\n\nLast night Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, who has been in contact with the Department of Defense about the case, discussed the appeal denial on The Kelly File.\n\n\"Imagine this, you're a 20-year-old kid and you're serving your nation and on your U.S. base you actually see child rapists and pedophiles and hear the scream of little boys at night and you're told it's an Afghan criminal issue,\" Duncan said. \"They were allowing this to happen because they don't want to offend the wrong people. There is a shameful lack leadership and morality in the Army.\"\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nUnbelievable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Disgusting. .05/26/2016 20:20:49PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Disgusting.", "title": "Disgrace: Green Beret Who Defended Boy Against Rape in Afghanistan Loses Appeal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/09/23/army-to-green-beret-punished-for-defending-boy-from-an-afghan-rapist-nope-you-cant-come-back-n2055822", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/23/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Disgusting.", "title": "Disgrace: Green Beret Who Defended Boy Against Rape in Afghanistan Loses Appeal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/09/23/army-to-green-beret-punished-for-defending-boy-from-an-afghan-rapist-nope-you-cant-come-back-n2055822", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/23/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Disgrace: Green Beret Who Defended Boy Against Rape in Afghanistan Loses Appeal , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Green Beret Charles Martland was discharged from the Army after roughing up an Afghan military commander who admitted, and laughed about, being a child rapist.\nHe has been fighting to stay in, but in an initial decision, the U.S. Army Human Resources Command told Martland that his appeal \u201cdoes not meet the criteria\u201d for an appeal.\n1st Class Charles Martland, a Green Beret with 11 years of outstanding Army service, is being kicked out of the military as a result of doing the right thing.\n1st Class Charles Martland earlier this year was ordered discharged by Nov. 1.\n\u201cConsequently, your request for an appeal and continued service is disapproved,\u201d the office wrote in a memo to Martland."}
