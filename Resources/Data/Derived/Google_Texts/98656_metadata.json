Lender Processing Services is now known as Black Knight Financial Services.\n\nNevada originally decided not to join a multi-state settlement with LPS signed in 2011 with 49 other states. LPS was recently acquired by Fidelity National Financial Inc., which allowed for negotiations to begin again, the attorney general said.\n\nUnder the terms, LPS will pay Nevada $5.5 million and $500,000 in attorney fees and costs. The company will also review all documents executed between Jan. 1, 2008 and Dec.31, 2010 to determine what documents, if any, need to be re-executed or corrected.\n\nThe attorney general said that Nevada would receive the nation\u2019s fourth-highest settlement, after California, Florida and Texas.\n\n\u201cThe provisions contained in the settlement will ensure integrity in the foreclosure process in Nevada,\u201d Masto said in the statement.\n\nMessages left with Black Knight Financial Services were not returned Friday.\n\nNevada homeowners can call 866-854-8935 to request review or correction of any documents executed by LPS.\n\nContact reporter Chris Sieroty at csieroty@reviewjournal.com or 702-477-3893.
