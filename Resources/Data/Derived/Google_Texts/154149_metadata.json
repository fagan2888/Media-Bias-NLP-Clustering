But it\u2019s also been a long time since scientists have tried to find a cure for HIV, with latent HIV cells hiding in the body posing the biggest obstacle.\n\nResearchers have come up with plenty of approaches to eradicate these difficult-to-reach, latent HIV hideouts \u2013 combination therapies, vaccines, zinc finger nuclease therapy.\n\nIn the midst of all these possibilities and yet no cure, another research project has been published. A new study out of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine found a new way to destroy these hidden HIV-infected cells. The researchers tested mice that had human cells comprising their immune systems, known as BLT mice, and found that a combination of both a bacterial toxin and an antibody could enter HIV-infected cells and eliminate them. This joint antibody-toxin approach would be more effective in killing latent HIV viruses than antiretroviral therapy.\n\n\u201cOur work provides evidence that HIV-infected cells can be tracked down and destroyed throughout the body,\u201d Dr. Victor Garcia, professor of medicine and senior author of the study, said in a press release.\n\nThough antiretroviral therapy (ART) is extremely effective in pushing HIV levels down to a diminished low, small amounts of latent, or hidden, HIV viruses remain in the system. Though ART cannot destroy these latent viruses, Garcia believes the combination of the bacterial toxin and antibody could.\n\nThe combination compound was developed by co-authors Dr. Edward Berger and Dr. Ira Pastan, from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The antibody is called 3B3 and is combined with a bacterial toxin known as PE38; the authors believed that the antibody would be able to identify a certain HIV protein in cells. The antibody would then attach to the protein, allowing the bacterial toxin to enter the HIV cell and destroy it. According to the press release, Garcia and his team found that \u201cthe molecular missile [compound] had killed the vast majority of persistent HIV-infected cells that had been actively producing the virus despite traditional therapy.\u201d This allowed for a large drop in the amount of HIV-infected cells in the body \u2013 six times lower than before.\n\n\u201cThe [mice with human immune system] model represents a platform in which virtually any novel approach to HIV eradication can be tested,\u201d Garcia said, according to the press release. \u201cIt helps us prioritize which therapeutic approaches should be advanced to clinical implementation in humans. This study shows that it\u2019s possible to attack and kill hidden HIV-infected cells that standard therapy can\u2019t touch.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hiv antiretroviral therapy, hiv cure, vaccines, latent hiv, blt mice", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists from UNC discovered that a bacterial toxin and an antibody could be used in unity to target and destroy latent HIV.", "title": "Scientists Discover New Combination Of Antibody And Bacterial Toxins To Kill Latent HIV", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-discover-new-combination-antibody-and-bacterial-toxins-kill-latent-hiv-266773", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/09/little-lab-mouse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists from UNC discovered that a bacterial toxin and an antibody could be used in unity to target and destroy latent HIV.", "title": "Scientists Discover New Combination Of Antibody And Bacterial Toxins To Kill Latent HIV", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-discover-new-combination-antibody-and-bacterial-toxins-kill-latent-hiv-266773", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/09/little-lab-mouse.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/09/little-lab-mouse.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-09T19:47:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-09T19:48:01-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists from UNC discovered that a bacterial toxin and an antibody could be used in unity to target and destroy latent HIV."}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s also been a long time since scientists have tried to find a cure for HIV, with latent HIV cells hiding in the body posing the biggest obstacle.\nResearchers have come up with plenty of approaches to eradicate these difficult-to-reach, latent HIV hideouts \u2013 combination therapies, vaccines, zinc finger nuclease therapy.\nThe researchers used BLT mice, or mice that have immune systems made up of human immune cells, to test their hypothesis.\nThough ART cannot destroy these latent viruses, Garcia believes the combination of the bacterial toxin and antibody could.\nThis study shows that it\u2019s possible to attack and kill hidden HIV-infected cells that standard therapy can\u2019t touch.\u201d"}
