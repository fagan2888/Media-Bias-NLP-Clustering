On airplanes we go through all the safety procedures, every time you\u2019re on the plane you have to listen to it,\u201d state Sen. Bill Kintner said of the measure. \u201cWe have all kinds of warnings that we put out there that we think people need to see during critical times.\u201d\n\nThe bill \u201cseeks to add another important piece of information to our informed consent laws,\u201d Kintner added.\n\nA clinic found without such a message posted to its walls would be fined up to $10,000 a day.\n\nWhat Kintner did not mention while explaining the rationale for his bill is how reproductive health advocates have long recognized that reproductive coercion \u2014 whether forcing a woman to terminate a pregnancy or to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term \u2014 is a form of violence. He also failed to mention the many barriers women seeking abortions in Nebraska must overcome in order to access that care, making the possibility of forced abortion perhaps less pressing of an issue than the very real threat of women being denied access to the care they need.\n\nIn order to obtain an abortion in Nebraska, a woman must first undergo mandatory and coercive counseling that includes information designed to discourage her from going forward with the procedure. (This counseling also includes information about the illegality of forced abortions.) She then must wait 24 hours, which often involves taking time off of work, finding childcare and securing transportation and, in many cases, a place to stay overnight, since 97 percent of counties in Nebraska do not have an abortion clinic. If she is able to do these things in order to access basic medical care, there is a strong possibility that her employer-provided or private health insurance does not cover abortion except in exceptionally narrow circumstances, leaving her to finance the procedure independently or take out costly \u201cabortion riders\u201d to secure insurance coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinics found in violation of the proposed law would be fined $10,000 each day", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Clinics found in violation of the proposed law would be fined $10,000 each day", "title": "Latest anti-choice strategy: Posters \u201calerting\u201d women they can\u2019t be forced to abort", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/04/latest_anti_choice_strategy_posters_alerting_women_they_cant_be_forced_to_abort/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/antiabortion_protest-620x4121.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clinics found in violation of the proposed law would be fined $10,000 each day", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/antiabortion_protest-620x4121.jpg", "title": "Latest anti-choice strategy: Posters \u201calerting\u201d women they can\u2019t be forced to abort", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Latest anti-choice strategy: Posters \u201calerting\u201d women they can\u2019t be forced to abort", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, anti-choice laws, anti-choice legislation, GOP, Nebraska", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2dd\"", "article_summary": "On airplanes we go through all the safety procedures, every time you\u2019re on the plane you have to listen to it,\u201d state Sen.
