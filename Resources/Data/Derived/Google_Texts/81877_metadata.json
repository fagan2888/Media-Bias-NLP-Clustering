But the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) reports that only one in five people who could benefit from a hearing aid actually wears one. Price is one major reason, as hearing aids typically run from $1,000 to $5,000. Add in the cost of hearing aid tune-ups and the fact that hearing aids generally last only three to five years, and the financial investment can quickly become unsustainable for those whose insurance plans don\u2019t include them.\n\n\u201cThe best thing you can say is that it\u2019s kind of all over the board,\u201d Janet McCarty, M.Ed., director of private health plan reimbursement for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), tells HPW on the issue of hearing care insurance in both the commercial and government setting. \u201cIt\u2019s not cut like vision and dental.\u201d\n\nPediatric coverage is a little more widespread, given the effect that hearing loss has on a child\u2019s cognitive abilities. Currently, 20 states mandate insurance coverage of hearing aids for children, while only three of those states \u2014 Arkansas, New Hampshire and Rhode Island \u2014 extend some insurance requirements to adults. While McCarty tells HPW \u201cwe pull out all the guns\u201d when it comes to pediatric care, a recent survey of state and public employers conducted by ASHA found that 41% of respondents did not include coverage for children\u2019s hearing aids, while only 18% did. (The remaining 41% did not specify.)\n\nEven government assistance is fragmented. Medicaid coverage varies from state to state, with some state Medicaid regulations excluding hearing aids entirely. Lise Hamlin, director of public policy and state development for the Hearing Loss Association of America, says despite Medicaid program regulations, it can be tough to find a hearing aid dispenser who accepts Medicaid, citing \u201conerous\u201d paperwork and a significant lag time in reimbursement.\n\nWhile Medicare Advantage plans may include hearing aids, traditional Medicare, on the other hand, excludes hearing aids entirely, a surprising fact considering the prevalence of hearing loss among the elderly. \u201cThat\u2019s a big question,\u201d Hamlin says. \u201cIt makes no sense to most people. Most people are shocked when they find out. Even legislators are shocked.\u201d\n\nMcCarty says while commercial plans are \u201cshaking loose\u201d from examples set by federal health options like Medicare, many still design their products along similar lines. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much of that impacts the private health plan coverage,\u201d she says. \u201cWe do know that a lot of private plans take their cues from Medicare, and so if Medicare doesn\u2019t cover hearing aids, \u2018OK, we\u2019re not going to cover hearing aids.\u2019\u201d\n\nHamlin says some audiologists are also averse to working with insurers because of the additional paperwork and potential payment caps. But both McCarty and Hamlin see potential for coverage expansion under the ACA\u2019s 10 essential health benefits (EHB), the minimum benefits that non-grandfathered plans in the individual and small-group markets must include, although little has changed thus far.\n\nThe seventh EHB is \u201crehabilitative and habilitative services and medical devices,\u201d which hearing care advocates interpret to include hearing aids. But the interpretations of EHBs vary significantly from state to state, and the standard for interpretation is set by the state\u2019s benchmark plan. If the benchmark plan doesn\u2019t include hearing aids as an essential medical device, then other plans are under no obligation to insure them either. Benchmark plans are also not necessarily permanent, as they\u2019re currently only green-lit for 2014 and 2015. CMS said it plans to revisit the benchmark policy for plans starting in 2016.\n\nHearing aid users do have some options currently available to them. The Department of Veterans Affairs ensures hearing aid coverage, and the Federal Employee Benefit Health Program includes a hearing aid option as well. In some states, like Texas, working adults can qualify for hearing aid coverage. A few private hearing health plans, such as EPIC Hearing Healthcare, have also begun popping up to offer hearing benefits to employers and larger insurance companies in the same fashion as vision and dental.\n\nEPIC is a Pomona, Calif.-based hearing plan that launched in 1997 after its president, Brad Volkmer, hatched the idea with an investor, who also happened to be a patient of the hearing clinic he worked at in Los Angeles. Dru Coleman, EPIC\u2019s national sales and marketing manager, said membership has grown \u201cexponentially\u201d since its inception \u2014 20% alone in the last year. EPIC\u2019s offerings include a full range of coverage options: fully insured, administrative services only (ASO), value-add and workers\u2019 compensation.\n\nThe low cost of the benefits is also similar to dental and vision. A fully insured hearing exam benefit through EPIC costs employers only around 35 cents per employee per month, and a benefit that includes both hearing exams and devices can cost as little as $2 per employee per month. EPIC also offers hearing aids at a 30% to 60% discount from the retail price.\n\nInsurer giant UnitedHealth Group extended its hearing coverage in 2011 with the initiation of hi HealthInnovations, a hearing health plan that offers similar services and discounts to EPIC. United launched the subsidiary after a survey found affordable hearing aids were one of the top three things consumers wanted most, behind affordable health insurance and prescription drugs.\n\nhi HealthInnovations CEO Lisa Tseng, M.D., says the company offers two \u201cbucket\u201d options: a discount program, where hearing aids are sold anywhere from $799 to $999, and a benefit program. While Tseng declined to give specific numbers, she says hi HealthInnovations has expanded rapidly since its start. Health plans are feeling increasingly \u201ccommoditized\u201d in the new landscape, Tseng says, and she predicts hearing insurance will continue to grow.\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
