He has also underscored another fact about himself that everybody knows to be true: Paul Ryan\u2019s No. 1 priority is reducing the budget deficit. Politico, reporting on Ryan\u2019s meeting today with Trump, notes, \u201cThe speaker even brought charts and slides illustrating the nation\u2019s budget woes to help Trump understand the problem he has spent 20 years trying to solve.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Ryan\u2019s record in public life supports a very different conclusion. Over the last two decades, he has supported all of the major deficit-increasing legislation: the Bush tax cuts, the Bush-era defense buildup, and Bush\u2019s debt-financed Medicare drug benefit. During the Bush administration, Ryan distinguished himself from the president by demanding even larger tax cuts \u2014 and, during the fight over privatizing Social Security, advocated a plan that the administration rejected because it would have exploded deficits by too much. Likewise, Ryan has opposed all of the major deficit-reducing legislation during this period \u2014 ending portions of the Bush tax cuts, ending overpayments to private tuition lenders, and enacting the deficit-reducing Affordable Care Act, especially its cost-containment measures. Ryan also voted against the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction framework, and torpedoed bipartisan efforts to negotiate a deficit-reduction compromise between the Obama administration and Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ryan says he cares about reducing the deficit more than anything else. That is a better message for Ryan than saying he cares about reducing income transfers from rich to poor more than anything else. But claiming to care about reducing the deficit while mostly working to increase it is not the same thing as actually caring about reducing the deficit.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "He's spent his entire career trying to solve the deficit!
