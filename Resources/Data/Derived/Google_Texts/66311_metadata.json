So can we please stop with the silly questions to candidates or potential candidates?\n\nThat means, stop speculating, ad nauseum, in print about whether Mitt Romney will make another run for the presidency in 2016. Romney says he\u2019s not interested. His wife says he\u2019s not interested. His sons say he\u2019s not interested. But no matter how many times these things are said, stories are still written, with the caution that the candidate didn\u2019t rule it out . What does that even mean? Since when did, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not running\u201d cease to qualify as a \u201cno\u201d? The same has happened to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, who has said repeatedly that she is not running for president. But the possibility is so delicious to the media \u2013 or maybe, it\u2019s just too boring to think about a 2016 that right now looks pretty limited \u2013 that such stories and TV commentary are often accompanied by the observation that if Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t run, then Warren will probably step in. (Why? Do modern presidential campaigns require a blonde female to be legitimate?) No means no, people.\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Hillary Clinton]\n\nWith Romney, there\u2019s a story there \u2013 but it\u2019s not about Romney not ruling out a presidential run. It\u2019s about a party that is still figuring out a way to bring its diverse (and warring) factions together and getting them to rally around a candidate. And none of the other contenders appears to be doing that, just yet, so it\u2019s sort of understandable that some activists might want Romney to think about it. But the story ends there as long as Romney says he\u2019s not running.\n\nTo say he or she \u201cdidn\u2019t rule it out\u201d isn\u2019t a news development. It\u2019s a tactic for reporters to speculate about anything in the absence of actual news. I saw this first-hand when I did an interview with Vicki Kennedy, widow of the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, in 2010. I\u2019m not running for his seat, she said. Clearly. \"There is only one Senator Kennedy,\" she said, equally clearly. I\u2019m not running.\n\nThe magazine story went online the Saturday night before the print edition came out. The following day, a front-page article appeared in the Washington Post, with various people talking about what an appealing candidate she would be for the job. It would have been a great story, except that it was made moot by Kennedy\u2019s clear statement that she was not, in fact, running. But did the paper kill the story? Nope. They just stuck in a line noting Kennedy\u2019s comment, with the caution, \u201cbut she did not rule it out.\u201d Yes, she did rule it out. She said she wasn\u2019t running.\n\nAll of this recalls the old \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch where John McCain, playing himself, rejects every possible version of that \"are you running?\" question \u2013 including whether he would run in the future against a zombie Jimmy Carter:\n\n[GALLERY: Editorial Cartoons on 2014 Congressional Elections]\n\nAnd in Kentucky, where there\u2019s a somewhat interesting Senate race and lots of issues to talk about \u2013 e.g., coal, the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 what is the pressing issue now in the media? It\u2019s whether Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes voted for President Barack Obama or not. Her refusal to say one way or the other has pundits declaring her challenge to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell done for. Well, no \u2013 she\u2019s been disfavored for a win since the beginning, since she\u2019s a Democrat running against a powerful Republican in a conservative state. Whether she voted for Obama is pretty meaningless, since he didn\u2019t even come close to winning the state in either election. To be fair, Grimes invited the question in seeking to separate herself from the unpopular president, and it just looks bad to refuse to answer it. But does it matter? If she did vote for him, so what? It had no impact in Kentucky. And if she didn\u2019t, so what? She\u2019s running to represent the state, not applying to be his campaign chair.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "susan-milligan/blogentries", "keyword": "Decision 2016 [News]", "title": "No, Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren Will Not Be Running for President", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren said they aren't running in 2016, but the media won't let it go.", "title": "No Means No (Even in Politics)", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/10/15/no-mitt-romney-and-elizabeth-warren-will-not-be-running-for-president", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/6e/e1/12e124ca41d98d2915be74e5e8ee/141001-romney-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren said they aren't running in 2016, but the media won't let it go.", "card": "summary", "title": "No, Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren Will Not Be Running for President"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Oct. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,politics,2016 presidential election,2014 Congressional elections,Romney, Mitt,Warren, Elizabeth,picks,Decision 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren said they aren't running in 2016, but the media won't let it go."}, "article_summary": "The same has happened to Sen.
