Bruce Rauner has issued an executive order continuing a national trend toward letting workers choose whether to pay labor unions.\n\nThe executive order forbids government unions from taking mandatory \u201cfair-share\u201d fees from state employees. Rauner also filed a complaint asking a federal court to rule on his assessment that forced government union dues violate the First Amendment.\n\nIf the Republican governor\u2019s court case succeeds, it could shield public workers throughout the country from forcibly paying fair-share fees.\n\nIllinois is one of 23 states where some or all government employees can be forced to pay a union as a condition of employment. Illinois is also one of the nation\u2019s most heavily unionized states, with 15.1 percent of all workers belonging to unions.\n\nNationally, unions take forced dues from more than 250,000 public employees as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1977 Abood v. Detroit Board of Education decision.\n\nMost government workers in Wisconsin and Michigan can choose whether to pay unions under laws passed in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Right-to-work bills that would end forced union dues for public and private-sector workers are under consideration in New Mexico, Missouri, West Virginia and elsewhere.\n\nRauner\u2019s arguments against public-sector fair-share fees strongly resemble those made by the plaintiffs in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case already awaiting consideration before the Supreme Court.\n\nF. Vincent Vernuccio, director of labor policy at Michigan\u2019s free-market Mackinac Center, told Watchdog in an interview this week that Rauner\u2019s moves reflect a growing sense the Supreme Court may soon abandon Abood.\n\n\u201cThis may be adding fuel to the fire of Friedrichs, which could upend public-sector collective bargaining as we know it,\u201d Vernuccio said.\n\n\u201cIt seems to make sense that forcing people to pay political organizations against their will is a violation of the First Amendment and should be seen as compelled speech,\u201d he added.\n\nVernuccio suggested governors in other states could protect public employees from mandatory union dues by following Rauner\u2019s example, especially if the ensuing legal battle plays out in Rauner\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cIt would definitely, if he wins, be a new model that strong Republican governors can use to stop the First Amendment infringement of forced dues for public-sector workers,\u201d Vernuccio said.\n\n\u201cLook at New Mexico, look at Maryland,\u201d he said. \u201cAnywhere there\u2019s a strong, principled Republican governor that can\u2019t get these reforms through the Legislature, they\u2019ll be watching this to see what happens.\u201d\n\nRauner\u2019s executive order, issued Monday, cited the First Amendment and the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 decision in Harris v. Quinn.\n\nIn Harris v. Quinn, the court ruled Service Employees International Union could not take mandatory fees from home health workers paid through Medicaid. Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s majority opinion described the Abood precedent allowing forced government union dues as an \u201canomaly.\u201d\n\nRauner asserted in his executive order that \u201cthe present facts and circumstances of Illinois public sector collective bargaining leave no doubt that the Fair Share Contract Provisions, as permitted by the Illinois Labor Act, violate Illinois state employees\u2019 freedoms of speech and association.\u201d\n\n\u201cIllinois state employee unions are using compelled \u2018fair share\u2019 fees to fund inherently political activities to influence the outcome of core public sector issues, such as wages, pensions, and benefits,\u201d Rauner explained.\n\nState pension systems in Illinois are underfunded to the tune of more than $130 billion, due in large part to the influence of government union bosses.\n\nKnowing his executive order would prompt a lawsuit by affiliates of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and other powerful unions, the Republican governor filed a federal court complaint for declaratory judgment Monday.\n\nRoberta Lynch, AFSCME Council 31 executive director, affirmed Illinois unions will do everything they can to keep workers\u2019 mandatory fair-share fees flowing into their coffers.\n\n\u201cIt is crystal clear by this action that the governor\u2019s supposed concern for balancing the state budget is a paper-thin excuse that can\u2019t hide his real agenda: Silencing working people and their unions who stand up for the middle class,\u201d Lynch said in a Monday statement.\n\n\u201cOur union and all organized labor will stand together with those who believe in democracy to overturn Bruce Rauner\u2019s illegal action and restore the integrity of the rule of law,\u201d added Lynch, who was paid $140,834 as an AFSCME Council 31 deputy director in 2013.\n\nRauner\u2019s federal court complaint noted, \u201csince Abood, the Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged that compelling a state employee to financially support a public sector union seriously impinges upon free speech and association interests protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cPursuant to his oath of office under Article XIII, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution, and his duty to execute the laws under Article V, Section 8 of the Illinois Constitution, the Governor cannot condone this unconstitutional coercion of speech,\u201d the complaint added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Illinois Gov.
