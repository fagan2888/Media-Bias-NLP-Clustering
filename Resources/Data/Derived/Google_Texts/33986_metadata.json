A recent Gallup Well Being poll has revealed that more Americans aged 65 and older \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that they felt good about their physical appearance compared with any other age group over 18.\n\n\u201cOne's concern about their appearance is clearly rooted in a combination of subjective and objective factors, and thus it differs according to a variety of demographic and cultural variances, including gender, age, and racial and ethnic background,\u201d the Gallup research team said in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, as people age, perhaps a different set of societal expectations and appearance standards lead to a renewed sense of confidence. In an image-conscious society where beautiful men and women flood the screens and pages of Americans' various mediums, it isn't surprising that many are left feeling inadequate.\u201d\n\nResearchers working with the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index administered surveys to over 85,000 adults in the United States between Jan. 1 and June 23, 2014. Americans in the age brackets 18 to 34, 35 to 64, and 65 and over were asked to rate their level of agreement with the statement, \"I always feel good about my physical appearance.\" The rating system was from one to five, one meaning \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d and five meaning \u201cstrongly agree.\u201d Among every age group included in the poll, men were more likely to agree with feeling good about their physical appearance than women.\n\nOver half of Americans included in the poll (58 percent) agreed they feel good about their physical appearance by giving ratings of four and five. Around one out of five Americans (27 percent) neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement and 15 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed that they feel good about their appearance. Two-thirds of Americans aged 65 and older either agreed or strongly agreed that they always feel good about their physical appearance followed closely by 61 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34. A little over half of middle-aged Americans between 35 and 64 (54 percent) reported feeling good about their appearance.\n\n\u201cAmericans' concern about their physical appearance fuels a huge component of the U.S. economy, extending across clothing, makeup, hair care, weight control, and cosmetic surgery industries,\u201d the research team added. \u201cThis concern about physical appearance is not totally ill-founded, given that research studies show that attractive people fare better than those perceived as less attractive in many business and social situations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "physical, appearance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Americans over the age of 65 are pretty happy with their physical appearance while middle-aged Americans feel they could look better.", "title": "Senior Citizens Think They're Pretty Darn Sexy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/americans-over-age-65-feel-better-about-their-physical-appearance-any-other-adult-age-group-292572", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/11/older-americans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Americans over the age of 65 are pretty happy with their physical appearance while middle-aged Americans feel they could look better.", "title": "Senior Citizens Think They're Pretty Darn Sexy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/americans-over-age-65-feel-better-about-their-physical-appearance-any-other-adult-age-group-292572", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/11/older-americans.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/11/older-americans.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-11T10:41:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-11T10:41:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Americans over the age of 65 are pretty happy with their physical appearance while middle-aged Americans feel they could look better."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbde2\"", "article_summary": "Americans over the age of 65 are pretty happy with their physical appearance while middle-aged Americans feel they could look better.\nOver half of Americans included in the poll (58 percent) agreed they feel good about their physical appearance by giving ratings of four and five.\nTwo-thirds of Americans aged 65 and older either agreed or strongly agreed that they always feel good about their physical appearance followed closely by 61 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34.\n\u201cThis concern about physical appearance is not totally ill-founded, given that research studies show that attractive people fare better than those perceived as less attractive in many business and social situations.\u201d\nA recent Gallup Well Being poll has revealed that more Americans aged 65 and older \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that they felt good about their physical appearance compared with any other age group over 18."}
