(Pictured above: Chiang Mai, Thailand)\n\nWhy? For starters, the seaside Algarve region of Portugal was ranked the top destination for Americans who want to retire abroad, according to a new report from Live and Invest Overseas, out earlier this week.\n\nRelated: Want a Secure Retirement? Head to the \u2018Cowboy State\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most affordable option in Europe,\u201d said Kathleen Peddicord, author and publisher of Live and Invest Overseas, a website with information for those who want to retire, invest, do business and own real estate outside the U.S.\n\n\u201cFor just $1,500 a month, you can live in the quintessential Old World culture in the Algarve, where you\u2019ll find medieval villages, some of the best beaches in Europe and amazing weather,\u201d she added.\n\nOther attractive aspects of the Algarve region include undervalued real estate \u2013 as well as recent legislation that allows resident foreign retirees to receive pension and foreign income in the country tax free for 10 years, if they qualify for the new non-habitual resident status.\n\nRelated: Retirement\u2019s Magic Number Is a Moving Target\n\nThe region, with its miles of beaches, is also a top golfing destination with dozens of courses.\n\nTo come up with the best places to retire overseas \u2013 which admittedly is not for everyone \u2013 Live and Invest Overseas looked at 12 criteria. Those are: climate, cost of living, crime rates, amount of English spoken, entertainment, environmental conditions, existing expat community, health care, infrastructure, real estate, residency options and taxes.\n\nHere are other top oversea destinations for retirement, as well as their main attractions, based on this source:\n\nCuenca, Ecuador: beautiful climate, affordable living and expat community\n\nGeorge Town, Malaysia: budget living, low taxes, good weather, expat community and English\n\nChiang Mai, Thailand: inexpensive living, expat community, weather and good health care\n\nDumaguete, Philippines: affordable living, great beaches, expat community, balmy climate and good health care\n\nRelated: The 12 Worst States for Retirement\n\nPau, France: Old World European lifestyle, low crime and good health care\n\nMedellin, Colombia: city living on a budget and good health care\n\n\u201cCollectively, these are the world\u2019s most affordable, most welcoming, friendliest, safest retirement choices right now,\u201d according to the report.\n\nFrom a tax standpoint, the report also noted that most countries don\u2019t tax retirement income, although as an American receiving Social Security, you would pay U.S. taxes on that income.\n\nTaxes on non-retirement income are a bit more complex and you should check the tax situation in your target country to understand if you owe tax in the U.S. and/or in the country in which you\u2019re retiring. You should also consult with your financial adviser about other implications of such a move.\n\nAs to the local cost of living, Live and Invest Overseas noted that will depend largely on how you choose to live. Your main expenses would be mostly centered on housing, utilities, groceries and entertainment.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If Wyoming, Alaska or Minnesota \u2013 the best states for retirement \u2013 don\u2019t do it for you, you might want to consider such overseas retirement options as Portugal, Malaysia or Ecuador.", "title": "The 7 Best Places to Retire Abroad", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/27/7-Best-Places-Retire-Abroad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10192012_Retire_Abroad_Chiang_Mai_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/27/7-Best-Places-Retire-Abroad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10192012_Retire_Abroad_Chiang_Mai_slideshow.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If Wyoming, Alaska or Minnesota \u2013 the best states for retirement \u2013 don\u2019t do it for you, you might want to consider such overseas retirement options as Portugal, Malaysia or Ecuador.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1217\"", "article_summary": "To come up with the best places to retire overseas \u2013 which admittedly is not for everyone \u2013 Live and Invest Overseas looked at 12 criteria.\nIf Wyoming, Alaska or Minnesota \u2013 the best states for retirement \u2013 don\u2019t do it for you, you might want to consider such overseas retirement options as Portugal, Malaysia or Ecuador.\nFor starters, the seaside Algarve region of Portugal was ranked the top destination for Americans who want to retire abroad, according to a new report from Live and Invest Overseas, out earlier this week.\nAs to the local cost of living, Live and Invest Overseas noted that will depend largely on how you choose to live.\nFrom a tax standpoint, the report also noted that most countries don\u2019t tax retirement income, although as an American receiving Social Security, you would pay U.S. taxes on that income."}
