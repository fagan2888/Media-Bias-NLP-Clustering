The prison phone service industry now rakes in around $1.2 billion every year.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the phone companies that are getting rich off prisoners\u2019 phone calls.\n\nThanks to so-called \u201ccommissions\u201d that can account for as much as 94 percent of the cost of a call, prison phone contracts have become a major source of revenue for state and local governments all across the country.\n\nThese glorified kickbacks have also become a source of revenue for prisons themselves, and they use them to pay for the health care and food services they\u2019re already constitutionally required to provide.\n\nIn other words, like pretty much every other case of privatization over the past few decades, the rise of private prison phone contracts has nothing to do with \u201cefficiency\u201d or \u201cimproving services\u201d and has everything do with making a quick buck for some crony capitalist with a bunch of Republican friends in Congress.\n\nAs Paul Wright of the Human Rights Defense Center told ThinkProgress,\n\n\u201cFor decades, prisons and jails provided secure, cheap telephone services with no problems. They\u2019re perfectly capable of doing it. It\u2019s just that now they view prisoners as profit centers. They\u2019re monetizing human suffering and human captivity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to kickbacks from phone companies, state and local governments are incentivized to keep their cells filled", "title": "Prisons are a cash cow: How privatization forged an incarceration industrial complex", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Thanks to kickbacks from phone companies, state and local governments are incentivized to keep their cells filled", "title": "Prisons are a cash cow: How privatization forged an incarceration industrial complex", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/prisons_are_a_cash_cow_how_privatization_forged_an_incarceration_industrial_complex_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/prison_cells.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to kickbacks from phone companies, state and local governments are incentivized to keep their cells filled", "title": "Prisons are a cash cow: How privatization forged an incarceration industrial complex", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/prison_cells.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thom Hartmann", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, AT&T, Prison, privatization", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, AT&T, Prison, privatization, Business News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetRampant privatization is wreaking havoc on our society.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the phone companies that are getting rich off prisoners\u2019 phone calls.\nCase in point: what\u2019s happened over the past few decades with prison phone services.\nThe prison phone service industry now rakes in around $1.2 billion every year.\nThese glorified kickbacks have also become a source of revenue for prisons themselves, and they use them to pay for the health care and food services they\u2019re already constitutionally required to provide."}
