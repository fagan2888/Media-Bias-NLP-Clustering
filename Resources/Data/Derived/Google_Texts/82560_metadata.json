Other commission members include former U.S. Rep George Miller; Angela Glover Blackwell, CEO of PolicyLink, a research and advocacy group focusing on equity issues; Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the Palo Alto-based Learning Policy Institute; Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com; and Lisa Jackson, an Apple vice president.\n\nThe report envisions the state fully supporting children\u2019s health through expanded childcare, preschool and transitional kindergarten, and better medical care achieved through increased Medi-Cal reimbursements and fixing an Affordable Care Act loophole that leaves 73,000 children without affordable health care, though it doesn\u2019t say how that fix would be done. It characterizes its recommendations in transformative terms.\n\n\u201cNo other human-development intervention can match this return on investment,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe commission recommended a sliding-scale payment system that would provide free childcare and preschool services to those with under 50 percent of the state\u2019s median income, and payments of no more than 10 percent of household income for people earning above that threshold.\n\nCommon Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer said the commission would \u201cnot be afraid\u201d to press elected officials during the current and future budget cycles, or to \u201ccall for new revenue and taxes\u201d to pay for the proposals. The commission also plans a series of at least 12 forums this year to raise awareness about its recommendations and to make the case for additional investment.\n\n\u201cWe are not naive,\u201d said Steyer. \u201cThere is significant additional investment that needs to be made here to the tune of billions of dollars a year if we are going to provide every child in California with the right start.\u201d Consolidating programs would lead to major cost savings, he also said.\n\nCalled \u201cRebuilding the California Dream,\u201d the report recommends creating a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d online portal, supported by regional referral centers, for parents to navigate childcare and education options \u2013 and the commission said it would work with Silicon Valley to make that happen. It cites North Carolina as a state that has had success coordinating resources for families and overseeing a statewide early education system.\n\nThe report also emphasizes the need for additional and significant support from the broader business community, in the form of advocacy and family-friendly workplace policies. Those policies should include flexible scheduling, including telecommuting arrangements, paid family leave and childcare assistance, said the report, which also urged business leaders, in undefined terms, to use their influence to rally support for investments in early education.\n\nThe business community leadership has in the past decade come far in its understanding of the importance of early childhood education, but there is legwork yet to do, said Matt Regan, senior vice president of government relations at the Bay Area Council, a business group that has in the past supported means-tested preschool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon organizations like ours to educate our members on the long-term benefits of making appropriate investments in early childhood,\u201d Regan said. \u201cYou have to explain to them that it\u2019s not a problem you can solve in middle school and beyond; it starts before kindergarten. But we\u2019re definitely making progress.\u201d\n\nCalls for childcare and preschool available to all children will meet with some skepticism, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile we know that it\u2019s the best bang for the buck to invest in early education, you will see raised eyebrows when talking to business leaders,\u201d Regan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s up to us to educate them (business leaders) and show them the data and research.\u201d\n\nAlthough the report doesn\u2019t include a projection of costs, a \u201crough estimate\u201d is that the expansion of childcare and preschool programs that the report called for in California would cost the state an additional $5 billion or more, said Craig Cheslog, co-director of Common Sense Kids Action. He said additional costs could be closer to $13 billion a year if quality-improvement measures were adopted such as recruiting and retaining qualified teachers, and increasing reimbursements to preschool and childcare providers, along with health-related measures such as higher Medi-Cal reimbursements. The state now spends about $3.5 billion a year on childcare and early education programs, according to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a significant price tag,\u201d state Department of Finance spokesman H.D. Palmer said, referring to Cheslog\u2019s estimate of the costs to the state of the various proposals made in the report. He said it would be evaluated along with the other feedback to the state about Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s proposal to consolidate preschool, quality control and transitional kindergarten into a single block grant.\n\nThe report describes the state\u2019s current childcare and education landscape as underfunded, \u201cfragmented,\u201d and confusing for families and providers alike. It also leans heavily on research that shows how crucial children\u2019s experiences in their early years are to future academic, social and economic outcomes for both individuals and society. And it recommends a full-fledged campaign to educate families about the value of early childhood care and education.\n\nThe recommendations drew a mixed response from one prominent business group, the California Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents larger employers.\n\nMany larger companies have already instituted family leave and similar policies, but smaller businesses can often not bear those costs, said Kirk Clark, the organization\u2019s vice president.\n\nClark also questioned the fiscal wisdom of expanding state spending in the preschool system too broadly. \u201cFamilies with the ability to make those investments in childcare and the pre-K system, they\u2019re doing that today,\u201d he said. Creating a universal preschool and childcare system would place an additional burden on taxpayers, he said.\n\nThe commission has \u201ca pretty good chance of getting the legislature to advocate on their behalf, but would it be enough to get them where they they want to get to in five years, is another question,\u201d said Paul Warren, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California and a former chief consultant to the state Assembly\u2019s education committee.\n\nCommon Sense Kids Action plans to raise $2 million to $3 million this year and $10 million to $15 million over the next five years to launch a campaign to promote the commission\u2019s recommendations, Cheslog said.\n\n\u201cThe only way this can even possibly be successful is if you put together a really powerful media campaign,\u201d said Thomas Timar, executive director of the Center for Applied Policy in Education at UC Davis.\n\nJeremy Hay covers early education for EdSource.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A non-profit journalism website reporting on key education issues in California and beyond.", "tags": "education news, california education, non-profit news, common core, local control funding formula, k-12 education", "og": {"url": "http://edsource.org/2016/commission-calls-for-major-new-investments-in-early-education/562797", "image": "http://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/early_preschool_reading_group.jpg", "site_name": "EdSource", "description": "The report calls for programs for all children 5 and younger.", "title": "Commission calls for major new investments in early education"}, "twitter": {"site": "@edsource", "description": "The report calls for programs for all children 5 and younger.", "card": "summary", "title": "Commission calls for major new investments in early education"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8102\"", "article_summary": "Jeremy Hay covers early education for EdSource.\nIt cites North Carolina as a state that has had success coordinating resources for families and overseeing a statewide early education system.\nThe state now spends about $3.5 billion a year on childcare and early education programs, according to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\nThe recommendations drew a mixed response from one prominent business group, the California Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents larger employers.\n\u201cWhile we know that it\u2019s the best bang for the buck to invest in early education, you will see raised eyebrows when talking to business leaders,\u201d Regan said."}
