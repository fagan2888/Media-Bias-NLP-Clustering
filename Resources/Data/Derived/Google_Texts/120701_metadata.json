HELL. HELL. HELL,\u201d Mo says on the networking site.\n\nThe film not only follows the pilgrimage, but also explores Sharma\u2019s life with husband Dan in New York, and his troubled relationship with his late mother as a young man in India.\n\nHaving travelled to India at the end of his time in Mecca, Sharma reads various letters from his mother \u2013 who died of cancer when he was 21 \u2013 imploring him to find a wife.\n\n\u201cI always wonder \u2018Did the shame of my sexuality kill her? Am I the one who has sinned?'\u201d Sharma asks himself in the film.\n\n\u201cMother never forgave me for being gay\u007f. Her anger was relentless, and my shame eternal.\u201d\n\nIt is this shame that Sharma wrestles with as he narrates the pilgrimage which all Muslims must undertake once in their lives \u2013 to cleanse them of their sins in the eyes of Allah.\n\nThe filmmaker is wracked with doubt throughout his journey, often pondering if he will be accepted by Allah and denouncing contemporary Islam as at war with itself and having been \u201chijacked by a violent minority.\u201d\n\nIn one ritual of the hajj, known as qurbani, Sharma kills a goat by slitting its throat, yet is overcome with remorse.\n\n\u201cBy killing another living being, I have also killed part of myself. What is gone is the part of me that wondered if Islam would accept me\u2026 it is up to me, as a gay Muslim, to accept Islam,\u201d Sharma says as the film concludes.\n\nReflecting on what he refers to as the greatest journey of his life, Sharma talks about powerful moments where he felt completely alone despite being surrounded by millions of people.\n\n\u201cI felt I was making the pilgrimage on behalf of hundreds of thousands of gay Muslims who would never be able to go due to being too afraid. For me \u2013 it was my hajj of defiance.\u201d\n\nBy Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Ros Russell", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Institutions, Politics, death penalty, human rights, LGBT, Mecca, Saudi", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) Millions of Muslims each year make the arduous and exhausting hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, but for one filmmaker, it was a journey that could have cost him his life.", "title": "Gay Muslim filmmaker risks death in pilgrimage to reconcile faith and sexuality\u007f", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/09/gay-muslim-filmmaker-risks-death-in-pilgrimage-to-reconcile-faith-and-sexuality/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-09-at-09.25.18.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/09/gay-muslim-filmmaker-risks-death-in-pilgrimage-to-reconcile-faith-and-sexuality/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/09/gay-muslim-filmmaker-risks-death-in-pilgrimage-to-reconcile-faith-and-sexuality/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) Millions of Muslims each year make the arduous and exhausting hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, but for one filmmaker, it was a journey that could have cost him his life."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2481\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI felt I was making the pilgrimage on behalf of hundreds of thousands of gay Muslims who would never be able to go due to being too afraid.\nHaving travelled to India at the end of his time in Mecca, Sharma reads various letters from his mother \u2013 who died of cancer when he was 21 \u2013 imploring him to find a wife.\nSharma said he was fortunate to be allowed into the conservative Islamic kingdom, despite his sexuality and a film career in which he has challenged conservative Islam.\nThe documentary \u201cA Sinner in Mecca\u201d, which screened at the Sheffield Doc Fest on Sunday, follows Parvez Sharma, a gay Muslim living in New York, on his once-in-a-lifetime journey to a country where homosexuality is punishable by death.\nWhat is gone is the part of me that wondered if Islam would accept me\u2026 it is up to me, as a gay Muslim, to accept Islam,\u201d Sharma says as the film concludes."}
