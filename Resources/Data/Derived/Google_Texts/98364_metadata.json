The suit seeks an injunction against GE, a judge\u2019s order to halt GE\u2019s plans to end the health benefits Jan. 1.\n\nGE has been arguing that it never promised that the benefit plans would last forever and that stopping the clock will do more harm than good.\n\nGE is moving roughly 65,000 retirees to a health exchange called OneExchange that offers thousands of different plans from private insurers. The company had previously offered Medicare gap plans that covered different parts of Medicare coverage, and will now offer 65-and older retirees a $1,000 subsidy instead toward the Medicare gap options offered by OneExchange.\n\nThe GE plans provide \u201cgap\u201d coverage of Medicare, which is the health insurance plan that covers most Americans after they turn 65.\n\nGE argued in a court filing made Friday that an injunction against the move could harm the 54,000 retirees who have already switched over to the OneExchange plans.\n\nBack in 2012, GE canceled the Medicare plans for GE retirees who had not yet reached 65. The latest move to cancel the coverage altogether on Jan. 1 happened earlier this year.\n\nReached at home Tuesday, Kauffman said that she was a benefits counselor at GE, and she remembers explaining to people as they retired from the company that they could count of the Medicare plans.\n\nShe now feels the burden of GE going back on its word. She has gotten calls from retirees from all over the world from GE retirees.\n\nGE estimates that the average retiree is currently paying about $3,608 annually through the GE plans, and that 78 percent of the retirees who switch will pay the same or less than they paid through GE. Of the 22 percent who will pay more, GE says 60 percent of those will only see an increase of $500 a year.\n\nGE says it is canceling the plans because of the cost to shareholders, current employees and other factors, although it said that changes to the Medicare marketplace has created plans that are cheaper than the GE plans.\n\nKauffman says she\u2019s taken up the cause because she used to travel the country explaining their post-retirement benefits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be able to buy coverage,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal for me. But GE doesn\u2019t need to do this.\u201d\n\nGE said in a recent regulatory filing that the move saves it $586 million in future obligations.\n\nKauffman says it will be a lot more difficult for GE to restore the Medicare plans after the Jan. 1 deadline, which is why she is hopeful that a temporary injunction will come before then.\n\nGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Buzz: Business news", "description": "General Electric retirees who have filed a lawsuit against the company seeking to stop it from dropping health insurance benefits for while-collar retirees are hopeful that the judge overseeing the\u2026", "title": "GE retirees hopeful that judge will rule soon in Medicare case", "url": "http://blog.timesunion.com/business/ge-says-health-insurance-lawsuit-putting-retirees-at-risk/62902/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-23T16:31:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-23T21:09:36+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc5f\"", "article_summary": "Back in 2012, GE canceled the Medicare plans for GE retirees who had not yet reached 65.\nShe has gotten calls from retirees from all over the world from GE retirees.\nThe suit seeks an injunction against GE, a judge\u2019s order to halt GE\u2019s plans to end the health benefits Jan. 1.\nThe GE plans provide \u201cgap\u201d coverage of Medicare, which is the health insurance plan that covers most Americans after they turn 65.\nThe company had previously offered Medicare gap plans that covered different parts of Medicare coverage, and will now offer 65-and older retirees a $1,000 subsidy instead toward the Medicare gap options offered by OneExchange."}
