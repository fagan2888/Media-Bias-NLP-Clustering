The New York Times puts it at 58 percent. Other top pollsters agree with the Times, saying the GOP\u2019s odds of a Senate majority are strong but slimmer. Only Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball strongly disagrees, saying that many Democratic incumbents will not be beaten.\n\nWhat would it look like if Republicans controlled Congress under President Obama? In the short term, there is no evidence that they would govern with restraint. The specter of veto wars from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other looms large. In the long term, the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court hangs in the balance. And today\u2019s younger voters, who helped elect Obama, will keep seeing a government that can\u2019t solve problems, which pollsters are saying has pushed some millennials to embrace Libertarian values.\n\nThe results could be even worse for the country than Rupert Murdoch's latest corporate takeover attempt, in which his Fox News media empire is seeking to buy Time Warner, Inc. If successful, that merger could mean that right-wing propaganda would creep into much of the media content fed to Americans. That\u2019s discouraging enough. But a government held hostage by Republicans ideologues only benefits the GOP. Too many of today\u2019s Republicans have run for office pledging to obstruct government and to cut public services.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the federal budget.\n\nThe latest plan put forth by Rep. Paul Ryan, the House budget architect, distilled \u201cevery form of right-wing lunacy,\u201d Democratic Florida Rep. Alan Grayson said in April. Ryan released his 100-page budget bill at 7pm on a Friday and Democrats had to file their amendments by noon the following Monday, Greyson noted, calling it a typical strong-arm tactic. Today, those proposals go nowhere in a Democratic Senate. But what would the GOP do if it could?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in there,\u201d Grayson wrote in a Huffington Post column:\n\n\u201cTax cuts for the rich, the so-called \u2018job creators.\u2019 Tax cuts for multinational corporations, the other so-called \u2018job creators.\u2019 (Why don\u2019t we ever call them by their real name, job exporters?) Cuts in middle-class tax benefits, like deduction for pension benefits and IRAs, to pay for this (Robin Hood in reverse). Cuts in Medicaid and food stamps, because, you know, the Republicans want to make millions of sick, hungry people more self-reliant. A legal requirement to force the president to cut Social Security benefits and/or raise Social Security taxes, to make Obama do the Republicans\u2019 dirty work for them. Big jumps in student loan interest rates. And massive increases in military expenditures.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more devilish details. Right now, Medicaid\u2014state-run healthcare for the poor\u2014pays below-market reimbursements. Under Obamacare, many blue states used additional federal funds to extend Medicaid coverage to millions of uninsured people. Ryan\u2019s plan, however, seeks to cut $732 billion in future Medicaid spending. That would hit children, elderly and disabled people the hardest, wrote Bruce Leslie of First Focus Campaign for Children. Similarly, you could expect a GOP-controlled Congress to pass bills ordering federal agencies they don\u2019t like to issue new rules that would stymie specific programs, such as how Obamacare works at Health and Human Services, or gutting new power plant emission standards at EPA.\n\nYou could also expect Republican vendettas to try to block Democratic governors from tackling problems that have been frozen in Congress. As the Times reported Thursday, the House\u2019s new Majority Leader, California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, pledged to block funds for California Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s biggest response to climate change: a high-speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Other examples were cited, suggesting that extreme stances by the GOP leadership could become law.\n\nWhat else might Americans see? The House GOP has enough votes to start the impeachment process, as some members seek, but there aren\u2019t enough Republicans in the Senate\u2014two-thirds are needed\u2014to remove Obama. In contrast, a GOP Senate could launch investigations into the deaths of four diplomats in Libya, as a way to keep attacking Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 aspirations. Republicans could empower a special prosecutor to look into what they claim is an IRS scandal over denying Tea Party groups the legal status of tax-free charities\u2014a cause celebre at GOP-friendly Fox News.\n\nA GOP Senate would likely do everything to thwart Obama\u2019s next Supreme Court nominee, if one of its aging justices retire or die in 2015 or 2016. The public has seen who Republicans like on the Court. Republican presidential appointees, especially Chief Justice John Roberts, have issued rulings that have resulted in the Court being labeled the most pro-corporate Court in 70 years. Senate Republican anger over Obama appointing federal judges\u2014after Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid changed the filibuster rule to thwart GOP obsructionism on federal judgeships\u2014would emerge.\n\nObama, for his part, would likely become the vetoer-in-chief, rejecting bill after bill from the GOP-run Congress. In the recent past, House Republicans have tried to break up major legislation\u2014such as immigration reform\u2014 into smaller bills to pass what they like and kill what they don't. We could expect similar uncompromising tactics, like Republicans sending Obama spending bills restoring cuts from the so-called sequester for the Pentagon, and then separating bills cutting funds for agencies they don\u2019t like.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, the GOP would claim that Obama and the Democrats have become the party of vetos and saying no. People who don\u2019t pay close attention would see a federal government tied up in terrible knots. Republicans would like that, saying they are fulfilling campaign pledges to stop spending. And young people who want to believe in government as a problem-solving force would become increasingly skeptical, and keep drifting in Libertarian directions, which pollsters say is already happening.\n\nRight now, WaPo is forecasting there\u2019s an 86 percent chance the Senate will have a Republican majority after November. Those aren\u2019t the odds found at the New York Times, the Cook Political Report or the Rothenberg Political Report. And Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball says the GOP has a long way to go toward ousting the Democratic incumbents who stand between it and a Senate majority.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Democrats should not be worried. If Democrats keep their Senate majority, it will likely be by one or two seats. Meanwhile, Americans who care about effective federal government and a fair-minded judiciary should take notice. If you think things are tied up in Washington now, they can get a lot worse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Washington Post predicts the Republicans will win big this fall.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "The Washington Post predicts the Republicans will win big this fall.", "title": "The Next National Nightmare: A Republican Majority Congress in 2015", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/election-2014/next-national-nightmare-republican-majority-congress-2015", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/mitch_mcconnell_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "The Next National Nightmare: A Republican Majority Congress in 2015"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T20:41:00"}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf8d\"", "article_summary": "The Next National Nightmare: A Republican Majority Congress in 2015Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican leader.\nRight now, WaPo is forecasting there\u2019s an 86 percent chance the Senate will have a Republican majority after November.\nIf Democrats keep their Senate majority, it will likely be by one or two seats.\nOther top pollsters agree with the Times, saying the GOP\u2019s odds of a Senate majority are strong but slimmer.\nSenate Republican anger over Obama appointing federal judges\u2014after Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid changed the filibuster rule to thwart GOP obsructionism on federal judgeships\u2014would emerge."}
