Anyone brave enough to enter a retail store this close to Christmas knows why \u2014 the shelves need restocking, the floors need cleaning, and someone has to get a little sleep. Only supermarkets and convenience stores make enough sales in the wee hours of the morning to justify the cost of round-the-clock operations, and even then those stores are usually only in higher-population areas.\n\nThis Christmas season, though, a couple of major retailers plan to keep the doors open for several days, right up to Christmas Eve:\n\nHere\u2019s some welcome news for all the procrastinators out there. Catering to last-minute shoppers, Toys R Us said Monday that it will keep its doors open for 87 hours straight leading up to Christmas. \u2026 \u201cWith only eight shopping days remaining until Christmas, we are offering customers extended, uninterrupted time in stores, providing them the opportunity to shop whenever is most convenient for them,\u201d said Troy Rice, Toys R Us\u2019 executive vice president of stores and services. Locations nationwide will open Saturday at 6 a.m. and remain open until 9 p.m. Christmas Eve. They will also offer shoppers the option to buy items online and pick them up in-store within an hour.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not welcome news to Toys-R-Us managers, and not for the corporation itself. The accumulated debt of the venerable childrens\u2019 toy store has become a lot less attractive recently, and Moody\u2019s already has its paper in junk status. They need a big Christmas to get them out of the hole, but history is already working against them:\n\nBond market watchers at Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2014a separate arm of the company from the group that actually rates the bonds\u2014have been watching the dropping prices carefully. They say the price declines \u201cimply that investors may well consider the upcoming holiday season to be a make-or-break time for the company.\u201d In fact, Moody\u2019s analysts say Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bonds are trading at such low prices, you\u2019d typically expect to see them on the bonds of an entity with a single \u201cC\u201d credit rating. That\u2019s four notches lower than the \u201cCaa1\u2033 rating that Moody\u2019s credit-rating arm has assigned to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. \u201cSingle C is the lowest notch on the ratings scale,\u201d said Jerry Tempelman, an analyst with Moody\u2019s Analytics who\u2019s been watching the performance of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us securities. \u201cEven Caa1 is considered deep junk, but single C is as low as it gets.\u201d According to Tempelman, Moody\u2019s Analytics looked at some 262 other instances when such a four-notch negative discrepancy has occurred since 1999. The result? Around 80% of the time, the company had defaulted within three years.\n\nThe debt comes from a leveraged buyout a few years ago, which was supposed to be resolved with an IPO in 2010 taking the firm public again. Toys-R-Us finally dropped that plan in March of this year, and investors have soured on it since. The move to a 24-hour operation makes a lot more sense with this context in mind \u2014 they have to capture the public\u2019s imagination, and score as much traffic as they can.\n\nBut Toys-R-Us isn\u2019t the only retailer with this idea. The discount department store Kohl\u2019s, which is a lot healthier than Toys-R-Us, announced almost two weeks ago that they would do the same thing:\n\nIn the wake of a Black Friday weekend that pushed retailers\u2019 hours earlier and earlier\u2014in many cases leading to Thanksgiving Day openings\u2014Kohl\u2019s said Thursday that it will extend its holiday schedule to 24 hours a day at most of its locations in the days leading up to Christmas. For the first time ever, the retailer will open its doors at 6 a.m. on Friday, Dec. 20, and keep them open until 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve\u2014meaning they will be open for more than 100 straight hours. Last year, stores were open from 6 a.m. to midnight leading up to Dec. 24. \u201cThe holiday season is an eventful time for families, and Kohl\u2019s is making it easy for shoppers to wrap up their last-minute gift giving,\u201d Michelle Gass, the retailer\u2019s chief customer officer, said in a release. Because of the shortened calendar\u2014there are six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year compared with last year\u2014retailers are coming up with new ways to steal share from competitors and bring shoppers into their stores. These include extended hours and dramatic price cuts.\n\nToys-R-Us and Macy\u2019s did this last year, when it was more of a novelty. This is starting to look like a trend, especially in the highly-competitive one-upsmanship world of retail. It won\u2019t be long before other retailers look at the lost opportunities in the graveyard shift and start keeping doors open as well, just as it hasn\u2019t taken long for Thanksgiving Day to become a competitive retail shopping day.\n\nLet\u2019s poll readers. Would you take advantage of all-night Christmas shopping, or would you stick with the usual retail hours?\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Desperation?", "title": "Latest fad in Christmas shopping: Staying open all night long", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/17/latest-fad-in-christmas-shopping-staying-open-all-night-long/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-17T14:26:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-17T14:51:11+00:00"}, "keywords": "Christmas, Kohl's, retail, shopping, Toys R Us,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3a1\"", "article_summary": "Catering to last-minute shoppers, Toys R Us said Monday that it will keep its doors open for 87 hours straight leading up to Christmas.\nLatest fad in Christmas shopping: Staying open all night longposted at 9:26 am on December 17, 2013 by Ed MorrisseyRetail employees are used to working long hours during the Christmas shopping season, but usually the stores will close for a few hours each day.\nLocations nationwide will open Saturday at 6 a.m. and remain open until 9 p.m. Christmas Eve.\nWould you take advantage of all-night Christmas shopping, or would you stick with the usual retail hours?\nThat\u2019s four notches lower than the \u201cCaa1\u2033 rating that Moody\u2019s credit-rating arm has assigned to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us."}
