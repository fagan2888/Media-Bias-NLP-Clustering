He was arraigned on two felony counts of peeping tom with electronic equipment in Grady County on Monday afternoon.\n\nCopeland is accused of secretly videotaping a young woman in Chickasha. Court records show he recorded the woman undressing, on at least two occasions, in 2011.\n\n\"We are in possession of some DVDs in which he filmed this young lady in her bedroom,\" said Cortnie Siess, assistant district attorney for Grady County.\n\nProsecutors allege Copeland tried to destroy the possible evidence by running some of the discs through a garbage disposal.\n\nTurns out, someone had replaced the recordings with blanks discs.\n\nInvestigators recovered most of the videos that ultimately led to Copeland's arrest.\n\nThe arrest also called his role as a board member for Chickasha Public Schools into question.\n\nChickasha Superintendent Jim Glaze confirmed, at this point, Copeland is still a board member.\n\n\"The board is monitoring the situation to determine the next steps,\" Glaze said.\n\n\"The fact that he held positions in this community and he was allegedly doing these acts\u2026maliciously, and without the young lady's consent is absolutely concerning,\" Siess said.\n\nCopeland could attend the next board meeting in February if he posts a $75,000 bond.\n\nThe judge also set certain restrictions for Copeland's bond. He is not allowed to contact the victim in this case or any of the state's witnesses.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Ryan Eric Copeland was booked into the Grady County Jail over the weekend.", "author": "Lisa Monahan", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24557313/police-arrest-chickasha-school-board-member-on-peeping-tom-complaint", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24557313_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ryan Eric Copeland was booked into the Grady County Jail over the weekend.", "title": "Chickasha School Board Member Arrested On Peeping Tom Complaint"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24557313_SA.jpg", "description": "Ryan Eric Copeland was booked into the Grady County Jail over the weekend.", "card": "summary", "title": "Chickasha School Board Member Arrested On Peeping Tom Complaint"}, "wnreadableurl": "police-arrest-chickasha-school-board-member-on-peeping-tom-complaint", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/01/27", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,chickasha,grady,county,ryan,eric,copeland,jail,arrested,school,board,peeping,tom,news9.com,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS27", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,chickasha,grady,county,ryan,eric,copeland,jail,arrested,school,board,peeping,tom,news9.com,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf458\"", "article_summary": "Prosecutors file peeping tom charges against a Chickasha School Board member.\nHe was arraigned on two felony counts of peeping tom with electronic equipment in Grady County on Monday afternoon.\nCopeland is accused of secretly videotaping a young woman in Chickasha.\nChickasha Superintendent Jim Glaze confirmed, at this point, Copeland is still a board member.\nThe arrest also called his role as a board member for Chickasha Public Schools into question."}
