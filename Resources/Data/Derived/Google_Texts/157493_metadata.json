A few years ago, the Oscar-winning actress, who is currently closing out the New York Philharmonic\u2019s season playing Joan of Arc, thought she might put aside performing in favor of working with environmental group Greenpeace.\n\n\u201cI was too passionate about my job to start to get angry,\u201d she told Speakeasy in a recent interview at the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side neighborhood. \u201cBut I need to be creative.\u201d\n\nMarion Cotillard attended the \u2018Ice & Sky\u2019 launch Dennis Van Tine/Zuma Press\n\nLooking fresh-faced and comfortable in a red-and-black checked dress paired with oxfords, Cotillard moves briskly along a corridor buzzing with French-speaking passers-by until\u2014spotting a toddler playing nearby on the floor\u2014she pauses to smile and wave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought about the next generation, but now it\u2019s not just words,\u201d said Cotillard, who has a four-year-old son with partner Guillaume Canet. \u201cI\u2019m connected to the next generation.\u201d\n\nWhile she hasn\u2019t shied away from personally participating in demonstrations, like climbing into a cage and calling for the release of 30 Greenpeace activists in 2013, the 39-year-old actress also lends her voice to other causes.\n\nThe latest is Ice & Sky, a climate-change initiative by \u201cMarch of the Penguins\u201d director Luc Jacquet that has film, television and educational components. It will also involve an expedition back to Antarctica, ten years after \u201cPenguins,\u201d to document environmental changes that have taken place there.\n\nThe movie, which closed the Cannes Film Festival this year and will be released in France and the rest of Europe at the end of October, follows the career and discoveries of glaciologist Claude Lorius, who\u2014over the course of decades\u2014collected and analyzed ice samples going back hundreds of thousands of years, and found that consistent intervals of warming and cooling occurred in regular patterns until about 150 years ago, when a spike in temperatures emerged in the data.\n\n\u201cThe validation of scientists is very important today to share because now there are no questions anymore about are we responsible for the climate changes,\u201d said Cotillard, punctuating her remark with a look of intensity familiar from her on-screen roles.\n\nShe\u2019s unfazed by skeptics, too. \u201cWhen I was younger, I would fight to try to make this set of people understand that they were wrong,\u201d she said, taking a sip of tea from a stainless-steel travel mug.\n\n\u201cToday, I want to focus on people who want to make a difference and who want to be aware of our impact.\u201d That means influencing governments, and forums like the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which takes place in Paris starting in November.\n\nStill, the impact of Cotillard\u2019s activism is largely dependent on her blazing career, which has adroitly pivoted from art-house films like \u201cTwo Days, One Night\u201d to blockbusters like \u201cInception\u201d and \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d Her upcoming turn as Lady Macbeth, opposite Michael Fassbender, has already generated considerable buzz. And she\u2019s also set to start filming \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed,\u201d a movie based on the popular Ubisoft videogame, this fall.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky that today I can go from Shakespeare to \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed,\u2019 to a French movie to a Belgian movie,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted when I was a kid\u2014I wanted to jump from a world to another and I was the biggest fan of Peter Sellers, who was able to do this.\u201d\n\nIt was time for her next appointment in a jam-packed schedule and, turning back to the topic of climate change, she flashed that intense look again. \u201cWe\u2019re super late,\u201d she said, standing up to leave. \u201cSo we need to get the party started\u2014the green party started.\u201d\n\nWrite to Robin Kawakami at Robin.Kawakami@wsj.com.
