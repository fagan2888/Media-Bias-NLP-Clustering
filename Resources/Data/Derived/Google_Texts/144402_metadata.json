Prosecutors had considered calling former public health director Dr. Eric Whitaker, a close friend of President Barack Obama, as a witness but demurred when, in outside testimony, Whitaker accused the U.S. attorney\u2019s office of racial bias. Whitaker is black, and 13 of the 14 people the unit has indicted since 2011 are black.\n\nQuestions about race are fair, but evidence is colorblind, Lewis told reporters Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhen cases are presented on an analysis of money and an analysis of evidence, it\u2019s not about a person\u2019s race, gender, national origin, or anything else,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s about evidence and following the money.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019s boss, Attorney General Eric Holder, who is black and a friend of Whitaker, told the Chicago Sun-Times that his central Illinois prosecutors are fair.\n\nKarin Dingle is the only white defendant among those convicted. The other 12 who are black include:\n\n\u2022 Quinshaunta Golden, former Department of Public Health chief of staff who controlled the grants to the Dingles. Pleaded guilty in April to bribery and theft involving $772,500 in taxpayer money she shared with former IDPH employee Roxanne Jackson, who also entered a guilty plea in September. They await sentencing.\n\n\u2022 Jacquelyn Kilpatrick, who stole $900,000. The Dingles blamed the bookkeeper for their troubles. Kilpatrick and her partner, Edmond Clemons, have pleaded guilty in the ruse. Kilpatrick and Clemons await sentencing.\n\n\u2022 Margaret Davis, former director of the Chicago chapter of the Black Nurses Association. Pleaded guilty in July 2011 to taking at least $500,000 from more than $1 million in grants received from four state agencies. Sentenced to 41 months in prison and ordered to pay $377,575 in restitution.\n\n\u2022 Tonja Cook, Davis\u2019s associate. Pleaded guilty for assisting Davis and sentenced to 19 months in prison.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Daily Chronicle", "og": {"url": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2014/12/20/u-s-criminal-probes-nab-13-race-questions-raised/a2lblfv/", "image": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/ixd3kbkh4hwpi9p1wde3ktrgfdos9xd", "site_name": "Daily Chronicle", "description": "SPRINGFIELD \u2013 In the past three years, U.S. Attorney James Lewis\u2019s office has dug up enough evidence of stolen taxpayer money to justify prison time for more than a dozen people \u2013 including a Chicago couple after their 17-count conviction this week for stealing $3.4 million in state grant funds to sustain a sumptuous lifestyle.", "title": "U.S. criminal probes nab 13; race questions raised"}, "twitter": {"site": "@daily_chronicle", "image": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/ixd3kbkh4hwpi9p1wde3ktrgfdos9xd", "description": "SPRINGFIELD \u2013 In the past three years, U.S. Attorney James Lewis\u2019s office has dug up enough evidence of stolen taxpayer money to justify prison time for more than a dozen people \u2013 including a Chicago couple after their 17-count conviction this week for stealing $3.4 million in state grant funds to sustain a sumptuous lifestyle.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "U.S. criminal probes nab 13; race questions raised"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109104291", "tout": {"article": {"id": "52f08ca2-3638-4613-9570-815b14bcf01c"}}, "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The case of Leon and Karin Dingle is one of the more brazen cases that Lewis\u2019 public corruption task force has encountered since it formed several years ago.\nKilpatrick and her partner, Edmond Clemons, have pleaded guilty in the ruse.\nWhitaker is black, and 13 of the 14 people the unit has indicted since 2011 are black.\nPleaded guilty in July 2011 to taking at least $500,000 from more than $1 million in grants received from four state agencies.\nPleaded guilty for assisting Davis and sentenced to 19 months in prison."}
