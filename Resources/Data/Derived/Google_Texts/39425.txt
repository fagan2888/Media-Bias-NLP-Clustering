WASHINGTON — The guest list for President Obama’s upcoming State of the Union address just got more interesting.

Yesterday, Sean Hannity said he’d be attending as a guest of Rep. Louie Gohmert. Hannity is a conservative pundit for Fox News. He’s had Gohmert, an outspoken critic of Obama, on his show a number of times. The Tyler Republican has even filled in hosting Hannity’s show on a few occasions.

Turns out, Hannity may have his own political ambitions in the Lone Star state.

“The answer is yes, I’d think about it,” Hannity said when a viewer asked via Facebook about his inclination to run for office eventually. “It would either be in Texas or Florida.” Hannity, who has indicated he’s leaving what he calls “anti-conservative” New York, later contrasted the state with Texas.

“How does Texas have a $12 billion surplus when they’re in debt up to their eyeballs in Albany?” he asked. He indicated Texas and Florida’s lack of income tax were appealing lures.

Other Texas conservatives have also invited high-profile guests to the president’s big speech. Rep. Steve Stockman has invited Chad Henderson, the former Obama volunteer who told reporters in October about his success signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Later, he revealed he did not actually enroll.

“I look forward to giving Chad the opportunity to attend the State of the Union Address. Now when President Obama speaks about ObamaCare the media will have someone they can cut to,” said Stockman in a statement. “I encourage the President to acknowledge him and his story.”

Stockman’s no stranger to inviting controversial guests. Last year, he invited rockstar and gun advocate Ted Nugent. Nugent caused an outcry during the 2012 presidential elections when he said he would end up “dead or in jail” if Obama was re-elected.
