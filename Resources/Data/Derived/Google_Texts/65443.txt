Michelle Nunn (D., Ga.) again refused Monday to give an answer when pressed by a reporter to answer if would have voted for Obamacare.

“So, I’ve said that I wasn’t there, obviously, six years ago,” Nunn said.

Obviously. At least Nunn can say she’s consistent in her refusal to answer simple questions.

It was nearly an identical exchange to a moment Sunday during her debate with Republican opponent, David Perdue (R., Ga.).

Nunn trails Perdue in the race to fill the seat of retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss.
