Bert Jones broadened the debate telling the chamber that allowing same-sex marriages to take place was going against God\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cI believe in my heart that as we move further and further away from God and from his word, that we can expect to see his blessings disappear,\u201d reasoned Jones.\n\nSurry County Rep. Sarah Stevens suggested that this would not pose a hardship in the state\u2019s smaller counties as anyone could go online and get a license to perform weddings, leaving magistrates out of the equation.\n\nRep.
