Serving out the full term would preclude her from running as a vice presidential candidate next year.\n\n\u201cI truly love this job, and it\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about,\u201d Warren said.\n\nBut will she stay in the job for the duration?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has changed any of my thinking on this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m working hard.\u201d\n\nShe also shed light on her private luncheon last month with Biden, who polled well against Clinton in a recent Quinnipiac University survey of three swing states.\n\nWarren said that she and Biden discussed several topics including helping the middle class and \u201cthe capture of this country\u201d by the wealthy and powerful. Warren demurred when asked if there was talk, even jokingly, of her joining Biden on the Democratic ticket if he enters the primary and wins the nomination.\n\n\u201cIt was a long conversation,\u201d Warren said.\n\nOn Wednesday, she also hit on many of the talking points that have established her as a fiery progressive and the bane of student lenders, large banks, and corporations chafing at her calls for stricter regulation of their industries.\n\nOn student loans, she asserted that the federal government is \u201ccharging too much interest\u201d and \u201cshould not be making a profit off the backs of our kids.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren on her potential White House bid\n\nElizabeth Warren talks White House politics\n\nShe also vigorously defended the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature health care law that has helped millions of Americans get insurance but has also been plagued by myriad problems including a disastrous roll-out of a government website.\n\n\u201cIs it perfect yet? No, but I don\u2019t require that for an A,\u201d said Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor. \u201cIt [leads] us in the right direction, and it has provided protections that we did not have before.\u201d\n\nShe told the host of the event, Boston Globe reporter Joshua Miller, that a provision of the law on prescription drug coverage will help \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of seniors in Massachusetts. She also highlighted the fact that young people can now remain on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26, and cited prohibitions against denying coverage for sick people.\n\nWhile Warren made no mention of the Republican candidates for president, she leveled criticism at the GOP when she described the Democrats\u2019 recent push to expand Social Security benefits for citizens who \u201cneed it most.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have clashed over Social Security in recent years, with some conservatives proposing changes to the entitlement program that have drawn criticism from liberals, who say the changes amount to cuts that would harm the nation\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.\n\n\u201cWhy are all the Democrats ready to talk about Social Security?\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhy are all the Republicans trying to find reverse on their limousines to back this up? ... It\u2019s because people all around the country said this matters.\u201d\n\nOther topics included a state ballot question to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and Warren, who previously opposed such legalization, said she is now \u201copen to it.\u201d\n\nShe also called for increased funding for medical research, and lamented the fact that she and her colleagues were unable to pass gun control legislation months after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings.\n\nAsked if she has found common ground with any of her Republican colleagues in Washington, Warren said she is working with Utah Senator Mike Lee on banking regulations and with Oklahoma Senator James Lankford on efforts to make settlement agreements between the government and large companies public.\n\nThere were also humorous moments, with Warren declaring her preference for light beer, which she termed the \u201cnectar of the gods,\u201d and her weakness for fast food.\n\n\u201cSometimes we do Chipotle,\u201d she said. \u201cI could probably close my eyes and recite most of the McDonald\u2019s menu.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren on her food habits", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.124671340", "eomportal-id": 113174, "description": "Amid speculation that she may be a vice presidential candidate in 2016, US Senator Elizabeth Warren said Wednesday that she will probably endorse a Democratic nominee for president during the primary and refused to say whether she will serve out her full Senate term.", "eomportal-instanceid": 26, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Amid speculation that she may be a vice presidential candidate in 2016, US Senator Elizabeth Warren said Wednesday that she will probably endorse a Democratic nominee for president during the primary and refused to say whether she will serve out her full Senate term.", "title": "Sen.
