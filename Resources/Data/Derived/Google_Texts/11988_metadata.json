( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images )\n\nCovered California still faces major challenges in enrolling African-Americans and Latinos as the state\u2019s health insurance exchange launched its third open enrollment period Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve come up short in who\u2019s enrolled today,\u201d Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee said at a recent media briefing on the exchange\u2019s marketing and outreach plans. \u201cOf those who are still uninsured, we want to make sure we reach them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve come up short in who\u2019s enrolled today.\u201d\n\nPeter Lee, Covered California Executive Director\n\nAbout 2.4 percent of the exchange\u2019s approximately 1.3 million enrollees are African-American, only about half of the blacks considered eligible for subsidies because of their income. Another 30 percent are Latino; 37 percent are considered eligible for subsidies, according to Covered California data.\n\nIn contrast, enrollment of whites and Asians has exceeded eligibility projections, meaning that Covered California was better able to reach those groups. The state\u2019s enrollment data is not exact, because more than a quarter of enrollees decline to state their race.\n\nWhile many more California Latinos and African-Americans have become insured since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, including through the state\u2019s Medi-Cal expansion and employer-based insurance, Covered California\u2019s experience echoes that of other states trying to ensure that their minority populations get the health coverage they need, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAbout 55 percent of the nation\u2019s remaining 32.3 million uninsured under age 65 are people of color, including 34 percent who identify as Hispanic/Latino and 14 percent who identify as black, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data.\n\nIn California, about 2.2 million Californians remain uninsured but are eligible for Medi-Cal or Covered California insurance plans, Lee said. They are more likely to be Latino and African-American, and younger and slightly more affluent than current enrollees, who may have qualified for subsidies or Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid.\n\nCovered California has earmarked about $50 million for marketing and another $13 million for navigators \u2014 trained counselors who help people learn about and sign up for coverage. The exchange unveiled its new advertising campaign Friday, including ads specifically targeted to Latinos and African-Americans. Covered California\u2019s open enrollment runs from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nExplanations for the disproportionately low enrollments of eligible African-Americans and Latinos vary. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people who don\u2019t trust the government,\u201d said Dan Daniels, coastal area director of the NAACP California State Conference, who oversaw Affordable Care Act outreach in his region.\n\nDaniels also cited attitudes among \u201cyoung invincibles,\u201d who are healthy enough to think they don\u2019t need coverage and are willing to pay the mandatory penalty for not having health insurance. That penalty will rise in 2016 to $695 per person or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is higher.\n\nAmong some Latinos who are legal residents, there is fear that applying for health insurance through Covered California will jeopardize the immigration status of other family members, Levitt said.\n\nAnd affordability remains a looming concern for higher-income people of color who may not be eligible for subsidies or Medi-Cal.\n\nFor example, Kemisha Roston, a 38-year-old contract lawyer from Riverside, said she makes too much money to qualify for those programs, but not enough to afford Covered California unsubsidized premiums \u2013 which top $300 per month \u2014 while she pays off student debt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m living check to check, because the market for attorneys is very saturated,\u201d Roston said. \u201cMy health is pretty good right now, so I don\u2019t need to go to the doctor. When I do, I go to free clinics or Planned Parenthood. I\u2019m dismayed, because if something does happen and I don\u2019t have health insurance, I could be wiped out.\u201d\n\nIn addition, some community leaders and health advocates have criticized Covered California\u2019s previous marketing and outreach efforts to both African-American and Latino communities as too generalized and impersonal. The exchange has spent more money on marketing and outreach than other exchanges, with less to show for it, said Hector De La Torre, executive director of the Transamerica Center for Health Studies.\n\n\u201cYou have these challenges in these communities and it takes a lot more than a TV commercial to make them aware of what they need to do -\u2013 you can\u2019t do that in 30 seconds,\u201d De La Torre said, referring to the need to educate people about the basic value of health insurance. \u201cThat\u2019s where Covered California has not done as much as it could in reaching out to these folks. It\u2019s a face-to-face communication effort that needs to take place.\u201d\n\nCharla Franklin, community outreach liaison for Healthy African American Families, an advocacy group in Los Angeles, said Covered California did well in reaching out to California\u2019s black churches and community groups to get the word out. But the advertising campaign in her area was \u201cso bland it was ridiculous,\u201d she said. The exchange really needed to better inform people about specific community events and places where people could get in-person help with the complicated and time-consuming online enrollment process, she said.\n\nLee has told reporters recently that Covered California is stepping up its ground game and changing its messaging. Consumer surveys have shown that potential enrollees need more education on how subsidies can lower their out-of-pocket costs, he said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it will pursue a similar strategy of publicizing financial help available to many people.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take it as a given that Californians understand that health care is more affordable because subsidies are available,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be getting back to basics.\u201d\n\nThe exchange is also expanding its direct outreach efforts, more than doubling the number of Covered California storefronts where people can get help to enroll to 500, Lee said.\n\nBut while Lee promised \u201ca more intense ground game,\u201d he also cautioned against overly high expectations for the exchange\u2019s third open enrollment season.\n\n\u201cWe have millions of Californians who\u2019ve adopted a culture of coping. They don\u2019t understand they have subsidies available to them and are making do. It\u2019s going to be years to change to a culture of coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two million Californians are eligible for Obamacare benefits -- but have not signed up for insurance.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Covered California Targets African Americans, Latinos In Obamacare Open Enrollment\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/02\\/covered-california-targets-african-americans-latinos-in-obamacare-open-enrollment\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-02 11:09:46\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-02 13:17:21\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":102095,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Insurance\",\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/GettyImages-481763413-e1446490567646.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Two million Californians are eligible for Obamacare benefits -- but have not signed up for insurance.", "title": "Covered California Targets African Americans, Latinos In Obamacare Open Enrollment", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/02/covered-california-targets-african-americans-latinos-in-obamacare-open-enrollment/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/GettyImages-481763413-1440x984.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In California, about 2.2 million Californians remain uninsured but are eligible for Medi-Cal or Covered California insurance plans, Lee said.\n( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images )Covered California still faces major challenges in enrolling African-Americans and Latinos as the state\u2019s health insurance exchange launched its third open enrollment period Sunday.\nThe state\u2019s enrollment data is not exact, because more than a quarter of enrollees decline to state their race.\nIn contrast, enrollment of whites and Asians has exceeded eligibility projections, meaning that Covered California was better able to reach those groups.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Covered California has not done as much as it could in reaching out to these folks."}
