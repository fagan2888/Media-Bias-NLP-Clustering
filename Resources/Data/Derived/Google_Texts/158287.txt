We all snore on occasion, but for some of us it happens frequently, leading to late-night jabs, pillows over the ears, and a poor night’s sleep. Whether you’re the snorer or the bed partner of a snorer, it’s a nuisance that not only disrupts the quantity and quality of sleep, but can also cause daytime fatigue, irritability, and increased health problems. Rather than sleep in separate rooms from your bed partner, make these changes to your diet to snooze without snoring.

In the U.S., noisy breathing during sleep is a common problem among people of all ages and genders, affecting approximately 90 million American adults and 37 million on a regular basis, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Snoring occurs when the muscles of the throat relax, the tongue falls backward, and the throat becomes narrow and floppy. This causes the walls of the throat to vibrate, specifically when you breathe in and occasionally when you breathe out, which is what produces the snoring sound.

Snoring can be triggered by several factors, including diet. A diet that lowers or restricts foods high in prostaglandin 2 (Pg 2) — lipid compounds that can create swelling or enlargement of the tissues in the throat and sinuses — can potentially decrease the incidence of both sleep apnea and snoring. Kevin Meehan, a holistic practitioner and founder of Meehan Formulations in Jackson, Wyo., believes “any process which increases the obstruction or reduction in the space of the air passageway will usually initiate the vibration of the respiratory structures, resulting in snoring. ... Keeping the obstruction of the throat and nasal passageways down is imperative,” he told Medical Daily in an email.
