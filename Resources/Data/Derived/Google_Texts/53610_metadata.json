But as Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman observes in his New York Times column today, the government has actually gotten it right on some of the most vexing challenges confronting the country, despite the prophecies of anti-government naysayers.\n\nEbola is but the most recent example, Krugman writes. While the virus continues to plague Africa, the U.S. hasn\u2019t seen a new case in weeks, and even a casual consumer of news can hardly help noticing that the disease receives much less media attention now \u2014 and is no longer the subject of political fear-mongering.\n\nKrugman sees a valuable lesson here. More than a public health challenge, he argues, Ebola functioned as a \u201cpolitical metaphor.\u201d Conservatives seized on the outbreak to assail big government incompetence, calling for drastic measures like travel bans and heaping scorns on government experts at agencies like the Centers for Disease Control. But as Krugman points out, those experts \u201cactually did know what they were doing\u201d \u2014 just as the government has deftly handled other complex policy issues.\n\nTake the Energy Department\u2019s renewable energy loan program. Chances are that if you\u2019ve heard of it, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve read about the failure of Solyndra, a renewable energy company whose failure cost the government more than half a billion dollars. Republicans pounced on Solyndra\u2019s collapse to deride federal subsidies and crony capitalism, but they were mysteriously silent last week when the Energy Department reported that its renewable energy program has actually turned a $5 billion profit overall.\n\n\u201cThe question is not whether the Department of Energy has made some bad loans \u2014 if it hasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not taking enough risks. It\u2019s whether it has a pattern of bad loans. And the answer, it turns out, is no,\u201d Krugman writes. Shouldn\u2019t the right wing, being enthralled with business, understand that some investments succeed, while others don\u2019t?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember the right's favorite anti-government horror stories?
