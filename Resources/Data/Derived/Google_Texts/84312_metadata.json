Eccles Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C. Bloomberg News\n\nAn effort to expand congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve\u2018s interest-rate decisions is generating buzz on the presidential campaign trail and in Washington, but its prospects on Capitol Hill remain uncertain.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) last month reintroduced legislation that would subject the central bank to more congressional scrutiny and appeared at an \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d rally in support of the bill on Friday in Iowa. The measure has 30 co-sponsors, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). All three men are considering presidential bids in 2016.\n\nFed governor Jerome Powell is set to deliver a speech on Monday about the bill and other related proposals. Presidents of several of the Fed\u2019s regional reserve banks have spoken out in recent days in opposition to the measure, echoing Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen\u2018s concerns that the bill could interfere with the central bank\u2019s ability to do its job free of political pressure.\n\nThe House passed a similar bill in the last Congress, but it went nowhere in the Senate, which was then controlled by Democrats. The proponents\u2019 hopes were boosted when Republicans took control of the upper chamber this year.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s fate, however, depends largely on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky), who ultimately controls whether or when the Senate will vote on it. He is a co-sponsor of the bill, but it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s a priority for him at a time of many other competing demands.\n\nA McConnell spokesman couldn\u2019t provide any updates about when the bill would make it to the Senate floor, or whether it might be offered as an amendment to other legislation.\n\nSeveral financial industry lobbyists said Mr. McConnell has a slew of other measures he wants to advance first, including bills to fund the Department of Homeland Security and extend the Highway Trust Fund and nominations for the Justice and Defense departments. He will also be under pressure to respond to bills sent over by the House, including legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers deserve to know what government agencies are doing in their name,\u201d Mr. McConnell tweeted the day after Mr. Paul introduced the bill.\n\nSenate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), who isn\u2019t a co-sponsor, has expressed interest in holding a hearing on the issue but hasn\u2019t scheduled one, a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe White House says congressional oversight of Fed policy could undermine its independence. \u201cWe think it is important that we not have any encroachments on the independence of the central bank that would result in monetary policy decisions that affect the long-term health of the economy being influenced by short-term political pressures,\u201d White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said about the legislation.\n\nEven if President Barack Obama wanted to veto it as a standalone measure, he might face a tough decision if Republicans passed it as an amendment to another measure with wide support.\n\nCongress did this last year when it amended a bill extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to include a provision earmarking a seat on the Fed board for someone with community banking experience. Mr. Obama signed it into law.\n\nMr. Paul\u2019s legislation directs the Comptroller General to complete an audit within one year of the bill\u2019s enactment and to issue a report of its findings to Congress. It doesn\u2019t define what is meant by an audit.\n\nThe financial statements of the Fed board and reserve banks are audited each year by an outside firm. The Government Accountability Office and Fed inspector general also regularly review its activities.\n\nMr. Paul said in his speech on Friday in Iowa that the Fed\u2019s bookkeeping and monetary policies could lead to serious economic troubles, saying only an audit could sort out its current state \u201cI think there needs to be some sunshine. I\u2019m going to fight \u2019em, and we\u2019re going to get a vote on audit the Fed,\u201d he said to applause from the crowd.\n\nThe bill is causing angst for the Fed and some investors, in part because it comes at such a sensitive time\u2013right as the central bank weighs whether to begin raising interest rates this year.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of evidence to suggest that more politicized central banks deliver worse economic outcomes on both growth and inflation,\u201d said Michael Feroli, the chief U.S. economist for J.P.Morgan Chase. \u201cIf you were to see this pass, it would be viewed as a step toward monetary policy becoming more politicized.\u201d\n\nEnacting the bill \u201cwould be a tremendous mistake because it would ultimately lead to poorer economic performance,\u201d Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday in a speech in Ohio.\n\nSome economists and financial executives said subjecting the Fed\u2019s monetary policy decisions to greater congressional scrutiny would cause investor heartburn and could disrupt markets.\n\nIf the bill were to pass, Mr. Feroli said, investors would probably show less preference for U.S. assets and more preference for assets in places where policy is viewed as less politicized. That likely would be reflected in equity prices, in the value of the dollar and in most financial assets, he added.\n\nChris Krueger, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities LLC, said the bill represents \u201cone of the largest DC-created tail risks for the markets this year,\u201d meaning it has a low probability of taking effect but could do damage if it did.\n\nMark Calabria, a former Shelby aide and Cato Institute fellow who supports the Audit the Fed bill, said a Senate hearing could make a big difference, if the Fed is able to convince members the bill could disrupt markets.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t at this point think the Fed has a lot of credibility with members on this, but I think there are a number of members who are on the fence,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u2013Byron Tau contributed to this article.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nRand Paul Attacks Fed, Calls for Audit of Central Bank\n\nYellen Prepared to Fight A Revived \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d Movement\n\nRon Paul Legacy Lives on as House Passes Fed Audit Bill\n\nRand Paul Faces Balancing Act in Presidential Bid\n\nRon Paul Q&A: Audit the Fed, Then End It (Sept. 16, 2009)", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An effort to expand congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decisions is generating buzz on the presidential campaign trail and in Washington, but its prospects on Capitol Hill remain uncertain.", "title": "\u2018Audit the Fed\u2019 Bill\u2019s Prospects Unclear", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/02/06/audit-the-fed-bills-prospects-unclear/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GU689_0205fe_P_20150204175103.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "\u2018Audit the Fed\u2019 Bill\u2019s Prospects Unclear", "description": "An effort to expand congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decisions is generating buzz on the presidential campaign trail and in Washington, but its prospects on Capitol Hill remain uncertain.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Kate Davidson and Michael R.
