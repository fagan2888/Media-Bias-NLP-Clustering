That was my Howard Beale moment,\u201d said Pontzloff, 62, a writer and acting teacher, who says he needs his coverage to go into effect as soon as possible to pay for open-heart surgery.\n\nHoward Beale is the fictional news anchor who in the classic 1976 film \u201cNetwork\u201d declared on a national broadcast, \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m not going to take this anymore.\u201d It wasn\u2019t TV, but Pontzloff staged a one-man protest a week ago at Pacific Coast Highway and Redondo Avenue, where he carried a sign declaring that he was not receiving the health care he expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty aggressive. I don\u2019t take no for an answer, and I try to get to the right person,\u201d Pontzloff said at his home.\n\nPontzloff said he was moved to protest after visiting a Lakewood cardiologist on Jan. 3 and getting the unwelcome surprise of being unable to verify his health insurance despite receiving a confirmation email from Anthem Blue Cross on New Year\u2019s Day. That message came, he said, at the conclusion of about a month\u2019s work to get signed up for insurance through the state\u2019s insurance exchange, Covered California.\n\n\u201cI came home and I was just furious,\u201d said Pontzloff, who said his days of protesting go back to street theater displays against the Vietnam War. \u201cI was so angry I was starting to get dizzy, and I thought. \u2018You\u2019ve got to do something. You can\u2019t be a victim.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith that attitude, Pontzloff bought a thick black marker at ACE Hardware and made a sign with white poster board. His message, in part: \u201cAfter enrolling in Covered CA and paying Anthem Blue Cross, I was denied service by my doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought. \u2018Where\u2019s the most traffic? PCH.\u2019 \u201d he said, deciding upon a location about two miles from his home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat thought took him to Plaza Zaferia, a grassy spot between the northbound and southbound lanes on Redondo Avenue. He said several motorists and passersby honked their horns or stopped to speak with him during the roughly four hours of his protest.\n\nBut more importantly, Covered California personnel also learned of his protest.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross could not be reached for comment. As of Thursday, however, Covered California reported that Pontzloff is in Anthem Blue Cross\u2019 system as an insured patient.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been notified of the outcome,\u201d Covered California spokesman Roy Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided him a telephone number of his provider, and we\u2019ve confirmed his enrollment.\u201d\n\nPontzloff plans to find out whether his insurance problems are solved when he visits a doctor\u2019s office on Monday.\n\nCovered California is the health insurance exchange created as a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The exchange is intended to provide an avenue for people who meet income eligibility requirements to obtain subsidized health insurance. The law imposes a tax penalty on Americans who forgo health coverage. Last weekend, the deadline for Covered California enrollees to pay their first premium and be covered as of the new year was extended to Jan. 15.\n\nPontzloff started his quest for health insurance in late November. He last had insurance about two or three years ago but decided to drop insurance after weighing the comparative risks of foregoing coverage or adding to his debts by paying for premiums with a credit card, he said.\n\nHe was unable to complete an online application and resorted to hiring a broker to get through the process, which was further complicated due to his being self-employed and needing to estimate his 2014 income.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, his heart condition was unknown to him until after he started the enrollment process, and he has spent more than $500 of his savings on doctor visits.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has been the subject of frequent criticism from conservatives who have spoken against the law\u2019s insurance mandate as well as the much-reported enrollment foul-ups. Pontzloff, by contrast, said his politics are informed by the radicalism of the 1960s, and he does not object to the prospect of government-provided health care as much as what he deems to be the poor execution of policy.\n\n\u201cI wanted a single-payer plan. I wanted Medicare for all,\u201d he said. \u201cI fault the insurance companies, because they knew this wave was coming.\u201d\n\nPontzloff\u2019s Long Beach-based insurance broker, David Neckanoff, said he has worked with 20 to 30 people who have wanted to enroll through Covered California but have experienced difficulties with the process. Covered California\u2019s website refers people who want help enrolling to insurance agents in their area.\n\n\u201cThat part of the whole system is the only part that\u2019s working well,\u201d Neckanoff said. \u201cIf someone needs help, it funnels them to an agent pretty quickly.\n\n\u201cI have had people that have applied five different times because they\u2019re not sure it was effective.\u201d\n\nAs for the Affordable Care Act, Neckanoff said the law has potential to help people who could not otherwise get insurance due to pre-existing conditions or financial difficulties, but he thinks it\u2019s too early to declare whether the law is a success or failure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right one,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I definitely think something needed to change from the way it was.\u201d\n\nFor professional purposes, Pontzloff spells his name Ponzlov. His filmography as an actor includes appearances in \u201cL.A. Law\u201d and \u201cMurder She Wrote,\u201d among other shows. He is also the screenwriter of the 2002 comedy \u201cUndertaking Betty.\u201d\n\nContact Andrew Edwards at 562-499-1305.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LONG BEACH >> The weeks of delays, technical difficulties and waiting to speak to an actual human being that culminated with the revelation that he was not  included among the ranks of the newly insured drove Fred Pontzloff to do what many other", "title": "Long Beach actor turned to protest to solve Affordable Care Act glitch", "og": {"url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/government-and-politics/20140111/long-beach-actor-turned-to-protest-to-solve-affordable-care-act-glitch", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.presstelegram.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LB/20140111/NEWS/140119902/AR/0/AR-140119902.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1065px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Long Beach actor turned to protest to solve Affordable Care Act glitch"}, "twitter": {"domain": "presstelegram.com", "description": "LONG BEACH >> The weeks of delays, technical difficulties and waiting to speak to an actual human being that culminated with the revelation that he was not  included among the ranks of the newly insured drove Fred Pontzloff to do what many other", "title": "Long Beach actor turned to protest to solve Affordable Care Act glitch", "url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/government-and-politics/20140111/long-beach-actor-turned-to-protest-to-solve-affordable-care-act-glitch", "image": {"src": "http://www.presstelegram.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LB/20140111/NEWS/140119902/AR/0/AR-140119902.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@presstelegram", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551754518", "iphone": "id502958939", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.longbeachpresstelegram"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Health care reform, Health care reform news, Long Beach Health care reform news, CA Health care reform news, US Health care reform news, world Health care reform news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Health care reform, Health care reform news, Long Beach Health care reform news, CA Health care reform news, US Health care reform news, world Health care reform news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f63\"", "article_summary": "Covered California is the health insurance exchange created as a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nThat message came, he said, at the conclusion of about a month\u2019s work to get signed up for insurance through the state\u2019s insurance exchange, Covered California.\nAnd if things work out, as a representative of the state\u2019s new health insurance exchange says it will, that may have been just what was needed to solve Pontzloff\u2019s problem.\nLast weekend, the deadline for Covered California enrollees to pay their first premium and be covered as of the new year was extended to Jan. 15.\nThe exchange is intended to provide an avenue for people who meet income eligibility requirements to obtain subsidized health insurance."}
