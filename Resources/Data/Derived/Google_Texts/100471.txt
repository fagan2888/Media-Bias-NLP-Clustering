A proposed rule by the Food and Drug Administration on the manufacturing of animal feed has the potential to be disastrous to another industry important to Colorado — craft brewing.

Brewers soak grains in hot water to expunge their sugars, which are fermented with yeast to make beer. The spent grains are then sold or given to local farmers to feed livestock.

In changes to the Food Safety Modernization Act that were proposed in December, the government has said it wants to have more regulation of animal feed.

One consequence, however, could be unnecessary expenses for breweries — requiring them to dry, analyze and package spent grains before sending them to farmers.

Most breweries surely would rather just dump the grains into a landfill — also a new expense.

Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., on Monday sent a letter to the FDA calling for a “risk assessment” of reusing grains, adding that the regulation could add nearly $43 million per year in extra costs for small breweries. That would surely be passed on to you, dear beer drinker.

Chad Melis, spokesman for Oskar Blues Brewery, said his brewery produces roughly 250 tons of wet spent grains every week.

The brewery uses the grains to feed cattle on its farm that in turn provides beef for the brewery’s restaurants.

“We have a very sustainable and healthy model,” Melis said. “If we had to dry it, process it and package it, it wouldn’t be sustainable. Financially, it would probably drive us to dump our grain.”

What a waste.

Spent grain is perfectly healthful livestock feed. Cattle have been eating it for centuries.

“It’s about as close as it gets to its original state,” Melis said. “The only thing that has been done is water has been run through it.”

No need exists for the extra regulation that will mess up what has become a perfect symbiotic relationship between two industries.

Absent evidence that any hazard exists for humans or animals, the FDA needs to dump this rule.
