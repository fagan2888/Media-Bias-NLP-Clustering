Agriculture and mining were recovering, which has boosted output, the IMF said in a statement.\n\nOther basic economic metrics look healthier, too. The IMF thinks inflation will be less than 3% this year, below last year\u2019s 3.3% rate. Jordan\u2019s current account deficit, meanwhile, is expected to narrow to below 7.5% of GDP this year.\n\n\u201cThe focus continues to be on reducing public deficits and debt, while boosting growth and creating jobs so as to improve living standards and social conditions for Jordanians in the future,\u201d said Kristina Kostial, an IMF official who led the Jordanian mission.\n\nWhile the future looks potentially promising, the political situation in the Middle East isn\u2019t stable. Jordan is coping with an influx of refugees fleeing Syria\u2019s three-year-old civil war, as well as the threat of instability from the recent incursion of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria. Supplies of natural gas from Egypt have also been affected by the political and economic situation there, leading to losses for Jordanian electricity producers.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Ms. Kostial said the IMF had \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with Jordan about policies to sustain growth while coping with external challenges. The IMF praised a draft income-tax law now under discussion in the country\u2019s parliament, saying it would raise government revenues and spread the burden of economic adjustments more equitably.\n\nWrite to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Jordanian economy is in good shape, especially considering the political instability in neighboring countries, says the IMF.", "title": "Jordan\u2019s Economy Improving Despite Regional Instability", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/jordans-economy-improving-despite-regional-instability/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Jordan\u2019s Economy Improving Despite Regional Instability", "description": "The Jordanian economy is in good shape, especially considering the political instability in neighboring countries, says the IMF.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Asa Fitch", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "The Jordanian economy is in good shape, especially considering the political instability in neighboring countries, says the IMF.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-01T14:49:32-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/jordans-economy-improving-despite-regional-instability/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1216", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Jordanian economy is in good shape, especially considering the political instability in neighboring countries, says the IMF.", "title": "Jordan\u2019s Economy Improving Despite Regional Instability", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/jordans-economy-improving-despite-regional-instability/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1216", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-01T14:50:11-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The Jordanian economy is in good shape, especially considering the political instability in neighboring countries, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nWhile the future looks potentially promising, the political situation in the Middle East isn\u2019t stable.\nSupplies of natural gas from Egypt have also been affected by the political and economic situation there, leading to losses for Jordanian electricity producers.\nJordan\u2019s current account deficit, meanwhile, is expected to narrow to below 7.5% of GDP this year.\nFollowing a visit to the country in September, an IMF mission reported that Jordan\u2019s GDP was on track to grow by 3.3% this year, accelerating from 2.8% last year."}
