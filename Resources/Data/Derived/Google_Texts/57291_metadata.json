Marco Rubio, R-Fl., at a rally at Roanoke College's Bast Center in Salem, Va., Sunday, Feb. 28, 2016. (Don Petersen/Roanoke Times via AP)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - \"I'm more than happy to tell you about my record,\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I mean it's -- it's -- number one, I've worked in the Senate where for four out of the last five years nothing happened because of Harry Reid. And yet, despite that, I actually worked with Bernie Sanders, who I don't agree (with) on anything, but we were able to work together to bring V.A. accountability. You can now fire senior executives at the V.A. because of my work.\n\n\"There are now additional sanctions on Hezbollah because I got the Senate to pass that unanimously, by the way.\n\n\n\nWe passed the Girls Count Act, which goes after human trafficking by -- by leveraging foreign aid from the United States government to ensure that all kids around the world are getting birth certificates so they don't fall prey to modern day slavery.\n\n\n\nWe led the effort to deal with the Obamacare bailout fund before anyone was talking about that. We were out there leading the effort on that. And today the Obamacare bailout fund is gone.\n\n\n\n\"We helped impose sanctions on human rights violators in Venezuela.\"\n\n\n\n\"And I'm very proud of what we've done despite the fact that Washington isn't doing anything.\"\n\n\n\nHost Chris Wallace noted that Rubio did not mention the piece of legislation for which he is best known -- the 2013 \"Gang of Eight\" bill on immigration \"reform.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let me ask you a question, was that a good bill? Was that a reasonable compromise on the immigration problem?\" Wallace asked Rubio.\n\n\n\n\"Not -- not as a final package. And I said that at the time, Chris. And if you go back -- and we'll provide you that -- you'll see that throughout that debate in the Senate, I kept saying over and over, this is the best we can do here in this Senate, run by Harry Reid, but this is going to have to change when it gets to the House. It's not strong enough. I've said that repeatedly. That's how the process works. You know that.\"\n\n\n\nRubio agreed that the bill he co-sponsored included important reforms.\n\n\n\n\"And we did get the Democrats to agree on a lot of things conservatives have pushed for, but it wasn't enough. And I warned about that repeatedly. I said, this is now going to go to the House and they're going to make it even stronger.\n\n\n\n\"But here's the good news -- when I'm president of the United States, we're not going to do it that way. I don't need to do it Harry Reid's way. We can do it our way, which is, we're going to enforce our laws and we're going to secure our border first. And until we do that, nothing else is going to happen on immigration.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor in June 2013, Rubio described the bill:\n\n\n\n\"This proposal mandates the most ambitious border and interior security measures in our Nation's history. For example, it requires and funds the completion of 700 miles of real border fence. It adds 20,000 new border agents. It details a specific technology plan for each sector of the border. It requires E-Verify for every employer in America. And it creates a tracking system to identify people who overstay their visas.\n\n\n\n\"These are all things that at a minimum must happen before those in the country illegally can apply for permanent status. And the proposal deals with those who are here illegally in a reasonable but responsible way. Right now, those here illegally are living in de facto amnesty. This is what I mean by that: They are unregistered, many pay no taxes, and few will ever have to pay a price for having violated our laws.\n\n\n\n\"Under this bill they will have to come forward. They will have to pass background checks. They will have to pay a fine. They will have to start paying taxes. They will be ineligible for welfare, for food stamps, and for ObamaCare.\n\n\n\n\"In return, the only thing they get is a temporary work permit, and they can't renew it in 6 years unless they can prove they have been holding a job and paying their taxes. For at least 10 years, that is all they can have. After all that, they cannot even apply for permanent status until the fence is built, the Border Patrol agents are hired, and the border security technology, E-Verify, and the tracking system are fully in place.\n\n\n\n\"Yet despite all of these measures, opposition from many conservatives has grown significantly in the last few weeks...\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "\"I'm more than happy to tell you about my record,\" Sen.
