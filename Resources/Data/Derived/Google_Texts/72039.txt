Sioux Falls, SD

A Sioux Falls man is in jail facing two counts of rape at a house party over the weekend. According to police, the victims, a 21-year-old woman and 23-year-old woman, started their evening at a night club in downtown Sioux Falls, but then moved on to someone's house.

"They had gone to a house party. While at the house party, both of the ladies had gone into the restroom of this residence," Lt. Loren McManus said.

That's where police say 36-year-old Mickey Joliffe followed the two women and committed the crime.

"The suspect came in, had a conversation with them in the restroom and ended up sexually assaulting both of them," McManus said.

A friend of the two victims took them home from the house party, and at 1:15 the next afternoon, the women reported the incident at Sanford Medical Center.

"I'm not sure, I don't know how they knew this guy. If he was there at the house party and they made friends with him there or knew him prior to that, I don't know what their relationship was," McManus said.

Joliffe now faces two counts of rape in the 2nd degree, a class one felony that, if convicted, could have him facing up to 50 years in prison with up to a $50,000 fine.
