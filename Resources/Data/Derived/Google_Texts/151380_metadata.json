The reason, says the letter, is because an internal audit revealed that the company had made overpayments to several employees\u2019 retirement accounts from 2010-\u201914.\n\n\u201cJob Options, Inc. is seeking approval of its correction from the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cIn order to preserve all options in dealing with this issue, John Hancock was instructed to reduce the account of each affected participant by the amount of the excess contributions made to their account. The amount of the excess contributions was placed in a suspense account and is awaiting an IRS ruling.\u201d\n\nJob Options chief executive Jeffrey Johnson makes no apologies for his company taking money out of his employees\u2019 retirement accounts, freezing those accounts, and then asking the government if doing so is acceptable only after the fact. He prefers the term \u201cadjustment\u201d to \u201cwithdrawal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud of what we do with our disabled workforce at [Navy Medical Center] Balboa and at the other sites we operate and categorically deny any mistreatment or financial improprieties by Job Options, Inc. in our organization,\u201d Johnson writes in an emailed statement to the Reader.\n\nTerry is one of about 80 Job Options employees working in janitorial and \u201cfloor technician\u201d jobs at Naval Medical Center San Diego. With $50 million in annual revenue, according to its website, Job Options, Inc. is paid to provide disabled workers to the Naval Medical Center through a contract administered by private-sector contractor Source America.\n\nSince 2006, Source America has managed nearly $2.75 billion of a $3 billion federal disabled-workers program called AbilityOne. Nine years after taking over, Source America is taking hits for alleged mismanagement of its massive government contract.\n\nNationally, CNN and locally the Reader have reported accusations of corruption by contractors and subcontractors. The bulk of allegations center on whether or not contractors are meeting their statutory obligation to ensure that at least 75 percent of their workers are disabled. Job Options claims its pool of workers is \u201croughly 75 percent\u201d disabled people.\n\nAnother local Source America subcontractor, Pride Industries, has been accused of treating employees abusively and allegedly pushing non-disabled workers to claim disabilities in order for the company to meet that 75 percent threshold.\n\nPride Industries posted a response on its website to the Reader\u2019s August 10 article by Joe Deegan exposing allegations of employee abuse and alleged improprieties. The rebuttal is mostly a series of clarifications, such as a declaration that Pride Industries is a \u201cnonprofit corporation\u201d rather than a \u201cprivate company.\u201d\n\nBoth Job Options, Inc. and Pride Industries are eager to point upward on the multi-billion-dollar Ability-One food chain claiming the program gets a clean bill of health from the Government Accountability Office. But neither mentions that at least five inspectors general from government entities, including the United States Navy, are currently investigating Source America and some of its subcontractors. Jeffrey Johnson says his company is not the target of any such investigations.\n\nYet some of his workers have asked their union to call for an investigation by state and federal labor officials.\n\n\u201cI thought the whole point of [the] AbilityOne program is to give us disabled people a purpose and reward us for working,\u201d Terry says. \u201cWhy is Job Options shaming us for our physical challenges? Why are they lowering our pay and doing God knows what with our retirement accounts?\u201d\n\nTerry believes Job Options penalizes disabled workers by subjecting them to recurring \u201cproductivity-timing studies.\u201d Disabled workers who aren\u2019t fast enough have their pay reduced by as much as $1 per hour or more for six months at a time. After six months, they\u2019re allowed to test again to see if they can work quickly enough to have their full pay restored.\n\nAnother Job Options worker says he was slapped by a supervisor. \u201cI got hit by one of the supervisors just because I had my arms crossed and he didn\u2019t like the way I was standing,\u201d says Jesse Arreola, 23, of San Diego. \u201cHe slapped me pretty hard on my elbow, and I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nArreola reported it to his supervisor\u2019s boss, who offered an apology. \u201cBut Carlos, my supervisor, just got a little talking to. I still have to work for him, and it\u2019s really stressful, because I can tell he\u2019s mad that I told.\u201d\n\nArreola works for Job Options as a housekeeper at the Naval Medical Center. He suffers from bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He fears retaliation from his supervisor. \u201cI think I could get fired for talking to you about this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. Maybe the way we\u2019re being treated will change if more people know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nRecently, Arreola and his coworkers took a different kind of hit. On July 1, he and other disabled employees got a notice from their human resources department. \u201cThey informed us they were ending our retirement accounts due to having to give us Obamacare health insurance and they couldn\u2019t afford to do both,\u201d Terry says. \u201cWe were given awful medical coverage through Kaiser Permanente. We now have to pay an annual out-of-pocket deductible of five-thousand dollars.\u201d\n\nArreola says the change cost him what he felt was superior coverage under MediCal. Under Kaiser, he says he\u2019s charged for appointments and medications that were free before. \u201cAt Kaiser, they want, like, $360 for one of my doctor\u2019s appointments when it used to be free for me. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not going to be able to get treatment anymore. When I run out of medications, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to get refills.\u201d\n\nContinued on the next page >", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2015/nov/04/citylights-disabled-workers-navy-wrongdoing/", "image": "http://media.sdreader.com/img/photos/2015/11/02/Navy-Medical-Center-San-Diego_t1316.jpg?5cd45d7c8b8cd438b6877c44adfe8b372238aa2b", "type": "article", "title": "Disabled workers say Navy contractor did wrong"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152198538323820}, "description": "\u201cThey made all of these weird withdrawals...\u201d"}, "article_summary": "Another employment contractor for the federal government is being accused of mistreating disabled workers, this time at Navy Medical Center San Diego.\nThe reason, says the letter, is because an internal audit revealed that the company had made overpayments to several employees\u2019 retirement accounts from 2010-\u201914.\nOn July 1, he and other disabled employees got a notice from their human resources department.\n\u201cJob Options, Inc. is seeking approval of its correction from the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d reads the letter.\nTerry is one of about 80 Job Options employees working in janitorial and \u201cfloor technician\u201d jobs at Naval Medical Center San Diego."}
