Really angry. And it shows up in lyrics like,\u201cboils bitten haggard pick, vomit kicking out, razor slide, black eye shroud, brain bespattered, jaw retaliate begrudgingly\u2026execute economic slave.\u201d\n\nEconomic slave or not, the Skinny Puppies are not above exacting their pound of flesh from the U.S. government, which they have accused of stealing their music for immoral purposes.\n\nThey are billing Uncle Sam the diabolical amount of $666,000 for blasting their music at inmates during interrogations at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nA member of the Vancouver-based band said the group was disturbed to learn from a fan and former GITMO prison guard about how its music was being used.\n\nRelated: Will Obama Finally Close GITMO as Promised?\n\n\"We never supported those types of scenarios,\" keyboardist cEvin Key said. \"Because we make unsettling music, we can see it being used in a weird way. But it doesn't sit right with us.\u201d\n\nAt first, the band planned to use an image of an invoice for the U.S. government as a design for its next album cover, but then they learned they could potentially bring a suit against the Department of Defense for using the music without permission.\n\n\"I am not only against the fact they're using our music to inflict damage on somebody else but they are doing it without anybody's permission,\" Key said in the interview.\n\nThe Department of Defense told Politico that it had not received any such invoice, and a spokesperson said it wasn\u2019t even clear how such \u201cbilling based on a hunch\u201d might work. The spokesperson also said that the U.S. treats prisoners humanely.\n\nThe use of loud music in detainee interrogations has been known for years and was most thoroughly exposed in a 2012 documentary by Al Jazeera, which found that prisoners in GITMO and Abu Ghraib were being subjected to loud music for prolonged periods of time.\n\nThe music ranged from bands like Metallica and Nine Inch Nails to children\u2019s songs from \u201cSesame Street.\u201d According to the documentary, prisoners were strapped to chairs, with headphones attached to their ears, blasting loud music for hours or days on end.\n\nRelated: Obama Renews Calls to Close GITMO\n\nMusicians from groups such as Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam and R.E.M, whose music has allegedly been used in interrogations, have supported efforts to close Guantanamo and learn more about what music was used as part of the so-called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d that critics and others have labeled torture.\n\nThe United Nations has classified the \u201csounding of loud music for prolonged periods\u201d as a violation of the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Clearly they\u2019ve never been in the middle of a mosh pit to see the torture of the entire audience.\n\n\u201cWe have spent the past 30 years supporting causes related to peace and justice \u2013 to now learn that some of our friends\u2019 music may have been used as part of the torture tactics without their consent or knowledge, is horrific,\u201d R.E.M. said in a 2009 statement. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-American, period.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon, however, does not classify the tactic as torture and says, instead, that it\u2019s used as a \u201cdisincentive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done in a measured way, in keeping with our obligation and commitment to treating detainees humanely,\u201d DOD Spokesman Capt. John Kirby told Al Jazeera.\n\nA spokeswoman for the military\u2019s Joint Task Force Guant\u00e1namo said in 2009 that loud music had not been used with prisoners since 2003.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Listen to a few bars of Skinny Puppy\u2019s Dig It, and you want to hide under the covers u", "title": "Band Bills DOD $666,000 for Playing Its Music at GITMO", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/06/Band-Bills-DOD-666000-Using-Its-Music-GITMO", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/SkinnyPuppy_2014_.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/06/Band-Bills-DOD-666000-Using-Its-Music-GITMO", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/SkinnyPuppy_2014_.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Listen to a few bars of Skinny Puppy\u2019s Dig It, and you want to hide under the covers u", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Will Obama Finally Close GITMO as Promised?\nA spokeswoman for the military\u2019s Joint Task Force Guant\u00e1namo said in 2009 that loud music had not been used with prisoners since 2003.\nThe United Nations has classified the \u201csounding of loud music for prolonged periods\u201d as a violation of the U.N.
