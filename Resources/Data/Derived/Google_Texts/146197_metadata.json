That\u2019s what CEO Russ Armistead told the Governor\u2019s Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding at its stop in Jacksonville on Wednesday morning.\n\nArmistead said, \u201cThanks to the Legislature and the governor, the LIP funding, which was 95 million dollars, we essentially got all of that for the current year. So we are funded. We\u2019re good to go.\u201d\n\nArmistead says, after months of uncertainty over a government subsidy for poor and uninsured patients, UF Healthcare Jacksonville can once more focus on the future.\n\nThe federal government is phasing out its Low Income Pool program which hospitals like UF Health count on to survive. The debate over how to make up the difference derailed the regular lawmaking session and forced Florida legislators back for a special session last month.\n\nArmistead was one of two hospital executives who addressed the commission at Jacksonville University Wednesday. Governor Rick Scott assembled the panel to gather information from hospitals that rely on taxpayer funding. He says he wants to help them run as efficiently and transparently as possible.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "The UF Health hospital in downtown Jacksonville is no longer in immediate danger of closing.
