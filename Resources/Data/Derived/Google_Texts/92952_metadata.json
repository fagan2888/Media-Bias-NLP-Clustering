Readers of GQ might think so.\n\nThe January edition of the men\u2019s magazine featured a list of \u201cthe craziest politicians of 2014,\u201d naming 16 Republicans, three Democrats, and one county sheriff.\n\nFair?\n\nA number of political commentators have said no.\n\nCalling out the magazine for engaging in \u201csome serious media bias,\u201d Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen said this morning on Fox News:\n\nIf there were a bipartisan media objective, this list would have been 10 Democrats, 10 Republicans. But when they\u2019re calling out 17 \u2018crazy\u2019 Republicans and only three Democrats \u2026 this is teetering on propaganda at this point.\n\nAmong the chosen \u201ccrazies\u201d were 2016 presidential contenders Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nAlso making the cut were a number of incoming Republican freshmen in the 114th Congress, including Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Reps. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Jody Hice of Georgia and Mark Walker of North Carolina.\n\nAfter bashing Ernst for her outspoken views on the Second Amendment, GQ told readers to \u201cthink of her as Michele Bachmann with a more sensible haircut.\u201d\n\nThe three Democrats cast as \u201ccrazy\u201d were Vice President Joe Biden and Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and Hank Johnson of Georgia.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Democrats just aren\u2019t keeping pace right now in the crazy department.\u201d @GQMagazine\n\nBiden\u2019s offense, according to GQ, is \u201cCrazy enough to run again for president!\u201d GQ, meanwhile, used this for its description of Cruz:\n\nLeans so far right that even fellow Republican John McCain classified him as a \u201cwacko bird\u201d; one of Cruz\u2019s supporters put the nickname on a hat, and he proudly displays it in his office.\n\nIn defense of his editorial judgment, author Stephen Sherrill attached a note to the bottom of article, in which he denied any media bias. \u201c[T]he reality is that Democrats just aren\u2019t keeping pace right now in the crazy department,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIs he right?\n\nPublishing its own list of 16 \u201ccrazy\u201d Democrats, the New York Post is now giving GQ a run for its money.\n\nOn it, readers will find Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, who earlier this year said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gives women the \u201cback of his hand,\u201d and California Rep. Barbara Lee, who called for a $26 minimum wage.\n\nRead GQ\u2019s full article.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201che reality is that Democrats just aren\u2019t keeping pace right now in the crazy department.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201che reality is that Democrats just aren\u2019t keeping pace right now in the crazy department.\"", "title": "GQ: 16 of the 20 \u2018Craziest Politicians\u2019 Are Republicans", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/PoliticiansCrazies_141229.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/13OUp5w"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201che reality is that Democrats just aren\u2019t keeping pace right now in the crazy department.\"", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/PoliticiansCrazies_141229.jpg"}, "title": "GQ: 16 of the 20 \u2018Craziest Politicians\u2019 Are Republicans", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2014-12-29T12:47:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gq, gq media bias, gq crazy list, craziest politicians of 2014, media bias, Adriana Cohen"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c18\"", "article_summary": "The January edition of the men\u2019s magazine featured a list of \u201cthe craziest politicians of 2014,\u201d naming 16 Republicans, three Democrats, and one county sheriff.\nAre Republicans crazy?\nBut when they\u2019re calling out 17 \u2018crazy\u2019 Republicans and only three Democrats \u2026 this is teetering on propaganda at this point.\nPublishing its own list of 16 \u201ccrazy\u201d Democrats, the New York Post is now giving GQ a run for its money.\n\u201c[T]he reality is that Democrats just aren\u2019t keeping pace right now in the crazy department,\u201d he wrote."}
