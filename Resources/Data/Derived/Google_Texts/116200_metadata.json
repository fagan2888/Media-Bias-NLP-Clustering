If this system is working well, it can protect the brain from abnormalAlzheimer\u2019s proteins; if it gets derailed, key areas of the brain start degenerating.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely important study,\u201d said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary accompanying the study. \u201cThis is the first study that is really starting to provide a plausible pathway to explain why some people are more vulnerable to Alzheimer\u2019s than other people.\u201d\n\nThe research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, focuses on a protein previously thought to act mostly in the brains of developing fetuses. The scientists found that the protein also appears to protect neurons in healthy older people from aging-related stresses. But in people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, the protein is sharply depleted in key brain regions.\n\nExperts said if other scientists could replicate and expand upon the findings, the role of the protein, called REST, could spur development of new drugs for dementia, which has so far been virtually impossible to treat. But they cautioned that much more needed to be determined, including whether the decline of REST was a cause, or an effect, of brain deterioration, and whether it is specific enough to neurological diseases that it could lead to effective therapies.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of papers now following up on it,\u201d said Dr. Eric M. Reiman, executive director of the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute in Phoenix, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWhile it\u2019s a preliminary finding, it raises an avenue that hasn\u2019t been considered before. And if this provides a handle on which to understand normal brain aging, that will be great too.\u201d\n\nREST, a regulator that switches off certain genes, is primarily known to keep fetal neurons in an immature state until they develop to perform brain functions, said Dr. Bruce A. Yankner, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the new study. By the time babies are born, REST becomes inactive, he said, except in some areas outside the brain like the colon, where it seems to suppress cancer.\n\nWhile investigating how different genes in the brain change as people age, Yankner\u2019s team was startled to find that REST was the most active gene regulator in older brains.\n\n\u201cWhy should a fetal gene be coming on in an aging brain?\u201d he wondered. He hypothesized that it was because in aging, as in birth, brains encounter great stress, threatening neurons that cannot regenerate if harmed.\n\nHis team discovered that REST appears to switch off genes that promote cell death, protecting neurons from normal aging processes like energy decrease, inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\nAnalyzing brains from brain banks and dementia studies, they found that brains of young adults ages 20 to 35 contained little REST, while healthy adults between the ages of 73 and 106 had plenty. REST levels grew the older people got, so long as they did not develop dementia, suggesting REST is related to longevity.\n\nBut in people with Alzheimer\u2019s, mild cognitive dementia, frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia, the brain areas affected by these diseases contained much less REST than healthy brains.\n\nThis was true only in people who actually had memory and thinking problems. People who remained cognitively healthy, but whose brains had the same accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles as people with Alzheimer\u2019s, had three times more REST than those suffering Alzheimer\u2019ss ymptoms. About a third of people who have such plaques will not develop Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms, studies show.\n\nREST levels dropped as symptoms worsened, so people with mild cognitive dementia had more REST than Alzheimer\u2019s patients. And only key brain regions were affected. In Alzheimer\u2019s, REST steeply declined in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, areas critical to learning, memory and planning. Other areas of the brain not involved in Alzheimer\u2019s showed no REST drop-off.\n\nIt is not yet possible to analyze REST levels in the brains of living people, and several Alzheimer\u2019sexperts said that fact limited what the new research could prove.\n\nJohn Hardy, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher at University College London, cautioned that information from post-mortem brains could not prove that a decline in REST caused dementia because death might produce unrelated damage to brain cells.\n\nTo investigate further, the team conducted what both Tsai and Reiman called a \u201ctour de force\u201d of research, examining REST in mice, roundworms and cells in the lab.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure the story was right,\u201d Yankner said. \u201cIt was difficult to believe at first, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nEspecially persuasive was that mice genetically engineered to lack REST lost neurons as they aged in brain areas afflicted in Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nYankner said REST appears to work by traveling to a neuron\u2019s nucleus when the brain was stressed. In dementia, though, REST somehow gets diverted, traveling with toxic dementia-related proteins to another part of the neuron where it is eventually destroyed.\n\nExperts said the research, while intriguing, leaves many unanswered questions. Bradley Wise of the National Institute on Aging\u2019s neuroscience division, which helped finance the studies, said REST\u2019s role needs further clarification. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can really say if it\u2019s a cause of Alzheimer\u2019s or a consequence of Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d yet, he said.\n\nDr. Samuel Gandy, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center, wondered if REST figured only in neurodegenerative diseases or in other diseases too, where? which could make it difficult to use REST to develop specific treatments or diagnostic tests for dementia.\n\n\u201cMy ambivalence is, is this really a way that advances our understanding of the disease or does this just tell us this is even more complicated than we thought?\u201d he said.\n\nYankner\u2019s team is looking at REST in other neurological diseases, like Parkinson\u2019s. He also has thoughts about a potential treatment, lithium, which he said appears to stimulate REST function, and is considered relatively safe.\n\nBut he and other experts said it was too early. \u201cI would hesitate to start rushing into lithium treatment\u201d unless rigorous studies show it can forestall dementia, said Dr. John Morris, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nStill, Morris said, the REST research the team conducted so far is \u201cvery well done, and certainly helps support this idea that we\u2019ve all tried to understand about why Alzheimer\u2019s is age-associated and why, while amyloid is necessary for the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it certainly is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere have to be some other processes and triggers that result in Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/03/ALZHEIMER.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ca7\"", "article_summary": "But in people with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, the protein is sharply depleted in key brain regions.\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s, REST steeply declined in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, areas critical to learning, memory and planning.\nIt is one of the big scientific mysteries of Alzheimer\u2019s disease: Why do some people whose brains accumulate the plaques and tangles so strongly associated with Alzheimer\u2019s not develop the disease?\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can really say if it\u2019s a cause of Alzheimer\u2019s or a consequence of Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d yet, he said.\nREST levels dropped as symptoms worsened, so people with mild cognitive dementia had more REST than Alzheimer\u2019s patients."}
