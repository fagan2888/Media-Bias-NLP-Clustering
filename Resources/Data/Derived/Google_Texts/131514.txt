Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) went to the Arizona Diamondbacks game Saturday night, and letâ€™s just say he got a little excited when Paul Goldschmidt hit his first of two home runs of the night.

So excited that he hugged the air while screaming.

Politicians have feelings, too.

The Diamondbacks had already held the lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers when this happened, making it that much more priceless. The game ended with the Diamondbacks leading 18-7 and one happy old man.

Now if only that excitement can be brought to Washington.
