But the letter explaining it still contained a surprise: Buying a comparable plan next year would cost the Bridgeport couple nearly 58 percent more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a bigger hit than we expected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Spains are among more than 60,000 Connecticut residents with health plans that don\u2019t meet the requirements of the federal health law. Many of them are receiving notices that their plans are being discontinued and that comparable, Obamacare-compliant plans will cost significantly more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing in some cases 100 percent increases,\u201d said Tim Tracy Jr., a Fairfield insurance broker and president of the Connecticut Chapter of the National Association of Health Underwriters.\n\nSound familiar? It should. Last year, with many provisions of Obamacare poised to take effect, insurance companies discontinued health plans that didn't meet the new coverage requirements, and many customers faced higher prices for new plans. Anger about losing insurance policies created a political firestorm on the heels of the health law\u2019s first sign-up period for coverage.\n\nBut about 60,000 Connecticut residents were able to continue plans that didn\u2019t meet the health law\u2019s requirements, either because the plans pre-dated Obamacare\u2019s passage or because they were purchased or renewed before the start of this year. Now nearly all of those residents are likely to be in the market for new coverage for 2015 -- and some will face \"sticker shock,\" as Tracy calls it.\n\nWhat accounts for the price increases? The Affordable Care Act created several new coverage requirements that can raise insurance prices. Among them: Plans sold on the individual market must cover a set of \u201cessential\u201d benefits, including maternity and pediatric dental care that were rarely covered in the past. Health plans can\u2019t put a dollar limit on the amount of medical care they\u2019ll cover for a person.\n\nAnd insurers must sell plans to anyone who wants to buy insurance, regardless of medical history, rather than selecting which customers to cover, as they did in the past.\n\nDeputy Insurance Commissioner Anne Melissa Dowling noted that many people who were able to hang onto old plans last year didn\u2019t have to pay attention to the health law\u2019s new requirements.\n\n\u201cAll this stuff that we\u2019ve all gotten very comfortable with and known about for the last 18 months, there\u2019s a whole crop of people to whom it\u2019s very new,\u201d she said.\n\nNot everyone whose plans are being discontinued will face higher premiums for new coverage. Another feature of Obamacare is the creation of federal tax credits to discount the cost of monthly insurance premiums for low- and middle-income people, as long as they buy their plans through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT.\n\nAnd people who already bought Obamacare-compliant plans last year are likely to see either price reductions or modest increases for insurance in 2015, since the rates for those plans are, on average, not increasing dramatically.\n\nTracy, the Fairfield broker, had some clients who got tax credits to discount their Obamacare-compliant plans this year.\n\n\u201cIt worked out great for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got cost-effective coverage. But unfortunately, the system isn\u2019t built to satisfy everybody.\u201d\n\nBy that he means those who don\u2019t qualify for any financial assistance to help with their premiums, who pay the full sticker price. In a high-income state like Connecticut, that\u2019s a lot of people.\n\nThe tax credits are set so that people earning below 400 percent of the poverty level won\u2019t pay more than 9.56 percent of their income to buy a mid-level plan through the exchange next year. But people who earn just above the limit -- $46,680 for a single person, and $95,400 for a family of four -- will pay full price, even if it\u2019s a significantly higher percentage of their income.\n\nEffectively, the law creates two groups of individual-market insurance customers: Those who qualify for a tax credit and are largely insulated from premium hikes, and those who pay sticker price. Access Health\u2019s acting CEO, Jim Wadleigh, said people who earn just over the limit for a subsidy \u201care the ones who get hurt the most,\u201d and noted while $96,000 for a family of four might sound like a lot of money, it doesn't go far in a high-cost state like Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find some way to make health care coverage affordable to everybody,\u201d he said.\n\nWadleigh said he\u2019s familiar with the concerns of people whose pre-Obamacare plans are being discontinued, in part because it\u2019s happened to some of his friends, who complain to him about it. He's connected them with a broker to find new plans.\n\nAs more people learn their plans are ending, Wadleigh expects more complaints about having to find new coverage, the costs and Obamacare in general. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to get noisier,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is likely the last big round of transitions from pre-Obamacare plans to those that meet the health law\u2019s requirements, at least in this state. As of June 30, 50,947 Connecticut residents had individual-market plans that were issued or renewed late last year and can\u2019t legally be continued after they expire. (Many of those people got plans that began Dec. 1, 2013. They\u2019ll be able to keep them through the end of December because the Connecticut Insurance Department received approval to let them continue an extra month, so customers wouldn\u2019t have to buy a new one-month plan before 2015 policies took effect.)\n\nAnother 10,022 people in Connecticut had \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans that were issued before the health law passed in 2010. Those plans can legally be continued if insurers choose to keep offering them, but insurers are expected to discontinue many of those plans.\n\nPete and Kate Spain are among the 10,000 with grandfathered plans, and theirs is being discontinued.\n\nThey don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy. Kate Spain runs a small design business, and the couple\u2019s income is above the $62,920 threshold that would qualify them for a tax credit. That means they\u2019ll be paying full price for insurance.\n\nThe Spains, who are in their mid-40s, currently pay $479 a month for an Aetna plan with a high deductible and a health-savings account. A letter from Aetna notified them that if they didn\u2019t take action, they would be routed into an Obamacare-complaint plan that costs $756.08 per month.\n\nPete Spain looked at other options and figures they could buy a plan from another carrier for less money, but it would still be an increase. The lowest-cost standard plan sold through the exchange would cost them about $120 per month more than they pay now.\n\nSpain is quick to note that he\u2019s a Democrat who made more than 1,500 phone calls for Obama before the 2008 election. He thinks the health law will help to contain health care costs overall in the future. But he was surprised by the financial hit he and his wife will be facing next year.\n\n\u201cThis is just kind of drastic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re lucky\u2026We\u2019ll figure something out. But I just feel bad for people who aren\u2019t doing as well,\" who fall just above the limit for discounted coverage.\n\nWhen the open enrollment period begins Nov. 15, he said, \u201cI will be shopping around.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Obamacare, a look at the plans sold through the state\u2019s exchange and a calculator to see what they\u2019d cost you, visit The Mirror\u2019s guide to health care in Connecticut by clicking here.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/20/obamacare-discontinued-plans-and-sticker-shock-round-2/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Affordable Care Act, canceled plans, insurance, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/20/obamacare-discontinued-plans-and-sticker-shock-round-2/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "About 60,000 Connecticut residents have health plans that don't meet the requirements of Obamacare.
