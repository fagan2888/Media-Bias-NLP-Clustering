It\u2019s no secret that Stewart, who has interviewed President Obama, is more sympathetic to the liberal side, so this was telling\u2014especially when he ridiculed the administration\u2019s planned tech \u201csurge\u201d to the same strategy used to salvage the Iraq war.\n\nWhen your political program becomes a punchline, you\u2019ve got problems.\n\nIn fact, the Iraq comparison didn\u2019t just remain in the realm of humor. By yesterday morning, \u201cMorning Joe\u201d panelists were debating whether the ObamaCare rollout was more like Iraq or Katrina.\n\nUnfair? Nobody\u2019s died because of the computer problems, though those who can\u2019t get health insurance\u2014who Obama and the Democrats want to help\u2014could suffer if they can\u2019t sign up. The larger issue is that the press is now in piling-on mode, ripping not just the snafus but examining the basic competence and political sense of the White House.\n\nLook at Politico\u2019s take on what it casts as the administration\u2019s defensiveness:\n\n\u201cPresident Barack Obama likes to say his team is the most transparent administration in history \u2014 but on the ObamaCare website debacle, it\u2019s been more like they\u2019ve been holed up in the bunker.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s growing pressure for the administration to come out from underneath the covers, and start releasing more details on what, exactly, is wrong with the Healthcare.gov site and how soon it might be fixed.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s 1-800 pitch at the White House didn\u2019t go over well, with the fainting spell of the pregnant and diabetic woman behind him being cast as a metaphor.\n\nLiberal Slate writer Matthew Ygelsias doesn\u2019t sugarcoat things:\n\n\u201cAfter years of offering up nonsense about Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and the New Black Panther Party, conservatives finally have a bona fide scandal dumped in their lap. Three weeks after its launch, the healthcare.gov portal for the federal health care exchange still doesn\u2019t work. Nobody can really say when it will work properly. For all the talk of \u2018glitches,\u2019 there appear to be fundamental flaws in the site\u2019s basic architecture, perhaps driven by poor incentives for government contractors and an overall flawed contracting process. At a Monday afternoon White House briefing for journalists on how things are going, I was tempted to grab a senior administration official by the lapels and demand: \u2018What did the president know and when did he know it?\u2019\n\n\u201cExcept in this case, the most disturbing thing is how little the White House seemed to know\u2026\n\n\u201cIt does look foolish. The product doesn\u2019t work, and for whatever reason, key people didn\u2019t know it didn\u2019t work. That\u2019s a mess, and it fundamentally undermines assurances that the current \u2018tech surge\u2019 will lead to major rapid improvements.\u201d\n\nBut then Yglesias pivots to a really striking argument that may have been overlooked:\n\n\u201cThe right was hoping for a massive backlash to ObamaCare. What it\u2019s found instead is massive frustration with the difficulty signing up for it.\u201d\n\nWhich means millions want to sign up. The New Republic\u2019s Alec MacGillis makes the case:\n\n\u201cNow that the law is actually going into effect, seizing on its deficiencies takes on a different aspect: It means, at some basic level, accepting the goals of the law as worth achieving. Now, Republicans will say that by highlighting implementation flaws they are simply exposing its inherent unworkability, but I\u2019m not sure that pose will hold up in their new mode of inspector general. Administration officials will come in for questioning and Republicans will demand to know: How many people are signing up for coverage? When will the site be working better? What are you doing to fix it? Unspoken in all of those questions is something that Republicans have simply shut out of their assault on Obamacare until now: That there are people out there, millions of them, who do not have coverage and will be helped by the law if it can be made to function properly.\u201d\n\nConservatives would say the problems show the system is unworkable, but it rings true that a laser focus on a malfunctioning website would lead to efforts to fix it.\n\nFinally, some not-so-friendly fire on the left. Salon\u2019s Joan Walsh, who describes herself as a Democrat, unloads on liberal pundits who are slamming the rollout:\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, yes, it\u2019s important for Democrats to acknowledge when government screws up, and to fix it.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, when liberals rush conscientiously to do that, they only encourage the completely unbalanced and unhinged coverage of whatever the problem may be.\u201d\n\nSo libs should muzzle themselves so as not to give the media ammunition?\n\nAnd Walsh names names: the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza and Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein.\n\nLizza, a prodigious reporter, had tweeted: \u201cWho will be more discredited this year: conservatives for pushing us to brink of default or liberals for failure of health care exchanges?\u201d\n\nPrompting a reply from Walsh: \u201cC\u2019mon @RyanLizza, are you trying to parody false equivalence? You\u2019re way smarter than that!\u201d\n\nAnd this rejoinder from Lizza: \u201cThe ACA is the most important liberal project in decades. If it fails, it is a complete disaster for liberalism.\u201d\n\nWalsh also complained that the \u201cgreat Ezra Klein\u201d (her MSNBC colleague) had said on the air that the Health and Human Services Department is covering up a massive \u201cmanagement failure.\u201d\n\nKlein tweeted that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by Joan Walsh\u2019s piece because \u201cmy job is to cover ObamaCare accurately, not instrumentally.\u201d\n\nClick for more from Media Buzz.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
