Every year the Panama City Rescue Mission invites everyone to celebrate with them and with a hot meal. The faith-based safe haven opened its doors to dozens of locals.

Guests were brought in through the chapel to lay their burdens aside. They were then shown a table and were waited on by volunteers.

Those volunteers prepare for at least a hundred guests and said it felt good to give back while celebrating the holiday.

High school student Clayne Slabin volunteered with his family.

"We volunteer usually during Christmastime for people with gifts and stuff," he said. "We've never volunteered for Easter but it's really fun."

Andrew Mills graduate from the mission's program and said he enjoys volunteering when he can.

"It feels really really good because at one point in time the shoe was on the other foot and I was sitting at this table," he said. "And to be able to come back and serve other people, what's done for me, is the best feeling in the world."

Diners gave their compliments to the chef. Volunteers say they'll be there again next year.
