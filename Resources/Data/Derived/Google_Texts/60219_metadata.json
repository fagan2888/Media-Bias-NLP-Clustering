Hayes said he and partner Connie King signed the agreement to sell Lost Valley Ski Banquet and Resort Friday night.\n\nStaff at Lost Valley told the newspaper that rumors of the sale had spurred sales of discounted early season passes. Lost Valley had sold 375 season passes at the close of business Saturday, the last day to buy them at the discounted price. Last year, Lost Valley sold 255 discounted passes.\n\nHayes said Shanaman first expressed interest last winter.\n\n\u201cI think he knew we were struggling, so he let Connie know that for some reason, he was interested,\u201d Hayes told the Sun Journal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s buying it for less than we were into it for,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cOn top of that, he has the advantage of being in the trade and rubbing arms with the piston-pulley people and manufacturers. He knows the lifts and he knows that whole end of the trade, which gives him certain advantages.\u201d\n\nIn June 2014, Hayes and King announced they might not be able to open for the 2014-15 ski season and were facing about $1.6 million in debt. A fundraising campaign and other events organized by local supporters who dubbed themselves Friends of Lost Valley raised about $23,000 - enabling the resort to open in January 2015.\n\nThe ski resort began operations in 1961.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The owners of Maine's Lost Valley ski area have found a buyer to keep the Auburn ski area operating.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/1/owners-of-lost-valley-ski-area-in-maine-have-found/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The owners of Maine\u2019s Lost Valley ski area have found a buyer to keep the Auburn ski area operating.", "title": "Owners of Lost Valley ski area in Maine have  found a buyer"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The owners of Maine's Lost Valley ski area have found a buyer to keep the Auburn ski area operating.", "card": "summary", "title": "Owners of Lost Valley ski area in Maine have  found a buyer"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "AUBURN, Maine (AP) - The owners of Maine\u2019s Lost Valley ski area have found a buyer to keep the Auburn ski area operating.\nHayes said he and partner Connie King signed the agreement to sell Lost Valley Ski Banquet and Resort Friday night.\nStaff at Lost Valley told the newspaper that rumors of the sale had spurred sales of discounted early season passes.\nLast year, Lost Valley sold 255 discounted passes.\nLost Valley had sold 375 season passes at the close of business Saturday, the last day to buy them at the discounted price."}
