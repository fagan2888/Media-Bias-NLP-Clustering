It might have come to her in a dream while dozing off somewhere over the Black Sea; she\u2019s not sure. If so, it was a dream about a dream that came true, and it came with clarity.\n\nThe day after she became the youngest Olympic slalom champion at age 18, the pride of Eagle-Vail related that story with humor. She wanted to write about that burst of insight immediately by typing on her iPad, but the flight attendant insisted she turn off the device in preparation for landing.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, this is the medal,\u201d Shiffrin told her with some impatience. \u201cYou need to let me write this.\u201d\n\nEventually she committed her ideas to writing, and Saturday she shared them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told the Olympics is all about the process, it\u2019s all about the journey,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI\u2019ve also been told that you go for gold and nothing else. Right now it seems like it\u2019s almost, they\u2019re two opposites, and I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t combine the two and use the journey to get the gold. That\u2019s what I came here to do.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the Olympics is a lot about the upsets. That\u2019s what inspires people because it feels like a miracle, and for the crowd \u2014 for the world watching \u2014 miracles give them hope that something like that can happen for themselves. My goal coming to the Olympics was to prove to the world that miracles are not random, and that you\u2019re in charge of your own destiny. I wanted to paint my own miracle. Hopefully that inspires the world that it doesn\u2019t need to be a random thing.\u201d\n\nShe was prepared in every way for the race she won, including making a brilliant save overcoming a bobble that almost threw it all away. She even had the foresight not to wear mascara, because she remembered a friend commenting after watching Lindsey Vonn\u2019s mascara run four years ago at the Vancouver Games when she won the Olympic downhill.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Either waterproof or nothing, because if I start crying, I do not want to look like a witch,\u2019 \u201d Shiffrin said.\n\nWhen she crossed the finish line and saw the green No. 1 that confirmed her as Olympic champion, she wanted to savor the moment.\n\n\u201cI mostly just didn\u2019t want to stop,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI kept skiing around the finish arena. I wanted to keep my skis moving as long as I could because it just felt so good to be able to ski down the mountain like that and really feel free \u2014 free to make mistakes, free to recover from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cA firecracker\u201d at age 92\n\nShiffrin wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the mistake she made.\n\n\u201cWhen you make it to the finish with that, it\u2019s a bigger accomplishment than just having a clean run,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody watching, their hearts stopped, it keeps going, you don\u2019t know where you stand and you really hold your breath to the finish. That\u2019s what makes ski racing exciting. That\u2019s what makes any sport exciting. I do hope I can inspire people to try and put on a show for themselves, for the crowd.\u201d\n\nAfter the race there was picture posing, a flower ceremony, finish arena interviews and a news conference. It was 10:30 p.m. when Shiffrin and her parents finally left the arena, packed an overnight bag and took a car 30 miles down to Sochi for a late-night chat with NBC\u2019s Bob Costas. They were delighted there to see NBC video of the celebration at her grandmother\u2019s house in Massachusetts at the moment she won. Shiffrin\u2019s grandmother is 92 years old.\n\n\u201cThey all jumped up and were screaming, and I think she jumped higher than anyone else,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cLike, \u2018Nana, where did you get that power in your legs? Give me some of that, what have you been doing?\u2019 She\u2019s a firecracker.\u201d\n\nShiffrin\u2019s mother, Eileen, loved it too. Nana is Eileen\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cShe was so excited,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cIt was hilarious.\u201d\n\nThe Shiffrins were in bed by 3:30 a.m., up again at 10 a.m. Saturday for a 12:30 p.m. news conference and then more TV interviews. Despite her head cold, Mikaela was holding up great. So was Mom.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t cried since she got the gold medal, and I\u2019m really proud of myself,\u201d Eileen said Saturday. \u201cEvery now and then I get really emotional, but I\u2019m just so proud of Mikaela on so many different levels.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, the gold medal part of it, I haven\u2019t really gotten my arms wrapped around that. It hasn\u2019t sunk in. It\u2019s her tenacity that got it. It\u2019s not the medal, it\u2019s what it took for her to accomplish that. It\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden it hits you\u201d\n\nSaturday afternoon was a blur, and it reminded Mikaela of racing slalom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot like the run, where I can\u2019t even think, I can\u2019t remember what just happened and I can\u2019t see but a split second ahead of me,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for a point where I\u2019ll be able to really sit down and take a breath and grasp the whole thing.\u201d\n\nShe received countless texts from friends in Vail and Vermont. At the medals ceremony Saturday night, nearly 24 hours after she became an Olympic champion, the enormity of it all began to sink in. Mom and Dad were in the audience, taking pictures. When Mikaela got up on the top step of the podium, received her medal and prepared herself for the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d tears pooled in her eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things that you don\u2019t think about, and then all of a sudden it hits you,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018This is the Olympics, and I have a gold, and that\u2019s been a dream of mine, and I\u2019m not really sure what to think.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThere was one thing she was thinking because of the cold she has been fighting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t sneeze up there,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI was scared I was going to sneeze and get like goobers all over everything.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eagle-Vail\u2019s Mikaela Shiffrin good as gold as inspirational Olympian", "title": "Eagle-Vail\u2019s Mikaela Shiffrin good as gold as inspirational Olympian", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/22/eagle-vails-mikaela-shiffrin-good-as-gold-as-inspirational-olympian/", "image": {"width": 436, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__BN20140222_Z00_BNSP23OLYSHIFFRINp3.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__BN20140222_Z00_BNSP23OLYSHIFFRINp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-22T16:04:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:21:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbfb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, this is the medal,\u201d Shiffrin told her with some impatience.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t cried since she got the gold medal, and I\u2019m really proud of myself,\u201d Eileen said Saturday.\n\u201cTo be honest, the gold medal part of it, I haven\u2019t really gotten my arms wrapped around that.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told the Olympics is all about the process, it\u2019s all about the journey,\u201d Shiffrin said.\n\u201cEvery now and then I get really emotional, but I\u2019m just so proud of Mikaela on so many different levels."}
