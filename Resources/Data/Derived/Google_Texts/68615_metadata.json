Dancing and clapping as she moved, Robinson\u2019s mouth broke into a wide grin when her dancers came into her sight.\n\n\u201cThis is what I love,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nRobinson founded Cleo Parker Robinson Dance in 1970 when she returned to Denver after studying in New York with Arthur Mitchell. Rooted in African-American traditions, today the company is a cross-cultural, dance-arts and educational institution, performing locally and around the globe.\n\nSunday\u2019s show, \u201cCleo on Cleo: Voices of Yesterday and Tomorrow,\u201d was an energetic blend of nostalgia and modern dance, showcasing some of her favorite routines from years past and premiering \u201cMadiba\u2019s River,\u201d a tribute to Nelson Mandela.\n\nThe audience also was treated to a rare performance by Robinson. Accompanied by dancer Chris E. Page, Robinson swept across the stage with fluid motion in \u201cSometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.\u201d The piece was created in 1972 as a male solo but was staged to be a duet between a man and a woman this year.\n\n\u201cI never envisioned that it would ever be danced by a woman, and certainly not that the woman would be me,\u201d she wrote in the program notes.\n\nAs with most performances by the dance company, hers received a standing ovation.\n\n\u201cI felt so there. There with my mother and all the ancestors,\u201d Robinson said afterward.\n\nRobinson found dance after a heart attack at 11 left her mute for a time. Without words, she learned that dance was a form of communication and began to vigorously study the art, teaching college-level dance by age 15.\n\n\u201cToday I got chills,\u201d Robinson said of the performances.\n\nThe company also will perform the show Feb. 28 and March 1 at the Lakewood Cultural Center", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cleo Parker Robinson takes the stage for rare appearance", "title": "Cleo Parker Robinson takes the stage for rare appearance", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/23/cleo-parker-robinson-takes-the-stage-for-rare-appearance/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223_063454_Robinson3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223_063454_Robinson3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-23T18:22:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:47:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Behind the stage of the Cleo Parker Robinson Theatre, Cleo Parker Robinson was sneaking through the stage door barefoot Sunday afternoon.\nRobinson founded Cleo Parker Robinson Dance in 1970 when she returned to Denver after studying in New York with Arthur Mitchell.\nAs with most performances by the dance company, hers received a standing ovation.\nThe audience also was treated to a rare performance by Robinson.\nRobinson found dance after a heart attack at 11 left her mute for a time."}
