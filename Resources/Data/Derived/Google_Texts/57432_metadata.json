PETA sent both a video and a letter to the group asking the President to advocate for a \u201cnew Thanksgiving tradition, a healthy, humane, eco-friendly vegan Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs president, you don\u2019t endorse soft drinks or shoes, so please stop promoting an industry that wreaks havoc on the health of the American people, contributes to environmental devastation, and abuses millions of animals every year,\u201d the letter, written by PETA President Ingrid Newkirk, states.\n\nThe plea goes on, saying these \u201csmart, sensitive birds\u201d deserve \u201csome respect\u201d and not a \u201cpresidential endorsement of their suffering.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease discontinue this pathetic, outdated promotion of a violent, environmentally irresponsible, and unhealthy industry,\u201d Newkirk writes.\n\nThe White House announced Friday President Obama would pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey on Wednesday. This year\u2019s pardoned turkey and its alternative were born and bred near Badger, Minn.\n\nThough President Obama officially pardons two turkeys each year, U.S. News\u2019 Nikki Schwab reported the two turkeys pardoned in last year\u2019s ceremony, Cobbler and Gobbler, died in February.\n\nPETA spokesman David Perle said they \u201cdied less than a year because of medical conditions \u2014 which include heart failure \u2014 directly related to these cruel factory-farming practices.\u201d\n\nCheck out PETA\u2019s video below.
