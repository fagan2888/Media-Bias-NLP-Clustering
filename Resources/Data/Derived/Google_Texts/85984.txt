STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — Police confirmed Saturday that they found the bodies of a missing Steamboat Springs woman and a man in his pickup in the Sarvis Creek parking area south of Steamboat Springs.

Police identified Page Stockdale and Mark Schiebel after being notified about the pickup Saturday morning by two Routt County men who were duck hunting in the area.

“It is suspected, at this early stage in the investigation, that carbon monoxide poisoning is a factor in the deaths,” Steamboat Police Chief Joel Rae said in a news release.

All of the windows to the truck topper were closed, and there was a charcoal grill in the back.

Stockdale was reported missing Tuesday night after not showing up for a dinner date.

On Wednesday, she did not show up for a physical therapy appointment.

On Thursday, she neither boarded a plane nor canceled her ticket for a trip to Vermont.

In recent months, Stockdale had been seen driving a black Toyota Tacoma pickup with a topper.

The truck belonged to Schiebel, 59, who has lived in Steamboat for about 15 years.

Rae said autopsy and toxicology tests would be done in the coming days.

The investigation into the deaths is ongoing.
