But three weeks later, after the state Department of Financial Services found Health Republic's finances were \"substantially worse than reported,\" it was announced the insurer would shut down on Nov. 30, meaning its 200,000 customers \u2014 20 percent of the individual exchange \u2014 would have to pick a new health plan for December.\n\nThat set off a flurry of activity in which the state has tried to appease insurers and providers while maintaining continuity of care for the hundreds of thousands of Health Republic customers who are about to lose their insurance.\n\nThe Cuomo administration has begun an investigation into Health Republic, and state and federal representatives have called for an investigation of DFS to find out if the executive branch should have seen this collapse coming.\n\nMagnaCare functions as a middle-man between the insurer and the doctors and hospitals. It is responsible for setting prices with providers and charges insurers, such as Health Republic and Oscar, to rent out its network. That saves the insurer from having to contract with the thousands of providers throughout the city.\n\nMagnaCare's decision to no longer process claims does not absolve providers of their contractual responsibility to provide care for Health Republic customers.\n\nThat contract remains valid through the end of November, but some patients are reporting providers have already started turning them away.\n\nThe majority of patients may still be seen, but if they are, it means the providers who treat Health Republic customers will almost certainly receive less than full payment because Health Republic is winding down.\n\nState officials have told providers they are hopeful \"modest payments\" can be made on outstanding claims at some point in the future but a cents on the dollar promise for future payments puts doctors, hospitals and health systems in a bind.\n\n\"Hospitals are in no position to absorb such losses,\" Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said in an email. \"GNYHA will continue to push for fair and equitable solutions, including the creation of a health insurance guarantee fund \u2014 which most states already have \u2014 to cover past amounts owed and potential future exigencies.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Medical Society of the State of New York said its members are \"very worried\" about the solvency of Health Republic and being paid for services.\n\nA MagnaCare spokeswoman provided the following statement: \"MagnaCare has shared the information provided by the NY State Regulators. HRINY is winding down under the supervision of the state\u2019s assigned agent Alvarez and Marsal. Our understanding is [Alvarez and Masal] is in control of the operational process and timing.\"\n\nMagnaCare declined to comment on whether the company pressured the state to wind Health Republic down at the end of this month instead of at the end of the year.\n\nState law already requires that doctors continue to treat patients with a life-threatening condition or women in their second trimester for at least 60 days or until the end of their pregnancy.\n\nThe state also announced it is in talks with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which is treating hundreds of Health Republic customers, as well as other hospitals, to ensure access for up to one year, though it is not yet clear how that will be paid for.\n\n\"We are having frank conversations at multiple levels of the Cuomo administration to highlight the growing burden of the Health Republic shutdown on providers,\" Health Care Association of New York State said in a statement to its members. \"We agree with the focus on minimizing consumer disruption, but we are simultaneously refocusing the state on the impact of this wind-down on the provider community. HANYS has advocated for the state to establish a new guarantee fund to help pay outstanding claims, in addition to creating a mechanism to pay November claims.\"\n\nGNYHA, which also lobbies on behalf of hospitals, told its members on Monday that it will \"aggressively push for legislation to establish a health insurance guarantee fund that would not only protect health care providers in the event of an insurer insolvency, but also be able to make retroactive payments.\"\n\nHealth insurance companies, however, are likely to oppose any fund into which they have to pay.\n\n\"The state\u2019s other insurers should not bear the financial brunt of fixing a problem that they did not create,\" said Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the Health Plan Association, which represents insurers. \"Rather than a guaranty fund tax, to address the immediate problem we would propose use of state dollars analogous to the state funds being used to bail out failing hospitals in New York.\"\n\nSo far, the state has not moved to create such a fund.\n\nInstead, the Cuomo administration announced Sunday it would extend the deadline for Health Republic customers to enroll in a new plan until Nov. 30.\n\nThe administration also said it would automatically enroll Health Republic customers into another insurer, though the details of how exactly the state will do that have not yet been released.\n\nUPDATE: The story has been update with a statement from MagnaCare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/11/8582398/state-hopeful-providers-get-modest-payments-health-republic-customers", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a-Health%20Republic%20Insurance%20of%20New%20York_0_1_1.png", "type": "article", "title": "State hopeful providers get 'modest payments' for Health Republic customers"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Providers told Health Republic claims payment will cease immediately"}, "article_summary": "The majority of patients may still be seen, but if they are, it means the providers who treat Health Republic customers will almost certainly receive less than full payment because Health Republic is winding down.\nInstead, the Cuomo administration announced Sunday it would extend the deadline for Health Republic customers to enroll in a new plan until Nov. 30.\nMagnaCare's decision to no longer process claims does not absolve providers of their contractual responsibility to provide care for Health Republic customers.\nIt is responsible for setting prices with providers and charges insurers, such as Health Republic and Oscar, to rent out its network.\nThe administration also said it would automatically enroll Health Republic customers into another insurer, though the details of how exactly the state will do that have not yet been released."}
