Now, after five months of treatment there, Colin Williams, along with about 75 others at the residential care facility, must move on. The Abbe Center is closing its doors on Sept. 30.\n\nFor Colin and his mother, a Gulf War veteran, it\u0092s yet another traumatic challenge they face after \u0093the incident that changed our lives forever,\u0094 she told The Gazette Editorial Board during an interview.\n\nDianne and Colin\u0092s story provides a window into the state of mental health care services that Iowans should understand and lawmakers could better address.\n\nOn June 16, 2012, Colin, then a resident at a group care home in New Hampton, exploded into angry, threatening behavior, Dianne said. She rushed him to the hospital\u0092s ER but to no avail. Colin\u0092s anger escalated. He ran off, eventually wandered into a garage and attacked four men.\n\nA few hours later, after a court committal, he was sent to a facility in Sioux City. After three days, he was returned to the New Hampton group home but, as Dianne had feared, his behavior didn\u0092t improve. Colin came back home but exhibited terror, hearing voices, seeing things not there, she said. He tried to jump out his bedroom window several times. Sheriff\u0092s deputies intervened again.\n\nTHE PATH TO ABBE\n\nFrom there, Colin, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, spent time at hospitals and care facilities in Waterloo, Mason City and Iowa City. His medications were frequently changed, and Dianne\u0092s access to him was often restricted, she said. Eventually, he was placed at the Mental Health Institute in Independence. After a few months, MHI staff recommended Colin be placed at Abbe Center.\n\nAt first, Dianne said, she was hesitant to have Colin leave MHI. As it turned out, \u0093Abbe is the best place in the state,\u0094 she told us. \u0093Eye contact and shaking hands and allowing physical contact never happened before Colin went to Abbe. ... The doctor changed his plan and drugs, and within two weeks, there was a big difference. Abbe has been wonderful. They\u0092ve given him back his life.\u0094\n\nBut now, as the Abbe Center\u0092s closing nears, the search is on for another residential facility that can provide the intense level of care for the mentally ill that Abbe offers as part of its services. Abbe officials, as well Colin\u0092s local county central coordinator of services and the state Department of Inspections and Appeals, all can help with relocation. As of last week, his placement was not yet finalized.\n\n\u0093Dianne can\u0092t go much longer without a plan and this fear of the unknown,\u0094 said Jane Caroway, an educator who had Colin as a student for four years and advocates for those with mental illness. \u0093There\u0092s a lot of love in his family, but it\u0092s not safe for him to be at home.\u0094 And they fear that without adequate, long-term residential care and treatment, Colin could wind up being among the homeless or commit a crime that puts him into Iowa\u0092s prison system \u0097 already overtaxed with inmates who have varying levels of mental illness.\n\nABBE\u0092S DOWNSIZING\n\nAbbe\u0092s closing will cap years of downsizing before funding cuts at the local, state and federal level accelerated two years ago, when Linn County faced a $5.4 million deficit in its mental health and developmental disabilities budget. Referrals to Abbe have since dropped sharply, as has revenue. According to Abbe President Dan Strellner, Medicaid rules that pay for residential care don\u0092t cover facilities larger than 16 beds. And a national movement following the Supreme Court\u0092s 1999 Olmstead Decision affirming rights of people with disabilities to live in community settings has led to shifting many patients from large institutions \u0097 many of them, as in Iowa, the original \u0093county homes\u0094 and state mental health institutes \u0097 into more community-based homes and smaller centers.\n\nAbbe\u0092s official capacity for residential beds for people with mental illness (RCF/PMI) is 64, one of four large facilities remaining in Iowa.\n\nStrellner and Dr. Al Whitters, chief of psychiatry at Mercy Medical Center, Cedar Rapids, who works with Abbe clients, say they understand Linn County\u0092s budget cuts that impacted the non-profit Abbe Center. They worry, however, that the full continuum of care for the mentally ill faces a serious gap, especially for the people \u0093least able to defend themselves or who are a danger to themselves or others.\u0094\n\nHOSPITALS FULL\n\nThey note that hospital units in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City have nearly 170 beds for psychiatric patients that are \u0093always full\u0094 \u0097 more beds than the rest of the state combined. Yet, after Abbe closes, the new nine-county region that has been created under the state\u0092s redesign of mental health services will have only nine RCF/PMI beds that provide the \u0093subacute\u0094 care for patients released from the hospital units. At Abbe alone, there are about 25 patients who require such care.\n\nStatewide, the DIA lists 13 RCF/PMI facilities with a total capacity of 312 beds \u0097 counting Abbe. The actual statewide need? That number is hard to come by.\n\nREDESIGN\u0092S ROLE\n\nThe state redesign is in its second year. Strellner and Whitters agree with its intent to provide level services throughout the state \u0093but there\u0092s a lot of work to do yet. Some of it has been implemented without fully understanding the consequences,\u0094 Strellner told us.\n\nSteve Miller and Mark Smith of Linn County NAMI (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill) have similar concerns and believe Abbe\u0092s closing leaves a hole in vital services.\n\nPart of the unknown, Strellner and Whitters said, is how well the redesign works with the new Iowa Health and Wellness coverage for low-income Iowans and the evolving federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nRick Shults, state administrator of the mental health division of the Iowa Department of Human Services, told us the redesign did not envision an impact on the number of RCF/PMI facilities and beds. However, the redesign is based on the Olmstead Decision principles and \u0093because of this, we will all be working together to expand the availability of effective services that will allow people to live and work successfully in more communty-integrated settings. The more the integrated settings grow and prove successful, there may be an impact on larger facilities.\u0094\n\nAs we\u0092ve written before, a statewide redesign was needed. Inconsistent access and delivery of services in parts of Iowa needed to be shored up. An adequate number of smaller residential facilities with high-level care may eventually fill the need as larger ones close.\n\nTRANSITION FUNDING\n\nBut full implementation will take several more years. In the meantime, the \u0093evening out\u0094 process doesn\u0092t appear to be serving some people \u0097 such as those who are better served in an RCF/PMI facility. That\u0092s why we were disappointed when Gov. Branstad earlier this year vetoed $13 million in supplemental funding that legislators had approved for transitional assistance as the redesign unfolds.\n\nWe urge the governor and legislators to address this situation early in the 2014 session. The state\u0092s financial situation certainly is strong enough to provide more transitional funding. Iowans with needs similar to Colin\u0092s \u0097 the most at risk \u0097 can\u0092t afford to wait much longer.\n\nComments: editorial@thegazette.com or (319) 398-8262\n\n---------\n\nIowa\u0092s mental health and disability development services system redesign: http://www.dhs.state.ia.us/Partners/MHDSRedesign.html\n\nAbbe Center for Community Care\n\nhttp://www.abbe.org/\n\nNAMI Linn County\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/mj29v7u\n\nIowa Department of Inspections and Appeals, Health Services Division\n\nhttp://dia.iowa.gov/page11.html", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | The Gazette Editorial Board-----\u0093The Abbe Center is the best thing that has happened to Colin in his year of mental madness.\u0094So wrote Dianne Williams of rural C", "og": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/09/22/abbe-centers-closing-leaves-gap-in-mental-health-services", "site_name": "The Gazette", "type": "article", "description": "The Gazette Editorial Board"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/09/22/abbe-centers-closing-leaves-gap-in-mental-health-services", "description": "The Gazette Editorial Board", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Abbe Center's closing leaves gap in mental health services"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-03-28T20:45:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_", "pubDate": "2013-09-22T00:01:00-05:00", "title": "Abbe Center's closing leaves gap in mental health services"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Comments: editorial@thegazette.com or (319) 398-8262---------Iowa\u0092s mental health and disability development services system redesign: http://www.dhs.state.ia.us/Partners/MHDSRedesign.htmlAbbe Center for Community Carehttp://www.abbe.org/NAMI Linn Countyhttp://tinyurl.com/mj29v7uIowa Department of Inspections and Appeals, Health Services Divisionhttp://dia.iowa.gov/page11.html\nDianne and Colin\u0092s story provides a window into the state of mental health care services that Iowans should understand and lawmakers could better address.\nEventually, he was placed at the Mental Health Institute in Independence.\nAbbe\u0092s official capacity for residential beds for people with mental illness (RCF/PMI) is 64, one of four large facilities remaining in Iowa.\nAccording to Abbe President Dan Strellner, Medicaid rules that pay for residential care don\u0092t cover facilities larger than 16 beds."}
