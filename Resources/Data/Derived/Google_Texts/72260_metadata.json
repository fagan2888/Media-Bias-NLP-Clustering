He said Anthem has agreed to pay the claims of those who received treatment from inaccurately listed doctors during the first three months of the year.\n\nHowever, that policy would not be extended for enrollees who discovered after March 31 that their doctors had been incorrectly listed, he said.\n\nThe suit says that Anthem, the state\u2019s largest individual health insurer, delayed providing full information to consumers until it was too late for them to change coverage. Anthem also failed to disclose it had stopped offering any plans with out-of-network coverage in four of the state\u2019s biggest counties \u2014 Los Angeles, Orange, San Francisco and San Diego, the suit says.\n\nAnthem \u201cintentionally misrepresented and concealed the limitations of their plans because it wanted a big market share,\u201d said Jerry Flanagan of the consumer advocacy group. Co-counsel on the case is the Claremont law firm Shernoff Bidart Echeverria Bentley, which specializes in suing health insurers.\n\nThe suit comes as Consumer Watchdog helped put a measure on the November ballot that would give the state\u2019s insurance commissioner greater authority to veto rate increases.\n\nBrought on behalf of Anthem enrollees who purchased individual coverage between Oct. 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014, the lawsuit reflects growing consumer pushback against so-called \u201cnarrow network\u201d health plans, which are increasingly common, especially in the new online state and federal marketplaces. Anthem was a major player on California\u2019s insurance exchange and the suit includes those who bought coverage online, as well as directly from the insurer.\n\nInsurers have defended plans with limited provider networks as a way of holding down premiums. Many expected younger and healthier customers might be willing to give up broad access to providers for these lower costs.\n\nBut consumers are retaliating with lawsuits and complaints to state regulators. As a result of the rising complaints, state managed care regulators are investigating whether Anthem and, separately, Blue Shield of California, provided accurate information about the doctors and hospitals in their plans.\n\nSix Enrollees\u2019 Stories\n\nThe Consumer Watchdog lawsuit names six Californians who purchased Anthem plans. Among them is Betsy Felser of Pasadena, who had coverage with Anthem for 20 years. Like hundreds of thousands of Anthem customers, she received a letter late last year stating that her preferred provider organization (PPO), which allows for in- and out-of-network care, was being cancelled, according to the lawsuit. The letter suggested a replacement Anthem plan \u201cwith the benefits you have come to count on.\u201d\n\nBefore agreeing to switch, Felser, a physician, said she checked with five Anthem telephone representatives, making it clear she wanted to be in a PPO.\n\n\u201cI would never have gotten anything that wasn\u2019t a PPO plan,\u201d said Felser, 47, whose insurance also covers her young son. \u201cThey said they would give me the same coverage.\u201d\n\nShe also checked Anthem\u2019s website and the doctors she sees, including her son\u2019s pediatrician, to make sure they were participating in the plans she was considering and was assured that they were, she said.\n\nDuring those calls, none of Anthem\u2019s representatives told Felser that the insurer was no longer offering PPOs in Los Angeles County, the lawsuit alleges. Nor did they tell her that the Anthem plans offered in her area would not cover care provided by out-of-network doctors or hospitals, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWhen she received her identification cards, they were stamped with a PPO symbol. But when she tried to use the coverage, she found out her doctors \u2013 and her son\u2019s pediatrician \u2013 were not in the network and that the plan was an exclusive provider organization (EPO), an extremely limited type of plan which pays nothing for out-of-network care.\n\n\u201cIt pays zero, so I essentially have no coverage,\u201d said Felser.\n\nAnthem, while declining to comment on the Consumer Watchdog suit, had answered questions last week about an earlier lawsuit that raised similar issues.\n\nSpokesman Ng said then that consumers were informed about what kind of plan they purchased, along with details about out-of-network benefits, in packets they received soon after enrolling. \u201cAll those materials clearly spelled out type of plan they were receiving,\u201d he said.\n\nBut consumers would have to dig deep in a brochure on the Anthem website to find a footnote to a page 9 chart indicating that EPO plans have no out-of-network benefits.\n\nNg noted that Anthem\u2019s EPO and PPO networks have the same doctors and hospitals for people with individual policies, although only the PPOs have out-of-network benefits. In recent weeks, Anthem said it has added 3,800 doctors to its networks.\n\n\u2018A Giant Mess\u2019\n\nAs for the PPO symbol on identification cards, Ng said last week that it had been intended to protect consumers who sought emergency care out-of-state, in keeping with Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules. Ng said Anthem recently got association approval to reissue the cards without the symbol.\n\nBut consumers say the damage was done. Josh Worth of Los Angeles said he was unable to get accurate information after receiving notice that his Anthem plan would be cancelled at the end of 2013. He said he called Anthem, as well as all the doctors he used \u2014 including his child\u2019s pediatrician and his wife\u2019s obstetrician \u2014 to be sure they were participating in the network.\n\n\u201cThey all said, \u2018yes, we\u2019re going to be continuing to accept all Blue Cross PPOs,\u2019 and that\u2019s what I was told I was going to be getting,\u201d said Worth, a 43-year-old graphic artist. In January, he said he enrolled his family in an Anthem plan with an $800 a month premium.\n\nWorth received an ID card in late February that called his plan a \u201cPathway Tiered PPO,\u201d according to the lawsuit. His son was born on March 31. Not long after, he said he began receiving bills from his wife\u2019s obstetrician, who was not in the network. Nor was the baby\u2019s pediatrician, he said.\n\nAs a result, he said he owes about $1,100 out of pocket for both. And although an Anthem telephone representative told him afterward that the hospital where his son was born was not in network, it actually is \u2013 and his bills there are being covered, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a giant mess,\u201d said Worth, who can\u2019t switch plans until open enrollment resumes in the fall. \u201cI was sold something I thought was one product, but when I used it, I found out it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to be going through Anthem again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many consumers have been left on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical bills, advocacy group says.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Anthem Blue Cross Sued Over Covered California Doctor Networks\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/09\\/lawsuit-anthem-blue-cross-committed-fraudulent-enrollment-practices\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-09 11:21:23\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-10 12:20:33\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20109,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Anthem Blue Cross\",\"Covered California\"],\"categories\":[\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/01\\/96525183-e1390846077644.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Many consumers have been left on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical bills, advocacy group says.", "title": "Anthem Blue Cross Sued Over Covered California Doctor Networks", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/09/lawsuit-anthem-blue-cross-committed-fraudulent-enrollment-practices/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/01/96525183-640x426.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "anthem blue cross,covered california", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf236\"", "article_summary": "In January, he said he enrolled his family in an Anthem plan with an $800 a month premium.\n\u201cI would never have gotten anything that wasn\u2019t a PPO plan,\u201d said Felser, 47, whose insurance also covers her young son.\nJosh Worth of Los Angeles said he was unable to get accurate information after receiving notice that his Anthem plan would be cancelled at the end of 2013.\nSix Enrollees\u2019 StoriesThe Consumer Watchdog lawsuit names six Californians who purchased Anthem plans.\nNor did they tell her that the Anthem plans offered in her area would not cover care provided by out-of-network doctors or hospitals, according to the lawsuit."}
