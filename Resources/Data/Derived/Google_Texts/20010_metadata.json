The City of Flagstaff had asked the state Supreme Court to review that appeals court ruling.\n\nThe February 2011 lawsuit that the Hopi had filed in Cococino County Superior Court in Flagstaff alleged that the city\u2019s contract to sell the water impairs the public\u2019s ability to enjoy an unsullied wilderness in the peaks.\n\nRELATED: State Court Allows Hopi Case Against Arizona Snowbowl to Be Heard\n\nThe legal approach differed from previous lawsuits, which looked at the effect of snowmaking on Native religious freedoms and on the environment. The Tuesday ruling is based on whether the sale of the water should have been given the go-ahead back in 2002, the Sun said.
