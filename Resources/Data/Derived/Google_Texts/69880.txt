SAN FRANCISCO – After a somewhat lackluster signup for health care insurance by Latinos in the early part of open enrollment, California's Latino enrollment rose to 32 percent of those enrolling in healthcare coverage during the first three weeks of March.That was nearly twice what it was during the first three months of open enrollment when only about 18 percent of those signing up for insurance identified themselves as Latino. It jumped to almost 65 percent in the last week in March.The increase came because of major policy shifts decided upon in January. Latinos made up about 60 percent of California's uninsured before open enrollment began on January 1 this year.“There was a dramatic improvement in Latino enrollment,” noted Peter Lee, executive director of the state’s online marketplace health care exchange, Covered California, which served as the portal for enrollment in both individual private insurance coverage and Medi-Cal, the state’s name for the low-cost or no-cost health insurance program for low-income people, known as Medicaid in the rest of the nation.Lee was among five state health care exchange directors who reviewed for the media in an April 10 teleconference the successes of their final push for enrollment in March and lessons learned in enrolling people. At approximately 3 million and 926,000, respectively, California and New York had the highest enrollment numbers. Thursday’s teleconference was sponsored by Families USA, the national non-profit organization for health care consumers.Because a sudden uptick of unique visitors slowed the system at the end of March and may have prevented some consumers from meeting the deadline, Covered California is allowing consumers until April 15 to contact an enrollment expert and complete their application for May 1 health coverage, Lee said. They can find free, confidential help by visiting the website at www.CoveredCA.com Enrollment for low-cost or no-cost Medi-Cal insurance through the Covered California website will not be affected by the deadline, as it continues year-round.Enrollment in Covered California private health insurance plans hit 1,221,727 through March 31. In fact, March was the highest single month of enrollment, with more than 416,000 people signing up for a health insurance plan.Lee said enhanced outreach boosted enrollment among Latinos and among Californians 18-34 years old. Additionally, Covered California more than doubled the base projection for Asian enrollment and has met the base projection for African- American enrollment.Prior to the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, 7 million of the nation’s 47 uninsured people resided in California.Between the two health insurance programs, more than 3 million state residents have enrolled, said Lee.Lee said one of the reasons the state saw a last-minute surge in Latino enrollment and among Californians 18 to 34 years old was that Covered California boosted its marketing, as well as increased the number of bilingual certified enrollment counselors and certified insurance agents to help people across the finish line. There are currently more than 5,000 of those in the state who speak Spanish.He said Covered California would continue its e-mail outreach until April 15, when the grace period for the first open enrollment ends.One of the lessons learned from this year’s enrollment efforts is “getting out of the gate as early as possible,” Lee said, especially because in 2015, open enrollment will last only three months instead of the six months all states were given this year.
