Don\u2019t look now, but it probably already happened and they won the war without firing a shot.\n\nI don\u2019t generally find much ground to argue with Victor Davis Hanson on, but I think he might have been a bit off base this week when he wrote this.\n\nThe downside of this complete reliance on computer gadgetry is a fundamental ignorance of what technology is. Smart machines are simply the pumps that deliver the water of knowledge \u2014 not knowledge itself.\n\nOf course, Hanson is to be forgiven, as making predictions about technology in general \u2013 and robots in particular \u2013 can be tricky. It\u2019s even one of the subjects where Isaac Asimov got it wrong fifty years ago.\n\n\u201cRobots will neither be common nor very good in 2014, but they will be in existence.\u201d\n\nWhere is all of this robot chatter going? It\u2019s the question being examined by Michael Belfiore in the Guardian this week, as he informs us that robots are coming for your jobs, and they\u2019ll\u2019 probably have about half of them in short order.\n\nWill you be replaced by a machine? There\u2019s nearly a 50-50 chance, according to a recent study by Oxford University researchers who found that 47% of the labor market in the US alone is at risk of being mechanized out of existence. Approximately 702 jobs thus far held by humans are now threatened by non-humans, as we were reminded by a widely shared report on the study this week. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are bringing robots into more and more workplaces\u2026 There\u2019s even a robotic burger flipper in the works. The website of Momentum Machines boasts that its slicing, grinding, frying robot can do \u201ceverything employees can do except better\u201d, and that it will \u201cdemocratize access to high-quality food, making it available to the masses\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s a pretty staggering list of employment areas which may be largely on the way out, given the list of robotic innovations which are already either in production or at least on the drawing board. The author brings up The Baxter Robot which can take over mid-level management and supervisory duties, learning new tasks on the fly, as well as robot surgeons. But at least the bloggers are safe, so the Hot Air staff won\u2019t have to worry. Or will they?\n\nThe Quill robotic journalist digests facts from raw data, and spits out fully formed sports and business stories.\n\nI used to laugh off these stories myself\u2026 that is, until I was attacked by this robot during a recent tax policy conference in DC.\n\nOkay\u2026 to be fair, \u201cattacked\u201d was probably a tad hyperbolic. The robot actually just bumped into my leg a couple of times while it was trying to navigate its way into the conference center. But it was still unsettling to say the least.\n\nOne final thought on this subject relates, yet again, to the minimum wage debate going on today. I take it you noticed the part about the \u201cburger flipping robot\u201d above. The one thing stopping every food joint in the country from automating these tasks is that you can still \u2013 at least for now \u2013 find somebody to do this work for less than it would cost to try to bring in C3PO and get an apron around its waist. But once you drive up the cost of labor far enough, the steel counter server is going to look a lot more viable. Once in place, the robot will never steal from the register, call in sick, develop an out of control drug problem or take baths in your sink. And once those jobs are gone, they won\u2019t be coming back.\n\nNow if we can find a robot to scare the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses off my porch at a reasonable cost, the future will be golden indeed.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Resistance is futile", "title": "The robot revolution already happened, and we lost", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/23/the-robot-revolution-already-happened-and-we-lost/", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/VGOrobot.jpg", "height": 353}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-23T19:31:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-23T20:16:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "jobs, robots, science, science fiction, technology,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb65c\"", "article_summary": "The robot revolution already happened, and we lostposted at 3:31 pm on March 23, 2014 by Jazz ShawAre the robots coming to take over the world from the incompetent, soft hands of mankind?\n\u201cRobots will neither be common nor very good in 2014, but they will be in existence.\u201dWhere is all of this robot chatter going?\nBut at least the bloggers are safe, so the Hot Air staff won\u2019t have to worry.\nDon\u2019t look now, but it probably already happened and they won the war without firing a shot.\nThe author brings up The Baxter Robot which can take over mid-level management and supervisory duties, learning new tasks on the fly, as well as robot surgeons."}
