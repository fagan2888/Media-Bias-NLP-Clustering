A news report quoted the man as saying he would need to pay $26,000 to keep the same doctor. It turns out, he was able to get a new plan, which has his doctor in its network, for a lower premium and a lower out-of-pocket maximum than his old plan.\n\nMichael Cerpok, from Fountain Hills, Ariz., was featured in a local TV news segment on Oct. 3. The ABC15 report said that Cerpok, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 2006 and requires ongoing treatment, had received a letter from his insurer, Celtic Insurance Company, saying that his policy wasn\u2019t \u201cfully compliant\u201d with the Affordable Care Act and would be canceled. Cerpok, a self-employed businessman, was paying $855 per month for the policy for himself.\n\nThe report said his out-of-pocket costs in 2012 were only $4,500, even though his treatment for leukemia totaled more than $350,000. Cerpok wanted to keep the same doctor he had at the Mayo Clinic. He told ABC15: \u201cNow it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t go see my current doctor, but my $4,500 out-of-pocket, is going to turn into a minimum of $26,000 out-of-pocket to see the doctor that I\u2019ve been seeing the last seven years.\u201d\n\nThat local Phoenix news segment has gone viral. Cerpok\u2019s plight now has been highlighted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank; cited in an ad from Americans for Prosperity, as the announcer says \u201cArizonans are losing the health care plans they love, the doctors they know\u201d; and featured on many other conservative websites. Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint wrote a letter in early October to President Obama that said: \u201cWe are fighting for people like Michael Cerpok, a leukemia patient in Arizona, who recently learned he will lose his current health insurance due to this misguided law. He notes that \u2018my $4,500 out-of-pocket [expense] is going to turn into a minimum of $26,000 out-of-pocket to see the doctor that I\u2019ve been seeing the last seven years,\u2019 and he worries that he and his wife might need to take second jobs to stay afloat.\u201d\n\nBut this story has a happy ending. We spoke with Cerpok a month after the TV report aired, and things have changed. Cerpok told us he was able to sign up for a new plan that has his current oncologist and hospital in its network. He said the policy was less expensive, but didn\u2019t have some of the same benefits \u2014 such as a specialty prescription drug benefit for cancer drugs. \u201cI will say that my premiums went down, as did my yearly total out of pocket maximum, commensurate with the benefits I lost,\u201d he said in an email to FactCheck.org. \u201cMy policy contains MANY things that I will never use.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to reveal how much money he was saving with the new policy or other details on the coverage, saying that he had received a lot of criticism after the ABC15 report aired.\n\nThat report, however, is what led him to a new plan. Cerpok had a career as a martial artist, and one of his former student\u2019s parent, who owns an insurance agency, contacted him after seeing the news report, Cerpok said, and helped him find comparable insurance. \u201cHe did a lot of research,\u201d Cerpok said, and \u201cfound a plan for me which I have now signed up for.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an individual market plan, but it is not through the federal exchange. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my new plan to be a part of a subsidized government-mandated health care,\u201d he told us. He said he had no problem with Americans getting subsidies to help them buy insurance, but he was opposed to the individual mandate, requiring everyone to buy coverage. \u201cThis is about freedom to choose,\u201d Cerpok said.\n\nHe said he did not look at health plans on the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov. Estimates available on the exchange website show significantly lower rates than the $855 Cerpok had been paying. Coverage for a single person over 50 \u2014 Cerpok is 52 \u2014 starts at $237.04 per month for a bronze plan. The highest-priced plan was an estimated $576.62 in Maricopa County, Ariz.\n\nHis old insurer, Celtic, did not offer him a new plan and is no longer selling individual market plans in Arizona, according to its website. We contacted Celtic\u2019s parent company, Centene, but haven\u2019t received a response to our questions. The $26,000 figure Cerpok cited in the news report comes from him looking into joining his wife\u2019s employer-based plan, which is through Blue Cross Blue Shield and doesn\u2019t include Cerpok\u2019s doctor and the Mayo Clinic in its network. He said Blue Cross Blue Shield told his wife he could continue to see his doctor on that plan, but the out-of-network costs would total $26,000 for the year.\n\nThe $855 Cerpok is paying for the soon-to-be-canceled Celtic policy is a high price, but he said he was happy it covered the bulk of his leukemia treatment. Individual market premiums vary \u2014 and as his premium shows, can vary greatly. The average price for Arizona, as calculated by the conservative Manhattan Institute, adjusting for preexisting conditions, was $127 per month for a 40-year-old and $386 for a 64-year-old male before the Affordable Care Act. The Kaiser Family Foundation found an average individual market premium of $241 per person per month in 2010 in Arizona, noting that was an average for all adults and children.\n\nThe cost estimates aren\u2019t what\u2019s important to Cerpok, however. It\u2019s about the right to choose to buy whatever you want. \u201cThe health insurance industry certainly needed to be put in check, and we certainly needed to provide affordable care for low income earners,\u201d he told us in an email. \u201cBut, I should not have had a product that I was willing to pay for, and that I had been very happy with, taken away from me by a government mandate and then taxed\u2026er, I mean fined\u2026if I chose not to replace it with a product I don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nThe cost of insurance has been the focus of political claims, and it was the focus of the local Arizona news report, which said the insurance switch could cost Cerpok \u201ctens of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Cerpok isn\u2019t facing such an increase, and instead lowered his monthly payments. He wasn\u2019t able to keep his plan, but he was able to keep his doctor.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3b9\"", "article_summary": "Conservative groups are highlighting the case of an Arizona man with leukemia whose insurance plan was canceled because it didn\u2019t comply with the Affordable Care Act.\nCerpok told us he was able to sign up for a new plan that has his current oncologist and hospital in its network.\nThe report said his out-of-pocket costs in 2012 were only $4,500, even though his treatment for leukemia totaled more than $350,000.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want my new plan to be a part of a subsidized government-mandated health care,\u201d he told us.\nA news report quoted the man as saying he would need to pay $26,000 to keep the same doctor."}
