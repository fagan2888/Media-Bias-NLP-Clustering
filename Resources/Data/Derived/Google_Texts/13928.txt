When the first cold snap of the year rolls through KAKEland, plumbers say they get bombarded with calls, usually about frozen or burst pipes.

"Anytime it gets cold, you want to prepare for the worst," said Jeremy Lucas, a service technician with Mr. Rooter.

Lucas says homeowners can save themselves a major headache and a lot of money if they do a little preventative maintenance.

"Disconnect their hose from their hose bib outside of their house," Lucas said. "That allows the water not to be trapped inside the spigot to where it can freeze and bust. Also another thing to do, in your crawl spaces, if you have any openings to go ahead and get those sealed off. Insulate your pipes because the cold weather and the cold air coming through your crawl spaces can definitely freeze those pipes pretty quick."

And to avoid a broken main which can lead to flooding, Lucas says turn on faucets--either to a slow drip or steady stream.

"It allows that water to keep flowing so it can't have time to build up and burst your pipes inside your house," he said.

Homeowners are also encouraged to keep the heat in their homes on at all times. Even if they go out of town, they can turn it down, but not completely off.
