Let's see,\" Perry said. He turned to Texas Rep. Ron Paul, looking for some help, but got nothing but a remark from Paul that he would eliminate five agencies. \"Oh five,\" Perry said. \"So Commerce, Education, and, uh, the uh, um, um.\" \"EPA?\" offered former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. \"EPA, there ya go,\" Perry said as the room exploded in laughter. CNBC moderator John Harwood honed in and pressed Perry: \"Seriously? Is EPA the one you were talking about?\" \"No sir. No sir. We were talking about the, um, agencies of government,\" Perry said. \"The EPA needs to be rebuilt.\" \"But you can't name the third one?\" Harwood persisted. \"The third agency of government,\" Perry said. \"I would do away with the education, the um, Commerce, and let's see.
