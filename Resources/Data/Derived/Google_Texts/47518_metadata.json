Scary how much influence he once had.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Obamacare a winning issue for Democrats, Pelosi says\n\nFrom there, the tweets came rolling in, attacking Mr. Drudge via social media and liberal news outlets, Breitbart reported.\n\n\u201cDude, there\u2019s no penalty until next yr,\u201d Sahil Kapur of Talking Points Memo tweeted, followed with a full story in the news outlet with a headline saying Mr. Drudge was \u201cprobably lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t pay a penalty for not having health insurance until they file their 2014 taxes\u2014in 2014,\u201d Dylan Scott wrote in the story. \u201cSo either Drudge is lying or he paid a huge penalty a year earlier than he needed to.\u201d\n\nA similar story appeared in Huffington Post, in which the author, Jeffrey Young, wrote Mr. Drudge\u2019s tweet was \u201cweird\u201d and a \u201clittle head-scratching.\u201d\n\nWhat each critical tweeter and pundit failed to realize was that Mr. Drudge, as the self-employed proprietor of The Drudge Report, files taxes as a small business on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe IRS requires self-employed business owners to file annual returns and pay estimated quarterly taxes. When entrepreneurs like Mr. Drudge file their 2014 first quarter taxes, they have to pay the individual health care mandate if they are not getting Obamacare coverage.\n\nThe IRS form also allows adding the mandate to the section labeled \u201cother taxes,\u201d hence Mr. Drudge\u2019s chosen name \u201cLiberty tax.\u201d\n\nA Senate Budget Committee aide told Breitbart News, \u201cIt is true that thousands of small businesses will be forces to pay Obamacare taxes quarterly in 2014.\u201d\n\nBreitbart reported that Mr. Drudge did respond to the ill-informed critics, tweeting, \u201cDazed team Obama media reporters think Opt-Out tax \u2018year-away\u2019? Not for small businesses that file Qtr estimates. We\u2019re there NOW, baby #pay.\u201d\n\nThat tweet was removed from Mr. Drudge\u2019s feed and replaced with another, which linked to the Talking Points Memo. It read: \u201cObama media team knows they will not get audited for avoiding taxes. I don\u2019t have this luxury. So they mock, ridicule.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Left leaning media outlets criticized Internet news mogul Matt Drudge's tweets on Friday, but the backlash stemmed from a misunderstanding of how Obamacare will affect small businesses.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Left leaning media outlets criticized Internet news mogul Matt Drudge\u2019s tweets on Friday, but the backlash stemmed from a misunderstanding of how Obamacare will affect small businesses.", "title": "Media wrongly attack Drudge after he admits paying Obamacare penalty", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/22/media-wrongly-attack-drudge-after-he-admits-paying/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/22/drudge-ap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/22/drudge-ap.jpg", "description": "Left leaning media outlets criticized Internet news mogul Matt Drudge's tweets on Friday, but the backlash stemmed from a misunderstanding of how Obamacare will affect small businesses.", "card": "summary", "title": "Media wrongly attack Drudge after he admits paying Obamacare penalty"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Matt Drudge"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd204\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019re there NOW, baby #pay.\u201dThat tweet was removed from Mr. Drudge\u2019s feed and replaced with another, which linked to the Talking Points Memo.\nWhen entrepreneurs like Mr. Drudge file their 2014 first quarter taxes, they have to pay the individual health care mandate if they are not getting Obamacare coverage.\nScary how much influence he once had.\u201dSEE ALSO: Obamacare a winning issue for Democrats, Pelosi saysFrom there, the tweets came rolling in, attacking Mr. Drudge via social media and liberal news outlets, Breitbart reported.\nLeft leaning media outlets criticized Internet news mogul Matt Drudge\u2019s tweets on Friday, but the backlash stemmed from a misunderstanding of how Obamacare will affect small businesses.\nThe IRS requires self-employed business owners to file annual returns and pay estimated quarterly taxes."}
