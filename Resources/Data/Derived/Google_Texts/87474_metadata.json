And for too many people, the law makes it more expensive\u2014by taking away people\u2019s choices,\u201d said Rep. Paul Ryan, the committee\u2019s chairman. \u201cIf your insurance company charges too much, what are you going to do? They all charge too much, and now you have to buy.\u201d\n\nDemocrats expressed concern that by removing the provisions it would destabilize the overall functionality of the bill.\n\n\u201cYou take away the motor and the car just isn\u2019t functional,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Rangel.\n\nWhile some provisions would be eliminated, certain aspects of the bill, including the ability for adults over the age of 22 to stay on their parent\u2019s health insurance plans and the requirement for insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions, would stay in tact.\n\nA select number of Democrats joined with their counterparts on the right in their distaste for the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member government agency established to recommend cuts to Medicare and Medicaid when spending reaches a certain level.\n\nRep. Loretta Sanchez said while she sees the Affordable Care Act as an overall success she thinks there is room for improvement.\n\n\u201cRepealing the IPAB and eliminating the board of 15 unelected and largely unaccountable individuals whose primary purpose is to cut Medicare is to me a no brainer,\u201d the California Democrat said, adding that she would vote for IPAB repeal in committee but against it \u201cwhen this good policy is inevitably hijacked and patched into a vehicle that\u2019s not good, and designed to placate the far-right wing of the party.\u201d\n\nRemoving the mandates passed the committee along party lines in a 23-14 vote with Democrats rejecting the measure. The House Budget Committee will take on the bill in coming weeks.\n\nRanking member Sander Levin said the bill would never pass the upper chamber, a comment Ryan disagreed with, saying reconciliation is the best chance to get the bill on the president\u2019s desk and a tool that should be used more often.\n\n\u201cWe really do believe this law, this entire law is doing great damage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is pricing healthcare out of reach for millions of people, it is hastening the fiscal problems we have in this country, it is reducing choice and competition, it is consolidating providers, it is denying choices for individual families and it\u2019s putting businesses out of business and pushing people out of their employer-sponsered healthcare.\n\nIf the bill passes the Senate, it will be the first of many attempts to in the House to unravel the legislation, but could still be vetoed by the executive branch.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
