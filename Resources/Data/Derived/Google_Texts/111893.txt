Austin Sigg, the teenager who pleaded guilty to the kidnapping and murder of Jessica Ridgeway, has been moved to an out-of-state prison, the Colorado Department of Correction confirmed Sunday.

Sigg, who was being held at a Denver intake center, was moved to an undisclosed location, said Adrienne Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the department.

Such transfers are not rare, said Jacobson, adding that they usually occur with high-profile offenders in an effort to preserve their privacy and safety, as well as that of their victims.

The news of Siggâ€™s transfer was first reported by 9News.

Sigg, who was 17 years old when he brutally murdered Ridgeway, an elementary school student from Westminster, was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 40 years in November 2013.

On Oct. 5, 2012, Sigg grabbed the 10-year-old as she walked to school, forcing her into his Jeep before binding her hands and feet with zip ties, according to a confession and police evidence. He then comforted the young girl, showing her a movie and telling her that she would be returned to his mother.

At some point later that day, Sigg strangled the girl with his bare hands and later scattering her remains in Denver suburbs.

Jessica was missing for days as police collected evidence and conducted countless interviews in an all-out manhunt for the girl. Sigg was arrested Oct. 23 after he confessed to the killing to his mother.

Sigg also pleaded guilty to an attempted kidnapping at Ketner Lake in 2012.
