As the obesity rate continues to rise, doctors say the health benefits of walking are lost to a generation of \u201chelicopter parents\u201d worried more about their children\u2019s immediate safety.\n\nIn a new study from the United Kingdom, psychologist David Rowe finds that parents tend to make the final decision on how younger children commute to school, often insisting on driving or bussing rather than walking or biking.\n\n\"The journey between school and home provides an ideal opportunity for physical activity but it is by no means always taken,\u201d the investigator said in a press statement from the University of Strathclyde. \"It may be that parents want their children to travel by car or bus for their safety. This is perfectly understandable but it also means that they can miss out on a great deal of beneficial physical activity and it could be that the children want to walk or cycle themselves.\"\n\nIn following a sampling of 166 schoolchildren around the age of 9, Rowe found that approximately half commuted to school on foot. The average child took about 1,627 steps per day, the equivalent of about a mile. As expected, children walked less during the colder months beginning in autumn, hibernating until spring.\n\nRowe presented the findings Wednesday in Toronto at the Global Summit on the Physical Activity of Children as part of an ongoing investigation into the walking habits of children between the ages of 8 and 9.\n\n\"We would recommend that measures aimed at increasing walking to school should be targeted not only to older children, who may be in a position to make their own decisions, but also to parents of younger children, as they will have the final say on how their child travels,\u201d he said. \u201cExercise is an indispensable part of children's health and wellbeing and is vital in tackling the increasing obesity problem worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe study was also associated with Travelling Green, an advisory available to schools through Sustrans, a U.K.-based organization promoting healthier habits of walking and biking. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 18 percent of 6- to 11-year-olds were obese in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "walking and obesity, childhood obesity and walking, walking to school and obesity, walking and overweight children", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors say today's generation of schoolchildren are missing the health benefits of walking or biking to school.", "title": "Why Parents Should Let Their Kids Walk To School", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/helicopter-parents-need-let-go-students-are-missing-health-benefits-walking-school-284192", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/todays-kids-missing-health-benefits-walking-school.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors say today's generation of schoolchildren are missing the health benefits of walking or biking to school.", "title": "Why Parents Should Let Their Kids Walk To School", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/helicopter-parents-need-let-go-students-are-missing-health-benefits-walking-school-284192", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/todays-kids-missing-health-benefits-walking-school.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/todays-kids-missing-health-benefits-walking-school.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-23T11:41:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-23T11:41:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors say today's generation of schoolchildren are missing the health benefits of walking or biking to school."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c38\"", "article_summary": "A British psychologist says doctors should sell parents of younger children on the health benefits of walking to school, as the obesity rate continues to rise.\nAs expected, children walked less during the colder months beginning in autumn, hibernating until spring.\nAs the obesity rate continues to rise, doctors say the health benefits of walking are lost to a generation of \u201chelicopter parents\u201d worried more about their children\u2019s immediate safety.\nLong gone are the days when children routinely walked home from neighborhood schools, following railroad tracks and short-cutting across carefully manicured lawns.\n\"It may be that parents want their children to travel by car or bus for their safety."}
