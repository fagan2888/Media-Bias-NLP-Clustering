There are some nonnegotiables when you first hit the road: Start slow and finish strong, never run through pain, and invest in running shoes and replace them before they wear out. But the rest is open to individual interpretation.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t undo your roadwork at the dinner table. It\u2019s easy to get into a cycle of entitlement eating, indulging in treats and eating back the calories you burn running. Keep in mind most people overestimate the number of calories they burn and low-ball the number they consume.\n\n\u2022 Follow the 10-minute rule. The first 10 minutes of any run are going to feel tough. You\u2019ll probably feel stiff, achy, tired and ticked off. That\u2019s a natural part of transitioning from being sedentary to being in motion. If you keep pushing your body forward \u2014 even if you\u2019re walking \u2014 your weariness will soon evolve into exhilaration. We promise.\n\n\u2022 Learn the difference between good and bad pain. Running isn\u2019t going to feel comfortable or easy. Not in the first few weeks or even months. But any pain that persists or worsens as you run or after you\u2019re done is something that deserves at least two days of rest and possibly a call to the doctor.\n\n\u2022 Take your run like medicine. The hour before a run is tougher than anything you\u2019ll encounter out there. Before you go, a flood of excuses will threaten to get between you and the road. But if you don\u2019t take care of your body, it won\u2019t take care of you.\n\n\u2022 Go with the flow. The state of your work, family and social life will have a huge impact on how much time, emotion, energy and interest you can bring to running, and what you need from it. Keep setting new goals that work well with your lifestyle and your state of mind.\n\n\u2013 Lenny Bernstein, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/10/health_running16a-crop-e1350406066280.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23a3\"", "article_summary": "There are some nonnegotiables when you first hit the road: Start slow and finish strong, never run through pain, and invest in running shoes and replace them before they wear out.\nIt\u2019s easy to get into a cycle of entitlement eating, indulging in treats and eating back the calories you burn running.\nHere are tips on staring up a running program and staying with it from Jennifer Van Allen, who has run 49 marathons and is the co-author of \u201cRunner\u2019s World Big Book of Running for Beginners\u201d:\u2022 Do it your own way.\nRunning isn\u2019t going to feel comfortable or easy.\nThe state of your work, family and social life will have a huge impact on how much time, emotion, energy and interest you can bring to running, and what you need from it."}
