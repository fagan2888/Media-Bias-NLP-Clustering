Forgive my negativity, but\u2026I was not expecting much, and the good doctor did not disappoint. He did not exactly come highly recommended. He just happened to be taking new patients.\n\nI was greeted with a half-hearted handshake, directed to a couch, and told in no uncertain terms that our appointment would be 45 minutes and not a minute longer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a lot of questions but don\u2019t go into detail because we don\u2019t have time for that. Going forward, you should know that all of your future appointments will be exactly 15 minutes. I will not spend time with you or really even check to see how you\u2019re doing. I will check your medications and you will leave. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, it\u2019s actually very wrong, but that\u2019s how we do it.\u201d\n\nIt had already been a long day. My husband is sick. I drove with my parking brake on and thought there was something seriously wrong with my car for, like, 20 minutes before I figured it out. When I went to get gas, I pulled up to the pump on the wrong side\u2026twice.\n\nRemember that old country song, \u201cDid I Shave My Legs for This\u201d? I\u2019ve been singing it in my head ever since I got home. Thirty seconds into my appointment and he had already done everything but win me over.\n\nSo he went over a long list of rapid-fire questions, none of which were out of the DSM. Nowhere in the DSM does it ask: \u201cDo you talk to aliens or ghosts flying around your head?\u201d Nowhere does it say: \u201cHave you ever been found wandering the street naked and talking to yourself?\u201d\n\nIf I hesitated for even a second on any of the questions, he motioned at me with his hands to hurry up. Everything was very black and white. No room for explanation or interpretation. He said there\u2019s nothing wrong with being \u201ccrazy\u201d or with choosing not to get treatment for being \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nHe confirmed what I already knew: that Seroquel is making me gain weight and Effexor is making me lose my hair. He said he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m really bipolar because I\u2019m 35 and have never been \u201clocked up\u201d for a lengthy period of time. If I was truly bipolar, I would have done some serious psych hospital time by now. I tried to tell him that there were times when I should have been hospitalized, but he waved that off and said it doesn\u2019t work that way, whatever that means.\n\nI never quite got a diagnosis out of him, which is frustrating because I\u2019m fairly certain that if anyone else had listened to my answers, they would have at least diagnosed me with depression, no questions asked. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind or in the mind of anyone knows me that I suffer from depression. But all I got was a \u201cmood disorder undefined\u201d and possibly anxiety.\n\nOh, there was that one other possible diagnosis\u2026I could be a \u201cPITA.\u201d I had no idea what that meant, so he explained that it meant \u201cPain In The A$$.\u201d No, he wasn\u2019t joking. He wasn\u2019t joking at all. If at any time during my appointment this man was joking, I was completely unaware of it. If so, he should start playing poker in Vegas because he\u2019d totally clean up.\n\nHe didn\u2019t really explain anything to me, but when he did take a stab at clearing something up he explained it in racial terms that I didn\u2019t understand. He\u2019s Philippino (I found out during the course of our discussion) and I don\u2019t think he likes Americans. He kept saying \u201cyou Americans\u201d and \u201chere in America\u201d in the most sarcastic way possible. He tried to explain to me that bipolar disorder is different from, say, intermittent explosive disorder, because\u2026um, something about \u201cjust because someone has dark skin that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s black, he could just have a really dark tan\u201d and something else about black people having curly hair. I\u2026I don\u2019t know. He lost me there.\n\nAt one point during the question-and-answer session, he just blurted out: \u201cSex.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cDo you want it?\u201d\n\nI sat there for what felt like an eternity before I realized he was asking if I had a sex drive. I\u2019m glad I took the time to figure that out because I was on the verge of saying, \u201cNot with you\u201d or \u201cNope, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the appointment, he laid out my treatment plan for my very vague \u201cundefined\u201d illness. He told me to go home, look up some psych meds to see which ones look the most attractive (have the least side effects), talk to my husband and my friends about it, and come back in five weeks and tell him what I want to take. (This could either be the start of one wild party or a slow descent into complete madness.)\n\nImagine! You go to your family doctor sick with some sort of bacterial infection, and he tells you to pick out your own drugs! This would never fly in any other field, obviously. People would be requesting Xanax to treat yeast infections.\n\nMy psychiatrist doesn\u2019t have a great bedside manner. He sort of talks down to you. You don\u2019t get the overwhelming sense that he loves his job. But I have to give him a little credit, because he was honest. Brutally, painfully honest.\n\n\u201cIf you have mental problems, you can\u2019t really get treated unless you try to kill yourself, try to kill your mother, or are wandering the streets without any clothes on.\u201d I double-dog dare ya to find another psychiatrist who will say it exactly like it is. It\u2019s not what I wanted to hear, but it didn\u2019t come as any great shock, either.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets really messy, though. He blames the whole mess on Obamacare. Now, we all know that the mental health system was absolutely terrible long before Obamacare\u2026and long before Obama himself. That part seems like a cop-out to me. It\u2019s a convenient excuse to give frustrated patients who, frankly, spend more time waiting on their order at Taco Bell than they do receiving real answers and treatment from psychiatrists.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s attitude isn\u2019t what frustrates me. I can handle smug and sarcastic, that doesn\u2019t bother me. What bothers me is that this was my one and only option \u2013 literally the only psychiatrist who was seeing new patients. I\u2019d love a second opinion, but do you know how impossible that\u2019s going to be?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mind not having bipolar disorder. (And I do believe he\u2019s right about that, after reviewing the events of my life over and over\u2026) But I don\u2019t have any answers at all because of the lack of time and interest on his part, or I should say the system\u2019s part. The fact that I\u2019m not violent or delusional means I can\u2019t be accurately diagnosed or treated.\n\nThere are no preventative measures, at least not medically. If I feel like I\u2019m getting severely depressed, possibly even borderline suicidal\u2026oh well! I have to actually harm myself or someone else (or at least threaten to do so) to get help. That\u2019s like saying I can\u2019t get my insulin unless I slip into a coma.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to be not surprised and absolutely shocked at the same time, but that\u2019s how I feel. I am now \u2013 basically \u2013 undiagnosed. Undiagnosed, lost, wondering what it will take to raise this sinking ship we call the mental health system.\n\nI\u2019m usually asking people to send me horror stories about their experiences, but please, PLEASE, if you have had the opposite experience, let me know in the comments.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Psych Central.com", "description": "Finally, after more than a year, I got to see a psychiatrist yesterday.
