Having bet everything on the certainty of collapse, now the Party faced the prospect that the law would work more or less as intended. Conservatives like Ross Douthat and Ramesh Ponnuru urged the Party to accept the new reality and build a health-care policy that didn\u2019t require suddenly throwing millions of people off their insurance.\n\nThis moment of confusion and flux turned out to be a perfectly opportune moment for Bobby Jindal. In an act of exquisite timing, Jindal was releasing his own health-care plan (of sorts) and promoting it to Washington conservatives, and he used the moment to position himself as the spokesman for reactionary irredentism. The sudden opening of political and moral sanity within the party created the perfect foil for him to push against and demand the opposite. Jindal would continue to insist on a full repeal of Obamacare, would not offer anything remotely comparable in its place, and oh, by the way, might run for president. (\u201cI've said it's something I'm thinking about. But right now, I'm focused on winning the war of ideas.\u201d)\n\n\n\nNow, about those ideas. Conservatives had invested heavily in the idea that the Affordable Care Act would flounder. The GOP\u2019s ability to unite on the (apparent) practical failure of the law allowed it to paper over any decision about the practical alternative \u2014 they knew it couldn\u2019t work, so why bother deciding if any of it should work?\n\nIt turns out not all Republicans have any practical qualms about throwing millions of Americans off their insurance (let alone moral qualms). William Kristol, for instance, has seamlessly transitioned from mortal certainty that the law will die to mortal certainty that Republicans must kill it. Jindal forthrightly told Washington conservatives Wednesday that they cannot shrink from fear of eliminating access to medical care that Obama has created:\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s a mistake if we say that we can\u2019t take back what Obama\u2019s already given ... That\u2019s the attack from the Left obviously, that once you\u2019ve given stuff to folks, once you've expanded a program, you can\u2019t cut it back. If as conservatives we concede that, we\u2019re done. We\u2019re done as a country and we\u2019re done as a conservative movement.\u201d\n\nAlso, the plan involves breaking her other arm.

But there isn\u2019t much more. Jindal proposes to tinker with the tax treatment of health benefits, but without going far enough to either provide real funds to purchase insurance to individuals or to disrupt employer-based insurance. There\u2019s the usual bit about letting insurers sell plans across state lines, which means letting the state most willing to allow insurers to cherry-pick healthy customers set national regulatory standards. He urges a focus on cost containment, which was a mantra of Republican opposition to the bill in 2009 and 2010, and had faded since health-care inflation has fallen to a 50-year low. Citing cost containment as the rationale to repeal a law that has at best created, and at worst coincided with, the most positive cost containment news in modern history is more than a bit perverse.\n\nThe only unique element of Jindal\u2019s plan is a $100 billion grant program (over the next decade) to states to \u201ccome up with insurance reforms and other solutions that can stem the rising tide of health costs.\u201d\n\nIs $100 billion a lot of money? No, it is not. It\u2019s 1/20th the size of the coverage provisions in Obamacare. It could finance coverage for no more than a token few. The role the $100 billion plays is a kind of magic wand that allows Jindal to pretend that states will come up with some kind of solution to all our problems at a cost of 0.2 percent of the federal budget (my figure, arrived at by dividing $100 billion by the projected $47 trillion in federal outlays over the next decade).\n\nJindal, trying to maintain his wonk credibility, presents his hand-waving, kill-\u2019em-all-and-let-the-states-sort-\u2019em-out gesture as a detailed proposal: \u201cI think there are some smart political folks in this town who think the best course is just to be against Obamacare until November and don\u2019t propose anything specific,\u201d he says, \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d Meanwhile, Republican economic adviser Douglas Holz-Eakin, in the course of defending Jindal, admits he doesn\u2019t have enough details to amount to a real plan: \u201cThere is no advantage in putting forward details at this point. It will just get picked apart.\u201d\n\nDetails, obviously, have little to do with the basis for Jindal\u2019s positioning. A plan that would have seemed vague and unappealing a week ago is now a firm clarion call for opposition. Jindal will give no quarter to the poor and sick. Bad news for Republicans may turn out to be very good news for Bobby Jindal.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "A merciless new presidential campaign takes shape.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "A merciless new presidential campaign takes shape.", "title": "Bobby Jindal Will Take Away Your Insurance, and He\u2019ll Enjoy Doing It", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/bobby-jindal-will-take-away-your-insurance.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/12/13/14-jindal.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A merciless new presidential campaign takes shape.", "title": "Bobby Jindal Will Take Away Your Insurance", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/12/13/14-jindal.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, bobby jindal, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,bobby jindal,obamacare", "published_time": "2014-04-04T11:30:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, bobby jindal, obamacare", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07e4\"", "article_summary": "This moment of confusion and flux turned out to be a perfectly opportune moment for Bobby Jindal.\nBad news for Republicans may turn out to be very good news for Bobby Jindal.\nJindal proposes to tinker with the tax treatment of health benefits, but without going far enough to either provide real funds to purchase insurance to individuals or to disrupt employer-based insurance.\nIt turns out not all Republicans have any practical qualms about throwing millions of Americans off their insurance (let alone moral qualms).\nA plan that would have seemed vague and unappealing a week ago is now a firm clarion call for opposition."}
