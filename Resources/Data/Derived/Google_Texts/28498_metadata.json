SCOTT OLSON / Getty Images\n\nDES MOINES -- On Gov. Christie\u2019s first trip to Iowa as a declared presidential candidate, he discussed the nuclear deal with Iran, his plan to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent, gun control, agriculture policy, and a number of other issues with voters in town-hall-style meetings.\n\nAs much as Christie thrives in the unscripted town-hall format, he also says he relishes the nitty gritty, walk-three-blocks-in-45-minutes part of the campaign, during which he shakes hands, takes pictures, and engages in small talk in the sweltering heat.\n\nMuch of the 2016 race, of course, will come down to policy ideas, fund-raising, etc. But to walk with Chris Christie in Davenport and downtown Des Moines is to see how voters respond to the candidate in real time. Do they go for a simple handshake? Offer a word of encouragement? Or ask, Please, Governor, what are you going to do about this Obamacare thing?\n\nIt also offers a glimpse into what Christie calls the \u201ccircus\u201d that his life has become.\n\nHere are a few scenes from Christie\u2019s interactions with Iowans over the past two days: at once mundane (he\u2019s only walking, after all) and fascinating (everyone wants to meet the presidential candidate, and time seems to move slowly).\n\n--Christie\u2019s inaugural stroll through Iowa as a presidential candidate came at a street festival in Davenport Friday afternoon. As he made his way through the crowd, introducing himself to everyone as \u201cChris,\u201d one vendor made sure to get his attention.\n\n\u201cChris, you best not pass me up,\u201d she said. This is how Christie came to sample a bacon-wrapped fried Oreo.\n\nLater, a passerby shaked the governor\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThanks for the bipartisanship\u201d -- a complement, to be sure, but still a decidedly odd thing to hear near a hot dog stand.\n\n-Undeterred by the glaring sun, Christie followed up Saturday morning with a walk through a farmers market in Des Moines. \u201cRun for president, and you\u2019ll learn how to do a selfie really well,\u201d he told some guy as the governor took their picture. (For more on the art of the selfie and 2016 presidential race, read this insightful New York Times story.)\n\nHe later autographed pictures of himself and found solidarity with a \u201csuffering Mets fan.\u201d\n\n-Christie capped his weekend in Iowa with a stop by an Italian-American heritage festival in Des Moines early Saturday evening.\n\nKey events: high-fiving a baby and admiring a cook\u2019s preparation of lasagna on a grill -- an impressive feat, he said. \u201cMy mother would be very proud of you,\u201d said Christie, whose mom was Sicilian.\n\nHe also snatched up two meatballs -- the \u201cbiggest at the festival,\u201d a vendor assured me. But Christie wouldn't eat them until later, a campaign aide explained, because the governor was wearing a white shirt, which the sauce could ruin.\n\nHe then spoke with the press one last time before departing for New Hampshire on Monday.\n\n\u201cAs you saw as I was walking around here, and the market this morning, I enjoy this,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThis is not, like, a burden for me. I enjoy meeting people. They seem to enjoy meeting me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160526, "editdate": "20150725T20:33:49", "twitter": {"title": "Walking with Chris Christie in Iowa", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/trenton-takes/Walking-with-Chris-Christie-in-Iowa.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/20150726_christie_iowa_1024.jpg", "creator": "@AndrewSeidman", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "cg": "news", "keywords": "Andrew Seidman", "description": "As much as Gov.
