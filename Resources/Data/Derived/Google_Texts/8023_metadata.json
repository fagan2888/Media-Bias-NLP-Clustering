Her allegations raise both ethical and legal questions at a time when the national Planned Parenthood organization faces a hostile climate in Washington, D.C., and beyond.\n\nFrom April 1991 to December 2008, Thayer managed Planned Parenthood\u2019s clinic in Storm Lake, Iowa. From 1993 to 1997, she also was center manager of the clinic in LeMars, Iowa. The two locations since have been consolidated into Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.\n\nThayer says she was fired at the end of 2008 after raising concerns about \u201cwebcam abortions\u201d\u2014 a controversial practice that allows Planned Parenthood doctors to dispense abortion-inducing pills to clients remotely using video-conferencing equipment.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Heartland calls Thayer a \u201cdisgruntled former employee.\u201d In an email to The Daily Signal, it said: \u201cWe deny those allegations and have no other statement to make on that case.\u201d\n\nThayer maintains she\u2019s anything but disgruntled. She continues to move forward with her lawsuit, and she testified before Congress in October about her experience inside the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider.\n\n\u201cI really feel like, as a taxpayer, as a mom, as a lover of life, it\u2019s my job to try to shed light on what goes on in there,\u201d Thayer told The Daily Signal in an exclusive interview. \u201cI know they\u2019re not being honest.\u201d\n\nMedicaid Billed for More Than 10 Times Cost of Pills\n\nBy privately negotiating a deal with Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, a birth control prescription manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Thayer said the Iowa clinics were able to purchase birth control pills for $2.89 per 28-day cycle.\n\nIn late October, The Daily Signal emailed both Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo and Janssen to confirm these numbers, but neither has responded.\n\nThayer then said Planned Parenthood of the Heartland would bill Medicaid $35 for each birth control package and be reimbursed about $26 by Iowa Medicaid authorities.\n\nMedicaid, a government-run health care program, provides free services to low-income families and individuals. When a patient on Medicaid seeks treatment at one of Planned Parenthood\u2019s more than 600 locations, the organization bills Medicaid on that patient\u2019s behalf.\n\nMedicaid programs use what are called \u201copen fee schedules\u201d to set compensation levels for prescriptions such as birth control.\n\nAccording to Iowa Medicaid\u2019s current open fee schedule, providers such as Planned Parenthood are allowed to be compensated $25.36 for each package of contraceptives (or 92 cents a pill).\n\nRead the tested and proven strategies to defeat the abortion cartel, in \u201cAbortion Free: Your Manual for Building a Pro-Life America One Community at a Time.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal called and emailed Iowa Medicaid multiple times to ask what it considers \u201cexcessive\u201d charging by providers for prescriptions, and what safeguards are in place to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. A spokeswoman for Iowa Medicaid said cost for prescriptions such as birth control pills \u201cis based on established national pricing\u201d and that a number of safeguards are in place to protect against fraud. She said:\n\nThe Iowa Medicaid Enterprise Program Integrity Unit regularly reviews payments to all providers to assure that providers are not fraudulently billing for services. If any billing and/or payment irregularities are discovered, resolution includes recoupment of any overpayments, all the way up to referral to the state\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and, where warranted, to the U.S. attorney.\n\n\u2018Unusual\u2019 Arrangement\n\nCasey Mattox, a senior attorney at Alliance Defending Freedom who represents Thayer, called the alleged profits Planned Parenthood of the Heartland made from birth control subscriptions \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedicaid providers, particularly nonprofits, usually don\u2019t make money off their Medicaid patients,\u201d Mattox said in an email to The Daily Signal. \u201cBut Planned Parenthood is unlike most nonprofit Medicaid providers in that its own annual reports show $127 million in profit last year and $765 million profit over the last decade.\u201d\n\nMattox calls this profit margin an example of \u201cwaste and abuse\u201d but says it\u2019s not necessarily proof of fraud:\n\nWhile Planned Parenthood makes a lot of money from abortions, in some states birth control pills are also its cash cow. A federal government program makes contraceptives available cheap to Planned Parenthood but allows states to set the reimbursement rates, even though [the government] pays 90 percent of the cost for contraceptives for Medicaid-eligible women. Iowa has allowed Planned Parenthood to make a major profit on every cycle of contraceptives.\n\nUnlike most health care providers, which prescribe only drugs, Planned Parenthood clinics both prescribe and dispense prescriptions, allowing its clinics to control the price and volume of prescriptions.\n\nEd Haislmaier, an expert in health care policy and markets at The Heritage Foundation, said Planned Parenthood\u2019s unique structure increases the opportunity for fraud.\n\n\u201cCost equals volume times price,\u201d Haislmaier said, adding:\n\nThe prescribers [physicians] determine volume, while the dispensers [pharmacists] can mark up prices. Typically, the two are separate and uncoordinated. However, in those cases [such as with Planned Parenthood] where the same entity controls both prescribing and dispensing, it increases both motive and opportunity to engage in fraudulent or abusive billing practices. This has been an issue at times in other areas, such as with oncology centers both prescribing and dispensing cancer drugs, or with in-house pharmacies at hospitals and nursing homes filing prescriptions written by staff physicians.\n\nThe more birth control Planned Parenthood of the Heartland prescribes to clients, the greater profit the clinic may make. Thayer says her employer took full advantage of this opportunity by using a program called \u201cC-Mail.\u201d\n\n\u2018C-Mail\u2019\n\nIn an effort to increase the bottom line, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland used \u201cC-Mail\u201d (short for contraceptive mail) to prescribe birth control to women and ship it by mail, Thayer told The Daily Signal.\n\nC-Mail began as a voluntary program where women could opt in, but Thayer said in court documents: \u201cPlanned Parenthood of the Heartland management concluded it could dramatically increase its revenues by converting the [previously] voluntary or \u2018opt-in\u2019 C-Mail program to a mandatory program.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa clinics where she worked did so by eliminating follow-up examinations and mailing each client at least a 12-menstrual-cycle supply of contraceptives in three-month increments.\n\nTypically, 28 pills come in a single birth control package, which equals 84 pills over three months. To increase profits, Thayer alleges, Planned Parenthood began sending three prescriptions to clients every 63 days, \u201cso there\u2019s a 21-day overage.\u201d\n\nBy the end of 2008, Thayer said in the lawsuit, at least 7,000 Medicaid-eligible women were enrolled in the C-Mail program. If any of those women moved or refused the pills, she said, the pills would come back in a \u201cbrown mailer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d open them up, return them to inventory, put a new sticker on them and sell them to the next patient that came in without ever crediting the first woman\u2019s account,\u201d Thayer said.\n\nIn doing so, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland \u201ceffectively [was] billing Iowa Medicaid and/or Iowa Family Planning Network at least twice for the same [birth control pills],\u201d Thayer claimed in the lawsuit.\n\nSoliciting Donations\n\nIn addition to overbilling Medicaid for birth control subscriptions, Thayer said Planned Parenthood of the Heartland would ask patients\u2014including Medicaid clients\u2014to contribute at least $10 as a \u201cdonation\u201d for each package of birth control pills, despite knowing that Medicaid fully covered the prescription for low-income patients.\n\nFor other services the Heartland clinic provided, Thayer said in the suit, employees \u201cstrongly suggested\u201d that Medicaid clients pay \u201c50 percent of the bill,\u201d never telling them \u201cthe entire amount of the bill for family planning services rendered would be fully reimbursed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a foster parent,\u201d Thayer told The Daily Signal:\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of kids and I\u2019ve taken them to different appointments and never once have I been asked to give a donation towards their dentist\u2019s appointment\u2014Medicaid has always covered it. And I remember saying to my boss numerous times, \u2018Is this right that we\u2019re soliciting donations from Medicaid-eligible women?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s fine\u2026it\u2019s all legal and we should\u2019ve been doing it years ago.\u2019\n\nThe former Planned Parenthood director also said these donations never were reported to Iowa Medicaid while her Iowa clinics were being reimbursed for birth control and other services.\n\nA spokeswoman for Iowa Medicaid told The Daily Signal that no specific policy covers \u201cdonations\u201d from Medicaid clients as a form of payment. However, she said one rule states:\n\nAll Medicaid providers [such as Planned Parenthood] must note on their submitted claims any payments received from other sources, which would include any payments received from a Medicaid member (or the member\u2019s family). Any such amounts are then deducted from the final Medicaid payment to the provider.\n\nNo Pressure Allowed\n\nIt\u2019s a gray area whether Thayer\u2019s description of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland\u2019s donation process constitutes a violation of the law, some health care experts say. Ultimately, the courts will decide.\n\nHowever, in August 2013, shortly after Thayer filed her lawsuit, court documents noted that the Iowa Family Planning Council, a network of providers of federal Title X funds, updated its \u201cdonation policy.\u201d\n\nThe amended policy reads:\n\nTitle X guidelines state \u2018voluntary\u2019 donations from clients are permissible. However, clients must not be pressured to make donations, and donations must not be a prerequisite to the provision of services or supplies. If a patient asks for a recommendation about what they should donate, staff should not provide a figure but tell the client to give what they feel comfortable with giving.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Thayer\u2019s attorneys cited this change, stating; \u201cThe conduct Thayer alleges [Planned Parenthood of the Heartland] engaged in did not comply with this policy.\u201d\n\nThe Lawsuit\n\nIn an email statement to The Daily Signal, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland acknowledged the lawsuit by its former clinic director but denied all allegations. A spokeswoman said:\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Heartland is involved in an ongoing lawsuit with a disgruntled former employee who alleges that we committed Medicaid fraud during her tenure with the organization. We deny those allegations and have no other statement to make on that case, which is still being litigated.\n\nIn court, Tiffany Amlot, a lawyer representing Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, argued that Thayer offered \u201cno proof\u201d to back up her arguments.\n\n\u201cHer function was in the billing department, but not in submitting the reimbursement claims to the government,\u201d Amlot said Nov. 20, 2013, during oral arguments in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t identify a single actual claim that was allegedly submitted to the government that was false.\u201d\n\nChief U.S. District Judge John A. Garvey agreed with Planned Parenthood and, in December 2012, dismissed the case. But in August 2014, the appeals court reversed that decision, and ruled that Thayer\u2019s former position at Planned Parenthood uniquely allowed her \u201cto plead personal, first-hand knowledge of Planned Parenthood\u2019s submission of false claims.\u201d\n\nIn the appeals court\u2019s decision reinstating the case, three judges wrote:\n\n[W]e conclude that Thayer has pled sufficiently particularized facts to support her allegations that Planned Parenthood violated the False Claims Act by filing claims for (1) unnecessary quantities of birth control pills, (2) birth control pills dispensed without examinations or without or prior to a physician\u2019s order, (3) abortion-related services, and (4) the full amount of services that had already been paid, in whole or in part, by \u2018donations\u2019 Planned Parenthood coerced from patients.\n\nThe appeals court, however, dismissed two claims in Thayer\u2019s lawsuit for technical reasons. Those claims alleged that Planned Parenthood of the Heartland prompted local hospitals to violate the federal Hyde Amendment\u2014first, by unknowingly submitting false claims to Medicaid for follow-up care for chemical abortions, and second, by billing Medicaid for more expensive procedures than were actually used or medically necessary.\n\nThe Fallout\n\nIf the courts eventually rule against Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, the group could be liable for a penalty of up to $11,000 for each false claim submitted, plus three times the amount of actual damages as well as Thayer\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nIn addition, the False Claims Act provides that a successful whistleblower is entitled to a share of the amount recovered\u2014with the balance being returned to taxpayers.\n\nIn 2013, Houston-based Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast settled with the Justice Department over similar allegations brought by a whistleblower.\n\nIn the settlement, Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast paid $4.3 million to resolve civil allegations under the False Claims Act, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. In a statement, the Justice Department said:\n\nThe government alleges that between 2003 and 2009, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast billed and was paid by government programs, Texas Medicaid, Title XX, and the Women\u2019s Health Program, for certain items and services related to birth control counseling, STD testing and contraceptives when such items and services were either not medically necessary, not medically indicated or not actually provided.\n\nThat settlement resolved a lawsuit filed by Karen Reynolds, a former medical assistant for a Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast clinic in Lufkin, Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Planned Parenthood Paid $3 for Birth Control but Billed Medicaid $35, Former Manager Says By Kelsey Harkness Reprinted with permission of the Daily Signal A little-known whistleblower lawsuit accuses Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa of wrongly siphoning millions of American taxpayer dollars with a series of complicated billing schemes aimed at increasing profits.
