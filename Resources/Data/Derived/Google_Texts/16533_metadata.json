(Getty Images)\n\nAmerica\u2019s Doctor wants Americans to walk more. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, released his \u201cStep It Up\u201d call to action Wednesday at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Center for Total Health in Washington, District of Columbia, saying Americans need to walk regularly to combat heart disease and diabetes, while at the same time recognizing that the way neighborhoods are designed often are unsafe or aren\u2019t conducive to walking.\n\n\n\nIn communities without parks, sidewalks or streetlights, recreational walking is difficult -- and, for the elderly and people with disabilities, sometimes impossible due to missing curb cuts for wheelchairs, walkers and strollers and a lack of safety signals for the visually impaired.\n\n\u201cFor too many seniors and people living with disabilities, and those who are economically disadvantaged, having the ability to be physically active is an economic issue,\u201d Murthy said at the event.\n\nHe evoked America\u2019s history with walking as a way to bring about attention to social issues: Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s March on Washington for civil rights, the parade for women\u2019s suffrage and the Capital Crawl for inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\n\n\n[READ: The Rise of Gun Violence as a Public Health Issue]\n\nToday, though it\u2019s not obvious to many, whether a community is walkable and accessible often is a sign of disparity and inequality. While poverty in other countries is often characterized by inadequate calorie intake, in the U.S. it tends to be marked by improper nutrition coupled with a sedentary lifestyle. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 30 percent of Americans don\u2019t live in communities with sidewalks.\n\nAn average of 22 minutes a day of physical activity \u2013 such as brisk walking \u2013 can dramatically reduce the risk for chronic ailments including cancer and lung disease, and is key to relieving stress.\n\n\n\nBut Americans of all ages aren\u2019t walking as much as they are supposed to. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, fewer than half adults in the U.S. get enough physical activity to reduce their chronic disease risk. Among high school students, only a quarter get the recommended amount.\n\nThe U.S. News Health Care Index shows the government now takes a greater role in health care coverage through President Obama\u2019s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, and as such is taking a greater role in making Americans healthier to prevent the crippling cost of chronic illness, which accounts for 86 percent of the country\u2019s health care costs.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a fancy gym membership or a special set of skills to walk,\u201d Murthy said. He called on city planners and local officials to design communities so that they are safe for walking.\n\nThe Kaiser Permanente event included a prominent commitment to inclusion of people with disabilities in its Call to Action.\n\n\u201cYou walk, I roll,\u201d Juliette Rizzo, Ms. Wheelchair America 2005, said at the event. \u201cAnd I hope you find the courage to join us all.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "public health", "title": "Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action: Walk More", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy promotes walkable communities to combat heart disease and diabetes, as well as inequality.", "title": "Surgeon General Calls Americans to Step It Up", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/09/09/surgeon-generals-call-to-action-walk-more", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/b2/6f/db3d68b74d209913ab7571528827/150909-walking-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy promotes walkable communities to combat heart disease and diabetes, as well as inequality.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action: Walk More"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 9, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,Pulse,healthandwellness [Consumer Advice],Surgeon General,exercise and fitness,diabetes,doctors,patient advice,heart disease,heart health,public health", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy promotes walkable communities to combat heart disease and diabetes, as well as inequality."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca386\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t need a fancy gym membership or a special set of skills to walk,\u201d Murthy said.\nDr. Vivek Murthy, surgeon general, stressed the importance of walking regularly to fight health issues, like heart disease and diabetes, on Wednesday.\nThe Kaiser Permanente event included a prominent commitment to inclusion of people with disabilities in its Call to Action.\n(Getty Images)America\u2019s Doctor wants Americans to walk more.\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, fewer than half adults in the U.S. get enough physical activity to reduce their chronic disease risk."}
