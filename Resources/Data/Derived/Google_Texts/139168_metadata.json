The team has cap\u00adtured 27 state cham\u00adpion\u00adships and 14 na\u00adtion\u00adal ti\u00adtles, and it's reg\u00adu\u00adlar\u00adly ranked in the top five na\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adly.\n\nRe\u00adcent\u00adly, the team took first place at the Minnesota State Chess Association Scholastic Chess Championships, and it will com\u00adpete at the National Junior High Championships in At\u00adlan\u00adta April 25-27.\n\nOne of the program's se\u00adcrets to suc\u00adcess, Ribnick said, was aim\u00ading high from the get-go. Like many of the things he teach\u00ades stu\u00addents in chess club, which meets twice a week af\u00adter school, the les\u00adson ap\u00adplies to both chess and life.\n\nSeventh-grader Zander Burton practiced with the Metcalf chess team, which recently won another state championship and will play in the national championship tournament in Atlanta this month.\n\n\"I like to say, 'It's bet\u00adter to aim for the stars and miss than aim for a pile of ma\u00adnure and hit,' \" he said.\n\nAn\u00adoth\u00ader key com\u00adpo\u00adnent of the program is re\u00adcruit\u00adment. Ribnick isn't above en\u00adtic\u00ading Metcalf stu\u00addents to join by hold\u00ading gi\u00adant month\u00adly par\u00adties, held at a water park or fea\u00adtur\u00ading paint\u00adball and piz\u00adza.\n\n\"I had to think out\u00adside the box for re\u00adcruit\u00ading,\" he said. \"You can have the best program ever, but if you have three kids in the room, it doesn't mat\u00adter.\"\n\nOnce Ribnick, who also teach\u00ades math, gets stu\u00addents in\u00adter\u00adest\u00aded, a love of the game takes over, he said. \"What hap\u00adpens is, chess is ad\u00addict\u00ading, but they don't know it yet,\" he said.\n\n\"I tell them, 'I prom\u00adise to make you a good play\u00ader. I'm going to teach you to be good at some\u00adthing, re\u00adal\u00adly good at some\u00adthing,' \" he said.\n\nSince 1984, un\u00adder Ribnick's guid\u00adance, the whole dis\u00adtrict has em\u00adpha\u00adsized the game, be\u00adgin\u00adning in kin\u00adder\u00adgar\u00adten. Every el\u00ademen\u00adta\u00adry school has an after-school club with a coach.\n\nThe clubs act as a feed\u00ader program for the juni\u00ador high and high school teams, and stu\u00addents' in\u00adter\u00adests are fur\u00adther piqued in fourth grade, when Ed Zelkind, a chess mas\u00adter, vis\u00adits class\u00ades dur\u00ading a \"chess res\u00adi\u00adden\u00adcy\" to teach the game.\n\nA pas\u00adsion for the game\n\nOn a Tues\u00adday night during chess club, the stu\u00addents going to na\u00adtion\u00adals lis\u00adtened to John Bar\u00adthol\u00ado\u00admew speak about strat\u00adegies for open\u00ading a game. Bar\u00adthol\u00ado\u00admew, whom Ribnick called the team's \"secret weapon,\" is the only Minnesota-born international mas\u00adter, an honor earned be\u00adcause of his high rat\u00ading.\n\nDown\u00adstairs, oth\u00ader stu\u00addents prac\u00adticed their end\u00adgame, work\u00ading through scen\u00adarios en\u00adcount\u00adered as they and their op\u00adpo\u00adnents make the last few moves in a game. \"Ribster, we think we got it!\" a stu\u00addent shout\u00aded across the room.\n\nHe didn't get it. But that was fine by Ribnick, who ex\u00adplained that in ord\u00ader to get good at chess, you have to lose thou\u00adsands of games.\n\nEighth-grader Evan Rabe, who has played since fourth grade, de\u00adter\u00admined the right moves sev\u00ader\u00adal times. Chess is \"re\u00adal\u00adly all about strat\u00adegy and the mind think\u00ading, and so it's re\u00adal\u00adly satis\u00adfy\u00ading when you win,\" he said.\n\nFor Ribnick, a pas\u00adsion for chess be\u00adgan when he was 11 years old and his dad taught him to play. He later took a chess class and was \"in\u00adject\u00aded with the chess drug,\" he said.\n\nFor him, the hours spent in juni\u00ador high chess club were a\u00admong the most mean\u00ading\u00adful in his life, and they al\u00adlowed him to build strong friend\u00adships. Now, he hopes his stu\u00addents have the same ex\u00adperi\u00adence.\n\nThe bene\u00adfits of chess\n\nIn ad\u00addi\u00adtion to be\u00ading a coach, Ribnick is also an ad\u00advo\u00adcate for all of the pos\u00adi\u00adtive things chess can bring to kids' lives. \"I'm 100 percent con\u00advinced that every stu\u00addent that's in it has benefited,\" he said.\n\nSeventh-grader Pratik Nehete practiced last week. The district begins its focus on chess in the elementary schools, every one of which has an after-school chess club.\n\nThe game teach\u00ades kids prob\u00adlem-solvi\u00adng skills of all kinds, im\u00adproves grades in school and builds con\u00adcen\u00adtra\u00adtion, he said. Ribnick said he's seen stu\u00addents with at\u00adten\u00adtion is\u00adsues \"sit there for hours, es\u00adpe\u00adcial\u00adly if they want to win, play\u00ading chess.\"\n\nPer\u00adhaps most im\u00adpor\u00adtant\u00adly, they be\u00adcome \"com\u00adplete\u00adly com\u00admit\u00adted to what their brain can do, and it's amaz\u00ading,\" he said.\n\nEighth-grader Victor Sanchez, a play\u00ader for two years, said that play\u00ading chess has helped his con\u00adcen\u00adtra\u00adtion. \"Now, I can ac\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly sit down and study for a test,\" he said.\n\nSeventh-grader Pratik Nehete said he plays for fun. Nehete was paired up against a mas\u00adter chess play\u00ader at the state tour\u00adna\u00adment and tied. \"To draw some\u00adbod\u00ady with that much more skill than me was kind of amaz\u00ading,\" he said.\n\nJen\u00adna Lichty, an eighth-grader who has played since kin\u00adder\u00adgar\u00adten, said she plays for \"the men\u00adtal brain en\u00ader\u00adgy\" the game re\u00adquires. She's one of a hand\u00adful of girls on the team, a trend that holds true at high\u00ader lev\u00adels of chess across the coun\u00adtry and in\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal\u00adly, Ribnick said.\n\nA long-term goal is to be rat\u00aded high\u00ader than her broth\u00ader, but that's not the rea\u00adson she plays. \"Any\u00adone can join,\" she said. \"It doesn't have to be for the smart peo\u00adple. It's for all ages, and it's a nev\u00ader-end\u00ading sport.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 1983, Brian Ribnick be\u00adgan coach\u00ading the chess team at Burnsville's Met\u00adcalf Junior High with a lofty goal: to be the top juni\u00ador high chess program in the country.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "In 1983, Brian Ribnick be\u00adgan coach\u00ading the chess team at Burnsville's Met\u00adcalf Junior High with a lofty goal: to be the top juni\u00ador high chess program in the country.", "title": "Burnsville chess program has all the right moves", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/burnsville-chess-program-has-all-the-right-moves/255034461/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139733554094144.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139733554094144.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 1983, Brian Ribnick be\u00adgan coach\u00ading the chess team at Burnsville's Met\u00adcalf Junior High with a lofty goal: to be the top juni\u00ador high chess program in the country.", "title": "Burnsville chess program has all the right moves", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/burnsville-chess-program-has-all-the-right-moves/255034461/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139733554094144.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139733554094144.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Burnsville-Eagan-Savage school district"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "chess,Burnsville-Eagan-Savage school district"}, "article_summary": "In 1983, Brian Ribnick be\u00adgan coach\u00ading the chess team at Burnsville's Met\u00adcalf Junior High with a lofty goal: to be the top juni\u00ador high chess program in the country.\nIn ad\u00addi\u00adtion to build\u00ading the state's most suc\u00adcess\u00adful juni\u00ador high program, Ribnick has helped foster a fo\u00adcus on chess across the en\u00adtire Burnsville-Eagan-Savage school dis\u00adtrict.\nFor him, the hours spent in juni\u00ador high chess club were a\u00admong the most mean\u00ading\u00adful in his life, and they al\u00adlowed him to build strong friend\u00adships.\nRe\u00adcent\u00adly, the team took first place at the Minnesota State Chess Association Scholastic Chess Championships, and it will com\u00adpete at the National Junior High Championships in At\u00adlan\u00adta April 25-27.\nWith 81 mem\u00adbers, Met\u00adcalf ranks as Minnesota's larg\u00adest juni\u00ador high team."}
