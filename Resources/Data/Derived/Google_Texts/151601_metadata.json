But whereas Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers detailing one specific military conflict in Southeast Asia, Snowden released details of the U.S. government\u2019s sprawling surveillance machine that operates around the globe.\n\nOn the second anniversary of Snowden\u2019s historic act of civil disobedience, it is worth reviewing what has changed \u2014 and what has not.\n\nOn the change side of the ledger, there is the politics of surveillance. For much of the early 2000s, politicians of both parties competed with one another to show who would be a bigger booster of the NSA\u2019s operations, fearing that any focus on civil liberties risked their being branded soft on terrorism. Since Snowden, though, the political paradigm has dramatically shifted.\n\nThe most illustrative proof that came last month, when the U.S. Senate failed to muster enough votes to reauthorize the law that aims to allow the NSA to engage in mass surveillance. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s prominent role in that episode underscored the political shift \u2014 a decade after the GOP mastered the art of citing 9/11-themed arguments about terrorism to win elections, one of the party\u2019s top presidential candidates proudly led the fight against one of the key legislative initiatives of the so-called war on terror.\n\nThere has also been a shift in public opinion, as evidenced by a new ACLU-sponsored poll showing that almost two thirds of American voters want Congress to curtail the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance powers. The survey showed that majorities in both parties oppose renewing the old Patriot Act.\n\nMonumental as those congressional and public opinion shifts are, though, far fewer changes are evident in the government\u2019s executive branch.\n\nFor example, the Obama administration is celebrating the two-year anniversary of Snowden\u2019s disclosures by intensifying its crackdown on government whistleblowers. After prosecuting more such whistleblowers than any previous administration, Obama\u2019s appointees are specifically moving forward a rule that the nonpartisan Project On Government Oversight says would deny \u201cfederal employees in \u2018sensitive\u2019 positions the right to appeal a termination or demotion\u201d when they expose wrongdoing. In practice, writes POGO\u2019s Elizabeth Hempowicz, the rule would make \u201cwhistleblowers who hold these positions particularly vulnerable to retaliation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the second anniversary of his historic act of civil disobedience, we review what has changed (and what has not)", "title": "America hates its whistle-blowers: The tortured legacy of Edward Snowden", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "On the second anniversary of his historic act of civil disobedience, we review what has changed (and what has not)", "title": "America hates its whistle-blowers: The tortured legacy of Edward Snowden", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/america_hates_its_whistleblowers_the_tortured_legacy_of_edward_snowden_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/edward_snowden2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the second anniversary of his historic act of civil disobedience, we review what has changed (and what has not)", "title": "America hates its whistle-blowers: The tortured legacy of Edward Snowden", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/edward_snowden2.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, civil disobedience, Daniel Ellsberg, Edward Snowden, patriot act, Rand Paul", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7b4\"", "article_summary": "In practice, writes POGO\u2019s Elizabeth Hempowicz, the rule would make \u201cwhistleblowers who hold these positions particularly vulnerable to retaliation.\u201d\nFor example, the Obama administration is celebrating the two-year anniversary of Snowden\u2019s disclosures by intensifying its crackdown on government whistleblowers.\nOn the second anniversary of Snowden\u2019s historic act of civil disobedience, it is worth reviewing what has changed \u2014 and what has not.\nBut whereas Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers detailing one specific military conflict in Southeast Asia, Snowden released details of the U.S. government\u2019s sprawling surveillance machine that operates around the globe.\nMonumental as those congressional and public opinion shifts are, though, far fewer changes are evident in the government\u2019s executive branch."}
