(AP file photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nBOSTON \u2013 Hundreds of Bernie Sanders supporters plan to descend on Boston Common Saturday at noon to spend three hours marching and canvassing for the Democratic presidential hopeful, snowy weather notwithstanding.\n\nReferred to as \u201c#MarchforBernie,\u201d the nationwide event is being organized locally by Boston for Bernie, a grassroots group. Local marches and canvassing drives are being organized across the country for the same day. The aim is to register voters, spread awareness of Sanders and help people \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d a week before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, in what organizers call the largest event for the Senator from Vermont so far.\n\nVoters in New Hampshire go to the polls Feb. 9, in the nation\u2019s first primary election, while the Massachusetts vote is set for March 1.\n\nWeather forecasts for Saturday remain somewhat loose, but the outlook as of Thursday afternoon is for minimal snow from a storm system expected to belt Washington with a foot or more. Should the storm change track and move closer to Boston, it could bring a significant snowfall to the city. But organizers said Thursday that the event is still on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be out there in ski goggles if we have to be,\u201d said Hilary Robinson, 34, a Bernie for Boston team member from Washington. \u201cThe grassroots movement is a lot deeper than who\u2019s going to be able to get out in a snowstorm,\u201d she said. \u201cWe march in solidarity with people who are older, younger, who can\u2019t be out in the snow.\u201d\n\nWithout predicting how many people may participate, even 200 would be deemed a success, she said. About 1,000 have indicated they plan to attend, according to the group\u2019s Facebook page, while another 4,000 have said they are interested in showing up.\n\nMarchers plan to start the walk at the Parkman bandstand on the common. It will and circle around to the State House and pass along Washington and Park Streets, keeping the route short due to weather, organizers said.\n\nBoston for Bernie formed last summer, gaining support from local groups working for prison and policing reforms, and to reduce racial and income disparities \u2013 similar to the way other groups have grown around the nation that back Sanders, whose rise has taken some in the media by surprise.\n\nOther Northeast marches are planned in Providence, Rhode Island, Manchester, New Hampshire, New York and Philadelphia. The 74-year-old Sanders will give a speech at 6 p.m. Saturday in an online presentation that will be shown in homes, offices and colleges around the Boston metro area.\n\n\u201cWe are gathering on this day, people of all races and creeds, to show the billionaires that We The People are ready to take them on,\u201d the event\u2019s website states. \u201cWe have the numbers, we have the passion, we have the determination, and we have the stamina.\u201d\n\nSanders is destroying rival Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire polls, a CNN/WMUR-TV survey showed this week, and appears to be attracting many younger voters away from the former Secretary of State. Polling shows Sanders and Clinton are locked in a much closer race in Iowa.\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/21/spreading-the-bern-in-boston-is-aim-of-planned-march/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DEM-2016-Sanders-Heal_Bunk-e1453911476141.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "2016 presidential election, Bernie Sanders, boston, canvassing, Democratic primary, iowa, marches, Massachusetts, new hampshire, politics, supporters"}, "description": "Hundreds of Bernie Sanders supporters plan to descend on Boston Common Saturday at noon to spend three hours marching and canvassing for the Democratic", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DEM-2016-Sanders-Heal_Bunk-e1453911476141.jpg"}, "keywords": "bernie sanders,supporters,boston,marching,2016 presidential election,canvassing,democratic primary,iowa,marches,massachusetts,new hampshire,politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Spreading \u2018the Bern\u2019 in Boston is aim of planned marchPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/21/spreading-the-bern-in-boston-is-aim-of-planned-march/Health care has long been a favorite subject of Vermont Sen.
