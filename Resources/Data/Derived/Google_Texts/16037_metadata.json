LifePoint launched its Patient and Family Advisory Board to include patient perspectives in the planning process of its hospitals located in communities across the country.\n\nThe initiative is part of a quality program established in partnership with Duke University Health System to improve patient care, experience and safety. LifePoint hospitals can include a patient or family member on their individual boards and create their own local advisory councils.\n\nDawn Rudolph, chief experience officer at Saint Thomas' Health in Nashville, which recently started a patient advisory committee, told the newspaper that feedback from patients provides opportunities for improvement and frequently centers on communication.\n\nHospitals also want patient feedback on design, Fierce Healthcare previously reported.
