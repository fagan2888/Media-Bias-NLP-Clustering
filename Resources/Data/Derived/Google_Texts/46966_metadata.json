However, the law is not so clear about messages containing general comments.\n\nGaining access to those text messages may be a matter of filing an open records request. However, whether that law applies may depend upon if the cellphone is government-issued or when and where a private cellphone was used.\n\nMaury County commissioners broached the topic in March during an Administration Committee meeting in which chairwoman June Beckum asked commissioners to stop texting members of the committee.\n\nIn a telephone interview later, Beckum said she finds texting during a meeting to be distracting and that is also appears to distract others commissioners.\n\n\u201cTo me, I just need to try to give my full attention,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when a question has been asked and answered and then a commissioner asked the same question again, you know they haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d\n\nBeckum said texting during a public meetings is becoming an issue that needs to be addressed, especially since conversations during public meetings are supposed to be public. Although she said she understands sending or receiving text or email messages in case of an emergency, the commission needs to regulate unnecessary distractions, she said.\n\n\u201cI definitely think, as much as it can be stopped, we should do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we should go back and cover this in our rules.\u201d\n\nDistrict 11 Commissioner Scott Cepicky, who was one of the commissioners texting during that March 6 meeting, said he must be available at all times for business and to respond to constituents.\n\n\u201cSome people from the audience and my work and stuff text me all the time,\u201d he explained. \u201cI can\u2019t sit there and not text business.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cmost\u201d of the texting with people in the audience involves questions about something they don\u2019t understand and for which they need clarification. Although Cepicky said he supports open government, he said he does not believe the public has a right to know \u201cwhen it comes to an individual conversation with a citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen Meetings law pertains to the commission and that\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t pertain to the commission and the public,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem is, however, members of the public have no way of knowing whether the text messages concern private communications or information that should be public, Fisher said.\n\n\u201cMeetings are supposed to be accessible to the public and they\u2019re suppose to be open to the public for them to come so they can hear the county commissioners deliberate on issues,\u201d she said. \u201cI think what needs to happen in public meetings is that all communications need to be done in the public. If commissioners are having side conversations via text messages, that goes against the spirit of the law and may even violate it.\u201d\n\nCepicky said he recognizes that texting during a meeting has the potential for abuse of the open meeting law, but he contends communications violations could still happen in other ways.\n\n\u201cThe public just has to trust that (commissioner) is not trying to coerce or influence or contrive a vote or an outcome (via text messaging),\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drivers caught texting in Tennessee face fines up to $50, while those who use cellphones in classrooms or courtrooms may be forced to hand them over.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "VANESSA CURRY vcurry@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "Drivers caught texting in Tennessee face fines up to $50, while those who use cellphones in classrooms or courtrooms may be forced to hand them over.", "title": "TEXTING DURING PUBLIC MEETINGS RAISES QUESTIONS", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/texting-during-public-meetings-raises-questions", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Public-Meeting-Texting_6079_swt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/texting-during-public-meetings-raises-questions", "title": "TEXTING DURING PUBLIC MEETINGS RAISES QUESTIONS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=827686", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=827686", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-12T20:55:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd11a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think what needs to happen in public meetings is that all communications need to be done in the public.\n\u201cAnd when a question has been asked and answered and then a commissioner asked the same question again, you know they haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201dBeckum said texting during a public meetings is becoming an issue that needs to be addressed, especially since conversations during public meetings are supposed to be public.\nSo, is it proper for lawmakers to converse with one another, their family or constituents via text during a public meeting?\nThe problem is, however, members of the public have no way of knowing whether the text messages concern private communications or information that should be public, Fisher said.\nGaining access to those text messages may be a matter of filing an open records request."}
