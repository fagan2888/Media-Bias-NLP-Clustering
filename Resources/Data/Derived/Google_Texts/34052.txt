On the eve of the third round of enrollment for health insurance through the federal exchange, premiums are rising an average of 7.5 percent, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Monday.

In New Jersey, prices on healthcare.gov, the federal website handling subsidized insurance for residents, are going up an average of 5 percent. Rates are going up a bit more - 5.1 percent - in northern New Jersey.

Premiums in other states showed even bigger swings.

Changes ranged from a 12.6 percent drop in Indiana to hikes of more than 20 percent in Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and South Carolina. The highest jump - 35.7 percent - is in Oklahoma.

In New Jersey, more than a quarter-million residents, or 254,000 people, buy policies through the online marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act. Roughly four out of five of them receive a subsidy to help them pay for the insurance they buy from private carriers.

The "Affordability Snapshot" released by the federal government in advance of open enrollment, which begins Nov. 1, does not break down premium increases by individual carriers.

In New Jersey, the largest player in the field, Horizon, has announced its plan to include a lower-priced policy among its offerings. The OMNIA plan would slash premium costs in exchange for the customer agreeing to use one of 34 hospitals statewide.

The figures announced Monday were for the 37 states - including New Jersey - that chose to use the federal exchange as their marketplace.

The price comparisons released Monday were for the second-lowest Silver plan, dubbed the "benchmark" plan because it is used by the IRS to calculate tax credits.
