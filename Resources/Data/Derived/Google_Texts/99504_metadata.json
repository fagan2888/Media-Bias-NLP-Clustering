Dank Depot, CC BY 2.0\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. polling group Gallup found that for the first time ever, the majority of Americans approved the full legalization of marijuana. Today, that rate of 58 percent has fallen to a slimmer majority of 51 percent, but the legalization boom has picked up even more steam.\n\nNew Year\u2019s Day marked the first day marijuana was legal in Colorado. From there, the plant only continued to make headway in both political and scientific circles. Here\u2019s a look at some ways marijuana was the defining drug of 2014.\n\n1. All The Stops In Colorado\n\nColorado\u2019s full recreational legalization didn\u2019t just give stoners an excuse to indulge in their habit (which it probably did in spades). It also marked the first concrete sign of political change. For years, the public had been pushing, as it still currently does, for looser regulations on marijuana \u2014 whether it\u2019s for recreational use or as medicine. But limited access to a potential upside, mixed with residual stigma and fear, made the move difficult.\n\nAfter decades of being caught in the loop of morality fueling legislation, science has managed to sway public opinion with facts. With Colorado\u2019s financial boost and decreased crime, both economists and politicians are finally breathing a sigh of relief.\n\n2. 4 More Onboard\n\nThe dominos have already started to fall in the wake of Colorado\u2019s legalization. Since Jan. 1, three more states, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, and Washington, D.C. have jumped onboard \u2014 a surefire sign that medical legalization isn\u2019t the ceiling in the U.S. Some have even begun forecasting the next round of legalization in 2015, with fence-sitting states like Massachusetts, California, Missouri, Hawaii, and Maine poised to fall where the grass is green. With each state that shifts its position, the drug moves from outlawed substance (marijuana is still considered the most dangerous type of drug by the U.S. government) to potential therapeutic.\n\n3. The War Is Over\n\nTwenty-three states currently have laws on the books legalizing medical marijuana, but that number may skyrocket after Congress quietly broke ground with its Dec. 16 passage of a bill that prevents the Department of Justice from blocking new state laws.\n\n\u201cThe war on medical marijuana is over,\u201d Bill Piper, a lobbyist with the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cNow the fight moves on to legalization of all marijuana. This is the strongest signal we have received from Congress [that] the politics have really shifted. \u2026 Congress has been slow to catch up with the states and American people, but it is catching up.\u201d\n\n4. Not An IQ Killer\n\nContrary to the deleterious effects of high school pot use, cannabis researchers have found in one October study no relationship between moderate use during mid-teenage years and decreased exam scores or IQ levels. Looking at the long-term marijuana use of over 2,000 kids as they aged from 8 to 15 years old, researchers from the University College London found casual marijuana use predicted equal scores on IQ tests and other intelligence exams. Heavy use \u2014 meaning it was consumed at least 50 times by the time kids reached age 15 \u2014 led to a three percent drop in test scores. In both cases, however, alcohol use predicted lower scores.\n\n5. Slowing Alzheimer's Roll\n\nPolitics wasn\u2019t the only new frontier for marijuana. In August, researchers from the University of South Florida discovered that low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis \u2014 helped slow the harmful effects of brain aging that are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brain, which get turned into neuron-blocking tangles, were found to subside when THC was more present in subjects\u2019 brains. THC also enhanced mitochondrial function, increasing energy production levels.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marijuana, legalization, delayed, forgetfulness, 5, cannabis, victories, 2014", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This was a big year for marijuana and its advocates, and the gaining momentum suggests 2015 will be even bigger.", "title": "5 Ways Marijuana Won In 2014", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marijuana-legalization-delayed-forgetfulness-5-cannabis-victories-2014-314992", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/19/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This was a big year for marijuana and its advocates, and the gaining momentum suggests 2015 will be even bigger.", "title": "5 Ways Marijuana Won In 2014", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marijuana-legalization-delayed-forgetfulness-5-cannabis-victories-2014-314992", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/19/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/19/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": 2014, "published_time": "2014-12-19T13:18:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T14:32:41-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This was a big year for marijuana and its advocates, and the gaining momentum suggests 2015 will be even bigger."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe39fb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe war on medical marijuana is over,\u201d Bill Piper, a lobbyist with the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Los Angeles Times.\nDank Depot, CC BY 2.0In 2013, the U.S. polling group Gallup found that for the first time ever, the majority of Americans approved the full legalization of marijuana.\nSince Jan. 1, three more states, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, and Washington, D.C. have jumped onboard \u2014 a surefire sign that medical legalization isn\u2019t the ceiling in the U.S.\nThis was a big year for marijuana and its advocates, and the gaining momentum suggests 2015 will be even bigger.\n\u201cNow the fight moves on to legalization of all marijuana."}
