Health Care: The White House sees this year’s ObamaCare enrollment as another big win. But even the law’s most ardent supporters — or, perhaps, especially those people — should be worried about the numbers.

The president is sure to laud ObamaCare at his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday. And no doubt he’ll boast about the 11.3 million people enrolled in an ObamaCare exchange by the end of the year.

That may look like “unprecedented demand” to Obama administration officials. But in fact, it’s an ominous sign that ObamaCare is losing what little luster it had in the marketplace.

First off, 11.3 million is nothing to celebrate when you consider that at the end of open enrollment last year, the administration claimed that 11.7 million had signed up. By the end of the entire year, that number had been whittled down to about 9 million, of which 8.2 million re-enrolled.

More will no doubt sign up before open enrollment ends on Jan. 31. Even so, the numbers are likely be only marginally improved from last year’s.

And they will be a far cry from the 20 million that the Congressional Budget Office had been expecting, and far fewer than insurance industry experts say are needed to keep the ObamaCare insurance pools stable.

The administration also brags that ObamaCare exchanges attracted 2.5 million new customers to its Healthcare.gov site. But that’s significantly fewer than the 4.7 million new customers it got last year. Most businesses would look at that trend with concern, not pride.

Meanwhile, the young and healthy continue to avoid ObamaCare. The administration says 26% of enrollees are 18 to 34 years old. That’s the same share as last year at this time and lower than the 28% in ObamaCare’s first year. And it’s well below the 40% that the administration had said was needed to keep the ObamaCare insurance markets stable.

And by the way, Gallup’s report on the uninsured — which the administration happily paraded about when it showed the number going down — finds that it climbed to 11.9% at the end of last year, the second quarterly increase.

As IBD’s Jed Graham aptly put it: “The Obama administration has shifted expectations about ObamaCare to such an extent that the latest enrollment data were, quite remarkably, reported as good news.”

It’s one thing for the White House to put a high gloss on these unhappy numbers, but it’s an indictment of the mainstream press that it’s willing to swallow it whole.
