But first: What's in CMS's monumental physician payment rule.\n\nWHAT'S IN MACRA \u2014 CMS on Wednesday proposed its highly anticipated changes to Medicare physician payment, the biggest reforms to doctor reimbursement in years.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe agency's focus? Introducing more flexibility for physicians, who say they're over-regulated and over-measured, while further nudging them towards models designed to reimburse them for high-value care.\n\nPULSE pulled out five major takeaways from the 962-page announcement.\n\n1) ACOs in \"Track 1\" of the Medicare Shared Savings Program won't qualify as an Advanced Alternative Payment Model. More for Pros.\n\n2) CMS outlined three standards that will be used to determine whether providers are assuming more than \"nominal\" financial risk, a crucial metric for determining eligibility as an Advanced Alternative Payment Model. More for Pros.\n\n3) To qualify as an Advanced Alternative Payment Model, clinicians will have to comply with a number of health IT requirements: 50 percent of clinicians must used certified EHRs by 2017, and 75 percent by 2018.\n\n4) Meanwhile, CMS will sunset its meaningful use program \u2014 as expected \u2014 and replace it with the new Advancing Care Information program, which is intended to offer more flexibility. For instance, the ACI program would not require all-or-nothing electronic health record measurement.\n\n5) MIPS-eligible clinicians will still be on aggressive upgrade timelines for their health IT. By 2018, clinicians will have to use 2015-edition certified products only, and will have to perform requirements which \u201ccorrelate\u201d with meaningful use stage 3.\n\nSee the rule: http://bit.ly/1rAVFpB\n\nSee the release: http://1.usa.gov/1WTM88p\n\nWatch HHS's new explainer video on payment reform: http://bit.ly/1VW843j\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\u2014 Bullish: The American Medical Association. \"Our initial review suggests that CMS has been listening to physicians' concerns,\" said AMA president Steven Stack. \"In particular, it appears that CMS has made significant improvements by recasting the EHR Meaningful Use program and by reducing quality reporting burdens.\"\n\n\u2014 Bearish: The American Hospital Association. \"We are deeply disappointed by CMS\u2019s narrow definition of alternative payment models, which could have a chilling effect on providers\u2019 ability to experiment with new patient-centered, value-driven payment models,\" said AHA's Tom Nickels. \"Today\u2019s rule fails to recognize the significant resources and risk assumed by the highly motivated, early adopters of alternative payment models.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: ANDY SLAVITT ON MACRA AND MORE \u2014 The CMS acting administrator sat down with PULSE for the debut of our brand-new podcast, \"Pulse Check.\" Slavitt shared thoughts on the new physician payment rule, the future of Obamacare pilots, why drug prices could be the top priority for his successor and much more.\n\nRead the story: http://politi.co/1T6GutQ\n\nListen to the podcast: http://bit.ly/1NBwDQs\n\nSubcribe on iTunes: http://apple.co/1YTVD60\n\nThree fun Slavitt tidbits we learned from the podcast\n\n\u00b7 He estimates he gets 27 comment letters per week \u2014 from Capitol Hill alone\n\n\u00b7 He thinks \"health care\" is two words, not one\n\n\u00b7 His willingness to be direct and honest on Twitter freaks out his colleagues\n\nTHIS IS THURSDAY PULSE \u2014 Where we're bidding good morning to a certain CMS administrator, who confessed he uses PULSE to determine whether it's a good day to get out of bed. (We'd propose he rise and shine, and if that turns out to be a punitive recommendation, he can always let us know in the comment period.)

Richard Burr told Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn and Sarah Karlin-Smith. \"We've spent a decade driving things out of the hospital and now all of a sudden, they're reverting back to putting it all back into the hospital,\" he said, citing doctors' concerns they will be driven out of business.\n\nThe story for Pros: http://politico.pro/1NBs7BA\n\n\u2014 Why Democrats want significant changes. All 12 Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee signed on to a letter expressing their concerns with the program, including how it will interact with other payment reform efforts and Medicare demonstration projects.\n\n\"We have heard numerous concerns from patients, providers and other stakeholders about the model\u2019s potential to have unintended consequences on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to care and physician-administered drugs,\" the Democrats warn.\n\nThey also caution that while CMMI \"should initially implement focused demonstrations,\" the Part B demonstration proposes \"significant and complex\" changes that could affect up to 75 percent of providers.\n\nMEET HILLARY CLINTON'S TOP THREE HEALTH CARE ADVISORS \u2014 The trio of Chris Jennings, Neera Tanden and Ann O'Leary are the inner circle hoping to shape the policies guiding the Democratic front-runner into the White House, Pro's Nancy Cook reports.\n\nClinton's known for cultivating small, loyal circles of advisers, and her top health care experts fit the bill; Jennings has guided Clinton since her 1990s health reform effort, and Clinton\u2019s relationships with Tanden and O\u2019Leary also date back to her husband\u2019s administration. Collectively, their strategy centers on stressing Clinton's \"bold and practical\" stance on health care \u2014 the only politician left in the race who's vowed to preserve the Affordable Care Act and improve upon it rather than start anew.\n\nMore for Pros: http://politico.pro/1SLzpBV\n\nPAUL RYAN WANTS TO END OBAMACARE'S PROTECTION FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS \u2014 The House speaker on Wednesday called for an end to the Affordable Care Act's ban on underwriting for pre-existing conditions, arguing that there's a less expensive alternative to cover America's sickest patients.\n\n\"Let's fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage, so that they can get affordable coverage,\" Ryan said in a speech to students at Georgetown University. \"You dramatically lower the price for everybody else. You make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition.\"\n\nMore from Reuters: http://reut.rs/238c3ZJ\n\n49 percent. That's the percentage of Americans who say they or a family member have a pre-existing medical condition like cancer, diabetes or heart disease, Kaiser Family Foundation CEO Drew Altman points out.\n\nSENATE TO VALEANT: APOLOGY NOT ACCEPTED \u2014 Valeant\u2019s executive suite on Wednesday came prepared to publicly apologize for their price-hiking tactics at the Senate Aging Committee's drug price hearing. But committee leadership was on the attack before the company's executives could even testify, Pro's Sarah Karlin-Smith reports.\n\n\"As for turning over a new leaf, I remain skeptical,\u201d said ranking member Claire McCaskill. Valeant hiked the price of sixteen of its drugs the last six months, McCaskill added later in the hearing. \u201cHow can you sit here and say you are sorry?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Why the Senate was so unhappy. Lawmakers also didn\u2019t accept Valeant's claims that its pricing tactics were just a small part of the company\u2019s business plan or that it had made efforts to provide patients and hospitals with discounts on its drugs.\n\n\u201cWe have yet to find any hospitals that have received those discounts,\u201d chairwoman Susan Collins said. \u201cYour patient assistance program does not have a good track record and has been very difficult to navigate,\u201d she added.\n\n\u2014 What's next for Valeant: A major shake-up. The company's planning to drop five long-standing board members and add four new ones in an effort to change its ways, the Wall Street Journal reports. The new board members are drawn from the pharma industry \u2014 an unusual move for Valeant, given that it publicly derided pharma firms while trying to position itself as an upstart.\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Expand seniors\u2019 access to prescription drugs.

Writing in POLITICO Magazine, Mike Grunwald details the \"never-ending internal battle over the Obamacare message\" that plagued White House media strategy in the early days of the administration. And because top officials never settled on a single message, the media strategy on the Affordable Care Act constantly fluctuated as a result.\n\n\"One month we\u2019d emphasize coverage, the next month cost, the next month taking on the insurers,\u201d former spokesman Reid Cherlin said. \u201cThe more polling you do and the more of a beating you take, the more you try different things. And you lose the narrative.\u201d\n\nRead the story: http://politi.co/1NVbtru\n\n\u2014 Media struggles extended beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. On Twitter, Grunwald adds that HHS was \"furious\" at the White House and wanted a major advertising push to defend reform. But White House aides \"didn't trust HHS [and] thought the less said the better politically.\"\n\nGROWING NUMBER OF DEM VOTERS WANT CONGRESS TO BUILD ON ACA \u2014 That's according to this morning's Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, which found that 51 percent of Democratic voters now want Congress to expand the law's scope rather than just leave it as is.\n\nThat's the highest level of support for ACA expansion in at least a year and a significant increase from 36 percent of respondents in December 2015. Why the surge? The foundation's analysts muse that the rhetoric around universal coverage in the Democratic presidential campaign may be the chief culprit.\n\nSee the poll: http://kaiserf.am/1pIfIAw\n\nU.S. MILITARY WILL FINALLY EXPLAIN WHY IT BOMBED A DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS HOSPITAL \u2014 That's according to NBC News, which reportsthat the military on Friday will release its investigation into the October bombing of a Doctors Without Borders trauma center in Afghanistan that killed at least 42 people.\n\nAccording to NBC's report:\n\n\u00b7 The military will offer a detailed timeline and release a heavily redacted version of the investigation\n\n\u00b7 Several service members faced administrative punishment, but not criminal charges\n\nSOME STATES PAY MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT OTHERS DO FOR HEALTH CARE \u2014 That's according to a new analysis from the Health Care Cost Institute, the latest report to quantify the massive cost variation in the U.S. health care system.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that the existence of regional cost variation is widely known, but say they're still puzzled by the forces behind them. And they call on regulators and researchers to keep exploring a key question: \"Why do prices for the same service differ markedly across distances of only a few miles, and what amount of that difference is justifiable?\"\n\nSee the report: http://bit.ly/1VW9qeg\n\nStates with the highest health care prices, relatively\n\n\u00b7 Alaska (164 percent higher than the national average)\n\n\u00b7 Wisconsin (91 percent higher)\n\n\u00b7 North Dakota (68 percent higher)\n\nStates with the lowest health care prices, relatively\n\n\u00b7 Florida (21 percent lower)\n\n\u00b7 Arizona (18 percent)\n\n\u00b7 Maryland (12 percent)\n\nMANHATTAN INSTITUTE OFFERS PRESCRIPTION ON CANCER DRUG REFORMS \u2014 The free-market think tank is out with a new report on using precision medicine to improve outcomes and value, ahead of its 10 a.m. briefing on Capitol Hill today.\n\nThe report's chief argument: That a series of regulatory reforms and emerging technologies would allow FDA to more quickly bring drugs to market, better reward innovative drug makers and lower costs for patients and providers.\n\nFor instance, the institute concludes that the growing focus on cancer genomics won't only lead to new breakthroughs in targeted medicine, but improve oncology pricing too. \"The rise of precision-medicine databases and analytical tools that can tell doctors and patients how best to match a specific drug with a specific patient\u2019s disease may well help solve the problem of drug-price sticker shock,\" the report reads.\n\nSee the report: http://bit.ly/1VTSq9n\n\n\u2014 Coburn no fan of FDA. At a small dinner on Wednesday, retired Sen. Tom Coburn \u2014 a Manhattan Institute adviser \u2014 said that the agency is missing opportunities to approve innovative drugs because it's grown too focused on relatively inconsequential risks. \"Aspirin would not be approved today by the FDA,\" Coburn said.\n\nCANCER RESEARCH FIRM CEO'S SALARY: $329.7 MILLION \u2014 Patrick Soon-Shiong was the highest-paid U.S. executive of 2015, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index this morning. The CEO of NantKwest made most of his money from stock options granted before the company's initial public offering.\n\nNEW YORK CHANGES TUNE ON HEP C DRUGS FOR MEDICAID PATIENTS \u2014 The state is backing off guidelines that deny Medicaid patients access to Sovaldi and Harvoni until they became very ill, POLITICO's Dan Goldberg and Kassie Parisi report. http://politi.co/1VW1xFU\n\nHAPPY (BELATED) BIRTHDAY \u2026 to Aubree Eliza Weaver, the terrific POLITICO Web producer who'll be the first person to see this, given how early she gets up to help get PULSE out the door.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING by Paul Demko\n\nAddiction treatment centers are plagued by staffing shortages, a problem being exacerbated by the opioid crisis, reports the Wall Street Journal. http://on.wsj.com/1SBtmNW\n\nTennessee Gov.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
