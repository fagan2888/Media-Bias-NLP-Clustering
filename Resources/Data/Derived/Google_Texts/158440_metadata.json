These demographic questions are asked in an effort to better know and understand our employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is one of the largest financial institutions in the world, with 260,000 employees in more than 60 countries. Chase is its U.S. customer and commercial banking unit, with 185,000 U.S.-based employees.\n\nRobert P. George, a law professor at Princeton University and co-author of a book on the definition of marriage, first reported on the survey on his law blog, Mirror of Justice, after a JPMorgan Chase employee brought the last question in the sequence to his attention.\n\nThe source, who asked not to be identified by George for fear of losing employment, expressed outrage over the inquiry. George quotes the source as saying:\n\nNot selecting that option is essentially saying \u2018I\u2019m not an ally of civil rights,\u2019 which is a vague way to say \u2018I\u2019m a bigot.\u2019 The worry among many of us is that those who didn\u2019t select that poorly placed, irrelevant option will be placed on the \u2018you can fire these people first\u2019 list.\n\nThe whistleblower added: \u201cThis survey was not anonymous. You had to enter your employee ID.\u201d\n\nAt JP Morgan Chase\u2019s request, The Daily Signal today submitted a list of 10 questions about the survey, including why employees were asked about their sexual orientation and whether it was the first time the bank has inquired about its employees\u2019 ties to the \u201cLGBT community.\u201d\n\nThe spokeswoman did not reply to the specific questions.\n\nSome gay activists and others in the self-identified LGBT community \u2014 for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender \u2014 expressed skepticism about the survey described by George\u2019s source. George then posted a follow-up blog citing a second employee who came forward to confirm the survey\u2019s existence.\n\nThe second employee said of the survey:\n\nIt did have the last two options about being an LBGT ally. I have worked for Chase for [deleted] years and was blown away by this question. I have no idea what they were thinking when they asked that. If this is posted, please spare my identity.\n\nAt Princeton, George holds the McCormick Chair in Jurisprudence and is founding director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions.
