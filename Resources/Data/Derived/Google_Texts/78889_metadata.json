Why weren\u2019t her anti-depressant medications included? Why did she have to pay $60 to see a doctor? The insurance jargon \u2013 deductible, co-pay, premium, co-insurance \u2013 was like a foreign language. What did it mean?\n\n\u201cI have an education and I am not understanding this,\u201d said Emerson, 50. \u201c I wonder about people who don\u2019t have an education \u2014 how baffling this must be for them.\u201d\n\nHealth officials have spent much of the past year promoting the Affordable Care Act and enrolling people in coverage. Now they need to help consumers understand the basics of health insurance and how to use their policies, health care providers and researchers say.\n\n\u201cGiving somebody an insurance card and not really telling them what that insurance is going to do for them is not going to produce the health outcomes that we all want to see,\u201d said Brendan Saloner, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIf the goal is to improve health and lower costs \u2026 it is really important to equip consumers with the education they need.\u201d\n\nPatients who don\u2019t grasp fundamental health and insurance concepts are less likely to make smart decisions about when and where to seek care, experts said. In fact, people with low \u201chealth literacy,\u201d as experts put it, are more likely to be hospitalized and use costly emergency rooms, according to the Institute of Medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s a big problem. About one in 10 people in the U.S. have a proficient level of health literacy, according to an assessment by the U.S. Department of Education \u2013 that is, they could understand and use health-related information in daily activities.\n\nIt\u2019s a big problem. About one in 10 people in the U.S. have a proficient level of health literacy, according to an assessment by the U.S. Department of Education \u2013 that is, they could understand and use health-related information in daily activities.\n\nAnd researchers at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics determined that just weeks before open enrollment began last year for state and federal insurance exchanges, more than 40 percent of Americans couldn\u2019t explain a deductible \u2013 the amount patients owe for health services before insurance kicks in. The authors found that those likely to benefit most from the health law \u2013 uninsured and low-income Americans \u2013 had the least awareness.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge void,\u201d said Bonnie Braun, a health literacy expert and professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health.\n\nInsurance is often perplexing even to savvy consumers. Acronyms abound: HMOs, PPOs, ACOs. Letters arrive in the mail saying \u201cthis is not a bill\u201d yet appear to be just that. Some detail exorbitant prices that have nothing to do with what is actually owed.\n\nLanguage and cultural barriers add to the confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand even if it is Spanish,\u201d said Marisela Sanchez, 50, a new Medi-Cal enrollee from Los Angeles who has diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. \u201cIf it\u2019s in English, it\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\nCommunity health centers throughout the nation are seeing some of the problems firsthand.\n\nAt Eisner Pediatric & Family Health Center in downtown Los Angeles, lead enrollment specialist Martha Vasquez said the vast majority of patients who bought private insurance selected plans with the lowest premiums, not necessarily grasping that those plans came with high deductibles.\n\nNow they are asking why the visits that they consider preventive aren\u2019t free and whether hospital visits are included in their plans. They also are uncertain what specialists they can see and what medications are covered.\n\nJessie Yuan, a physician at the center, said patients have been confused about health insurance for a long time. The new health law \u201cjust adds another layer on top of that,\u201d she said.\n\nYuan said she sees it as part of her job to give a brief orientation to new Medi-Cal patients. On a recent morning, she spoke with Oscar Gonzalez, a diabetic patient from Huntington Park, in Spanish. Gonzalez had been switched to Medi-Cal from a free county program for the uninsured.\n\nWith Medi-Cal, Yuan told her patient, over-the-counter medications like Tylenol and cough syrup aren\u2019t free anymore. He can get a free vision appointment but will have to pay for glasses. It will be easier to get referrals to specialists, but if he needs to change the appointment, he has to do it himself.\n\nAnd instead of giving him a three-month supply of medications, Yuan explained she would write a refillable prescription that would cover several months.\n\nGonzalez seemed bewildered.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even know he had been automatically switched to the Medi-Cal program until Yuan told him. \u201cI knew by the news they were making some changes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know all the rules.\u201d\n\nThe side effects of confusion can be harmful, providers said. Sanchez, the new Medi-Cal recipient from Los Angeles with several chronic conditions, stopped taking two of her regular medications because the doctor didn\u2019t write new prescriptions. Sanchez concluded she didn\u2019t need them anymore \u2013 not realizing that she was supposed to get refills.\n\n\u201cThe concept of refill is very difficult for our patients,\u201d said Nicole Alton, the Eisner health center\u2019s director of pharmacy. \u201cShe is just one of hundreds of people who come and don\u2019t understand the system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just low-income patients or those new to insurance who need help navigating the system.\n\nRob Hoerntlein, 63, had purchased private insurance before but said he is stumped by his new Covered California plan, which took effect in April.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand what the costs or coverage are,\u201d said Hoerntlein, who lives near Yosemite and is a licensed real estate agent.\n\nWhen his wife had some warts burned off, he got a bill for about $300. Hoerntlein said he was told that he had vision coverage but later told he didn\u2019t. The booklet explaining his new health coverage arrived months after signing up for the policy.\n\nTo address these problems, efforts are underway across the nation by the government agencies, universities and health plans to help people understand the language of health insurance, what services are covered and how to make the best use of policies. The University of Maryland and the nonprofit Insure the Uninsured Project in California are among those who have offered workshops or are planning to.\n\nHealth insurance exchanges are publishing glossaries of insurance terms. Insurers are holding webinars, sending out welcome kits and trying to make everything \u201cclear, simple and easy to use,\u201d said Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. Pisano added that patients will take better care of themselves if they understand their benefits.\n\nDeb Emerson, the Oroville woman who chose a policy through Covered California, said she has spent the last several months reading and asking questions about what is included in her plan and what her financial responsibilities are. She still isn\u2019t clear why she paid about $70 to see a doctor before getting insurance \u2013 and $60 afterward.\n\nCome next month, Emerson expects to become eligible for Medicare and will have to start all over again.\n\n\u201cI am worried it might be more confusing,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story also ran in the Sacramento Bee.
