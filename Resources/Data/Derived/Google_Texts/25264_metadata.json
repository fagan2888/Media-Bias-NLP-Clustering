But the jobs created by fracking are not the kind of quality jobs American workers deserve.\n\nThey are not the kind of jobs American laborers have fought and died for throughout our country\u2019s history.\n\nThey are extremely dangerous, exposing workers to chemicals whose long-term impacts on human health are yet unknown. In fact, the fatality rate of oil field jobs is seven times greater than the national average.\n\nIn our new short film, GASWORK: The Fight for C.J.\u2019s Law, we conduct an investigation into worker safety and chemical risk. We follow Charlotte Bevins as she fights for CJ\u2019s law\u2014a bill to protect workers named for her brother CJ Bevins, who died at an unsafe drilling site.\n\nWe interview many workers who have been asked to clean drill sites, transport radioactive and carcinogenic chemicals, steam-clean the inside of condensate tanks which contain harmful volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other chemicals, and have been told to do so with no safety equipment.\n\nA lot of reporting has been done on the health impacts fracking and drilling have on local communities, but often the story of the workers, the folks who are exposed to fracking chemicals and unsafe working conditions around the clock, goes untold.\n\nGASWORK has rare interviews with oil and gas workers who have come forward to speak out about the unsafe conditions.\n\nOne worker from western Pennsylvania told us he was hired by the fracking industry in the early days of the rush to drill the Marcellus Shale to cover up toxic spills in his own community, near the forests and streams where he would hunt and fish, near the front yard where his children play.\n\nThe industry won\u2019t tell you that the \u201cgood\u201d jobs created by fracking are paying men to poison their own communities in order to feed their families. They won\u2019t tell you that those jobs are not union jobs and if you get hurt, you are on your own. And they won\u2019t tell you that the transition to 100 percent renewables will create hundreds of thousands of safer jobs.\n\nThat is one reason we joined workers from the renewable energy industry in an act of civil disobedience on the banks of Seneca Lake in May. Along with 19 others, we blockaded the gates of Crestwood Midstream, a Houston based company whose plan to turn the Finger Lakes into the gas storage and transportation hub for the northeast includes storing gas in rickety salt caverns under Seneca Lake.\n\nPages: 1 \u2022 2", "article_metadata": {"description": "In GASWORK: The Fight for C.J.'s Law, Josh Fox conducts an investigation into worker safety and chemical risk in fracking.
