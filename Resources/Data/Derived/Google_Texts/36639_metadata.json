In most cases, his laws of choice conveniently coincide with his Administration\u2019s political agenda. Our Founding Fathers created the Executive Branch to implement and enforce the laws written by Congress and vested this power in the President. However, President Obama has chosen to ignore some of the laws written by Congress and implemented by preceding Presidents.\"\n\n\n\nIn his letter to fellow members, Rice enumerated the complaints as:\n\n\n\n1.President Obama recently announced an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d in regard to cancelled healthcare plans due to Obamacare. Of course he plans to provide a \u201cfix\u201d which will substantially alter his signature legislation without involving Congress.\n\n\n\n2. Over the summer, President Obama\u2019s Administration announced a one-year delay in Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate without involving Congress.\n\n\n\n3. Last year, President Obama\u2019s Administration granted temporary status to illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children without involving Congress.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Rice Introduces Resolution to take Obama to Court", "copyright": "NorthMyrtleBeachOnline.com", "author": "North Myrtle Beach Online, LLC", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "implemented,preceding,presidents,some,ignore,however,chosen,enumerated,complaints,fix&rdquo,regard,&ldquoadministrative,recently,power,this,with,administration&rsquos,coincide,conveniently,cases"}, "article_summary": "Rice wrote in a letter to fellow House members, \"President Obama has adopted a practice of picking and choosing which laws he wants to enforce.\nHowever, President Obama has chosen to ignore some of the laws written by Congress and implemented by preceding Presidents.\"\nIn his letter to fellow members, Rice enumerated the complaints as:1.President Obama recently announced an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d in regard to cancelled healthcare plans due to Obamacare.\nLast year, President Obama\u2019s Administration granted temporary status to illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children without involving Congress.\nOf course he plans to provide a \u201cfix\u201d which will substantially alter his signature legislation without involving Congress."}
