A profoundly liberal senator from California booed off of the stage for not being liberal enough; the party that stokes self-entitlement learning that the self-entitled don\u2019t accept things like \u201crules\u201d or \u201cvote totals\u201d; the once-vaunted party machine swiftly disintegrating from the inside now that more and more party activists realize that Harry Reid, the Clintons, and the rest never cared about them or \u201cthe little guys\u201d in the first place \u2013 what\u2019s not to snicker at?\n\nI want to laugh at all the people who demand an ever-larger and more powerful government, and then freak out when this desire is immediately and directly fulfilled in the form of police officers coming to restore order and disperse troublemakers. (What did you think \u201cmore government\u201d was, Berners? It\u2019s blunt force. How else did you think you were going to take more of Other People\u2019s Money to pay for \u201cfree college\u201d?)\n\nAnd I want to be satisfied that a party filled with people who respond to electoral defeat by vandalizing their own party headquarters, publish personal contact information of party volunteers, and harass and threaten the families of said volunteers will never, ever be capable of achieving any sort of power in Nevada or in the United States of America.\n\nBut I can\u2019t. Because we\u2019ve already seen this show, and know how it ends.\n\nWe had our convention chaos in 2008, when Ron Paul supporters who couldn\u2019t win by persuasion determined to attack from the inside. They eventually succeeded, but like mutineers who can\u2019t drive a ship, ran the whole enterprise aground. They \u201cpurified\u201d the GOP by driving \u201cheretics\u201d to register as independents without influence in primaries.\n\nThe 2016 convention was relatively sedate. But it was not the smooth running of a well-oiled machine that kept it quiet, but rather the peace of the grave. Very few elected officials bothered to show up, and why would they? The party activists don\u2019t represent the majority of regular voters. (To-wit: Governor Sandoval\u2019s approval rating is 66 percent statewide, while the conventioneers condemned him.) Why court a party which has minimal money or organizational ability to get out the vote; one infected with tinfoil-hat-wearing activists who cause such disruption that party officers keep quitting in disgust? Those who remain left their intellectual credibility behind when they rallied behind Donald Trump \u2013 how do you censure the governor and his GOP allies in Carson City for \u201cbreaking promises,\u201d raising taxes, or not being sufficiently against Obamacare, while simultaneously demanding fealty to a serially dishonest Orange Combover who has promised to raise taxes and implement a full-fledged single payer government health care system?\n\nThe result is a party leader who will either lose to the worst Democrat candidate in living memory, or will win and be indistinguishable from her in any way that matters to those of us who believe in America\u2019s founding principles.\n\nWe can only hope that a saner option rises from the corpse of the current GOP, so we can shield ourselves from the inevitable death throes of the Democratic Party\u2019s Berned-out husk.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1ViQRQX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I want to bask in schadenfreude about the Democratic state convention disaster, if the state GOP wasn't in the same boat.", "og": {"site_name": "Reno Gazette Journal", "description": "I want to bask in schadenfreude about the Democratic state convention disaster, if the state GOP wasn't in the same boat.", "title": "Orrin: Two dead parties", "url": "http://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/05/25/orrin-two-dead-parties/84938992/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/rgj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I want to bask in schadenfreude about the Democratic state convention disaster, if the state GOP wasn't in the same boat.", "title": "Orrin: Two dead parties", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4ded550dfe9a157145d1d2586df1c73f3f5b071/c=672-0-3256-2584&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/29/Reno/B9319475095Z.1_20151029205644_000_GJRCD1LFE.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@rgj", "site": "@rgj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805729789", "fb": {"app_id": 178959168788968}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "orrin johnson, nevada republicans, nevada gop, nevada democrats, bernie sanders, hillary clinton, donald trump"}, "article_summary": "The party activists don\u2019t represent the majority of regular voters.\nHow else did you think you were going to take more of Other People\u2019s Money to pay for \u201cfree college\u201d?)\nBuy Photo Orrin Johnson (Photo: Andy Barron/RGJ)Buy PhotoOh, how I want to bask in schadenfreude about the Democratic state convention disaster.\nWe had our convention chaos in 2008, when Ron Paul supporters who couldn\u2019t win by persuasion determined to attack from the inside.\nWhy court a party which has minimal money or organizational ability to get out the vote; one infected with tinfoil-hat-wearing activists who cause such disruption that party officers keep quitting in disgust?"}
