WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAU) -- You can learn more about Bridge Community Health Clinic and take a tour of their facility today during a special open house

This week is the 20th anniversary of the opening of Bridge Community Health Clinic. The clinic was founded as Primary Connection Health Care in 1995, and opened to help provide medical care to the underserved in the community.

Executive director Laura Scudiere says while Bridge isn't a free clinic, they are able to serve the underinsured and uninsured. "What we do is meet with patients and discuss their options. A lot of patients come in and don't realize they're eligible for Medicaid, and we've got people on site that can help them sign up that day." The clinic also helps people connect with the Affordable Care Act exchanges as well as BadgerCare.

Scudiere says everyone is invited to tour the clinic today starting at 4 pm. "We're inviting all our legislators to come visit and see the clinic itself. It's a beautiful time to see the clinic because the community garden is in bloom."

Bridge Community Health Clinic is located just north of the Boys and Girls Club in Wausau on Second Street.
