Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) has said he will not seek a third term in the statehouse.\n\nCoakley, who has served as the state's attorney general since 2007, ran an unsuccessful Senate campaign in 2010 against Republican Scott Brown. Brown, who lost his Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren (D) in 2012, has said he will not run for governor in 2014. Brown, however, is exploring a 2016 presidential bid.\n\nSeveral Democrats have already jumped in the race, including state Treasurer Steven Grossman and state homeland security official Juliette Kayyem. Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) is also expected to make a decision soon on whether he will run. On the Republican side, Charles Baker announced his candidacy earlier this month. Baker previously ran for the office in 2010. Independent candidate Evan Falchuk is also pursuing the office.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 2014 Gubernatorial Candidates 2014 Gubernatorial Candidates\n\n1 of 95 Greg Abbott (R-Texas) State Attorney General (2002-Present) State Supreme Court Justice (1995-2001) Share this slide:\n\n(AP Photo/Pat Sullivan)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley is set to announce her candidacy for governor,", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-16 11:40:18 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley is set to announce her candidacy for governor,", "title": "Martha Coakley To Run For Governor In Massachusetts: Report", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/15/martha-coakley-governor_n_3930636.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1353719/images/o-MARTHA-COAKLEY-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley is set to announce her candidacy for governor,", "creator": "molliereilly", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1353719/images/o-MARTHA-COAKLEY-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Martha Coakley To Run For Governor In Massachusetts: Report", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-15 11:40:18 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3930636", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "scott brown 2014,Scott Brown,Politics News,Deval Patrick,martha coakley 2014,martha coakley governor,election 2014,massachusetts governor,massachusetts,martha coakley scott brown,2014 elections,massachusetts governor 2014,martha coakley", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "scott brown 2014,Scott Brown,Politics News,Deval Patrick,martha coakley 2014,martha coakley governor,election 2014,massachusetts governor,massachusetts,martha coakley scott brown,2014 elections,massachusetts governor 2014,martha coakley", "published_time": "2013-09-15 11:40:18 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-16 17:08:55 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6b5\"", "article_summary": "Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley is set to announce her candidacy for governor, WCVB and the Boston Globe report.\nCoakley, who has served as the state's attorney general since 2007, ran an unsuccessful Senate campaign in 2010 against Republican Scott Brown.\nAlso on HuffPost: 2014 Gubernatorial Candidates 2014 Gubernatorial Candidates1 of 95 Greg Abbott (R-Texas) State Attorney General (2002-Present) State Supreme Court Justice (1995-2001) Share this slide:(AP Photo/Pat Sullivan)\nBrown, who lost his Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren (D) in 2012, has said he will not run for governor in 2014.\nCoakley, a Democrat, has reportedly been weighing a 2014 gubernatorial bid for months."}
