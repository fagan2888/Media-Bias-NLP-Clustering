The group\u2019s field organizing team often meets minority voters who list health care as a top concern, and it is looking to leverage that issue to get more Hispanic voters to the polls in November.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act passed in 2009, Republican leaders in Texas have opposed expanding Medicaid to cover poor, uninsured adults, saying the system is broken and should be overhauled before it is expanded. The issue of Medicaid expansion resonates strongly with Hispanics, who make up a large portion of the state\u2019s uninsured population.\n\nIn Harris, Dallas and Bexar counties \u2014 three of the state\u2019s most populous counties \u2014 The Texas Organizing Project is working to use Hispanic support of affordable health care to spur a movement that could change the state\u2019s electoral tide.\n\nThe group\u2019s leaders said they believe their efforts, which include 200 canvassers and phone bankers, will be successful because the individuals they are working with are receptive to candidates who support the federal health law regardless of political affiliation.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t people who are worried about turning Texas blue,\u201d said Ginny Goldman, executive director of the Texas Organizing Project, which has endorsed Democratic candidates who are supportive of the health care law. \u201cNot only will we support Republicans who are on our side of the issues, but we\u2019ll take on Democrats who are not.\u201d\n\nFor their part, Republicans are prioritizing the economy and jobs \u2014 issues on which they say their party holds the upper hand \u2014 to reach Hispanic voters. They point to polling data indicating that job security and the economy resonate with Hispanic voters.\n\n\u201cHealth care is a concern among all Texans \u2014 not just Hispanics,\u201d said David Zapata, Hispanic engagement director for the Republican Party of Texas. \u201cHowever, what we\u2019re seeing is that jobs and the economy continue to dominate voters\u2019 concerns.\u201d\n\nAs the state\u2019s Hispanic population continues to grow, both major political parties are honing their messages to reach this swelling voting bloc. Although less than a third of eligible voters in Texas are Hispanic, they are expected to make up a plurality of the state\u2019s population by 2020 from 38 percent of the state\u2019s population now.\n\nZapata said conservatives who oppose the federal health law stand to gain from the party\u2019s outreach to Hispanic voters by focusing on the economy. Texas Republicans can promote the \u201ceconomic success our state has experienced\u201d under their leadership, he said.\n\nJim Henson, a Texas Tribune pollster and director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said Hispanics overwhelmingly support almost all of the major provisions of the federal health law. But the issue ranks far behind unemployment and the economy as the top problem facing the state.\n\nHenson said that while health care was not expected to be a driving force among registered Hispanic voters, those with lower incomes could be more sensitive to health care costs and efforts to mobilize on that issue.\n\n\u201cWhat we see is a pattern of support among Hispanics for much better health care delivery,\u201d Henson said. \u201cAnd, when necessary, for government to help improve that delivery.\u201d\n\nHispanic voters also disapprove of the fines that most Texans will face if they do not buy health insurance under the federal law, and polling data shows they have been critical of its fumbled rollout. Zapata said Hispanic voters could also agree with Republicans on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cnegative consequences,\u201d including cases in which individuals have lost their doctors under new health care plans and high premiums they are left to pay for health coverage.\n\nPolitical analysts are at odds on whether health care could be a driving issue among Hispanics whose voter turnout in Texas \u2014 much like the general population \u2014 has been dismal.\n\nGuadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Brownsville, said Republicans would eventually have to compromise on health care issues with large support among Hispanics, like expanding Medicaid, if they want to be successful in coming elections in which Hispanics will carry increased electoral weight.\n\nMatt Mackowiak, a conservative political consultant, said the health care debate could work for organizing groups like the Texas Organizing Project that are looking to \u201ctarget certain constituencies very narrowly\u201d to increase voter turnout. But he quickly added that Democrats looking to use the issue to their advantage are facing a losing proposition.\n\n\u201cThe question is: Can Democrats motivate voters narrowly on the issue of health care?'\u201d Mackowiak said. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me if health care as an issue is a net plus for Democrats in 2014, I think the answer is no.\u201d\n\nThe organizing project\u2019s goal for the year is to deliver more than 100,000 new minority voters and reach thousands of minorities who are registered to vote but do not turn out.\n\nThere is a large area for improvement in Hispanic voter turnout in Texas. In 2012, only 39 percent of Hispanics in Texas eligible to vote cast a ballot in the presidential election. In that same election, 61 percent of eligible white Texans voted.\n\nThe group\u2019s leaders believe those voters could be motivated to head to the polls when they realize the polarity of positions on government-subsidized health care in the current election cycle. They also argue that Hispanics\u2019 likelihood of being uninsured could favor their mobilization efforts as they organize around ways to make health care more affordable in a state where almost one out of every four residents is uninsured.\n\n\u201cWhen the numbers are on your side, this is a Latino problem,\u201d the organizing project's Goldman said, speaking about the large number of Hispanics in the state who are uninsured. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our numbers, and we\u2019re going to leverage them.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
