Cobert's nomination now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\n\n\u201cI think we are all strongly in support of this nomination,\u201d said Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., during Wednesday\u2019s business meeting. \u201cBeth Cobert is an extraordinary individual, wonderful background.\u201d But Johnson also noted there were \u201csome problems\u201d with the nomination, referring to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman\u2019s subpoena issued to Cobert over documents related to the OPM hack, and a senator\u2019s potential block of the nomination because of issues related to the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the House oversight committee, wants OPM to produce more documents related to the hack, and be more transparent with lawmakers on how the breach was discovered. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., wants more information about why the Obama administration, through an OPM-issued rule, decided that the federal government could continue to contribute to the health plans of congressional staff and lawmakers under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nACA required lawmakers and congressional aides in personal offices to drop their Federal Employees Health Benefits Program insurance coverage as of Oct. 1, 2013, and enter the newly created exchange market. The August 2013 OPM rule stated that like private-sector employees, affected lawmakers and congressional staff would not lose their employer contributions for these health plans. Before OPM weighed in on how that provision of the law should be interpreted, Capitol Hill had worried that the shift from FEHBP to the health care insurance exchanges under Obamacare would be too expensive for many lawmakers and aides, making it difficult to retain employees. But some lawmakers, including Vitter and Johnson, believed the interpretation amounted to special treatment for those working on the Hill.\n\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, it\u2019s a very reasonable request to get information on how the Office of Personnel Management came up with this ruling that pretty much circumvented the law under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Johnson said, in support of Vitter\u2019s request.\n\nJohnson said he would support Cobert\u2019s nomination at this time because she committed to working with lawmakers on oversight and information requests. The nomination encountered no resistance from any of the panel\u2019s lawmakers during Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nHSGA Ranking Member Tom Carper, D-Del., praised Cobert\u2019s \u201csmarts,\u201d saying, \u201cwe\u2019re lucky that she\u2019s willing to take on this job.\u201d Cobert spent nearly 30 years at McKinsey & Co. before heading to government; prior to OPM, she served as deputy management director at the Office of Management and Budget.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kellie Lunney", "description": "Acting Director Beth Cobert still faces hurdles because of matters related to the OPM hack and Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Acting Director Beth Cobert still faces hurdles because of matters related to the OPM hack and Obamacare.", "title": "Senate Panel Approves OPM Nomination", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/management/2016/02/senate-panel-approves-opm-nomination/125840/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2016/02/10/021016cobert.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Acting Director Beth Cobert still faces hurdles because of matters related to the OPM hack and Obamacare.", "creator": "@klunney", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2016/02/10/021016cobert/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Senate Panel Approves OPM Nomination", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-10T17:10:12Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2016/02/10/021016cobert.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Senate Panel Approves OPM Nomination", "keywords": "beth cobert, opm hack, obamacare lawsuit", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2016/02/10/021016cobert/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "channel-management,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Acting Director Beth Cobert still faces hurdles because of matters related to the OPM hack and Obamacare."}, "article_summary": "A Senate panel on Wednesday advanced the nomination of Beth Cobert to serve as director of the Office of Personnel Management.\n\u201cI think we are all strongly in support of this nomination,\u201d said Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., during Wednesday\u2019s business meeting.\nCobert's nomination now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nJohnson said he would support Cobert\u2019s nomination at this time because she committed to working with lawmakers on oversight and information requests.\nThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee easily reported out the nomination of Cobert, who has been serving as acting OPM director since Katherine Archuleta resigned last summer amid the massive breach of federal employee data."}
