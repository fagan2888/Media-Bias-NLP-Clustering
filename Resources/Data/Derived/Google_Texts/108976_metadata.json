But when she tried to use it, she found that doctors \u2014 even those on the plan\u2019s network \u2014 wouldn\u2019t see her. She stated,\n\nI just felt that I wasn\u2019t being treated like a first-class citizen. Nobody, I don\u2019t care what kind of degrees they have, should ever be treated that way.\n\nWelcome, Miranda, to the world of socialized medicine, a world where doctors are struggling to keep their offices open, where insurance companies are cutting reimbursements under pressure from the federal government to keep their premiums \u201caffordable,\" and where the supply of physicians and other medical service providers is shrinking while the demand (thanks to newly insureds entering the market needing medical attention for problems that have festered for years) is increasing.\n\nSal Morales lost his employer-provided health insurance last year when he was laid off. So he found a plan that was affordable under his straitened means, thanks to federal subsidies. But when he tried to use his new coverage, he discovered that the first three physicians he called for an appointment wouldn\u2019t see him. He related,\n\nI actually went to a doctor and in the lobby they had an 11-by-17-inch sign in bright yellow that said: \u201cWe do not accept anything from the [ObamaCare] marketplace.\u201d\n\nAfter a shouting match with the office staff, Morales left and tried, for four months, to find a doctor who would see him. He finally found one who was close by and willing to see him and accept his coverage.\n\nAn internist, Eduardo Martinez, views ObamaCare from the other side of the receptionist\u2019s desk:\n\nTo be able to see a patient costs money. So it\u2019s easier to \u2026 avoid those patients because you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to get paid or not, and yet you have to pay your employees, and you have to pay the light bill.\n\nAnd when a medical service provider does get paid, he or she might be dismayed at how little that payment is. Dr. Doug Gerard, an internist in Hartford, Connecticut, is usually paid $100 or more when a new patient comes to see him. But if the patient comes with an ObamaCare policy, Gerard receives only $80. This is due partly to the pressure the federal government continues to apply to insurers to keep their premiums low and \u201caffordable.\" Gerard explained:\n\nI cannot accept a plan [which pays only] Medicare rates. You have to maintain a certain mix in private practice between low reimbursers and high reimbursers to be able to keep the lights on.\n\nProblems with insurers are exacerbated by the \u201c90-day grace period\u201d rule, whereby a patient who just signed up goes in to see a provider and then stops paying his premium. The doctor is assured he\u2019ll get paid for the initial visit but may be left holding the bag on additional services provided afterward. Internist Martinez explained:\n\nHow do I plan for a patient who needs to have surgery that\u2019s a large amount of money. [Whom] do I send him to? Which of my colleagues do I refer him to, knowing that my colleague is going to take a financial hit?\n\nThe whole chain of services gets affected.\n\nAnother issue is policies with large deductibles and co-pays that are the patient\u2019s responsibilities. Often those are the only plans affordable to lower-income people, who don\u2019t have the resources to meet them. What will a physician with a towering overhead do?\n\nJane Orient is a physician in Tucson, Arizona, who has never taken one dollar of third-party payments, private or public. It\u2019s a \u201cphilosophical and ethical\u201d position she\u2019s held for more than 20 years. Now the executive director of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons (with a membership of more than 4,000, including Dr. Rand Paul, U.S. senator from Kentucky), she says that more than half of them don\u2019t take Medicaid patients, but they\u2019ll take cash instead. Those patients are then free to wrestle on their own with their insurance companies to get reimbursed.\n\nGary Franchi, a reporter for NextNewsNetwork, wrote on November 1 that more than 200,000 physicians and other medical service providers have dumped ObamaCare:\n\nIn just a short amount of time since the [ObamaCare] laws have started taking place, already 215,000 doctors are now refusing to accept ObamaCare patients. That\u2019s more than 1 in 4 doctors across the nation, and that number is still rising.\n\nIn some states it\u2019s even higher. 70 percent of doctors in California are refusing to participate with ObamaCare plans.\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida\u2019s 23rd Congressional District, has been getting complaints from her constituents about their problems finding doctors to take them. Schulz also is chair of the Democratic National Committee and thus can see the future for doctors. Back in July she issued this chilling statement:\n\nMy staff has raised [the issue] with the Department of Health and Human Services as well as directly with some of the insurance companies\u2026.\n\nI believe the onus is on the insurers and the providers to bridge this gap and provide reliable, consistent customer service. [Emphasis added.]\n\nAnd what if they don\u2019t want to \u201cbridge the gap,\u201d or can\u2019t afford to? Turn them into government employees and force them to, according to Merrill Mathews, a scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation:\n\nPatient access to doctors is approaching a perfect storm of decreased physician supply, more demand for medical care \u2026 and doctors increasingly refusing to see low-paying Medicare or Medicaid patients.\n\nIf the \u201cpromise\u201d of Obamacare\u2019s access to health care is to be kept, government will eventually have to force doctors to accept Obamacare-covered patients.\n\nThis is the end-game of ObamaCare. It\u2019s socialized medicine, and physicians and other medical care providers who don\u2019t want to play nice will simply be assimilated by force into the system \u2014 socialized into government employees, so to speak. ObamaCare customers such as Miranda Childe will discover that they are no longer dealing with their physician but instead with a government bureaucrat. Then they will experience all the glories of government-provided health care as promised under ObamaCare.\n\nA graduate of Cornell University and a former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at www.LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, doctors, physicians, refusing, patients, socialized medicine", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/19443-more-doctors-refusing-obamacare-patients", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/cbea8bbe666ec80bc66914bf30ca0606_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "More and more doctors are refusing ObamaCare patients, but soon government will force doctors to provide service. by Bob Adelmann", "title": "More Doctors Refusing ObamaCare Patients"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/cbea8bbe666ec80bc66914bf30ca0606_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1037\"", "article_summary": "Gary Franchi, a reporter for NextNewsNetwork, wrote on November 1 that more than 200,000 physicians and other medical service providers have dumped ObamaCare:In just a short amount of time since the [ObamaCare] laws have started taking place, already 215,000 doctors are now refusing to accept ObamaCare patients.\nAnd when a medical service provider does get paid, he or she might be dismayed at how little that payment is.\n70 percent of doctors in California are refusing to participate with ObamaCare plans.\nNobody, I don\u2019t care what kind of degrees they have, should ever be treated that way.\nIf the \u201cpromise\u201d of Obamacare\u2019s access to health care is to be kept, government will eventually have to force doctors to accept Obamacare-covered patients."}
