After news organizations objected, she modified it slightly to allow access to docket entries but not the underlying filings. She left in place the ban on public comments by the parties.\n\nThe 4th Circuit panel order was issued by judges Roger Gregory and James Wynn, as well as Senior Judge Andre Davis. None took authorship of the court's brief ruling.\n\nBerger indicated that the unusual secrecy measures were needed to make sure a fair jury could be selected in the small city of Beckley, W. Va. where the trial is set to take place.\n\nBlankenship's lawyers have asked for a change of venue and had urged the appeals court to put off a ruling until that issue was decided.\n\nFederal prosecutors told the appeals court the order was not necessary to ensure a fair trial in the case.\n\nBerger, Wynn and Davis are appointees of President Barack Obama. Gregory was appointed to the 4th Circuit on an interim basis by former president Bill Clinton and re-appointed by former president George W. Bush.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, the Charleston Gazette, National Public Radio, and West Virginia Public Broadcasting filed the legal challenge to the judge's order. A slew of other news organizations signed-on to an amicus brief urging the appeals court to step in.\n\nJosh Gerstein is a senior reporter for POLITICO.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>Press prevails gets 4th Circuit to toss judge's ban on comments and access to court filings in ex-Massey CEO's prosecution</p>", "title": "Appeals court voids gag order in coal executive\u2019s trial", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/03/at-medias-request-court-overturns-gag-order-in-coal-203559.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>Press prevails gets 4th Circuit to toss judge's ban on comments and access to court filings in ex-Massey CEO's prosecution</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3107\"", "article_summary": "A slew of other news organizations signed-on to an amicus brief urging the appeals court to step in.\nFederal prosecutors told the appeals court the order was not necessary to ensure a fair trial in the case.\nBlankenship's lawyers have asked for a change of venue and had urged the appeals court to put off a ruling until that issue was decided.\nThe Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, the Charleston Gazette, National Public Radio, and West Virginia Public Broadcasting filed the legal challenge to the judge's order.\nThe 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said the order issued by U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger in connection with the prosecution of former Massey Coal CEO Donald Blankenship ran afoul of constitutional guarantees of public access to criminal proceedings."}
