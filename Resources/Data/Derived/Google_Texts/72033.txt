CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) â€” Mike Tobey had 15 points and a career-high 20 rebounds and No. 4 Virginia stifled No. 11 Louisville for the second time this season in a 68-46 victory Saturday night.

The game was the last of the season for Louisville (23-8, 12-6), which has self-imposed a postseason ban for this year for recruiting violations.

Malcolm Brogdon had 17 points and Anthony Gill 15 for the Cavaliers (24-6, 13-5 Atlantic Coast Conference), who began the game hoping No. 17 Duke would beat No. 8 North Carolina, giving Virginia a chance to claim a share of its third consecutive ACC regular-season title.

The Tar Heels prevailed, however, 76-72, and will be the top seed when the tournament opens Tuesday in Washington, D.C.
