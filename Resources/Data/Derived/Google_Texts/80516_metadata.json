MillerCoors released a sustainability report Wednesday that shows it has cut its water use by 9.2 percent from 2012.\n\n\u201cWater is just critical to us,\u201d Kim Marotta, the Chicago-based company\u2019s sustainability chief, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. \u201cLooking ahead, we needed to find a way to brew more beer but use less water.\u201d\n\nMillerCoors\u2019 water-saving effort \u2014 focused in Texas, California and Colorado \u2014 involves using sensors to release just enough water for irrigation, planting native grass to reduce erosion and runoff, and keeping a close eye on leaky machinery in its breweries.\n\nSome craft beermakers are also working to cut down on water usage while increasing market share.\n\nThe number of brewers in the U.S. has expanded to its highest level since the 1870s, mostly because of an explosion of craft breweries. Without the technology or scale of big brewers, craft brewers use on average as much as twice the amount of water for every barrel of beer.\n\nRahr & Sons Brewing Co., a craft brewer based in Fort Worth, Texas, produces about 22,000 barrels of beer per year. Co-owner Fritz Rahr said he does not know how much water he uses to produce each barrel but says the company employs strategies to conserve water and energy.\n\n\u201cWe use a heat-exchanging system, which recaptures the heat energy from the brewing process, transferring it back to the new brew water for the next batch of beer,\u201d Rahr said\n\nMillerCoors\u2019 massive Fort Worth brewery taps 770 million gallons a year from the Trinity River Basin, where tensions among private landowners, municipalities and other stakeholders are rising amid a persistent drought.\n\nWhile MillerCoors isn\u2019t restricted in its water use, residents in the Dallas-Fort Worth area are. In some cities, for example, residents can\u2019t flush toilets from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day and can water yards only on certain days. Three of MillerCoors\u2019 eight breweries rely on watersheds with stretched supplies.\n\nMillerCoors is giving out about $700,000 to landowners in the Trinity River Basin that use strategies that reduce erosion and runoff, such as restoring native plants and rotating cattle grazing, according to Trinity Waters, a nonprofit conservation group. That money is in addition to $7 million that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is providing to finance improvements.\n\nElsewhere, MillerCoors is controlling water use by paying for and installing sensors on the lands of its hop and barley suppliers in Utah and Colorado to control the release of water depending on soil and weather conditions.\n\nAfter visiting parent company SAB Miller\u2019s operations in Peru and Colombia, MillerCoors executives set up water rooms at its factories in Golden and Fort Worth \u2014 nicknamed \u201cwar rooms\u201d \u2014 to brainstorm ideas for cutting down on water.\n\nMillerCoors\u2019 sustainability report shows the brewer since 2012 has reduced water use to 3.48 barrels of water per barrel of beer, or roughly 1 billion barrels of water. The company says its Fort Worth brewery is leading the company\u2019s effort, partly by converting wastewater into fuel for its boilers and by recycling the pressurized water used to clean bottles and cans.\n\nSt. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, the largest U.S. brewer, said earlier this month it had cut its water use by 32 percent in the last five years by sponsoring preservation initiatives in water basins critical to its breweries, and by installing U.S. Department of Agriculture real-time weather and crop water-use data meters on suppliers\u2019 farms.\n\nThe owner of a farm in southeastern Idaho that supplies Anheuser-Busch with barley says the weather meter installed in March is helping.\n\n\u201cWater is really our limiting factor. In fact, we\u2019re struggling right now,\u201d said Clark Hamilton, who owns the 4,500-acre barley farm. \u201cWe kind of look to this equipment to show us what we can see physically.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Water woes forcing big beer brewers to tighten tap", "title": "Water woes forcing big beer brewers to tighten tap", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/water-woes-forcing-big-beer-brewers-to-tighten-tap/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__20140615_K2_BZ15BREWERSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__20140615_K2_BZ15BREWERSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T21:26:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:03:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Water"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcc1\"", "article_summary": "Without the technology or scale of big brewers, craft brewers use on average as much as twice the amount of water for every barrel of beer.\nMillerCoors\u2019 sustainability report shows the brewer since 2012 has reduced water use to 3.48 barrels of water per barrel of beer, or roughly 1 billion barrels of water.\nRahr & Sons Brewing Co., a craft brewer based in Fort Worth, Texas, produces about 22,000 barrels of beer per year.\nMillerCoors released a sustainability report Wednesday that shows it has cut its water use by 9.2 percent from 2012.\n\u201cWater is just critical to us,\u201d Kim Marotta, the Chicago-based company\u2019s sustainability chief, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview."}
