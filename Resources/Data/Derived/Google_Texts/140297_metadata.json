You lag behind women when it comes to getting health coverage, according to a recent U.S. Census report. Not only that, you tend to shy away from health screenings.\n\nAnd compared to women, you don\u2019t have a regular clinician to go to when you\u2019re sick or need medical advice. That\u2019s according to the Journal of American Medical Association.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019re not taking care of yourself. What gives?\n\n\u201cMen have, in general, this idea of strength and power and control,\" said Dr. Tom Walsh, a urologist and the director of the Men\u2019s Health Center at UW Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe idea of losing control or taking time out of one\u2019s busy day to actually see a doctor is part of a man\u2019 s paradigm,\u201d he said.\n\nWalsh isn\u2019t surprised with these findings. He said this pattern is also common in Europe and Australia. It holds across socioeconomic groups.\n\nHe thinks it\u2019s more than a time issue. Walsh said unlike men, women have been conditioned to see a doctor at an early age, starting in their teens.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re introduced to somebody who helps begin screening them for what used to be a very dangerous cancer \u2014 cervical cancer \u2014 so that it\u2019s very routine once women become in the post-pubertal arena where they would see a gynecologist \u2026 on a yearly basis for what was deemed to be an important screening.\u201d\n\nSo when men do see a doctor, Walsh said it\u2019s not usually to get screened, but for areas that impact their quality of life, like fertility and sexual health \u2014 things that the UW Men\u2019s Health Center focuses on.\n\nThat was part of the idea of creating the clinic to begin with. Once they\u2019re in the door, Walsh uses the opportunity to refer them to a primary-care person for the routine stuff.\n\nWalsh said there may be other reasons why men hesitate to seek care: it could be fear of bad news or a sense of resignation that doctors won\u2019t do anything. But here\u2019s something to consider: Men are more likely than women to have diabetes and high cholesterol. And men tend to die at a younger age.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Guys, we need to talk.
