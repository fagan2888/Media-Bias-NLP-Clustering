The show was an evening of fun and music, with Fallon\u2019s guests, the lovely and mega-selling musical artist, Taylor Swift, and HBO talk show host and comedian, John Oliver. The musical guest on the Tonight Show was one of the hottest bands around, Imagine Dragons. Also, later in the episode, Taylor Swift and Jimmy Fallon were in a skit together, called Jumbotron Dancers.\n\nJimmy Fallon welcomed the studio audience, who gave him a standing ovation. He said \u201cYou\u2019re at a hot show right now!\u201d He then joked about topics ripped from today\u2019s headlines in his monologue, such as the North Eastern states experiencing their roughest winter in decades. He said that \u201cSchools and Federal offices were shut down after receiving four inches of snow \u2014 or, as Boston residents put it, are you kidding me?\u201d\n\nFallon said that \u201cMichelle Obama has banned boxed macaroni and cheese from the White House \u2014 which was tough on Joe Biden, as then he couldn\u2019t make his wife any jewelry for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d He urged Hillary Clinton to pick Biden as her running mate, so that Biden could still be the butt of his jokes.\n\nThen, Jimmy Fallon joked about UFOs, aliens, and the possibility that Rick Scott was an alien. He also said that George Washington might have been the first president to have smoked weed, to help him deal with the pain of his false teeth. He called Washington the \u201cLil Wayne\u201d of presidents.\n\nThe Tonight Show house band, The Roots, played him to his desk, and Jimmy Fallon said it was the show\u2019s one year anniversary. He thanked the staff and crew and everybody who watched the show. Tomorrow, Kevin Bacon and Martin Short will be on. Tonight, Fallon announced that Taylor Swift will be on, and \u201cshe will be showing off her dancing skills.\u201d\n\nThen, he took a look at the Pros & Cons of Watching the Academy Awards. \u201cPro: The awards celebrate the most artistic and thought-provoking movies of the year. Con: In other words, movies you haven\u2019t seen. Pro: Whiplash was nominated for Best Picture. Con: Fifty Shades of Grey was nominated in the category of Best Whiplash. Pro: Robert Duvall was nominated for his role in The Judge. Con: Judge Ruth Ginsberg was nominated for her role in The Hangover.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Jimmy Fallon mentioned that the show was celebrating its one year anniversary. He said that there used to be a Ben & Jerry flavor named after the Late Show when he hosted it, called Late Night Snack. He said he will unveil a new Tonight Show Ben & Jerry ice cream, and the actual Ben & Jerry behind the brand were on the show. Fallon said about the new ice cream that \u201cOur ice cream is made with all Fair Trade ingredients.\u201d All Ben & Jerry ice cream is now made that way, Ben and Jerry said.\n\nThe name of the new ice cream was The Tonight Dough. It had peanut butter cookie dough and chocolate chip cookie dough in it, caramel, and other yummy ingredients. Jimmy Fallon gave everybody in the audience containers of the new ice cream, and said that Taylor Swift will be the first guest after a commercial break.\n\nBack from the break, Jimmy Fallon held up the latest issue of Vogue, which has Taylor Swift\u2019s picture on the cover, along with Carly Rae Jepsen. He said her album 1989 has sold over 6 million copies. When Swift came onstage, she hugged Fallon. Then, she wished him happy anniversary, and they talked about the SNL After Party. Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney played I Saw Her Standing There. Then, Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney both sang Swift\u2019s huge hit, Shake it Off. McCartney knew how to play it on his guitar, of course.\n\nTaylor Swift is the first artist, ever, to have three consecutive albums that have sold over a million copies each. Fallon said that now they were both \u201con the list of Beatles.\u201d Swift said her record label asked her if she would consider having both country albums and pop albums out. She said she was going to stick with pop songs, comparing it to \u201cchasing two rabbits at once \u2014 if you try to do that, you will end up losing both of them.\u201d\n\nThey then tried to draw pictures of each other without looking down at the paper. Swift drew a heart, also, so that \u201cNo matter how badly it looked, the heart would allow me to redeem myself.\u201d\n\nJimmy Fallon asked if she would be in a skit with him. After another commercial break, they were in a skit called Jumbotron Dancers.\n\nFallon said \u201cI was a little upset seeing you dancing at the Grammys.\u201d They talked back and forth, saying that they used to dance just with each other, in Jumbotron footage. Then, Fallon played a clip showcasing both of them dancing together. It was extremely cool! They even did the dance from the movie, Flash Dance, to the song, Maniac.\n\nJohn Oliver was the second guest on the Tonight Show. He has dealt with quite a few controversial topics already on his HBO talk show, Last Week Tonight, and last Sunday, he took on big tobacco companies, like Philip Morris International, and their instigating lawsuits against countries like Australia to do away with \u201cplain packaging\u201d laws.\n\nJohn Oliver wished Fallon a happy anniversary, and he said on Sunday, he kind of felt that nobody was watching him, as the SNL 40th Anniversary Special was airing. Fallon asked him about if he had been born in England, and if Oliver liked American comedy. Oliver said he was born in England, and he loved listening to American comedy albums, like those of Richard Pryor. He memorized some of the routines, and did a couple of lines from Pryor\u2019s \u201cWhy do black people never get bitten by snakes?\u201d routine.\n\nJimmy Fallon then wished John Oliver \u201cCongratulations,\u201d because HBO picked up Oliver\u2019s show for two more seasons. John Oliver said that he \u201cowed Jon Stewart everything \u2014 literally, everything.\u201d Fallon asked him who could possibly replace Stewart, and at first, Oliver said a \u201chologram Jon Stewart.\u201d Then, he suggested a combination of himself and Tupac, with his torso and the bottom half of his body being Tupac\u2019s.\n\nAfter another commercial break, Jimmy Fallon introduced the musical guests of the show, Imagine Dragons. The group performed the song Shots from their latest album Smoke + Mirrors. It sounded AMAZING, and it will likely be a big hit for Imagine Dragons. The electric guitarist and bassist did a fantastic job, and Jimmy Fallon said the album is available in stores right now.\n\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon celebrated the show\u2019s one year anniversary tonight, in a big way, with Fallon\u2019s very cool guests, Taylor Swift and John Oliver. Taylor and Fallon were even in a skit together, called Jumbotron Dancers. Then, to top off the night, Imagine Dragons, who are currently on tour, blasted the roof off of 30 Rock with the song, Shots.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nSources:\n\nNBC Universal Media Village\n\nImagine Dragons Tour Site\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "This Tuesday night, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon marked a special occasion, the first year anniversary of when Fallon took over the reins.
