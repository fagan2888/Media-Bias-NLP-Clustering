Bruce Rauner, who has given his campaign $6 million out of his own pocket, looks like he\u2019s going to get the chance on March 18 to take on Pat Quinn in the November election\u2014i.e. to take on Quinn and the Democratic party and the unions and trial lawyers, et al, who are not about to hand the statehouse to a man who calls himself a Republican (I think he\u2019s closer in philosophy to Rahm Emanuel or Mike Bloomberg than, say, Scott Walker or Rick Synder) and is crusading for term limits in Illinois.\n\nRauner, who charged that his three opponents have all taken union money, inveighed last night against \u201cgovernment unions \u2026 trial lawyers\u2026. [who] run Springfield; they bought it, they own it,\u201d and reported that he has almost enough signatures to put a proposed constitutional amendment on legislative term limits on the ballot. (He has pledged to limit himself to two terms.)\n\nMy gut tells me that this has become a Rauner/Kirk Dillard battle. Bill Brady (who lost to Quinn in 2010 after besting Dillard by 193 votes in the primary) and state treasurer Dan Rutherford (handicapped by a federal sexual harassment and political-work-on-state-time lawsuit, which will be impossible to refute before the primary, less than two weeks away) are effectively out of it. Watching their faces and body language last night makes me believe they know it.\n\nBrady had a few moments of feistiness\u2014comparing Rauner to the incarcerated Blago wasn\u2019t one of them\u2014and Rutherford was the most likeable, except that he has this cloud hanging over him that will drench any victory-march fantasy to which he might still cling.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of the highlights and lowlights of a long program, moderated by WMAQ-TV\u2019s 5\u2019s Carol Marin, and sponsored by WMAQ, David Axelrod\u2019s Institute of Politics, and the Harris School of Public Policy. The first hour was televised, an additional half hour followed, and then came a short \u201cpress availability\u201d at which only Dillard and Brady, both tired and testy, showed up.\n\nThe four stood beside each other at matching podiums for 90 minutes, rail-thin Rauner at the far left towering over the portly Dillard next to him. My takeaway from the concluding presser is that Dillard is so angry with Rauner that he could not quite bring himself to say the words that if Rauner were the party\u2019s nominee, Dillard would endorse him.\n\nRauner, Brady, and Dillard are enamored with Republican governors, Indiana\u2019s former governor Mitch Daniels chief among them. He\u2019s a \u201cpersonal role model\u201d for Rauner who said, \u201cI\u2019ve been studying with the great governors of America [which also include Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, and Michigan\u2019s Rick Synder] for the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nRutherford said pointedly that he has doesn\u2019t have the \u201cclout\u201d to study with governors, but instead learns from the needs of the citizens of Illinois with whom he interacts as state treasurer. \u201cI studied the people of Illinois, someone who has a mother in a nursing home\u201d\u2014take that Rauner, who has been slammed for his former private equity firm\u2019s ownership of an allegedly substandard nursing home company.\n\nDillard called Daniels \u201ctremendous,\u201d but said he\u2019s \u201ceclectic\u201d and quipped, \u201cI\u2019m Kirk Dillard but I copy ideas from other states that are good.\u201d Brady said he\u2019d take \u201cbits and pieces\u201d from each of the republican governors mentioned, and specified Jeb Bush on education policy and Bobby Jindal on economic development.\n\nDillard, who lives in Hinsdale, railed against the dominance in Illinois of Cook County politicians, noting \u201call four legislative leaders are from Cook County.\u201d Rauner was the only Cook County resident on stage\u2014Brady is from Bloomington and Rutherford from Chenoa\u2014so the dig was obviously aimed at the first-time candidate. Noting that he\u2019s from DuPage County, Dillard, who has a strong Chicago accent, said, \u201cJust outside of Cook County there\u2019s a place called Illinois.\u201d\n\nTo news that Rauner has had breakfast with Mike Madigan and has met with John Cullerton, Bill Brady said he wouldn\u2019t do that. \u201cI\u2019m a reliable Republican,\u201d he explained. Rutherford volunteered that Mike Madigan had come to his birthday party but had not brought along a present.\n\nIn hitting Quinn for running \u201cone of the most hostile states for business in America; \u2026[a man] who thinks government spending and government programs are creating jobs,\u201d Rauner vowed to move to Springfield and take no salary and no pension and to \u201cfly around the nation\u2026 recruiting companies to come to Illinois after we change our regulatory burden and our tax burden.\u201d (He didn\u2019t say if he\u2019d be using a private plane or a state plane.)\n\nOn relations with Rahm Emanuel, Rauner\u2019s opponents wanted to portray the two as BFFs. \u201cI did not make Mayor Emanuel a wealthy man by probably giving him $16 million,\u201d said Dillard. \u201cThat being said, I have a good professional relationship with Mayor Emanuel.\u201d Dillard vowed that he\u2019d repeat what he did as Gov. Jim Edgar\u2019s chief of staff when dealing with then-Mayor Rich Daley: \u201cI\u2019ll be able to tell Rahm Emanuel no.\u201d\n\nRauner countered that he and Rahm \u201cdisagree on most things,\u201d mentioning that he thinks that \u201cObamacare\u201d will \u201cdwarf our pension problem as a financial disaster\u201d for Illinois. Rauner said he\u2019d work with Rahm on pension reform, but all four said they\u2019d be opposed to helping Rahm delay a $600 million increase in police and fire pensions. Rutherford said he and Rahm are \u201cconversant,\u201d but it\u2019s not like they meet for dinner at Chicago Cut.\n\nThe Blago reference? \u201cThe more I hear Bruce Rauner speak,\u201d Bill Brady said, \u201cthe more he sounds like Rod Blagojevich,\u201d adding that the next governor needs to be \u201cdecisive,\u201d not \u201cdivisive,\u201d but neglecting to mention examples of Rauner\u2019s failure to be decisive. Brady also charged Rauner with being \u201ctied to more felons that are in jail than I think Rod Blagojevich,\u201d primarily a reference to Stuart Levine. (Rauner\u2019s firm paid Levine, who sat on the Teachers Retirement System board, a monthly $25,000 consulting fee.) Rauner, whose firm had state pension business, has denied knowing Levine.\n\nDillard and Brady accused Rauner, who raised $8 million beyond his own $6 million contribution, far more than raised by the others combined, of trying to buy the race. Dillard called that fact \u201cobscene.\u201d\n\nAll four did agree on issues such as restoring the death penalty in Illinois for the most serious crimes, and they also agreed on the virtues of the concealed carry law\u2014the Second Amendment seemed unthreatened on that stage. They also all said that they would host same-sex couples in the governor\u2019s mansion, in which all would presumably spend more time than did Blago or Quinn.\n\nOn the subject of abortion, Brady, Dillard and Rutherford said they\u2019re pro-life, but that governors can\u2019t do anything about a federal ruling (i.e. Roe v Wade). Rauner gave the most nuanced answer; the one that should play best in a general election: \u201cI believe abortion is a tragedy. It\u2019s a sad event I wish didn\u2019t occur.\u201d He said that abortion is a decision that should be between a woman, her family and her doctor.\n\nDillard, whose tone was definitely the most bitter, called Rauner \u201cunelectable.\u201d Unfortunately for Dillard, that might be true in the general election, but not in the primary.\n\nPostscript: Dillard, who had already won the endorsement of the Illinois Education Association and the Illinois Federation of Teachers, today added the endorsement of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31. Expect an ad from Rauner turning that endorsement of Dillard into an indictment of Dillard.\n\nHold on to your ear muffs, the race is finally heating up.\n\nCarol Felsenthal is a lifelong Chicagoan and self-proclaimed political junkie.
