Marco Rubio in particular, have followed him there.\n\nRelated: At CPAC, Derision and Disappointment as Trump Bails Out\n\nIn an interview at CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) outside Washington on Friday, Republican Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert said, \u201cIt\u2019s just tragic that anybody would enter a Republican race and devolve the race, the debate and the party to the level it\u2019s now devolved. It\u2019s just tragic.\u201d\n\nOthers who share Gohmert\u2019s disgust, like Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse have made it clear that they are so appalled by Trump that they will not support him as the GOP nominee, and many conservative pundits and activists have said the same thing.\n\nOn Thursday, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney uncorked a blistering attack on Trump, delivering a speech that denounced him as a fraud and a crook, and all but urged the other remaining candidates to collude against the frontrunner in order to force a contested Republican Convention.\n\nBut not everyone in the GOP sees the utility of breaking with the Party over Trump.\n\nRelated: Is Anyone Running This Show? Priebus Leads from Behind as Trump Bolts Ahead\n\nGrover Norquist, the anti-tax activist and founder of Americans for Tax Reform, said he doesn\u2019t support a specific candidate for the nomination. \u201cEverybody\u2019s made a commitment on taxes, everybody\u2019s got a tax plan that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d he said, so he is remaining neutral.\n\nHowever, he said, he\u2019s dubious about the sudden attacks on Trump and promises to walk away from the Party if he is the nominee \u2013 especially coming so late in the game.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the odd thing about that,\u201d he said in an interview at CPAC. \u201cIf you felt very strongly about this, about who the nominee should be or who it shouldn\u2019t be, where were you in the last year? What were you doing? This is almost like you are putting down a marker, saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be held responsible for this, or something.\u201d\n\nThere is a precedent for the GOP establishment working to undermine an insurgent candidate, he noted, and it didn\u2019t end well for the Party.\n\nRelated: For Trump, Last Night\u2019s Debate Was Another Episode of Survivor\n\n\u201cThose who read books, or are old enough to remember, remember that it was the Rockefeller Republicans, it was the Republican governors of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who stabbed [Barry] Goldwater in the back by going, \u2018oh we\u2019re not voting for him.\u2019\u201d\n\nGoldwater, the Republican nominee in 1964, lost in a landslide to the incumbent Lyndon Johnson, and many veteran Republican lawmakers went down with him, further weakening an already feeble minority in the House of Representatives.\n\nNorquist says that he sees parallels in recent threats by elements of the GOP to abandon the Party over Trump.\n\nIn the 1960s, he said, \u201cEastern establishment Republicans \u2013 they were the ones always threatening to bolt. If you are going to have a strong party, you can\u2019t have it threaten to fall apart all the time. So, now that the modern conservative movement and the Reagan Republican Party are really 95 percent overlap, why in the world would you ever want to talk about walking out the door?\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Obamacare Is So Important to Hillary Clinton\n\nAll it does, he said, is empower other groups to behave in a similar fashion.\n\n\u201cWhen you are the majority party, why would you ever get into this \u2018We\u2019ll quit, we\u2019ll leave?\u2019 You have the same problem in the House or the Senate saying we\u2019re not voting for this because it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d he said.\n\nIf lawmakers and others have a problem with Trump, he said, they ought to be out on the trail with a candidate they do support, making the case for him.\n\n\u201cIf you have strong feelings, go out there and work,\u201d he said. \u201cThreats to walk out the door are not constructive, and I don\u2019t think they will have a serious impact\u2026it\u2019s whining; it\u2019s not work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid threats from some GOP lawmakers that they would abandon the party over Donald Trump, anti-tax activist Grover Norquist said threats to walk out the door are not constructive. \u201cIt\u2019s whining; it\u2019s not work.\u201d", "title": "Norquist Accuses Trump Naysayers of \u2018Whining, not Working\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/06/Norquist-Accuses-Trump-Naysayers-Whining-not-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11202012_norquist_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/06/Norquist-Accuses-Trump-Naysayers-Whining-not-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11202012_norquist_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Amid threats from some GOP lawmakers that they would abandon the party over Donald Trump, anti-tax activist Grover Norquist said threats to walk out the door are not constructive. \u201cIt\u2019s whining; it\u2019s not work.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Norquist says that he sees parallels in recent threats by elements of the GOP to abandon the Party over Trump.\nBut not everyone in the GOP sees the utility of breaking with the Party over Trump.\n\u201cThreats to walk out the door are not constructive, and I don\u2019t think they will have a serious impact\u2026it\u2019s whining; it\u2019s not work.\u201d\nTrump has arguably dragged down the discourse in the debate to new lows, and other candidates, Florida Sen.
