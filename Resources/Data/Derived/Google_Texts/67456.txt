Panama City Beach, FL---High School baseball district tournaments start Monday, yet and Arnold coach Greg Gumm will lead his Marlins into the postseason Tuesday.

The first year coach from Kentucky has taken a team that hit below the "Mendoza Line" last year, registering close to a .175 batting average, and has earned them a first round bye in the 5A-1 field.

The difference: the quick bond developed between Gumm and his elder players.

"Anytime you bring a new coach into a program, the kids have to buy in to what's going on," said Gumm. "And I think our kids have done a really good job of accepting everything we've asked them to."

"It was kind of tough at the beginning, but we've learned how to catch on to how he coaches and what not," said senior first baseman and pitcher Takoda Carmichael. "And he's a really good coach. He gets us to do everything right, represent Arnold in the right way."

"Obviously this year, with the amount of seniors we have, we were going to have a good team," said senior third baseman and pitcher Kyle Cunningham. "But I think we've been playing a lot more solid, a lot more together as a team, and that's made a huge difference."

The second seed Marlins will face the winner of the (3) Bay- (6) Rutherford matchup. Top ranked Mosley meets either (4) Gulf Breeze or host (5) Choctaw.
