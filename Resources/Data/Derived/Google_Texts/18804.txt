Although most of his viewers were probably on board with Jimmy Kimmel’s view on vaccinations, some anti-vaxxers got a little heated and happily took to social media to criticize the funny man, fueling an already hilarious fire.

“If you genuinely believe that 99 percent of the doctors in this country are dishonest, then you need to see a doctor, ironically,” Kimmel declared on his late night show following some pretty graphic backlash for putting out a humorous yet appropriately blunt pro-vaccine PSA last week, which was put together with the help of real doctors.

According to Kimmel, this is a hot-button topic that really just shouldn’t be and doesn’t even deserve a look at both sides of the situation. Like if someone said eating pancakes makes you gay, he pointed out, that’s just wrong and doesn’t require the need for debate.

Even if the vaccination hoopla isn’t really worth debating, the show is clearly having a good time poking fun. By reaching out to real people on the street, Jack and Becky, “The Anti-Vaccination Crusaders,” explored responses to the proposition that maybe kids themselves should have a choice in the matter – especially because those who were surveyed gave a resounding “No” when asked if they’d like to be injected with a needle.

Here’s the original PSA and Kimmel’s follow-up below.
