The German and French leaders, who presided in the Belarus capital, leapt into 11th hour action when Washington disclosed it was planning to arm Kiev against rebellious regions in the east. As of this weekend, the deal is holding and the Obama administration has backed off.\n\nBut this is a long way from over. Apart from the many ambiguities in the Minsk II Protocol requiring clarification, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s revived bailout plan, announced simultaneously as part of a plainly concerted effort, has barnacles all over its hull.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2014If Putin Really Wanted Ukraine, He Could Take It\n\nBailouts are the IMF\u2019s business, but this one is probably unprecedented, given Christine Lagarde, the fund\u2019s director, has just agreed to extend a $17.5 billion lifeline to a government fighting a crippling civil war. Over the decade of its Ukraine program, the IMF\u2019s rescue will require $40 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s problematic. At the very least, negotiating the terms by which foreigners holding Ukrainian debt are satisfied will take many months, and it\u2019s a question whether Kiev can afford such a delay in the IMF\u2019s disbursements. One of these creditors is Russia.\n\nJust as Chancellor Merkel and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande have a long things-to-do list in getting Minsk II implemented on the ground, so does Lagarde:\n\n\u2022 Lagarde asserted as recently as January that as a matter of standing policy the fund can\u2019t lend to nations at war. Unless she wants to insert the IMF into Ukrainian politics by taking Kiev\u2019s side, this means all fighting has to stop definitively. \u201cThe great question,\u201d Michael Hudson, an economics professor at the University of Missouri said in a recent interview, \u201cIs thus when the IMF will even begin to release the loan it has been discussing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Merkel Defends Ukraine Arms Stance in Face of US Criticism\n\n\u2022 Neither can the fund lend to insolvent nations, according to its articles of agreement. Have you looked lately? Ukraine\u2019s insolvent by any measure short of a formal declaration.\n\n\u2022 Government and multilateral pledges are significant parts of the plan. The EU is in for $2.2 billion and the US for $2 billion. Germany, Japan, and others are committed to giving $1 billion more. Institutions including the\n\nWorld Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development and the European Investment Bank are in for $4 billion. This is a crowded room. Given Ukraine\u2019s political, military and economic fragility, by what criteria will all these decide to deliver?\n\n\u2022 Foreign bondholders have to get a haircut, and Natalie Jaresko, Ukraine\u2019s new finance minister, told Bloomberg by e-mail Friday it may come to $15 billion. This kind of private-sector involvement in an IMF program has no precedent and negotiating terms will take time. Problem No. 1: Bondholders\u2019 cooperation is a condition of IMF disbursements. No. 2: Kiev proposes exactly the terms\u2014extended maturities, reduced interest rates, a possible write-down\u2014that the EU now insists Greece cannot be permitted.\n\n\u2022 Of Ukraine\u2019s $16 billion in outstanding bonds, the Russian sovereign wealth fund holds $3 billion. This is tricky for evident reasons. Two months ago Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, the German finance minister, asked his Russian counterpart (a little shamelessly under the circumstances) to restructure this debt, and Moscow has so far declined. It may change its mind now to keep Minsk II afloat, but it could also scuttle the entire program if it so chose. And since Kiev must treat all creditors equally, if Moscow wants a better deal all others can demand the same.\n\nRelated: Germany Warms of High Price of Violating Ceasefire\n\n\u2022 More broadly, the IMF\u2019s conditionality is typically stringent, and the risks of this degree of austerity are amply demonstrated across Europe. Greece is now in depression because it simply had too little resilience to withstand the discipline, and Ukraine\u2019s economy is in far worse condition than Greece\u2019s at its most dire.\n\n\u2022 Neither can social and political risks be ignored. Ukraine is about to submit to the \u201cshock therapy\u201d applied in Eastern Europe after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. But Ukrainians are a more highly politicized population 20 years on. To boot, Kiev remains unhealthily dependent on far-right extremists\u2014in government and in the war\u2014and some German ministerial officials already worry this could create an opening for these elements to take over.\n\nSouffl\u00e9s rise and thrill those assembled as they come out of the kitchen. Minsk II and Lagarde\u2019s Ukraine program are a pair of them. Collapses are a danger, though, as any chef knows. They come quickly, too, and disappoint the diners.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Could last week\u2019s", "title": "Saving Ukraine: Why the IMF\u2019s Bailout May not Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/02/16/Saving-Ukraine-Why-IMF-s-Bailout-May-not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Ukraine_USA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/02/16/Saving-Ukraine-Why-IMF-s-Bailout-May-not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Ukraine_USA.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Could last week\u2019s", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d1a\"", "article_summary": "Over the decade of its Ukraine program, the IMF\u2019s rescue will require $40 billion.\nMinsk II and Lagarde\u2019s Ukraine program are a pair of them.\nThis kind of private-sector involvement in an IMF program has no precedent and negotiating terms will take time.\nApart from the many ambiguities in the Minsk II Protocol requiring clarification, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s revived bailout plan, announced simultaneously as part of a plainly concerted effort, has barnacles all over its hull.\nCould last week\u2019s ceasefire in Ukraine, announced in Minsk Thursday after 17 hours of negotiation, have been any more dramatic?"}
