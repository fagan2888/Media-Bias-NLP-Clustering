In the past two days, he\u2019s taken to Twitter to trash-talk b\u00eate noire Megyn Kelly of Fox and Sen.

He is his own spokesman, his own opposition-research director and his own campaign hitman.\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s so entertaining, and it\u2019s also why most political professionals have found themselves aghast and agog at his rise. Trump is breaking decades of hard-learned lessons about how to minimize risk and maximize effectiveness. He is playing the game in an entirely new way.\n\nCandidates struggle to be consistent, or to explain their changes of opinion if they find themselves making those changes. Not Trump, who was able in less than one minute earlier this week to say he supports a flat tax \u2014 in which everyone in the country pays the same rate \u2014 and wants rich people to pay at a higher rate.\n\nAt any other time in American history, such an answer would make him a laughing-stock. Not Trump. He\u2019s laughing all the way to the polling bank.\n\nSo how is this happening? Many say it\u2019s because of his hard line on immigration. Trump believes this. Others, Bill Kristol in particular, have observed cleverly that Trump is the only unrestrained nationalist in the race.\n\nI think there\u2019s something else at play here. Trump has basically declared himself the anti-Obama, an all-American (he still believes Obama was born in Kenya) who has built things and run things and hasn\u2019t just been an egghead and government guy.\n\nIn fact, what Trump is promising is simply a different form of Obamaism, and that is what perversely makes him attractive to so many people.\n\nObama\u2019s astonishing second-term efforts to do an end-run around the constitutional limits of the presidency have given Trump\u2019s approach peculiar resonance with certain conservatives.\n\nThey\u2019ve watched in horrified amazement as Obama has single-handedly postponed parts of the Affordable Care Act; unilaterally installed people in federal jobs (at the National Labor Relations Board) that require congressional consent and announced in November 2014 that he\u2019d cease enforcing certain immigration laws and effectively grant protection to 5 million so-called \u201cdreamers\u201d \u2014 when it is his constitutional obligation to enforce existing laws passed by Congress.\n\nTrump is, in effect, promising to be a right-wing Obama, to run roughshod over the rules to fix things Obama and other politicians have broken.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why this is seductive.\n\nConservatives and others who dislike Obama see him acting with impunity. They believe the media cover for him. They think Republicans in Congress are too weak to challenge him. And so he gets whatever he wants.\n\nThey\u2019re largely right about the media, but they\u2019re wrong that he gets away with whatever he pleases.\n\nHis immigration scheme was basically thrown in a garbage can by a district judge in Texas only three months after his speech, and his appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n\nRight-wing Obamaism is just as dangerous. The American system is designed to restrain our politicians, not to give them a free hand.\n\nTrump is uninterested in such niceties, and he is canny enough to declare that anyone who disagrees with him is simply too weak or cowardly or too controlled by \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d to see that his strongman tactics are the only way to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\nBut the answer to Obamaism isn\u2019t more Obamaism. The answer to a president who acts like a strongman isn\u2019t another strongman.
