Michael Pearson, its chairman and chief executive, was on medical leave and that a team of executives would run the company while he was out.\n\nValeant confirmed last week that Mr. Pearson had been hospitalized and was being treated for a severe case of pneumonia.\n\nMr. Pearson is known for an aggressive strategy that has helped propel Valeant into the ranks of the world\u2019s largest drug companies in less than a decade. But this strategy has also thrust some of the company\u2019s more controversial tactics into the spotlight. The drug maker\u2019s action of acquiring old drugs and sharply raising their prices, often by several hundred percent, has attracted widespread condemnation.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price fell more than 10 percent on Monday after the news, a sign that investors link Valeant\u2019s growth to Mr. Pearson, according to David Steinberg, an analyst with Jefferies. \u201cMichael Pearson is most closely associated with his company than probably any other pharmaceutical executive,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nValeant\u2019s shares have fallen more than 50 percent since their 52-week high in early August.\n\nValeant also faced scrutiny over its relationship with Philidor Rx Services, a mail-order pharmacy that dispensed some of Valeant\u2019s expensive dermatology drugs and handled getting them reimbursed by insurance companies. Valeant severed its ties to Philidor in October, after questions were raised about the practices.\n\nValeant did not name an interim chief. Instead, its board created an \u201coffice of the chief executive,\u201d which will include Robert Chai-Onn, its executive vice president and general counsel; Dr. Ari Kellen, executive vice president and company group chairman; and Robert Rosiello, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Valeant also created a board committee to oversee and support the new office of the chief executive.\n\nRelated Valeant Coverage\n\n\u201cThe committee will be working closely with the entire management team to ensure that the company continues to operate normally while Mike focuses on his health,\u201d Robert A. Ingram, Valeant\u2019s lead independent director, said in a statement. \u201cI am confident that with the vast industry and business knowledge from the management team and the board of directors, we will manage through this period.\u201d\n\nAntibiotics can help patients suffering from a typical case of bacterial pneumonia feel better within a week or two, according to Dr. Alan Glaseroff, the director of coordinated care at Stanford Health Care. But recovering completely could take four to six weeks, he said. Recovery times can vary widely, however, depending on the age and immune system of the patient, he said.\n\nMr. Pearson, 56, became chief executive in 2008 and has spearheaded the enormous growth that has defined Valeant since. A 2010 merger with Biovail, one of Canada\u2019s largest drug makers, effectively put Valeant on the map and preceded a string of aggressive acquisitions that would help Valeant\u2019s stock price to skyrocket over the next five years.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been sort of credited with creating a vision for the company and a set of guiding principles in terms of how they look at deals,\u201d said Irina Koffler, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities USA.\n\nThat vision included moving toward elective spending like cosmetic dermatology and consumer products, as the Affordable Care Act and other factors were helping to reshape the insurance landscape. Valeant agreed to acquire Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, the maker of Restylane and other injectables, in 2012. The following year, it made a deal to buy Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest makers of contact lenses, solutions and other eye-care products.\n\nBut Valeant\u2019s tactics have also come under fire. Last year, Mr. Pearson took the highly unusual step of partnering with the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman in a hostile takeover bid for Allergan, the maker of Botox.\n\nWhile the monthslong pursuit ultimately ended unsuccessfully, the partnership has had lingering implications: In anticipation of the deal, Valeant sold off a line of aesthetic products, including Restylane, to avoid overlapping with Allergan\u2019s products. And both Valeant and Mr. Ackman\u2019s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, face an insider trading lawsuit related to an investment Mr. Ackman made in Allergan before the takeover bid was publicly disclosed. Representatives from Valeant and Pershing Square declined to comment on the suit.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151228091414, "twitter": {"description": "The company said a team of executives would run the company in place of J.
