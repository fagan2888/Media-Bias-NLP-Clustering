Upon being released from the ER, Haddock had to wait three painfully long days before doctors at the pediatric care unit at the Arnold Palmer Hospital were able to determine the extent of Eli\u2019s injuries. Finally, she received news that no parent wishes to hear:\n\n\u201cHis injuries are extensive. \u2026 If he pulls through this, he likely will not have much of a life. He will probably not be able to walk, talk, or show emotion\u2026\u201d\n\nBy the time Haddock arrived back at the hospital, a nurse informed her that Eli had drank seven bottles of breast milk she had been storing in the PICU and that he was still hungry. Haddock explained that she never asked for any miracles regarding her son\u2019s health, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of hope for Eli\u2019s future. For the next five years, she would see Eli through the arduous steps of recovering from his injuries as a single parent.\n\nFive years after the accident that changed Haddock\u2019s life \u2013 and Eli\u2019s just 14 weeks after it started \u2013 she was able to remarry with her new husband Ted, who decided to adopt Eli without hesitation. At 10 years old, Eli has far and away surpassed the expectations of his initial diagnosis. Knowing full well that Eli\u2019s success was the result of tireless efforts by doctors, nurses, and other medical staff, Haddock knew she had a lot of people to thank. So that\u2019s exactly what she did.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "thank, you, project, mother, finds, each, and, every, person, who, helped, save, her, sons, life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kellie Haddock tracked down everyone involved with saving her son's life simply to say \"thank you.\"", "title": "Mother Finds Each Person Who Helped Save Her Son's Life To Say 'Thank You' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/thank-you-project-mother-finds-each-and-every-person-who-helped-save-her-sons-life-314098", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/12/thank-you-project.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kellie Haddock tracked down everyone involved with saving her son's life simply to say \"thank you.\"", "title": "Mother Finds Each Person Who Helped Save Her Son's Life To Say 'Thank You' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/thank-you-project-mother-finds-each-and-every-person-who-helped-save-her-sons-life-314098", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/12/thank-you-project.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/12/thank-you-project.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-12T12:04:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-12T12:04:49-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kellie Haddock tracked down everyone involved with saving her son's life simply to say \"thank you.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecfb\"", "article_summary": "Haddock explained that she never asked for any miracles regarding her son\u2019s health, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of hope for Eli\u2019s future.\nFor the next five years, she would see Eli through the arduous steps of recovering from his injuries as a single parent.\n\u2026 If he pulls through this, he likely will not have much of a life.\nKnowing full well that Eli\u2019s success was the result of tireless efforts by doctors, nurses, and other medical staff, Haddock knew she had a lot of people to thank.\nAt 10 years old, Eli has far and away surpassed the expectations of his initial diagnosis."}
