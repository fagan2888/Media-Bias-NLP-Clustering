The annual Cowtown Marathon and the 50K Ultra Marathon that were set for Sunday have been cancelled, Fort Worth police said.

Event organizers determined that only the course for the half marathon will be ready for the 8 a.m. start from the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth. The full and ultra marathons rely on secondary streets in shaded neighborhoods and the Trinity trail, which won’t be passable for runners by race time, police said.

Those who were planning to run the other marathons are invited to join the half and do not need to change their bib or registration, police said.

The expo open and packet pick up will be held Saturday from 1 to 6 p.m. and at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday.

On Friday, organizers canceled Saturday’s events, which included the 10K and 5K races.

“The safety of Cowtown runners, volunteers and spectators is our top priority,” said Heidi Swartz, Cowtown executive director, in a statement. “The Texas weather is challenging all of us this weekend. We are so grateful to the thousands of runners, volunteers, supporters and local officials who regularly participate in our event. Their dedication, patience and flexibility in times like these are invaluable.”

In 2013, the MetroPCS Dallas Marathon was cancelled because of the December ice storm that blanketed the area.
