A judge’s decision that exotic dancers at a New York City strip club are protected by labor laws is one more indication that the women deserve at least a minimum wage, a lawyer for dancers who filed a similar suit against a Grand Junction club said Wednesday.

“Many clubs nationally have tried to get away with not paying the dancers and it’s flat out wrong and it’s illegal. Courts throughout the country are consistently finding that dancers need to be paid for the work they do and appropriately classified as employees,” said Mari Newman, a lawyer handling the case for the Grand Junction dancers.

The ruling came Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit brought by current and former dancers at Rick’s Cabaret in midtown Manhattan.

The lawsuit charged that the strippers were denied wages and required to pay a variety of fees to the club.

The lawsuit mirrors one now in U.S. District Court in Denver filed by dancers at Fantasy Gentlemen’s Club in Grand Junction.

A decision in favor of dancers outside Colorado would have little impact on the Grand Junction suit, though judges handling similar cases could weigh a ruling as they consider a case, said Karen Steinhauser, a former prosecutor who is now in private practice and teaches at the University of Denver.

She is not involved in the Grand Junction case.

The owner of the Fantasy, Kevin Eardley, said he knows of similar rulings in favor of dancers in other states.

“They seem to be coming up all the time. If we need to restructure we can put them on as employees. That can be done and we can make our money back in other ways,” he said Wednesday.

Eardley has not yet hired a lawyer to handle the case, filed on July 30.

The dancers at Fantasy Gentlemen’s Club aren’t paid anything by the club. Instead, they must pay to work there, according to the suit filed by four of the club dancers, Jessica Mason, Michelle Cross, Allison Stebbing and Jamie Tencza.
