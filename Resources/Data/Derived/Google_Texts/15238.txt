But while entrepreneurship and small business were mentioned frequently, not all advocates on Main Street were in agreement with what the president had to say.



"Small businesses have been loudly and clearly opposed to many of the very policies he featured in his speech this evening, including the health-care law, his energy regulations and mandatorily higher labor costs," said Dan Danner, president and CEO of the conservative National Federation of Independent Business.

Obama did tout his landmark Affordable Care Act and its ability to provide health insurance for workers who lose their jobs or choose to take the leap into entrepreneurship. For the nonpartisan National Small Business Association, the comments fell flat.

"Our last health-care survey in November 2015 showed the health-care problem is far from fixed for small businesses, with 90 percent seeing increases. One in five had premium increases of 20 percent or more â€” these costs aren't coming down," said Molly Day, vice president of public affairs for the group.

It's something franchisee Dave Gronewoller, who has nine Golden Corral franchises across the Carolinas and Florida, has seen firsthand.

"For the first time ever, I had to charge some of my employees part of their insurance premiums," Gronewoller said. "Our premiums went up 101 percent, while the health of our individuals has gone up every year. For 20 years, our employees never paid a dime for it.
