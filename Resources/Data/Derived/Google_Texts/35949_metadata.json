And in a sense, he delivered a rejoinder to Trump\u2019s views on global warming on Monday with the release of a 300-page report, \u201cThe Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment.\u201d\n\nThe exhaustive study, which was reviewed by the National Academies of Science, adds to a body of compelling evidence that if left unchecked, climate change poses a devastating threat to public health in the coming decades -- especially deaths among the poor, children and the elderly from extreme heat, insect-borne diseases and asthma.\n\nThe report, prepared by federal agencies and White House advisers over the past three years, cautions that as greenhouse gases continue to alter the climate, \u201cthe risks to human health will grow\u2026.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Warns of Costly Public Health Crisis Spurred by Climate Change\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about glaciers and polar bears. It\u2019s about the health of our family and our kids,\u201d said Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in an article in The Washington Post.\n\nThe release of the report coincides with National Public Health Week and is the latest in a series of administration pronouncements on the long-term costs of global warming to the economy, public health and coastal areas and natural resources. Obama has made combating global warming one of his signature domestic and foreign policy initiatives.\n\nThe president\u2019s major proposal for reducing industrial carbon emission, the so-called Clean Power Plan, has been challenged in court by a number of states. The plan constitutes the heart of the administration\u2019s commitment to a global climate change strategy that was worked out by world leaders in Paris late last year.\n\nWhile the new White House report is far ranging, here are seven of its major findings regarding the long-term public health risks of climate change:\n\nRelated: Obama and Critics Battle Over Climate Change Costs\n\nThe number of premature deaths will rise from thousands to tens of thousands annually because of extreme summer heat. According to one estimate using 1990 mortality levels in 200 U.S. cities as the baseline, there will be an additional 11,000 heat-related deaths during the summer of 2030 and 27,000 more deaths in 2100. Air pollution and airborne allergens will lead to a sharp increase in allergies and asthma. \u201cFuture ozone-related human health impacts attributable to climate change are projected to lead to hundreds to thousands of premature deaths, hospitalizations, and cases of acute respiratory illnesses each year in the United State by 2030, including increases in asthma episodes and other adverse respiratory effects in children,\u201d the report stated. We can expect to see an earlier annual onset of Lyme disease cases in the eastern U.S because of warmer winter and spring temperatures. Already climate change is having an effect. The number of reported cases of Lyme disease and their distribution increased in the Northeast and Upper Midwest between 2001 and 2014. Unseasonably warm weather will increase the exposure of food and crops to certain pathogens and toxins that can threaten the food supply. The combination of rising temperatures and flooding will lead to the increased likelihood of food contamination and human exposure to pathogens and toxins.\n\nRelated: Cities Face Costly Projects to Cope with Climate Change", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump frequently scoffs at President Obama", "title": "The Climate Change Crisis Trump Refuses to Acknowledge", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Climate-Change-Crisis-Trump-Refuses-Acknowledge", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09182013_Ice_Floes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/06/Climate-Change-Crisis-Trump-Refuses-Acknowledge", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09182013_Ice_Floes.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump frequently scoffs at President Obama", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI am not a believer in climate change,\u201d he said last fall.\nThe plan constitutes the heart of the administration\u2019s commitment to a global climate change strategy that was worked out by world leaders in Paris late last year.\nRelated: Cities Face Costly Projects to Cope with Climate Change\nAlready climate change is having an effect.\nRelated: Obama: This May Be \u2018The Last Generation\u2019 That Can Stop Climate ChangeTrump, a skeptic about climate change, says he\u2019s more concerned about saving jobs in industry than aggressively combating industrial emissions to reduce global warming."}
