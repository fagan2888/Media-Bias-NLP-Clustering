He ran for governor in 2006 and lost to Beebe, who was prohibited by term limits from running for a third term this year. Hutchinson ran this year on a platform that included pledges to strengthen vocational education, require the teaching of computer science in every high school and cut state income taxes.\n\n\u201cThis election is about a new day in Arkansas,\u201d Hutchinson said in a victory speech at a watch party in Little Rock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a new responsibility for the Republican Party that\u2019s had a great victory tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we earn the respect and support of the people of Arkansas by governing well, by working hard and acting honorably.\u201d\n\nIn a concession speech in Little Rock, Ross urged Arkansans to work together for the state\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThere is much more that unites us than divides us, and we are stronger as a state when every person has a voice and every one of you is heard. So tonight I call upon all Arkansans, no matter your political party or philosophy, to set aside our political differences and put Arkansas first,\u201d he said.\n\nHutchinson, 63, of Rogers, is a former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, 3rd District congressman, administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and undersecretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nRoss, 53, of Little Rock, is a former Nevada Quorum Court member, state senator and 4th District congressman. He also had a plan to cut state income taxes and pledged to make pre-kindergarten accessible to every 4-year-old in the state and fight to protect the private option, Arkansas\u2019 version of Medicaid expansion.\n\nAs of 10:45 p.m., Hutchinson had 55 percent of the vote, Ross had 42 percent, Libertarian Frank Gilbert had 2 percent and Green Party candidate Joshua Drake had 1 percent, according to unofficial and incomplete election results from the secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association spent $6.2 million on 10 different television ads in the race. The RGA worked to tie Ross to President Barack Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., although Ross was part of the conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition in the House and voted against Obama\u2019s signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRGA Chairman and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday, \u201cThe promise of a more competitive, prosperous Arkansas under a strong, principled leader is what drove Asa Hutchinson to a much-deserved victory in this race. Hutchinson will make an excellent governor and work hard to make Arkansas prosperous.\u201d\n\nRaces for all seven of Arkansas\u2019 constitutional offices were on Tuesday\u2019s ballot. Early returns suggested a Republican sweep.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor\u2019s race, Republican U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin of Little Rock defeated Democrat John Burkhalter of Little Rock to win the office that has been vacant since Feb. 1.\n\nRepublican Mark Darr resigned as lieutenant governor after being fined $11,000 for misuse of campaign contributions and public funds.\n\nBy 10:45 p.m., Griffin had 56 percent of the vote, Burkhalter had 40 percent and Libertarian Christopher Olson had 4 percent.\n\nIn the attorney general\u2019s race, Republican Leslie Rutledge of Little Rock defeated state Rep. Nate Steel, D-Nashville. Term limits prohibited Democratic Attorney General Dustin McDaniel from seeking a third term.\n\nAs of 10:45 p.m., Rutledge had 51 percent of the vote, Steel had 44 percent and Libertarian Aaron Cash had 5 percent.\n\nRepublican incumbent Secretary of State Mark Martin of Prairie Grove won re-election, defeating Democrat Susan Inman of Little Rock.\n\nMartin had 60 percent of the vote, Inman had 36 percent and Libertarian Jacob Holloway had 4 percent as of 10:45 p.m.\n\nRepublican Saline County Clerk Dennis Milligan of Benton won the state treasurer\u2019s race, defeating Democrat Karen Sealy Garcia of Hot Springs.\n\nBy 10:45 p.m., Milligan had 56 percent of the vote, Garcia had 38 percent and Libertarian Chris Hayes had 6 percent.\n\nDemocrat Martha Shoffner resigned as treasurer in May 2013 after her arrest on public corruption charges. Shoffner was convicted on federal charges of extortion and bribery in March and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Andrea Lea, R-Russellville, won the state auditor\u2019s race, defeating Democrat Regina Hampton of Little Rock.\n\nAs of 10:45 p.m., Lea had 56 percent of the vote, Hampton had 38 percent and Libertarian Brian Leach had 5 percent. Auditor Charlie Daniels is retiring.\n\nRepublican Land Commissioner John Thurston of Little Rock won re-election, defeating Democrat Mark Robertson of Little Rock.\n\nThurston had 56 percent of the vote, Robertson had 38 percent and Libertarian Elvis D. Presley had 6 percent by 10:45 p.m. The percentages add up to more than 100 because of rounding.\n\nThe party that controls a majority of Arkansas\u2019 constitutional offices is considered the state\u2019s majority party and gets two of the three seats on each of the state\u2019s 75 county election commissions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Republican Asa Hutchinson won the Arkansas governor\u2019s race Tuesday, defeating Democrat Mike Ross to put the state\u2019s top office back in Republican hands after Democrat Mike Beebe\u2019s eight years in office.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Republican Asa Hutchinson won the Arkansas governor\u2019s race Tuesday, defeating Democrat Mike Ross to put the state\u2019s top office back in Republican hands after Democrat Mike Beebe\u2019s eight years in office.", "title": "Hutchinson wins governor\u2019s race", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/hutchinson-wins-governor-s-race", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_asa-hutchinson-11-3-14_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/hutchinson-wins-governor-s-race", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_asa-hutchinson-11-3-14_1.jpg"}, "title": "Hutchinson wins governor\u2019s race", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-04T21:23:40-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2598\"", "article_summary": "In the lieutenant governor\u2019s race, Republican U.S. Rep.
