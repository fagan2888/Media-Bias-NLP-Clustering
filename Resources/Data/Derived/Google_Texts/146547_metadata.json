But they would kill Amazon\u2019s vision for Prime Air: a drone delivery service that could whisk deliveries to your door in 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to be flexible in writing these rules,\u201d FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said. \u201cWe want to maintain today\u2019s outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry.\u201d\n\nThe rules will now go through a period of public comment before being enacted. These regulations would apply only to commercial drone use, rather than private.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has issued a set of privacy rules for government-operated drones.
