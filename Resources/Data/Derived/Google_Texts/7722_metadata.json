Details here: http://t.co/jeWBvSwOq4 \u2014 Speaker John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) December 2, 2013\n\nHere\u2019s the list of hearings Republicans are having this week:\n\n\u2022 On Wednesday, the House Ways & Means Subcommittee on Health will hold a hearing on the implementation of the president\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u2022 Also on Wednesday, the House Small Business Committee will hold a hearing to \u201cexamine the process of determining whether businesses are considered single or multiple entities under the health care law.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Health will hold a hearing Wednesday to examine what Medicare Advantage beneficiaries should expect under ObamaCare.\n\n\u2022 On Friday, the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee will hold a field hearing in Apache Junction, AZ to get a closer look at the consequences of ObamaCare\u2019s broken promises.\n\nI call these hearings a waste of money because they are not really hearings; they are full on propaganda shows, put on by the GOP in order to get negative ObamaCare press they can use in 2014. The real reason Republicans are holding these hearings is to provide 2014 campaign sound bites for their members.\n\nJust last week a local news outlet busted Darrell Issa\u2019s \u201cObamaCare hearing\u201d because he only let the folks who furthered his narrative testify. This is Issa\u2019s and the GOP\u201ds stock and trade \u2014 they did it with Benghazi, they did it with the IRS, and they\u2019re doing it with ObamaCare. It\u2019s taxpayer funded propaganda for electoral campaign purposes.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Republicans are going to run against ObamaCare in 2014. For evidence that the GOP has not yet had its come to Jesus moment, see the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s gleeful fail gloating over the ObamaCare website. It\u2019s still not perfect, you see.\n\nThe NRSC likes to remind everyone that the ObamacCare website isn\u2019t working, so #GOP14 y\u2019all! They tweeted today, \u201cIt\u2019s Cyber Monday! And the #ObamaCare website still isn\u2019t working. #GOP14\u201d Root for the failure of millions of Americans getting insurance, Republicans. Yes, that\u2019s a winner\u2026\n\nRepublicans still believe they can beat Democrats in 2014 by running against ObamaCare. The media has assisted Republicans in their delusions, once again. Not so sure that\u2019s helpful.\n\nRepublicans might want to focus on what people who understand political science have to say, not Joe and Jane Pundit on the tee-vee or Joe and Jane clickbait. Because those people are either lying to Republicans or they are totally clueless. In the real world, only Republican partisans will vote based on how a website designed to provide a needed service performed in its rollout. People are going to like having health insurance. Sorry, but it\u2019s true. Personal survival will always trump politics.\n\nRepublicans are desperately trying to make ObamaCare a \u201c#trainwreck\u201d, so they can make it about Obama being untrustworthy and incompetent. But Obama\u2019s approval ratings are consistently better than Congress\u2019, precisely because Obama has a likeable persona.\n\nWorse for the GOP, the people who hate Obama already hate him \u2014 the GOP can\u2019t broaden their tent or get Independents by hating him more. They tried this in 2012 and it didn\u2019t work. They knew they were supposed to broaden the tent by halting their hatred of women, minorities, gays, and non-Republican Christians, but instead they curled into their hatred, taking comfort in juvenile meanness and ready, easy marks.\n\nThere\u2019s a #trainwreck afloat, and it\u2019s the GOP. The Republicans think Democrats will let America forget how the GOP shutdown the government over ObamaCare? That\u2019s cute. If they want to make the election about Democrats trying to provide health insurance to the 47 million uninsured, I\u2019m sure Democrats will let them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker Boehner is investing the few hours the House works this week into more \"oversight\" of ObamaCare, in order to provide 2014 campaign sound bites for the GOP.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Speaker Boehner is investing the few hours the House works this week into more \"oversight\" of ObamaCare, in order to provide 2014 campaign sound bites for the GOP.", "title": "Republicans To Waste More Taxpayer Money on Four More ObamaCare Hearings This Week", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/12/02/republicans-waste-taxpayer-money-obamacare-hearings-week.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-02-at-4.58.14-PM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-02T17:36:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-12-02T17:32:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-02T17:36:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8231\"", "article_summary": "Republicans aren\u2019t finished wasting taxpayer money on ObamaCare hearings yet.\nJust last week a local news outlet busted Darrell Issa\u2019s \u201cObamaCare hearing\u201d because he only let the folks who furthered his narrative testify.\nAt least four #ObamaCare oversight #hearings in the House this week.\nAnd the #ObamaCare website still isn\u2019t working.\nThe real reason Republicans are holding these hearings is to provide 2014 campaign sound bites for their members."}
