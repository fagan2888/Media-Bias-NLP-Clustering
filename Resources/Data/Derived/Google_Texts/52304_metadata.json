Whatever it had been that was cute about young Noah Ritter (if that\u2019s your thing) was sapped of all spontaneity. The poor kid tried self-consciously to be entertaining, raising his arms and dancing around.\n\nWhen Sophia Grace and Rosie appeared on YouTube, their performance of Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cSuper Bass\u201d had felt like kids being kids. But on Ellen\u2019s couch they were antic and stagey, as though they\u2019d been coached to keep the energy level up no matter what. The pair\u2019s performance, with one bopping silently as the other elided most of the R-rated words in Minaj\u2019s song, bore all the signifiers of \u201ccute\u201d (children in pink dresses acting precocious) with none of the actual, you know, cuteness. So let this be a warning to all talk show hosts: It\u2019s time to stop trotting out pint-size viral sensations for the benefit of your viewership, straining to wring from them every last drop of stardom.\n\nA talk show is really no place for a kid. Even adult celebrities who are accustomed to attention turn annoying when given the opportunity to chat about themselves for 10 minutes. So why should we expect civilian children thrust into the spotlight by pure accident to do much better? And yet we keep trying. Ellen is probably the worst offender at the crime of putting kids on display and forcing them to attempt to recapture their lightning-in-a-bottle virality. If Sophia Grace or \u201cApparently Kid\u201d were just a tiny bit older, they would surely be treated like Cecilia Cassini, the preteen designer whose staginess in describing her design career on \u201cThe Nate Berkus Show\u201d got her pilloried. Or like teen movie critic Jackson Murphy, who came off like a bit of a know-it-all for his \u201cTonight Show\u201d spot in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the \"Ellen\" show tries to wring every last drop of stardom out of \"Apparently\" kid, a call to stop the madness VIDEO", "title": "Stop putting viral kids on talk shows!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As the \"Ellen\" show tries to wring every last drop of stardom out of \"Apparently\" kid, a call to stop the madness VIDEO", "title": "Stop putting viral kids on talk shows!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/12/stop_putting_viral_kids_on_talk_shows/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/noah_ritter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the \"Ellen\" show tries to wring every last drop of stardom out of \"Apparently\" kid, a call to stop the madness VIDEO", "title": "Stop putting viral kids on talk shows!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/noah_ritter.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, apparently kid, the ellen degeneres show, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8e5\"", "article_summary": "When Sophia Grace and Rosie appeared on YouTube, their performance of Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cSuper Bass\u201d had felt like kids being kids.\nEllen is probably the worst offender at the crime of putting kids on display and forcing them to attempt to recapture their lightning-in-a-bottle virality.\nWhatever it had been that was cute about young Noah Ritter (if that\u2019s your thing) was sapped of all spontaneity.\nIf Sophia Grace or \u201cApparently Kid\u201d were just a tiny bit older, they would surely be treated like Cecilia Cassini, the preteen designer whose staginess in describing her design career on \u201cThe Nate Berkus Show\u201d got her pilloried.\nSo let this be a warning to all talk show hosts: It\u2019s time to stop trotting out pint-size viral sensations for the benefit of your viewership, straining to wring from them every last drop of stardom."}
