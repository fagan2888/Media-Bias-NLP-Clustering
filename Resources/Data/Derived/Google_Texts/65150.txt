Meridian city councilman Dustin Markham says steps to build a learning center in Velma Young Park are underway.

Markham says they will vote on an architect for the job at the next city council meeting. He says drafts of the project will be reviewed by September. The ground-breaking for the new Velma Young Center will be January next year with a target completion by mid-summer 2016.

“It’s going to be a multifaceted facility. Everyone in the community is going to be able to use it and rent it out fir events. There are going to be some educational tools. We’re going to possibly invite MCC over to see if they want to setup shop and help individuals attain their GED,” Markham says.
