Other members of his family were fined, too, he said, and some were irate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a cousin, he called me up and said, \u2018How bad did you get socked?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Taylor, 52, said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, in Mr. Taylor\u2019s case, the penalty worked as a nudge: After doing his taxes, he hustled to buy coverage for his wife in order to avoid a much bigger penalty \u2014 at least $325 \u2014 at tax time next year.\n\nOthers threatened with a penalty have discovered they did not owe one. Josephine Kennedy, for instance, had worked a series of low-paying jobs in 2014 and had gone without health insurance, despite the new Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans get coverage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand where all of this is coming from,\u201d Ms. Kennedy, 51, said, shaking her head as she waited for a tax preparer at Just Harvest in Pittsburgh to tell how big a penalty she would owe.\n\nBut Ms. Kennedy, now a housekeeper at a private business club, ended up owing no penalty. With an income of $12,563, she would have qualified for Medicaid if Pennsylvania had expanded the program, an option allowed by the Affordable Care Act, last year. Since it did not, she got an exemption from the penalty.\n\nThe state has now expanded Medicaid, and Ms. Kennedy said she would apply even though she preferred the free clinic she had gone to for years. If she remains uninsured, she will most likely be subject to the penalty for 2015, which will grow to $325 per adult or 2 percent of household income, whichever is larger.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see the point of forcing someone to get insurance,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy I got this taken care of for now.\u201d\n\nPeople who learn they have to pay back part of their subsidy after underestimating their 2014 income on their insurance application are equally perplexed. Many saw their circumstances change during the year \u2014 getting a job or a raise as the economy improved, for example. But if they failed to report an income change, they will owe the I.R.S.\n\nMr. Ciesielski, who is on disability, said he would think twice about taking on acting jobs this year to avoid the same predicament when he files his 2015 taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to guess\u201d what his income will be, he said.\n\nAs if taxpayers were not confused enough, the federal marketplace sent out forms containing inaccurate data to 820,000 people with subsidized insurance policies in January. Marketplace officials said Friday that they had mailed corrected forms to all but 80,000 of the affected taxpayers, who need them for calculating whether they received an appropriate subsidy.\n\nThose who filed their taxes before the mistake was caught \u2014 about 50,000 people, the Obama administration has said \u2014 do not have to refile, but they could lose subsidy money they are owed.\n\nLaurel Dickenson of Duluth, Ga., is among those people. She was surprised to learn while doing her taxes that she owed back $600 of her insurance subsidy. Now she is waiting for a corrected form and hoping that she may in fact owe less, even though she got a job after becoming insured last spring and did not report her income change.\n\n\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised,\u201d said Ms. Dickenson, 57, who recently became unemployed again. \u201cBut this is complicated, and it\u2019s affecting people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
