The findings indicate that women are not being offered alternative treatments or options to hysterectomies to treat benign conditions.\n\nThe hysterectomy is a medical procedure that includes the surgical removal of the uterus and in some case other parts of the female reproductive system, such as the cervix, fallopian tubes and in some cases, the ovaries (known as an oophorectomy). The surgery renders a woman infertile and, in cases where the ovaries are removed, instigates menopause if the woman is still in her child bearing years.\n\nRead More: Obamacare Drives Women to Get Tubes Tied\n\nAs of 2010, approximately 600,000 hysterectomies were being performed in the nation annually, accounting for over $5 billion health care costs. A hysterectomy can typically cost between from $10,000 and $20,000, depending on the type of hysterectomy performed and the state and hospital it is performed in. In most cases, it is covered by health insurance if it is deemed medically necessary. For patients covered by health insurance out-of-pocket costs can range from co-pays of $100 or more and between 10% to 50% of the cost of the procedure", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "New study finds one out of five hysterectomies performed in the nation may be unnecessary with costly results.
