It\u2019s also linked to depression and dementia. ESPN reported the news on Wednesday. The former Cowboys running back, now 59, underwent brain scans and clinical evaluations over the past three months at UCLA. ESPN reported: \u201cCTE is indicated by a buildup of tau, an abnormal protein that strangles brain cells in areas that control memory, emotions and other functions. Autopsies of more than 50 ex-NFL players, including Hall of Famer Mike Webster and perennial All-Pro Junior Seau, who committed suicide last year, found such tau concentrations.\u201d Dorsett described to ESPN the various symptoms he\u2019s experienced, including memory loss, depression and thoughts of suicide. \u201cWhen he took his Oct. 21 flight from Dallas to Los Angeles for testing, he repeatedly struggled to remember why he was aboard the plane and where he was going,\u201d ESPN reported. \u201cSuch episodes, he said, are commonplace when he travels.\u201d CTE was explored in an explosive PBS documentary that recently aired on KERA-TV that investigated concussions in the NFL. \u201cIt\u2019s enlightening to know what I have, what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d Dorsett told The Dallas Morning News. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to find out, how can we can come back from it? I actually was told [by researchers] that it can be reversed. I was like, \u2018What?\u2019 They said, \u2018Yeah, it can be reversed, slowed down, stopped.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere's the PBS Frontline special \"League of Denial\":\n\nAnd the YouTube Award goes to \u2026 Yes, YouTube has launched its own awards ceremony. Pentatonix, the a capella group with Arlington ties, won the Response of the Year category. The award is for the group\u2019s remix of \u201cRadioactive\u201d with Lindsey Stirling. YouTube describes the category this way: \u201cBased on what you watched, shared and loved over the last 12 months, these nominees are the five best videos that remixed, covered, parodied or responded to an original song on YouTube.\u201d Pentatonix has been getting lots of media love lately. NPR\u2019s Morning Edition explored the group on this morning\u2019s program. \u201cPentatonix is a five-person singing group that formed to compete in the NBC a cappella competition show \u201cThe Sing-Off.\u201d Three of its members were friends from high school, but the full group met for the first time just hours before the show to rehearse. Pentatonix ended up winning the competition.\u201d Bass vocalist Avi Kaplan told NPR: \"We try to do it in a way where you don't think of it as vocal music; you just think of it as music \u2014 as just a song that you're listening to and you don't miss anything. We're just a band, and we just happen to use our voices.\"\n\nHere\u2019s the \u201cRadioactive\u201d remix that won Response of the Year:\n\nAnd here\u2019s Pentatonix\u2019s remix of Daft Punk songs. It\u2019s been viewed more than 4 million times (on YouTube, of course) since it was released on Monday.\n\nPresident Obama visited Dallas on Wednesday evening.

KERA's Lauren Silverman covered the president's Dallas visit and has more details.\n\nOne Crisis Away: Did you know that one in three North Texans can\u2019t weather a financial storm that lasts 90 days? The problem's known as asset poverty, and it doesn\u2019t discriminate. A job loss, health emergency, even legal trouble is enough to plunge a third of our friends and neighbors into financial distress.

On Wednesday, \u201cThink\u201d explored the topic, focusing on financial literacy.\n\nJennifer Staubach Gates is a lifesaver. The Dallas City Council member saved an elderly man\u2019s life by performing CPR on him at a North Dallas restaurant on Monday night. The Dallas Morning News reported that Gates was eating dinner at The Mercury when a waiter came by looking for a medical professional to help a diner who was choking. The man was foaming at the mouth. Gates, a registered nurse and the daughter of Cowboy legend Roger Staubach, started chest compressions before the man threw up and regained consciousness, the News reported. \u201cI thought he was dead,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cI thought he was gone.\u201d\n\nAnd, today, we have a sixth item:", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Five stories that have North Texas talking: A Cowboys legend has a brain disease, a group with Arlington ties gets a YouTube award, a recap of the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://keranews.org/post/cowboys-legend-tony-dorsett-has-degenerative-brain-disease", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kera/files/styles/medium/public/201311/tony_dorsett.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Five stories that have North Texas talking: A Cowboys legend has a brain disease, a group with Arlington ties gets a YouTube award, a recap of the", "title": "Cowboys Legend Tony Dorsett Has Degenerative Brain Disease"}, "story_id": 243697945, "twitter": {"site": "@keranews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@aasen"}, "author": "Eric Aasen", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Cowboys Legend Tony Dorsett Has Degenerative Brain Disease"}, "nid": 40940, "datePublished": "2013-11-07", "keywords": "The High Five, Tony Dorsett, CTE, degenerative brain condition, degenerative brain disease, Jennifer Staubach Gates, Barack Obama, Obamacare, chronic traumatic encephalopathy", "wordCount": 1213, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Dallas Cowboys legend Tony Dorsett shows signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain condition that\u2019s reportedly caused by head trauma.\nESPN reported: \u201cCTE is indicated by a buildup of tau, an abnormal protein that strangles brain cells in areas that control memory, emotions and other functions.\nThe former Cowboys running back, now 59, underwent brain scans and clinical evaluations over the past three months at UCLA.\nKERA's Lauren Silverman covered the president's Dallas visit and has more details.\nESPN reported the news on Wednesday."}
