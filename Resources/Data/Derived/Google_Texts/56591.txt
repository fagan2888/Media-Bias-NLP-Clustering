HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Pageant judges have crowned a new winner of for Zimbabwe’s 4th annual Mister Ugly contest, upsetting supporters of the crowd favorite and prompting rioting at the event.

Judges chose Milton Sere Saturday, citing his numerous missing front teeth and a wide range of grotesque facial expressions, over William Masvinu, who has held the title since 2012.

Masvinu and his supporters mobbed the judges upon hearing their decision, claiming that Sere was “too handsome” to win and his ugliness wasn’t natural since it was based on missing teeth.

Judges said Sere, 42, made a “tremendous effort to enhance his ugliness by pulling facial stunts,” while Masvinu did not try hard enough.

This year’s competition attracted a record number of entries since it began in 2011.
