As Texas continues to mourn the loss of Harris County Sheriff Deputy Darren Goforth, Governor Greg Abbott today issued a statewide call to stand with law enforcement in Texas. To honor Deputy Goforth and all officers across the state, Governor Abbott is asking Texas law enforcement officers turn on their red and blue flashing lights for one-minute at 11:00 a.m. this Friday – the time Deputy Goforth’s funeral is set to begin.

“Respect and pride in our law enforcement must be restored in this state and nation,” said Governor Abbott. “It is time to unite in solidarity to support the men and women who serve and protect our communities. I ask that communities across Texas support this cause for unity and remember the essential role that law enforcement plays in keeping Texas safe and strong.”

Additionally, law enforcement patrol cars will line the North drive of the Capitol on Friday to join in unity in turning on their red and blue flashing lights.
