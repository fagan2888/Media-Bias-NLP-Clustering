Authorities initially put out an evacuation order, but are now urging people to \"shelter in place.\" (Cliff Grassmick/For the Times-Call)\n\nThe city of Longmont has rescinded its evacuation order for homes surrounding McIntosh Lake.\n\nA reverse 9-1-1 call was issued around 12:30, telling citizens in the area that flooding in the area was \"imminent.\" They are now urging people in the affected area to \"shelter in place.\"\n\nThe city's emergency management team had issued the evacuation order because of a breach to the headgate of the Oligarchy Ditch. The gate is near 63rd Street, and the ditch runs from there all the way across Longmont to Union Reservoir.\n\nCmdr. Jeff Satur of the Longmont Police Department said an employee of the city's public works and natural resources department noticed the breach around noon. He said crews then diverted the Oligarchy water into McIntosh Lake at the spot where the ditch runs behind the Agricultural Heritage Center off Colo. Highway 66.\n\n\"We (were) anticipating waters rising and we want(ed) to make sure they can get out before it gets dangerous,\" Satur said of the neighborhood's residents.The area that received reverse 9-1-1 calls is bordered by 17th Avenue on the south end, Harvard Street on the east and Horizon Parkway.\n\nLater, Satur said, crews with the city's department of public works and natural resources repaired the headgate and set it to divert most of the water that would normally flow into the Oligarchy into an overflow area, and from there it would end up back in the St. Vrain.\n\n\n\nEarlier on Sunday, residents of the Greens, Champion Greens and Valley neighborhoods, which are east of Airport Road and between Ninth Avenue and Mountain View, were forced to re-evacuate because of the rising St. Vrain. Residents had been allowed back into those neighborhoods on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/ci_24100188/longmont-rescinds-evacuation-order-mcintosh-lake-area", "modificationDate": "2013-10-16T11:34:52-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/0915/20130915__15TCAEVA-A_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Tony Kindelspire   Longmont Times-Call", "description": "The city of Longmont has rescinded its evacuation order for homes surrounding McIntosh Lake.
