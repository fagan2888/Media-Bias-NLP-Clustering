The 2015 rate is $57. Variable rate premiums of $30 per $1,000 of underfunding would increase to $38 by 2019. The variable rate is currently $24.\n\nThe proposal also calls for extending pension funding stabilization rules for two more years, until 2022, to allow sponsors to use higher interest rates when calculating contribution demands.\n\n\u201cOnce again the employer-sponsored system is being targeted for revenue,\u201d said Annette Guarisco Fildes, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee, who predicted that the premium hike will give defined benefit plan sponsors \u201cmore reasons to consider exit strategies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's an incredibly bad idea and it's going to have, in the long run, devastating consequences for the (defined benefit) system,\u201d said Deborah Forbes, executive director of the Committee on Investment of Employee Benefit Assets, in an interview.\n\nPBGC officials had not called for additional premium increases in the single-employer program on top of ones already scheduled. \u201cPBGC's finances for the single-employer program have been improving steadily over the past few years, and there is really no reason to increase single-employer premiums at this time,\u201d said Michael Kreps, a principal with Groom Law Group.\n\nThe additional revenue projected from the budget deal's premium hikes would be used to offset other federal spending projections but does not go into the Treasury.\n\nThe budget deal is expected to pass in order to pay for increased federal spending that is currently constrained by budget caps, and to avoid a significant increase in Medicare costs. It also repeals the auto-enrollment employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"taxonomy": 432, "twitter": {"description": "Further hikes in PBGC premiums will help pay for a federal budget bill agreed to by the White House and congressional leaders late Monday.", "title": "Proposed budget will increase PBGC premiums 22% over 3 years", "url": "http://www.pionline.com/article/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/proposed-budget-will-increase-pbgc-premiums-22-over-3-years", "image": "http://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/AR/0/AR-151029868.jpg", "site": "@pensionsnews", "card": "summary"}, "published_at": "2015-10-27T16:12:45-04:00", "guid": "934818D7-765F-446E-95CF-38688A87FDB0", "short_publish_date": 20151027, "category": "Article", "modified_date": "2015-10-27T16:17:00-04:00", "co_category": "ONLINE", "article-access-level": "metered", "content_title": "Proposed budget will increase PBGC premiums 22% over 3 years", "author": "Hazel Bradford", "co_currcategory": "ONLINE", "access_level": "metered", "theme": "DEFINED BENEFIT", "co_current_request": "/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/proposed-budget-will-increase-pbgc-premiums-22-over-3-years", "article-theme": "Defined Benefit", "image": "http://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/AR/0/AR-151029868.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail", "description": "Further hikes in PBGC premiums will help pay for a federal budget bill agreed to by the White House and congressional leaders late Monday.", "related_links": "manual", "article": {"section": "Defined Benefit", "published_time": "2015-10-27T16:12:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-27T16:17:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Pensions & Investments", "description": "Further hikes in PBGC premiums will help pay for a federal budget bill agreed to by the White House and congressional leaders late Monday.", "title": "Proposed budget will increase PBGC premiums 22% over 3 years", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pionline.com/storyimage/CO/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/AR/0/AR-151029868.jpg", "url": "http://www.pionline.com/article/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/proposed-budget-will-increase-pbgc-premiums-22-over-3-years", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=666127269, app-argument=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/p-i-news/id666127269?mt=8", "title": "Proposed budget will increase PBGC premiums 22% over 3 years", "summary": "Further hikes in PBGC premiums will help pay for a federal budget bill agreed to by the White House and congressional leaders late Monday.", "co_current_request_unmodified": "/article/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/proposed-budget-will-increase-pbgc-premiums-22-over-3-years", "url": "http://www.pionline.com/article/20151027/ONLINE/151029868/proposed-budget-will-increase-pbgc-premiums-22-over-3-years", "publish_date": "2015-10-27T16:12:45-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc95a\"", "article_summary": "Further hikes in PBGC premiums will help pay for a federal budget bill agreed to by the White House and congressional leaders late Monday.\nVariable rate premiums of $30 per $1,000 of underfunding would increase to $38 by 2019.\n\u201cPBGC's finances for the single-employer program have been improving steadily over the past few years, and there is really no reason to increase single-employer premiums at this time,\u201d said Michael Kreps, a principal with Groom Law Group.\nThe variable rate is currently $24.\nThe budget deal is expected to pass in order to pay for increased federal spending that is currently constrained by budget caps, and to avoid a significant increase in Medicare costs."}
