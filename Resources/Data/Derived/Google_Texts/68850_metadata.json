He pleaded guilty recently to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud.\n\nCourt documents show that Drummond and others would contact elderly people around the U.S. to falsely tell them they had won a lottery prize worth millions of dollars. But they were also told they first had to pay thousands of dollars in taxes and fees before they could collect.\n\nProsecutors say Drummond had victims send him cash in packages and through wire transfers. The $500,000 was stolen from multiple victims between April and December 2015.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/CRIME,/FOX NEWS/US,/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS,/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southeast,/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southeast/Florida", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-13 03:57:34 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "A South Florida man is facing up to 20 years in prison for operating a phony lottery scam that cheated victims out of at least $500,000.", "twitter": {"description": "A South Florida man is facing up to 20 years in prison for operating a phony lottery scam that cheated victims out of at least $500,000.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1457899054742.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Florida man faces up to 20 years' prison for lottery scam", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/CRIME\",\"/FOX NEWS/US\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southeast\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southeast/Florida\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"us\",\"title\":\"Florida man faces up to 20 years\\\\u0027 prison for lottery scam\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1457899054742.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-13T19:11:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"acf106b4-e2c6-4e1e-8a22-e5639a7c4d19\",\"section\":\"us\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A South Florida man is facing up to 20 years in prison for operating a phony lottery scam that cheated victims out of at least $500,000.", "dc.identifier": "acf106b4-e2c6-4e1e-8a22-e5639a7c4d19", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "crime,us,usregions,southeast,florida", "description": "A South Florida man is facing up to 20 years in prison for operating a phony lottery scam that cheated victims out of at least $500,000.", "prism.section": "us", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Florida Man Faces Up To 20 Years' Prison For Lottery Scam", "dcterms.created": "2016-03-13 03:57:34 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A South Florida man is facing up to 20 years in prison for operating a phony lottery scam that cheated victims out of at least $500,000.", "title": "Florida man faces up to 20 years' prison for lottery scam | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1457899054742.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2016-03-13", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/CRIME\",\"/FOX NEWS/US\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southeast\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/US REGIONS/Southeast/Florida\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"us\",\"title\":\"Florida man faces up to 20 years\\\\u0027 prison for lottery scam\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1457899054742.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-13T19:11:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/03/13/florida-man-faces-up-to-20-years-prison-for-lottery-scam.html\",\"post_id\":\"acf106b4-e2c6-4e1e-8a22-e5639a7c4d19\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"us\"}"}, "article_summary": "A South Florida man is facing up to 20 years in prison for operating a phony lottery scam that cheated victims out of at least $500,000.\nProsecutors say Drummond had victims send him cash in packages and through wire transfers.\nBut they were also told they first had to pay thousands of dollars in taxes and fees before they could collect.\nCourt documents show that Drummond and others would contact elderly people around the U.S. to falsely tell them they had won a lottery prize worth millions of dollars.\nSentencing is set for May 31 in Fort Lauderdale federal court for 26-year-old Delroy Drummond."}
