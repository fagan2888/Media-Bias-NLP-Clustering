He built a Hall of Fame coaching career, turning the University of Washington into a powerhouse program that won a share of a national championship.\n\nNo wonder he\u2019ll forever be referred to around the school as \u201cThe Dawgfather.\u201d\n\nJames, the longtime Washington coach who led the Huskies to a share of the 1991 national title, died at his home Sunday from the effects of pancreatic cancer. He was 80.\n\nJames had been undergoing treatment for the disease since late September.\n\nJames was 176-78-3 as a head coach at Kent State and Washington. He went 153-58-2 with the Huskies from 1975-92 and led the school to a six-pack of Rose Bowl appearances. His crowning moment came in 1991 when Washington had the most dominant defense in the country, and beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl to finish 12-0. The Associated Press media poll gave Miami \u2014 James\u2018 alma mater \u2014 the national championship, while the coaches\u2019 voted in favor of Washington in their poll.\n\n\u201cHis accomplishments as a football coach stand alone, but what made him truly special is the quality of man he was away from the game,\u201d current Washington coach Steve Sarkisian said. \u201cThe guidance and leadership he instilled into this program and community are still felt today, and will continue to be felt here for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nJames\u2018 image was displayed on the video board outside the entrance to Husky Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Thoughts poured over social media from former players, fellow coaches and fans who watched the Huskies program rise under James\u2018 leadership.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 61 years, Carol, their three children and 10 grandchildren. The school said details on a public memorial service would be released at a later date.\n\nJames played quarterback at the Miami, graduating in 1954 with a degree in education. He went on to serve as a commissioned second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was as an assistant coach at Florida State, Michigan and Colorado.\n\nHe was an unknown when he arrived in Seattle in 1975, taking over for Jim Owens. He came from Kent State, where he led the Golden Flashes to the Mid-American Conference title in 1972. While at Kent State, James coached future Hall of Famer Jack Lambert and future college coaches Nick Saban and Gary Pinkel.\n\n\u201cHe was a special man and meant the world to me,\u201d Saban said Sunday night. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough words to describe not only the great coach he was, but how much he cared for people and the positive impact he made in the lives of everyone he came in contact with. Coach James was my mentor and probably did more than anybody to influence me in this profession.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Washington to become a contender under James. The Huskies went 6-5 in his first year after winning six games combined in the final two years Owens was coach. By 1977, led by quarterback Warren Moon, they beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl.\n\nIt was the first of James\u2018 six Rose Bowl trips, topped by the 34-14 win over Michigan in 1991. Only once \u2014 his second season \u2014 did the Huskies have a losing record, winning at least six games every other year. Washington won 10 games seven times and went to a bowl game in 14 seasons under James. Washington nearly won the national title in 1984 after beating Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, only to be edged out in the voting by BYU. The Huskies were also in line for the title in 1990 before losing at home to UCLA.\n\nBetween the end of the 1990 season and November 1992, the Huskies won 22 straight games before losing 16-3 at Arizona on Nov. 7. The Huskies lost two weeks later to Washington State in a snowy Apple Cup in Pullman, but still served as the Pac-10 representative in the Rose Bowl. That New Year\u2019s Day, Michigan got payback for the loss a year earlier with a 38-31 win in what turned out to be James\u2018 final game.\n\nJames knew penalties were coming from the conference after an investigation of reports during the 1992 season that quarterback Billy Joe Hobert received $50,000 in loans from an Idaho businessman. Among the violations found by the Pac-10 were improper loans to athletes, free meals provided to recruits and improper employment of athletes by boosters. The conference also cited a lack of institutional control over funds provided to students hosting recruits.\n\nBut James protested when the conference added an additional year to the Huskies bowl ban, making it a two-year penalty. The Pac-10 also limited Washington\u2019s football scholarships and recruiting visits, and prohibited the university from sharing in television rights fees for one year.\n\nJames was 60 years old when he resigned less than two weeks before the 1993 season began. He was replaced by longtime assistant Jim Lambright.\n\n\u201cI have decided I can no longer coach in a conference that treats its players and coaches so unfairly,\u201d James said in his letter of resignation.\n\nHe was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nJames remained connected to the Huskies\u2019 program. He was a regular visitor at practices after his resignation and served on the committee that helped in the redesign of Husky Stadium. James gave his annual preseason speech to the current Washington squad in August and attending the first game at the renovated stadium on Aug. 31 against Boise State. It was shortly after that his health took a significant turn.\n\nJames had two surgical procedures in September at Virginia Mason Medical Center for what was called a gastro-intestinal issue. James\u2018 family issued a statement after the surgeries announcing that he was resting comfortable following the hospital stay but would be beginning chemotherapy treatment for a malignant tumor on his pancreas and asked for privacy.\n\n\u201cCoach James set the standard for this program and for all of us. It\u2019s the reason you all are sitting here. It\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here,\u201d Sarkisian said recently. \u201cHusky football and what it all stands for is what he created and I was so happy he was able to come to the first game against Boise and the opening of Husky Stadium because if anybody deserved to be in that building that night it was him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "James was 176-78-3 at Kent State and Washington, going 153-58-2 in 18 seasons with the Huskies from 1975-92.
