But Mr. Trump must give us specifics, not just vague promises to make America great.\n\nPresident Obama did take extraordinary steps to stabilize an economy reeling from an epic financial crisis, but what followed is a terrible mess.\n\nBanks are so overregulated as to be ineffective. They are now much less interested in lending to America\u2019s most dynamic job creators, innovators and engines of growth \u2014 small businesses.\n\nThe administration has imposed more burdensome taxes and a record avalanche of new regulations across the full spectrum of businesses, and new startups have fallen to their lowest levels in 50 years.\n\nUniversities are bullied and harassed to serve the left\u2019s social agenda. Albeit, they are led by faculty who blame all the ills of humanity on racism, sexism and capitalism, and are so distracted from the task of imparting useful skills that most graduates are ill-prepared for responsible employment.\n\nObamacare subjects health care \u2014 one sixth of the entire economy \u2014 to central planning and compels Americans without a large company plan to buy insurance at the \u201cgovernment store\u201d \u2014 HealthCare.gov.\n\nPremiums are rocketing and the nation\u2019s largest insurer \u2014 United Healthcare \u2014 is quitting the system in most markets.\n\nGetting less for more, even if with other people\u2019s money, is usually how socialism works out.\n\nSince the recovery began, the trade deficit \u2014 dominated by Chinese manufacturers who benefit from subsidies, high tariffs and a manipulated currency \u2014 has exploded. That directly costs American workers 4 million jobs and curtails vital investments in research and development, and modernization of industrial infrastructure.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Obama recovery has posted 2.1 percent annual gross domestic product growth and increased employment by 11 percent, as compared to 4.6 percent and 21 percent accomplished by President Reagan\u2019s expansion. Family incomes are down, whereas those were up nearly $4,000 on the Gipper\u2019s watch, and homeownership, a critical metric of middle-class prosperity, is now at a 48-year low.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to continue all this and impose nationally California\u2019s Fair Pay Act. This would require businesses to justify to the Labor Department virtually all hiring, promotion and salary decisions.\n\nShe derides business for shortsighted decisions and wants to compel more \u201cfarsighted investment\u201d as defined by her regulators.\n\nHuman resources policies and investment decisions are so fundamental to business management that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals would effectively impose central planning on the entire economy and complete Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign promise to \u201cchange America\u201d \u2014 apparently to a Chinese model of state-directed capitalism.\n\nDonald Trump promises to eliminate the trade deficit and rev up economic growth by confronting China and other nations about their undervalued currencies and barriers to U.S. exports. He threatens punitive tariffs to leverage change, and that could radically alter U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization, North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade pacts.\n\nIn the end, that could work out well, but we need to know more about what would replace existing commercial arrangements with other nations \u2014 reverting to blind protectionism in an age of global supply chains is not an option.\n\nMr. Trump promises to replace Obamacare with free-market solutions and focus his business acumen on building a stronger economy. He chides the nation for too much political correctness.\n\nHe needs to tell us how his health care policies would lower costs and ensure universal access, exactly what are his plans for all the executive orders and crushing regulations issued by Mr. Obama\u2019s bureaucrats, and how he proposes to encourage universities to produce more engineers, managers and entrepreneurs instead of unqualified dolts.\n\nOtherwise, Mr. Trump is asking Americans to merely take a bold leap of faith, and that\u2019s not good enough.\n\n\u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is not ready to support Donald Trump -- not that he won't.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is not ready to support Donald Trump \u2014 not that he won\u2019t.", "title": "PETER MORICI: Paul Ryan\u2019s smart request for Donald Trump\u2019s blueprint", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/10/peter-morici-paul-ryans-smart-request-for-donald-t/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/10/5_102016_b1-morici8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/10/5_102016_b1-morici8201.jpg", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is not ready to support Donald Trump -- not that he won't.", "card": "summary", "title": "PETER MORICI: Paul Ryan\u2019s smart request for Donald Trump\u2019s"}, "Author": "Peter Morici", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Labor, Business Finance, Donald Trump"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce26a\"", "article_summary": "Otherwise, Mr. Trump is asking Americans to merely take a bold leap of faith, and that\u2019s not good enough.\nMr. Trump promises to replace Obamacare with free-market solutions and focus his business acumen on building a stronger economy.\nBut Mr. Trump must give us specifics, not just vague promises to make America great.\nLike other Americans, Mr. Ryan is faced with a choice between Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise to complete the Obama transformation of America or embrace Mr. Trump\u2019s more pragmatic path.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is not ready to support Donald Trump \u2014 not that he won\u2019t."}
