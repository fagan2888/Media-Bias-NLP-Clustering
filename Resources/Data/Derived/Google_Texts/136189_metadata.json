Children younger than 18 years old represented 50% of the overall refugee population, the report says, the highest figure in ten years.\n\nImage: AP Photo, File/Associated Press\n\nThe UN cites the ongoing Syrian civil war as the \u201cprimary cause\u201d for the steep numbers. More than two million people - half of them children - have fled the on-going conflict.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in the Lebanese capital Beirut, U.N. High Commissioner Antonio Gutteres called the numbers \u201ca quantum leap in forced displacement,\u201d saying: \"For the first time since the Second World War, we had in 2013 more than 50 million people displaced by conflict and persecution either crossing borders or within the borders of their countries.\u201d\n\nOf 51.2 million people displaced worldwide last year, 16.7 million were refugees outside their countries' borders. Nearly 12 million of them are cared for by U.N. agencies. More than half of the refugees under UNHCR's care \u2014 6.3 million \u2014 had been in exile for more than five years, the agency said.\n\nBy country, the biggest populations of refugees were Afghans, Syrians and Somalis, the report said.\n\nImage: UNHCR\n\nThe countries hosting the largest number of refugees were Pakistan, Iran and Lebanon, a country whose stability is threatened by the raging Syrian war, now in its fourth year. Afghanistan has over 2.5 million refugees distributed across 86 countries, the report says, representing one out of every five refugees. A whopping 95% of those refugees have fled to Pakistan or Iran.\n\nSyria, the report warns, could replace Afghanistan in 2014 as the leading country for refugees. In fact, the past year saw the largest exodus by a group of people since the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.\n\nImage: UNHCR\n\nConflicts in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Mali, Sudan, Somalia and Iraq all contributed to the flood of people fleeing their homes for the safety of neighboring countries.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Brian Ries", "sailthru.secondary_image": "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mlZdZ9bDMpU1EyAYou6s0Np1x0A=/288x162/2014%2F06%2F20%2F88%2FRefugeeChil.879dc.jpg", "short_url": "http://on.mash.to/1qygw9e", "twitter": {"via": "mashable", "description": "The United Nations\u2019 refugee agency is out with a damning new report that shows global refugee numbers are at their highest since World War II.
