(Council on Foreign Relations)\n\nRepresentatives for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and Abedin also declined comment.\n\n[How Huma Abedin operated at the center of the Clinton universe]\n\nThere is no indication that the watchdog is looking at Clinton. But as she runs for president in part by promoting her leadership of the State Department, an inquiry involving a top aide and the relationship between her agency and her family\u2019s charity could further complicate her campaign.\n\nFor months, Clinton has wrangled with controversy over her use of a private email server, which has sparked a separate investigation by the same State Department inspector general\u2019s office. There is also an FBI investigation into whether her system compromised national security.\n\nClinton was asked about the FBI investigation at a debate last week and said she was \u201c100 percent confident\u201d nothing would come of it. Last month, Clinton denied a Fox News report that the FBI had expanded its probe to include ties between the foundation and the State Department. She called that report \u201can unsourced, irresponsible\u201d claim with \u201cno basis.\u201d\n\nDuring the years Clinton served as secretary of state, the foundation was led by her husband, former president Bill Clinton. She joined its board after leaving office in February 2013 and helped run it until launching her White House bid in April.\n\nAbedin served as deputy chief of staff at State starting in 2009. For the second half of 2012, she participated in the \u201cspecial government employee\u201d program that enabled her to work simultaneously in the State Department, the foundation, Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal office and Teneo, a private consultancy with close ties to the Clintons.\n\nVIEW GRAPHIC\n\nOriginally founded in 1997, the foundation has since grown to include a vast number of initiatives. Here is how it all stacked up over the last 18 years.\n\n[The inside story of how the Clintons built a $2 billion global empire]\n\nAbedin has been a visible part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s world since she served as an intern in the 1990s for the then-first lady while attending George Washington University. On the campaign trail, Clinton is rarely seen in public without Abedin somewhere nearby.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have alleged that foreign officials and other powerful interests with business before the U.S. government gave large donations to the Clinton Foundation to curry favor with a sitting secretary of state and a potential future president.\n\nBoth Clintons have dismissed those accusations, saying donors contributed to the $2 billion foundation to support its core missions: improving health care, education and environmental work around the world.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Clinton\u2019s opponent in the Democratic primary, has largely avoided raising either issue in his campaign. Last spring, Sanders expressed concerns about the Clinton Foundation being part of a political system \u201cdominated by money.\u201d\n\nSanders has batted away questions about the email scandal, famously saying at a debate last fall that, \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\u201d\n\nThe potential consequences of the IG investigation are unclear. Unlike federal prosecutors, inspectors general have the authority to subpoena documents without seeking approval from a grand jury or a judge.\n\nBut their power is limited. They are able to obtain documents, but they cannot compel testimony. At times, IG inquiries result in criminal charges, but sometimes they lead to administrative review, civil penalties or reports that have no legal consequences.\n\nThe IG has investigated Abedin before. Last year, the watchdog concluded she was overpaid nearly $10,000 because of violations of sick leave and vacation policies, a finding that Abedin and her attorneys have contested.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, led by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), have alleged that Abedin\u2019s role at the center of overlapping public and private Clinton worlds created the potential for conflicts of interest.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.
