People magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive is reporting for duty on behalf of the deeply unpopular ObamaCare legislation.

Adam Levine, singer and co-star of the reality singing show The Voice, is part of the celebrity 2.0 effort to convince Americans that the deeply flawed ObamaCare web site, its sky-high deductibles and knack for separating patients from their preferred doctors is in their best interests.

Reprising a tactic President Barack Obama successfully employed in his 2012 re-election, organizers plan to use celebrity promotions and professionally produced videos aimed at inspiring Americans to encourage friends to enroll. The goal is generating 100 million Internet contacts before open enrollment closes March 31…. The roster includes television star Fran Drescher of “The Nanny,” actor Kal Penn of the “Harold and Kumar” movie series and former Women’s National Basketball Association most valuable player Lisa Leslie, according to the campaign’s organizers, who declined to provide a full list before it gets underway.

Levine, for one, is known for his anti-conservative, pro-Obama rhetoric. He once threatened to “lose my shit” if Obama didn’t win re-election and dubbed Fox News “evil.”
