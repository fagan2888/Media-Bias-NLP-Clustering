Thirty states plus the District of Columbia have sought the Center for Disease Control’s help identifying potential cases of Ebola.

Themap above is based on a list of those states provided to Breitbart NewsThursday by the CDC. The list shows (in bright red) all the states whichhave asked for the CDC’s help with potential Ebola cases since July27th.

When contacted for consultation, the CDC examines thepatient’s symptoms and travel history to decide whether or not ablood test is needed. In most cases, the CDC is able to rule out Ebolawithout the need for a blood test.

ABC News reportedWednesday that the CDC was contacted 68 times since the end of lastmonth. In 58 of those cases Ebola was ruled out. In the ten remainingcases CDC ordered a blood test. Seven of those tests have already returnednegative, and three are still outstanding.

The CDC did not have up-to-date information on the location of the 10 patients who have received Ebola tests thus far, but reports indicateat least one patient was tested in New York, California, New Mexico,Maryland, and Ohio. Patients in California and New Mexico are currentlyawaiting test results.

Two patients who were transported toAmerica after contracting Ebola in West Africa were released from ahospital in Atlanta this week. Both recovered after treatment whichincluded an experimental drug called ZMapp. The CDC pronounced both patients cured, issuing a statement saying, “They no longer have Ebola virus in their blood and therefore pose no risk to household contacts or the public.”
