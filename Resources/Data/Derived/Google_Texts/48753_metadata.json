For example, states could alter the eligibility or benefits under Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.\n\nThe report finds that HHS\u2019s decision-making on whether to approve these waivers is not always clear. HHS has not issued specific criteria for making these determinations, it finds.\n\nSpending under the waivers is still supposed to promote Medicaid\u2019s objectives, but the report finds that the objectives of a program are not always made clear.\n\n\u201cHHS's approval documents are not always clear as to what, precisely, approved expenditures are for and how they will promote Medicaid objectives,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe lack of criteria plays into larger transparency issues, it says.\n\n\u201cWithout clear criteria for assessing how proposed expenditure authorities states are seeking will promote Medicaid objectives, and without clear documentation of the application of those criteria, the bases for HHS's decisions involving tens of billions of Medicaid dollars are not transparent to Congress, states, or the public.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high, as the waivers apply to about $150 billion in spending, or about one-third of Medicaid dollars, according to the report.\n\nHHS largely agreed, in the response section of the report, that it needs to clarify the process. It said it will \u201cmore clearly articulate how section 1115 authority is being used to assist states in addressing evolving trends or needs in their Medicaid programs.\u201d\n\nWhile the report does not specifically mention it, this waiver program has been at the center of a fight between Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and the Obama administration.\n\nScott argues the administration is taking away waiver funds reimbursing hospitals for caring for the uninsured in an effort to force the state to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare.\n\nThe Obama administration says Florida is free to expand Medicaid or not, but that the waiver funds should not be used for costs that would otherwise be covered in a Medicaid expansion.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The GAO report looked at approval for waivers in the Medicaid program.", "description": "The GAO report looked at approval for waivers in the Medicaid program.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The GAO report looked at approval for waivers in the Medicaid program.", "title": "Watchdog: HHS program lacks transparency", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/242006-watchdog-hhs-program-lacks-transparency", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/242006-watchdog-hhs-program-lacks-transparency", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-13T18:18-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-13T18:18:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/242006-watchdog-hhs-program-lacks-transparency", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The GAO report looked at approval for waivers in the Medicaid program.", "card": "summary", "title": "Watchdog: HHS program lacks transparency"}, "dcterms.title": "Watchdog: HHS program lacks transparency"}, "article_summary": "The Department of Health and Human Services lacks transparency in how it makes approval decisions about billions of dollars in experimental projects in the Medicaid program, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said Wednesday.\n\u201cHHS's approval documents are not always clear as to what, precisely, approved expenditures are for and how they will promote Medicaid objectives,\u201d the report states.\nFor example, states could alter the eligibility or benefits under Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.\nSpending under the waivers is still supposed to promote Medicaid\u2019s objectives, but the report finds that the objectives of a program are not always made clear.\nHHS largely agreed, in the response section of the report, that it needs to clarify the process."}
