While the truth might not be far off, all that productivity is stressing out the euro-zone\u2019s powerhouse economy.\n\nThis week, a minister in Germany\u2019s most populous state called for an \u201canti-stress law\u201d banning work-related calls and emails outside of working hours. The labor ministry says it has been researching the idea for some time.\n\nBeing on call \u201ccan\u2019t be fundamentally condemned like the Spanish inquisition,\u201d but the country needs \u201ca law through which employers can\u2019t be allowed to contact employees at specific times,\u201d Guntram Schneider, labor minister of North Rhine-Westphalia told the Rheinische Post this week.\n\nThe proposal, which unions have backed for years, comes as Chancellor Angela Merkel and most of the German government relax on summer vacation \u2014 although Merkel has spent at least some of her trip on the phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWork stress is currently a hot topic in the German media. Current law demands employers provide a safe and healthy working environment, but unions like the Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund say many companies are lagging on this with regards to psychological stress.\n\nAn article on the front page of Thursday\u2019s Bild-Zeitung tabloid sounded the alarm that \u201cEvery fifth person is reachable by the boss after knocking-off time.\u201d According to a study cited by Bild, every third person feels being constantly available is a burden on health, and around one in four employees is too tired for personal commitments after work.\n\nGerman working hours are amongst the lowest of the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and about 25% below the OECD average. People in Germany work just under 1,400 hours a year, compared with nearly 1,800 in the U.S. and the OECD average of 1,765 hours.\n\nClemens Kirschbaum, professor of psychology at the Dresden University of Technology, said those numbers don\u2019t necessarily account for the German mentality geared towards maximum efficiency and productivity at work and in life.\n\nBased on his experience abroad, Kirschbaum said \u201cthe whole nation has a different concept of organization and time management. A lot more gets done [in Germany] in eight hours than in eleven or twelve in other countries.\u201d\n\nMulti-tasking work and family life and being constantly available on smartphones and email has led to a \u201cdefinite\u201d increase in chronic stress here, Kirschbaum said. \u201cFar too little time is spent switched off, just to withdraw in peace. It\u2019s not conducive to good health\u201d and can lead to hypertension, burn-out, and depression, he said.\n\nGermany amended labor law in late 2012 to include employee protection from risks to mental as well as physical health on the job. According to a labor ministry spokesman, research is ongoing into ways of requiring employers to minimize job stress that could form the basis for a legal framework. The new German government, formed late last year, said in its coalition treaty that it plans to address the \u201cdrastic increase in [work-related] psychological illnesses,\u201d potentially through government regulation.\n\nEarlier this year, companies and workers in neighboring France agreed to allow certain workers the right to switch off calls and email after hours.\n\nPending similar legislation in Germany, Kirschbaum suggests tackling work stress by finding time to switch off the smartphone and do something fun \u2013 be it sport, cooking, or spending time with friends.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "All that productivity is stressing out the euro-zone's powerhouse economy.", "title": "German Minister Wants to Outlaw Late-Night Work Email", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/08/08/german-minister-wants-to-outlaw-late-night-email/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EA183_german_P_20140807144511.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Careers", "article.headline": "German Minister Wants to Outlaw Late-Night Work Email", "description": "All that productivity is stressing out the euro-zone's powerhouse economy.", "article_section": "Careers", "author": "Harriet Torry", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "At Work Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "At Work", "article.summary": "All that productivity is stressing out the euro-zone's powerhouse economy.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-08T14:09:02-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/08/08/german-minister-wants-to-outlaw-late-night-email/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-ATWORKB-1968", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Careers", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "All that productivity is stressing out the euro-zone's powerhouse economy.", "title": "German Minister Wants to Outlaw Late-Night Work Email", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/08/08/german-minister-wants-to-outlaw-late-night-email/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EA183_german_P_20140807144511.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "At Work", "article.id": "BL-ATWORKB-1968", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-11T15:25:54-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6fb\"", "article_summary": "German working hours are amongst the lowest of the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and about 25% below the OECD average.\nThis week, a minister in Germany\u2019s most populous state called for an \u201canti-stress law\u201d banning work-related calls and emails outside of working hours.\nWork stress is currently a hot topic in the German media.\nPeople in Germany work just under 1,400 hours a year, compared with nearly 1,800 in the U.S. and the OECD average of 1,765 hours.\nPending similar legislation in Germany, Kirschbaum suggests tackling work stress by finding time to switch off the smartphone and do something fun \u2013 be it sport, cooking, or spending time with friends."}
