A former state lawmaker wants to get back into politics by going to Washington.

David Orentlicher sent out a statement to reporters on Sunday saying he would run for Congress. Specifically, the Democrat will seek the 8th District seat that comprises much of southwestern Indiana, including Terre Haute and Evansville. That seat has been held by Republican Larry Bucshon since 2010, who is expected to seek re-election.

Orentlicher represented an Indianapolis district in the State House for three terms before losing a run for Congress in 2008 - he was defeated by Rep. Andre Carson in the Democratic primary. “Bill Clinton was right. If you work hard and play by the rules,” Orentlicher said in his statement. "You should be able to provide a good life for your family and a better future for your children. That’s not true anymore, and we need to make sure it is true again."

Since leaving politics, Orentlicher has taught at both the IU School of Medicine (in Indianapolis and Terre Haute) as well as the university's Robert McKinney School of Law - he is a physician and an attorney. Should he win the Democratic nomination, it would set up a race between two physicians - Bucshon is a heart surgeon - with the impact of President Obama's Affordable Care Act likely to be a major issue.

Bucshon's district is considered reasonably safe for Republicans - he has won all three of his Congressional races by double-digits, even though he was initially targeted by the tea party wing of the GOP in 2014.
