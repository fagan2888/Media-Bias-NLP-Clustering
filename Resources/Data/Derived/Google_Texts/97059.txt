Many throughout Bay County got their shot this weekend to check out a variety of different firearms in panama city.

Dozens came out to the Panama City Gun Show at the Bay County Fairgrounds Sunday.

The event hosted by Southern Classic Gun and Knife Shows of Florida showcased different types of guns and knives from rifles, to pistols, and stun guns.

Promoters say the event gave people the opportunity to buy and sell different types of guns and knives, and also check out concealed weapons classes.

"Right now, manufacturers are absolutely tooth and nail at great discounts," Skip Gwinn of Southern Classic Gun and Knife Shows said. "You have many vendors here. It gives the public a great chance to come see, touch, and feel. A lot of times they can't always do that at the big box stores."

Gwinn says the next show will be held at the fairgrounds in October.
