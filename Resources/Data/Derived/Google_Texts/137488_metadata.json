(HAND-IN PHOTO, received October 2013)\n\nMONTEREY PARK >> It\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s confusing and few seem to understand it.\n\nSo how do you explain Obamacare to young Americans who probably aren\u2019t tuned into healthcare issues to begin with?\n\nWith Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber look-a likes, of course. That\u2019s the approach the Fung Brothers took in their new \u201cHealth\u00adcare Swag\u201d music video. The video is based on the Cyrus song \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d with original lyrics by the Fungs and appearances by a host of celebrity impersonators.\n\nMonterey Park residents David and Andrew Fung, who have become Internet sensations with their comedy videos on YouTube, were approached by the KCAL Insurance Agency in Hacienda Heights to create the video.\n\n\u201cKCAL reached out to us and said they would help us out on the budget,\u201d Andrew Fung, 24, said. \u201cWe thought, \u2018OK, we can do this. It would be fun and interesting and it might actually help people.\u2019 We always like to educate people about something in our videos. I know a lot of my friends don\u2019t know anything about this health care thing. We tried our best to boil it down and at least get people to think about it.\u201d\n\nThe song\u2019s lyrics include such passion-evoking phrases as \u201cno more pre-existing conditions,\u201d \u201climited enrollment period\u201d and \u201cpick your coverage \u2014 choose the plan you want.\u201d It isn\u2019t Rodgers and Hammerstein, but the Fungs figure it will get the point across.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ll watch this once and understand it all,\u201d Fung said. \u201cBut you can ask more questions.\u201d\n\nKCAL President and owner Kenny Chang said his company decided that the Fung Brothers were the right choice to get the health care message out to young Americans.\n\n\u201cThey have so many creative ideas, and now that we have this health care reform the only way it will be a success is if we find a way to get young kids to join,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I asked them if they were interested to educate young kids on how important it is.\u201d\n\nYoung participants are needed not only so they can receive adequate coverage, Chang said, but also so they can pay into the insurance pool. KCAL Insurance has set up a customer service center at its Hacienda Heights office to answer questions about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cRight now we have about 125 people at the center,\u201d Chang said.\n\nThose who want to delve deeper into the available options under the Affordable Care Act can visit Coveredcalifornia.com, which serves as a marketplace where individuals and families can select coverage and see if they qualify for financial assistance to make their health coverage more affordable. The site lets consumers compare and choose the coverage plan that best fits their needs and budget.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had no idea about the Affordable Care Act until I became a production assistant for the \u2018Healthcare Swag\u2019 project,\u201d said Amy Chan, a junior at Cal State L.A.\n\nFung said the video took some time to put together.\n\n\u201cFrom conception to completion it took about a month,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to come up with the lyrics, make sure all the facts were true and correct and do the production casting. A couple of people in the video are our friends, but we did regular casting for the others. It\u2019s really been cool because we made some new friends.\u201d\n\nThe video also includes look-a likes of Rihanna, Drake, 2 Chainz, Katy Perry, Psy and Bruno Mars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of reaction with YouTube comments from people who support Obamacare and want people to take advantage of the new marketplace,\u201d said David Fung, 27. \u201cThe people whose comments are against Obamacare will probably have a tendency not to like the video. But we\u2019re nonpolitical. I would like to think of this more as a little \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 skit. It\u2019s edu-tainment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MONTEREY PARK >> It\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s confusing and few seem to understand it.So how do you explain Obamacare to young Americans who probably aren\u2019t tuned into healthcare issues to begin with?With Miley Cyrus", "title": "Fung Brothers create comedy video to help explain Obamacare", "og": {"url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20131005/fung-brothers-create-comedy-video-to-help-explain-obamacare", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20131005/NEWS/131009703/AR/0/AR-131009703.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1125px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Fung Brothers create comedy video to help explain Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "MONTEREY PARK >> It\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s confusing and few seem to understand it.So how do you explain Obamacare to young Americans who probably aren\u2019t tuned into healthcare issues to begin with?With Miley Cyrus", "title": "Fung Brothers create comedy video to help explain Obamacare", "url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20131005/fung-brothers-create-comedy-video-to-help-explain-obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20131005/NEWS/131009703/AR/0/AR-131009703.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, West Covina Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, West Covina Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "article_summary": "Monterey Park residents David and Andrew Fung, better know as the Fung Brothers, have created a video to help educate young Americans about Obamacare.\nKCAL Insurance has set up a customer service center at its Hacienda Heights office to answer questions about the Affordable Care Act.\nThat\u2019s the approach the Fung Brothers took in their new \u201cHealth\u00adcare Swag\u201d music video.\nI know a lot of my friends don\u2019t know anything about this health care thing.\nSo how do you explain Obamacare to young Americans who probably aren\u2019t tuned into healthcare issues to begin with?"}
