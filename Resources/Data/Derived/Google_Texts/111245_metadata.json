The policies are drawn from a review of his website, stump speeches, debates and town halls, and televised interviews.\n\nRead: Clinton, Trump score big wins on Super Tuesday\n\nTrade\n\nTrump has complained that China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam and India are \u2018ripping us off\u2019 by devaluing their currencies and keeping out some US exports.\n\nHe would not sign the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact and would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada.\n\nHe would designate China a currency manipulator and impose countervailing duties on its exports. He also wants to pursue a World Trade Organization case on Chinese government programs that subsidize exporters.\n\nTrump has said he would put activist investor Carl Icahn in charge of negotiating a better trade relationship with China. Icahn has said he is happy to advise Trump, but would not seek a formal position if Trump were elected.\n\nTrump has said he would slap 35% tariffs on air conditioners made by United Technologies Corp\u2019s Carrier in Mexico after the company decided to move production there from Indiana, and on Ford Motor Corp vehicles made in Mexico that are sold in the United States.\n\nTaxes\n\nTrump has pledged to cut and simplify taxes. Individuals making less than $25,000 per year and married filers earning less than $50,000 would not pay income tax.\n\nThere would be three other brackets, down from seven currently, with a top marginal income tax rate of 25%, and a top rate for long-term capital gains and dividends of 20%.\n\nCharitable giving and mortgage interest deductions would remain unchanged. Other deductions would be trimmed in the highest tax brackets.\n\nHe would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax, and the carried interest tax break that allows investment fund managers to treat income as capital gains.\n\nThe corporate tax rate would be cut to 15%, down from the current level of 35%.\n\nHe would phase in a \u2018reasonable cap\u2019 on deductions for business interest expenses and would cut other corporate loopholes.\n\nTrump would impose a one-time 10% \u2018deemed repatriation\u2019 tax on deferred corporate overseas profits and would end deferral of income from foreign subsidiaries.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, an independent policy research group, has said Trump\u2019s plan would cost more than $10 trillion over the next decade. His campaign has said the plan is fully paid for.\n\nRead: Super Tuesday: Where US presidential hopefuls stand, and the road ahead\n\nEconomy\n\nTrump has pledged to get rid of the $19 trillion deficit by boosting jobs, and cutting government waste, but he has not released a formal policy paper on how he would do this.\n\nHe has said he would not cut the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for senior citizens and low income Americans, nor Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nHe would cut the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump has promised to build a high wall at the southern border to keep out illegal immigrants that he has said would cost $10 billion to $12 billion.\n\nMexico would pay for the wall or face consequences, his campaign said. Trump would \u2018impound\u2019 remittance payments to Mexico from undocumented workers, and increase visa\n\nand border crossing fees for Mexican workers. Applying tariffs on Mexican goods and cutting foreign aid are also \u2018options,\u2019 his campaign has said on his website.\n\nHe would deport the 11 million undocumented people living in America and end \u2018birthright citizenship\u2019 for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants.\n\nHe has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and would not allow refugees from Syria.\n\nTrump would triple the number of border agents and require all businesses to use the E-Verify database to ensure employees are in the country legally.\n\nHe would withhold federal funding from \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 that decline to help the federal government deport illegal immigrants.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has also said he would \u2018pause\u2019 new green cards and require employers to hire American workers first.\n\nRead: Super Tuesday: Hillary and Trump see big wins but fight still on\n\nHealth care\n\nTrump has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and replace it with a system of health savings accounts.\n\nHe would still require insurers to provide coverage to people with preexisting medical conditions, a key feature of Obamacare.\n\nHe would move to allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines to spur competition.\n\nTrump has said he could save the government $300 billion by negotiating better prices with drug companies.\n\nIslamic State\n\nTrump has promised to \u2018knock out\u2019 Islamic State quickly and said he is open to working with Russia to do so.\n\nHe has said he would \u2018bomb the oil\u2019 that helps finance the insurgent group and stop the \u2018back channels of banking\u2019 used by the group.\n\nHe has vowed to bring back the use of waterboarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning and has been banned as torture under US law. He said he also supports other, unspecified techniques \u2018a hell of a lot worse\u2019 than waterboarding.\n\nHe would \u2018take out\u2019 the family members of Islamic State militants and would like to shut down \u2018areas\u2019 of the Internet to try to stop the group from recruiting members.\n\nHe wants to build a \u2018safe zone\u2019 for Syrian refugees in Syria. But Gulf states would have to pay for it.\n\nHe has said the United States should first deal with Islamic State before addressing President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s future, saying \u201cWe have to do one thing at a time.\u201d\n\nHe has questioned whether the United States should back opposition groups in Syria, saying \u201cwe have no idea who they are.\u201d\n\nDefence\n\nTrump has said he would increase the size and power of the US military to make it \u201cso strong, so powerful that nobody\u2019s going to mess with us.\u201d\n\nHe says too much money is wasted buying equipment the military does not want.\n\nHe wants Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to bear more of the cost of military aid provided by the United States. \u201cWe can no longer defend all of these countries,\u201d he said, citing the deficit.\n\nTrump would boost the US military presence in the East and South China seas to \u201cdiscourage Chinese adventurism,\u201d according to his website.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "1.1.545539883", "eomportal-id": 183327, "Description": "Here is a closer look at what Trump has said he would do on trade, taxes, the economy, immigration, healthcare and defense should he become the nominee and win the November 8 election.", "eomportal-instanceid": "S160.21", "og": {"site_name": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/", "description": "Here is a closer look at what Trump has said he would do on trade, taxes, the economy, immigration, healthcare and defense should he become the nominee and win the November 8 election.", "title": "Fight with China, repeal Obamacare: What a President Trump would do", "url": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/fight-with-china-repeal-obamacare-what-a-president-trump-would-do/story-Ioj1dfqr4rNgpAE6Do2oeO.html", "image": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/03/02/Pictures/republican-gestures-campaign-presidential-candidate-university-valdosta_3a314308-e063-11e5-9948-13623a58218c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "hindustantimes.com", "description": "Here is a closer look at what Trump has said he would do on trade, taxes, the economy, immigration, healthcare and defense should he become the nominee and win the November 8 election.", "title": "Fight with China, repeal Obamacare: What a President Trump would do", "url": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/fight-with-china-repeal-obamacare-what-a-president-trump-would-do/story-Ioj1dfqr4rNgpAE6Do2oeO.html", "image": {"src": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/03/02/Pictures/republican-gestures-campaign-presidential-candidate-university-valdosta_3a314308-e063-11e5-9948-13623a58218c.jpg"}, "site": "@httweets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 14:44:55 IST 2016", "tweetmeme-title": "Fight with China, repeal Obamacare: What a President Trump would do", "fb": {"admins": 100006810078735, "app_id": 672336366190593}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, US Presidential elections, Hillary Clinton, Republican presidential candidate", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-02T16:11Z"}, "eomportal-uuid": "dc3e6fd8-e061-11e5-9948-13623a58218c"}, "article_summary": "Individuals making less than $25,000 per year and married filers earning less than $50,000 would not pay income tax.\nHe has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and would not allow refugees from Syria.\nHe wants Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to bear more of the cost of military aid provided by the United States.\nIcahn has said he is happy to advise Trump, but would not seek a formal position if Trump were elected.\nTrump has said he would put activist investor Carl Icahn in charge of negotiating a better trade relationship with China."}
